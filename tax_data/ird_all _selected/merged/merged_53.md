International treaty examination of the Convention between Japan and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Contents Recommendation 2  Appendix A 3  Appendix B 4  DOUBLE TAXATION AND FISCAL EVASION CONVENTION BETWEEN JAPAN AND NEW ZEALAND 2 Convention between Japan and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Recommendation The Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the Convention between Japan and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, and recommends that the House take note of its report. New Zealand has a current double taxation agreement with Japan, but it is 50 years old and needs to be updated. The new agreement aims to reduce tax barriers for New Zealand businesses with operations in Japan, making it easier for them to return profits made in Japan to New Zealand. The profits will be paid out to New Zealand shareholders or re-invested in the New Zealand economy. The arrangement is reciprocal, so it also reduces taxes on Japanese businesses in New Zealand. Although New Zealand will forgo about $3 million in tax revenue per year, the agreement encourages foreign investment, to an extent that is however hard to quantify. We heard that New Zealand’s total investment in Japan is worth approximately $3.7 billion, and Japan’s in New Zealand just over $8 billion. We asked if the Inland Revenue Department thought that the prospect of paying less withholding tax in New Zealand would make Japanese companies more inclined to invest. We heard that withholding tax is quite often passed on to the New Zealand business involved. One of the main benefits of the agreement is that it provides investment certainty: for example, a Japanese investor wanting to invest in New Zealand could refer to the text of the agreement instead of having to compare two sets of legislation to find out the tax implications. DOUBLE TAXATION AND FISCAL EVASION CONVENTION BETWEEN JAPAN AND NEW ZEALAND 3 Appendix A Committee procedure The treaty was referred to the committee for examination on 22 February 2013. We met on 21 and 28 March 2013 to hear evidence and consider it. We heard evidence from the Inland Revenue Department. Committee members John Hayes (Chairperson) Hon Phil Goff Dr Kennedy Graham Hon Tau Henare Dr Paul Hutchison Su’a William Sio Lindsay Tisch DOUBLE TAXATION AND FISCAL EVASION CONVENTION BETWEEN JAPAN AND NEW ZEALAND 4 Appendix B National Interest Analysis Convention between Japan and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Executive summary 1 The Convention between Japan and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and its accompanying Protocol (collectively known as “the new DTA”) has been negotiated to replace the existing Convention between Japan and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (“the existing DTA”), signed in Wellington on 30 January 1963. The existing DTA with Japan is New Zealand’s oldest double taxation agreement (DTA) and has some major gaps and deficiencies compared to modern DTAs. 2 Japan is New Zealand’s fourth largest trade and investment partner. The Japan DTA is therefore an important treaty in New Zealand’s overall DTA network. 3 Since 2008, New Zealand has sought to enhance the competitiveness of its DTA network by negotiating new DTAs that reduce withholding tax rates with its major trading partners and modernise its most important treaties (starting with Australia, the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong and Canada). The new DTA with Japan is the next major step towards implementing this strategy. 4 The main objective of these new DTAs is to reduce tax barriers to New Zealand businesses that expand offshore. However, because DTA provisions are reciprocal, they also reduce New Zealand taxes on foreign investment into New Zealand. For this reason, the new DTA with Japan has an estimated revenue cost to New Zealand of $3 million per year. This reflects the fact that there is twice as much Japanese investment in New Zealand than New Zealand investment in Japan. DTAs will generally give rise to favourable economic benefits (such as a potential increase in trade and investment) that can be expected to offset such fiscal costs. 5 It is proposed that the new DTA be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The new DTA will then be brought into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes. The new DTA will enter into force on the date of the later of the two notes. Nature and timing of the proposed treaty action 6 The Convention between Japan and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and its accompanying Protocol (collectively known as “the new DTA”) was signed in Tokyo on 10 December 2012. It was signed in English and Japanese, with both texts having equal authenticity. The English text of the new DTA is attached at Annex 1. 7 Subsequent to satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, in accordance with Standing Orders 394 to 397, the new DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. DOUBLE TAXATION AND FISCAL EVASION CONVENTION BETWEEN JAPAN AND NEW ZEALAND 5 8 In accordance with Article 31 of the new DTA, the new DTA will then be brought into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes, confirming the completion of all necessary domestic procedures for entry into force in each country. The new DTA will enter into force on the date of the later of these notes. 9 As each provision of the new DTA comes into effect in accordance with Article 31, the equivalent provision of the existing DTA will cease to have effect. The existing DTA will terminate once all of its provisions cease to have effect. 10 Like other DTAs, the new DTA will not apply to the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau. Reasons for New Zealand becoming party to the treaty 11 Japan is New Zealand’s fourth largest trade and investment partner. 12 The Japan DTA is therefore one of the most important treaties in New Zealand’s overall DTA network. It is important for New Zealand to maintain a competitive DTA network in order to retain and grow internationally competitive companies. The existing DTA with Japan is New Zealand’s oldest DTA and has some gaps and deficiencies compared to modern DTAs. Ensuring New Zealand remains a competitive place to do business 13 Since 2008, New Zealand has sought to enhance the competitiveness of its tax treaty network by negotiating new DTAs that reduce withholding tax rates with its major trading partners, and modernising our most important treaties (starting with Australia, the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong and Canada). The new DTA with Japan is the next major step towards implementing this strategy. 14 A major objective of these new DTAs is to reduce tax barriers on New Zealand businesses that expand offshore. In particular, the new DTA with Japan provides for a 0% rate on certain dividends. This helps to remove an artificial impediment to the repatriation of foreign profits. 15 This change can be shown by considering the effects on a New Zealand business which sells products through a subsidiary in Japan. Currently, under the existing DTA, any profits earned by the Japanese subsidiary will be subject to a 15% withholding tax rate when a dividend is paid back to the New Zealand parent company. Under the new DTA, the Japanese tax on this dividend will reduce to 0%. This will make it more efficient to return the income back to New Zealand, where it can be reinvested or paid out to shareholders. Importance of a modern DTA 16 The new DTA will replace an existing DTA with Japan. The existing DTA was signed in 1963 and has some major gaps and deficiencies compared to modern DTAs (for example it does not include interest or royalties Articles, which are two of the most important Articles in modern DTAs). The existing DTA is very different to New Zealand’s other DTAs and uses an old style of drafting that can be difficult to apply and interpret. The new DTA will address these issues and provide taxpayers with the level of certainty and protection that they expect from a modern DTA. DOUBLE TAXATION AND FISCAL EVASION CONVENTION BETWEEN JAPAN AND NEW ZEALAND 6 Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force and not entering into force for New Zealand Advantages to New Zealand of the new DTA 16 The advantages can be summarised as follows: Outbound investment  As explained in the previous section, the new DTA will enhance the competitiveness of New Zealand’s overall DTA network. Along with other international tax settings, this helps New Zealand to retain and grow internationally competitive businesses.  The new DTA reduces tax barriers to New Zealand businesses that invest into Japan. In particular, it provides for a 0% rate on certain dividends, which helps to remove an artificial impediment to the repatriation of foreign profits. Inbound investment  The new DTA will also make it easier for Japanese investors to invest into New Zealand by reducing compliance costs and “headline” rates of withholding tax. Compared to domestic law, DTA settings are “locked in” which provides certainty for long-term investments. Updating the DTA to modern treaty practices makes it easier for investors to understand how the DTA will apply, and ensures consistency with other DTAs.  Despite these benefits, the new DTA with Japan is not expected to have a large impact on levels of inbound investment. This is because New Zealand already has some existing measures in its domestic law that reduce withholding taxes on certain forms of foreign investment.  These existing measures reduce the cost of agreeing to lower withholding taxes on dividends and interest under a DTA. For example, because New Zealand provides exemptions and tax credits for imputed dividends (where the company has already paid 28% New Zealand tax on its profits), the cost of reducing withholding tax on dividends is limited to a small number of unimputed dividends. On interest, the cost of reducing withholding taxes is limited to related party loans, as a 2% approved issuer levy already applies to loans from unrelated parties.  However, there are still some cases where the new DTA will make a difference, by going beyond the reductions available in domestic law. For example, under the new DTA, the rate on related party interest will be reduced from 15% to 10%, and the rate on royalties will be reduced from 15% to 5%. These rates will bring the Japan DTA into line with New Zealand’s other major DTAs. Disadvantages to New Zealand of the new DTA 18. The disadvantages can be summarised as follows: Revenue cost  For the reasons given in the previous paragraph, the new DTA with Japan has an estimated revenue cost to New Zealand of $3 million per year. However, DTAs generally give rise to favourable economic benefits (such as some expected increase in trade and investment) that can be expected to offset such fiscal costs. Administrative obligations DOUBLE TAXATION AND FISCAL EVASION CONVENTION BETWEEN JAPAN AND NEW ZEALAND 7  The new DTA provides for assistance in collecting taxes imposed by the other country. Inland Revenue will incur some costs if a request for assistance in collection is made by the Japanese Revenue. However, New Zealand has entered into such arrangements in a number of its treaties and has a well-established system to deal with any requests. It is expected that any cost incurred will be marginal. Further, the arrangement is reciprocal, which means that New Zealand will be able to make a request to the Japanese Revenue for assistance to collect taxes in Japan on behalf of New Zealand.  There are some general disadvantages to concluding a DTA (for example the “locked-in” nature of a treaty or the costs incurred in administering the exchange of information provisions). These disadvantages are less relevant when renegotiating an existing DTA, as many of these disadvantages will already have been absorbed by New Zealand. Therefore, apart from the reduction in revenue and marginal increase in administration costs as discussed previously, there are no new disadvantages created as a result of the new DTA. 19 New Zealand has the option not to enter into the new DTA with Japan. This would mean that the existing DTA would continue to apply, although it is out-of-date compared to modern treaty practice and New Zealand policy developments. In particular, the high withholding tax rates on dividends, interest and royalties would continue to apply. 20 Compared to the existing DTA, the new DTA has only minimal disadvantages and significant benefits for New Zealand. It is therefore in New Zealand’s interest for the new DTA to enter into force. Obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty 21 The new DTA will not impose any requirements on taxpayers. Instead it requires the governments of Japan and New Zealand to restrict their taxing rights on a reciprocal basis. It also requires tax authorities to assist each other by exchanging tax information and by collecting taxes if requested by the other tax authority. The new DTA will not require the imposition of any tax that is not already imposed under domestic law. 22 Where income is derived from one country (the country of source) by a tax resident of the other country (the country of residence), the country of residence generally retains taxing rights under the new DTA. The main impact of the DTA is to restrict the ability of the country of source to tax the income in certain circumstances. Where both countries are permitted to tax the income, the DTA requires the country of residence to provide a credit for the tax imposed by the country of source. For example, if a royalty payment is made between Japan and New Zealand, Japan’s taxing right would be limited to a 5% withholding tax and, when New Zealand taxes the payment, New Zealand would provide a tax credit for the 5% of Japanese tax paid. 23 The key provisions of the new DTA are summarised in the following table. In some cases, the allocation of taxing rights is similar or identical to the existing DTA, but in other cases there is no equivalent provision in the existing DTA. Key provisions of the new DTA DOUBLE TAXATION AND FISCAL EVASION CONVENTION BETWEEN JAPAN AND NEW ZEALAND 8 Type of income Relevant article in the new DTA Is there a similar provision in the existing (1963) DTA? New DTA allows source country to tax? Business profits Articles 5 and 7 ✓ Only if business income is connected to a permanent establishment in the source country (e.g. a fixed place of business such as a branch office). Income from services Article 5(5) ✓ but only for independent services (self-employed people) Only if the services are performed in the source country for more than 183 days in a 12-month period. Income from natural resources Article 6 ✓ ✓ Income from international ships and aircraft 8 ✓ ✕ Dividends 10 ✓ Source country tax is limited to 15% of the dividend or 0% if the dividends are paid to a company that owns at least a 10% shareholding and meets certain other conditions Interest 11 ✕ Source country tax is limited to 10% of the interest payment or 0% if paid to a bank or the other government. In the case of NZ-sourced interest, the 0% rate also requires AIL to be paid by the NZ borrower (this is consistent with NZ’s existing domestic law) Royalties 12 ✕ Source country tax is limited to 5% of the royalty payment. DOUBLE TAXATION AND FISCAL EVASION CONVENTION BETWEEN JAPAN AND NEW ZEALAND 9 Alienation of property 13 ✕ ✓ Employment income 14 ✕ ✓ if employment is performed in the source country and certain other criteria are met. Director’s fees 15 ✕ ✓ Entertainers and Sportspeople 16 ✕ ✓ Pensions 17 ✕ ✕ Government service 18 ✓ Can only be taxed by the Government of which the person is an employee. Payments to students 19 ✓ Payments from a foreign government are not taxable in the country where the student is studying Income derived through a silent partnership 20 ✕ ✓ Other income (not previously mentioned) 21 ✕ ✓ Non-discrimination 24 Article 25 of the new DTA prevents a country from applying tax laws which discriminate on the grounds of nationality, situs of an enterprise, ownership of capital, and (in limited circumstances) residence. This is a very common treaty DTA provision that is not expected to apply in practice. However, there is a remote risk that a taxpayer may attempt to use the non-discrimination provision to challenge a legitimate tax measure which protects the New Zealand tax base. To minimise this risk, the Protocol to the DTA explicitly excludes from the scope of the non-discrimination rule certain elements of New Zealand’s existing tax rules that would be most vulnerable to a legal challenge. Being reciprocal in nature, the non-discrimination provision will help to protect New Zealand businesses operating offshore from any potential discrimination under Japan’s tax system. Administrative requirements DOUBLE TAXATION AND FISCAL EVASION CONVENTION BETWEEN JAPAN AND NEW ZEALAND 10 25 As is the case with the existing DTA, both countries will have to comply with various administrative requirements imposed by the new DTA. These include a general requirement to eliminate double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid (Article 24), complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the new DTA (Article 26), and complying with the arrangements for the exchange of information (Article 27). 26 The new DTA also authorises the New Zealand and Japanese tax authorities to assist each other in the collection of taxes (Article 28). The existing DTA did not contain any similar provision. New Zealand only includes this in DTAs with countries where the provision can be expected to give rise to real benefits. This is likely to be the case with Japan. Differences with other recent DTAs 27 In most respects the DTA with Japan is consistent with New Zealand’s other recent DTAs with major trading partners. However the new DTA with Japan does depart from these other recent DTAs. These differences are explained below. 10% ownership threshold for dividend exemption (Article 10) 28 New Zealand has negotiated DTAs with Australia, the US and Hong Kong which provide a zero percent withholding tax rate on dividends paid by subsidiaries to parent companies. In these DTAs the zero percent rate applies when the parent owns at least 80% of the subsidiary (and certain other conditions are met). A 5% withholding tax rate applies to companies that own between 10% and 80% of the dividend-paying company. A 15% rate applies to all other dividends. 29 The DTA with Japan relaxes these ownership thresholds so that a dividend exemption applies when a company owns 10% or more of the dividend paying company. There is no 5% rate in the DTA with Japan. Instead, all other dividends are taxed at a 15% rate. 30 The new rates with Japan are likely to be a favourable precedent for New Zealand. The fiscal cost to New Zealand should be minimal as under domestic law New Zealand already provides an exemption for imputed dividends paid to non-residents who own at least 10% of a New Zealand company. On the upside, New Zealand companies will be able to benefit from a reciprocal reduction in foreign taxes on dividends that they receive from significant offshore investments. A broader arbitration provision (Article 26) 31 One of the benefits of DTAs is that they provide for taxpayer disputes to be resolved through “mutual agreement” by the revenue authorities in both countries. The mutual agreement procedure provides a quick and satisfactory outcome in almost all cases. However, it does require co-operation between the countries party to the treaty. If the revenue authorities are unable to reach agreement, the taxpayer may be left with no alternative but to go to court, possibly in both countries. 32 To address this shortcoming, there is an international trend for countries to include in their DTAs a facility for taxpayers to request mandatory arbitration of cases that are still unresolved after 2 years. This provides a strong incentive for revenue authorities to resolve mutual agreement cases in a timely fashion. DOUBLE TAXATION AND FISCAL EVASION CONVENTION BETWEEN JAPAN AND NEW ZEALAND 11 33 New Zealand has thus far only agreed to include arbitration in its DTA with Australia. In that DTA, arbitration is limited to questions of fact (although there is scope for New Zealand and Australia to agree to extend arbitration to other issues, in the future). 34 The new DTA with Japan would be the second time New Zealand has agreed to include an arbitration provision, but unlike with Australia, the provision with Japan is not limited to questions of fact, so it potentially has wider application. 35 In practice, arbitration is unlikely to be triggered. In New Zealand’s experience, very few cases have been brought by taxpayers under our DTAs, and almost all of these have been settled within 2 years. Reservations 36 The treaty does not allow either country to make a reservation. Measures which the Government could adopt to implement the treaty action 37 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the new DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. The overriding effect is limited to the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993. The override of the Inland Revenue Acts enables the provisions of the new DTA to provide relief from tax that would otherwise be imposed under domestic law. The override of the Official Information Act is necessary to ensure that confidential communications with the other contracting state are not required to be disclosed. The override of the Privacy Act is necessary to ensure that information regarding natural persons can be exchanged according to the terms of the treaty. 38 The only alternative to an Order in Council for implementing a DTA would be by the enactment of a dedicated statute. This is not preferred as it would unnecessarily increase the amount of primary tax legislation. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects 39 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. 40 As noted in this NIA, the overall economic effects of the new DTA between New Zealand and Japan are expected to be favourable. The new DTA will enhance the existing investment and trade relationship by ensuring that the arrangements governing double taxation between New Zealand and Japan are up-to-date and provide the levels of certainty and protection that taxpayers expect from a modern treaty. 41 Compliance costs for New Zealand businesses are expected to be reduced as a result of the treaty action. This is because New Zealand businesses will have clearer and more up-to-date guidance about when they will be liable for tax on activities in Japan, in line with internationally recognised norms. The same will also be true for Japanese businesses operating in New Zealand. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 42 The new DTA with Japan is expected to have an estimated revenue cost to New Zealand of $3 million per year. This is due to the fact that the DTA reduces New Zealand’s ability to tax interest, royalties and unimputed dividends paid by New Zealand companies to Japanese investors. The reciprocal nature of the DTA means that there are some DOUBLE TAXATION AND FISCAL EVASION CONVENTION BETWEEN JAPAN AND NEW ZEALAND 12 offsetting revenue savings from Japan reducing its taxes on payments to New Zealand investors. This means that more income can be taxed in New Zealand, but there is still an overall cost as there is twice as much Japanese investment in New Zealand than there is New Zealand investment in Japan. 43 Officials expect that any additional revenue cost (outside the reduction in the withholding tax rates) will be minimal because the new DTA is a replacement of an existing DTA, and the allocation of taxing rights generally remains the same between the new DTA and the existing DTA. 44 It has been noted above that Inland Revenue could incur some administrative costs because Japan will be able to request New Zealand to collect Japanese taxes in certain circumstances. While these costs cannot be quantified precisely, they are expected to be small. New Zealand has entered into such arrangements in a number of other DTAs and has a well-established system to deal with any requests. In addition the reciprocal nature of the arrangement is means that any costs incurred will likely be offset by benefits accruing to New Zealand from the ability to ask Japan to collect taxes on our behalf. Consultation 45 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Treasury, have been consulted about the terms of the new DTA and the content of this extended NIA, and those agencies agreed that implementing the DTA would be in New Zealand’s interest. 46 On 29 June 2012, Japan and New Zealand announced that officials had reached an agreement in principle on the text of a new DTA. Businesses and tax practitioners have welcomed this development but, consistent with international practice, officials have not publicly disclosed or consulted on any specific details of the new DTA. Subsequent protocols or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 47 No further amendments are anticipated at this time. New Zealand will consider future amendments on a case-by-case basis. Any amendments to the new DTA will be subject to the normal domestic approvals and procedures. Although there is no amendment clause in the new DTA, amendment would be subject to the usual requirements of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. 48 An accompanying Protocol forms an integral part of the new DTA and will be signed at the same time. Countries often prefer clarifying provisions and departures from their standard treaty model to be located in an accompanying Protocol. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 49 Under Article 32, either country may terminate the new DTA after the DTA has been in force for at least 5 years. A country must give at least 6 months’ notice that they wish to terminate the DTA. 50 In such an event, the new DTA will cease to have effect for withholding taxes on interest, dividends and royalties from 1 January in the year following the year in which the notice of termination is given. The provisions for other taxes would cease to have effect for income years beginning on or after 1 April in the year following the termination notice for New Zealand, and 1 January for Japan. DOUBLE TAXATION AND FISCAL EVASION CONVENTION BETWEEN JAPAN AND NEW ZEALAND 13 Agency Disclosure Statement 51 Inland Revenue has prepared this extended national interest analysis (NIA). It has undertaken an analysis of the issue of implementing the new DTA between Japan and New Zealand, and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. As part of that process, it has considered the option of not entering into the treaty. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. The policy aligns with the Government Statement on Regulation. 52 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Treasury, have been consulted about the terms of the new DTA and the content of this NIA, and those agencies agreed that implementing the DTA would be in New Zealand’s interest. On 29 June 2012, Japan and New Zealand announced that officials had reached an agreement in principle on the text of a new DTA. Businesses and tax practitioners have welcomed this development but, consistent with international practice, officials have not publicly disclosed or consulted on any specific details of the new DTA. 53 Inland Revenue is of the view that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on business; nor impair private property rights, market competition, or the incentives for business to innovate and invest; nor override fundamental common law principles.

The committee supports the double taxation agreement and has no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The national interest analysis for the agreement is appended to this report. DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA 3 Appendix A Committee procedure The international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income was referred to the committee on 10 December 2012. We met on 31 January 2013 to consider the agreement. Committee members John Hayes (Chairperson) Hon Phil Goff Dr Kennedy Graham Hon Tau Henare Dr Paul Hutchison Su’a William Sio Lindsay Tisch DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA 4 Appendix B National Interest Analysis Double Tax Agreement with Papua New Guinea 1 Executive summary 1.1 On 29 October 2012, New Zealand signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the Papua New Guinea DTA). 1.2 Double tax agreements (DTAs) are bilateral international treaties that are principally designed to encourage growth in economic ties between countries. They do this by reducing tax impediments to cross-border services, trade and investment. The negotiation of, and giving of effect to, DTAs is authorised by section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. New Zealand has 37 DTAs in force, primarily with New Zealand’s major trading and investment partners. 1.3 Although Papua New Guinea is not currently a major trading and investment partner, the key factor that led to negotiations with Papua New Guinea was the identification of significant opportunities for New Zealand tax residents in the large mining and petroleum projects currently being undertaken in Papua New Guinea. In particular, a multi-billion- dollar ExxonMobil-led liquid natural gas project will take over 30 years. The initial (US$15 billion) phase of the project involves construction of gas production, processing and storage facilities, together with over 700 kilometres of pipelines to connect the facilities. As a consequence of this investment, almost every sector of Papua New Guinea’s economy is growing. 1.4 New Zealand companies are operating at a disadvantage compared with Australian companies that are competing for those same business opportunities. This is because Australia has had a DTA with Papua New Guinea since 1989. Under that DTA, Australian companies can structure their affairs to minimise or eliminate their tax obligations to the Papua New Guinea Government. Papua New Guinea’s income taxes are complex and significant. (Taxes on companies typically aggregate to at least 48%, compared to 28% in New Zealand.) Reducing tax obligations to the Papua New Guinea Government will provide a number of practical advantages to New Zealand businesses in areas such as profit impact, compliance costs, cash flow, the ability to make competitive tenders, and the pass- through of imputation credits to shareholders. 1.5 As in all negotiations, the New Zealand DTA with Papua New Guinea represents a compromise between the starting positions of both countries. However, only one compromise made by New Zealand in the Papua New Guinea DTA is of any potential significance. That compromise relates to New Zealand’s agreement to Papua New Guinea’s request for a tax sparing mechanism to be included in the treaty. Tax sparing provisions were once a common feature of DTAs between developed and developing countries. The developed country would agree to provide a tax credit for tax deemed to be paid in the developing country, but not actually paid because of a tax exemption intended to attract foreign investment. New Zealand stopped providing tax sparing provisions some years ago, DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA 5 for tax policy reasons. The tax sparing mechanism agreed with Papua New Guinea therefore represents a concession. However, recent changes to New Zealand’s international tax rules mean that tax sparing is now a relatively minor issue for New Zealand. Additionally, the mechanism will apply only in circumstances agreed to between the two Governments in an exchange of letters, and it is not expected that the mechanism will ever be invoked. The mechanism will terminate after a ten-year period. 2 Nature and timing of the proposed treaty action 2.1 The Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the Papua New Guinea DTA) was signed on 29 October 2012. 2.2 The proposed treaty action is to bring the Papua New Guinea DTA into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirm the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force by each country, pursuant to Article 26 of the Papua New Guinea DTA. 2.3 Before the treaty action is taken, the Papua New Guinea DTA must successfully undergo Parliamentary treaty examination, in accordance with Parliament’s Standing Order 394, and must successfully be given the force of law in New Zealand by an Order in Council made pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 3 Reasons for New Zealand becoming Party to the treaty General reasons for New Zealand’s conclusion of double tax agreements 3.1 New Zealand began entering into double tax agreements (DTAs) in 1947, and currently has a network of 37 DTAs in force, predominantly with New Zealand’s main trading and investment partners. 3.2 DTAs are bilateral international treaties that are principally designed to encourage growth in economic ties between countries. DTAs do this by reducing tax impediments to cross-border services, trade and investment. Some impediments to cross-border economic activity can be addressed unilaterally. For example, New Zealand generally relieves double taxation by unilaterally allowing tax residents who derive foreign-sourced income to credit foreign tax paid against their New Zealand tax liability. New Zealand also unilaterally reduces withholding taxes on certain forms of inbound investment. However, unilateral solutions cannot address all of the issues that arise from cross-border activity. Moreover, the country applying unilateral measures must then bear the full cost of the relief. DTAs address these problems by facilitating bilateral solutions. DTAs enable a wider range of issues to be addressed than is possible unilaterally, and also enable the parties to a DTA to share the cost of providing relief. 3.3 DTA networks make an important contribution to the expansion of world trade and to the development of the world economy, which are key objectives of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Internationally, the OECD has therefore assumed a leading role in promoting the use of DTAs. In particular, the OECD has produced a Model Tax Convention, and a comprehensive commentary, for member and non-member countries to use as a basis for concluding DTAs. As a member of the DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA 6 OECD, New Zealand is subject to an express recommendation issued by the OECD Council in 1997 1 for all member countries: 1. to pursue their efforts to conclude bilateral tax conventions ... with those member countries, and where appropriate with non-member countries, with which they have not yet entered into such conventions ... 2. when concluding new bilateral conventions or revising existing bilateral conventions, to conform to the Model Tax Convention, as interpreted by the Commentaries thereon. 3.4 At a practical level, DTAs are complex technical documents that provide an interface between two, often conflicting, tax systems. The key stakeholders in cross-border economic activity generally favour DTAs for the following reasons: Taxpayers. A primary concern for any taxpayer contemplating entering into commercial activity in another jurisdiction is that they must comply with the tax and other legal obligations of two separate jurisdictions. This can be perplexing, and obtaining professional advice or tax rulings can be costly and time consuming. Unique issues also arise from cross-border activities, ranging from complex matters such as transfer pricing disputes, to more mundane considerations such as whether taxes paid in the other jurisdiction are creditable against home jurisdiction tax. DTAs help alleviate many of these problems. They establish a framework for the taxation of cross-border activity and establish a mutual agreement procedure for resolving tax disputes. Investors. Investing across an international border always involves risk. Tax laws are often complex and can change suddenly. DTAs assist investors by specifying the maximum rates of tax that can be applied to dividends, interest and royalties. These “headline” rates reduce compliance costs for investors by making it easier to determine the after-tax returns on potential investments. The tax rates are “locked in” by the treaty, which means that investors can make business decisions with confidence. To encourage greater inward investment, governments can unilaterally reduce their taxation of investment income. However, lowering tax rates in a bilateral treaty setting ensures that the rates are also reduced on a reciprocal basis by the treaty partner. This provides benefits to domestic investors. Governments. As double taxation distorts business decisions and generally hinders cross-border economic activity, most jurisdictions unilaterally relieve double taxation of their tax residents. (For example, New Zealand tax legislation provides a general tax credit mechanism.) However, in the absence of a DTA, a jurisdiction bears the full cost of relieving double taxation itself. DTAs allow the cost of relieving double taxation to be shared. They do this by allocating taxing rights between the jurisdictions concerned, on the basis of internationally accepted principles as set out in the OECD Model Tax Convention. Additionally, most countries tax their residents on income earned worldwide. International cooperation between tax authorities is therefore needed to enable tax authorities to verify that income earned in other countries is reported correctly by tax residents. DTAs facilitate this by authorising the exchange of tax-related information (such as 1 The recommendation follows similar OECD Council recommendations that have been in place since before New Zealand joined the OECD. DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA 7 tax records, business books and accounts, bank information and ownership information). The exchanged information assists tax authorities to detect and prevent tax evasion and tax avoidance. This is a key benefit of DTAs for governments. Specific reasons for the double tax agreement with Papua New Guinea 3.5 New Zealand generally only enters into DTAs with countries with which it has an existing or potential significant economic relationship. However, DTAs can also be entered into to exploit a particular opportunity or to address particular taxation problems. 3.6 Until recently, Papua New Guinea would not have been categorised as an existing or potential significant economic partner for New Zealand. In the year to December 2011, New Zealand’s merchandise exports to Papua New Guinea amounted to NZ$217 million, and New Zealand imports from Papua New Guinea were NZ$13 million. Investment statistics are not available, but investment in either direction is not thought to be high. 3.7 However, recent international investment in Papua New Guinea has changed that country’s economic outlook and has opened significant opportunities for New Zealand business interests. 3.8 Papua New Guinea’s economy is now strong (real GDP grew by 8.9% in 2011 and the IMF projects growth of 7.7% in 2012), as a result of confidence generated by large mining and natural gas projects. The most high-profile of these is a multi-billion-dollar ExxonMobil-led liquid natural gas (LNG) project. The initial (US$15 billion) phase of the project involves the construction of gas production, processing and storage facilities, and over 700 kilometres of pipelines to connect the facilities. 3.9 The foreign investment is resulting in increased Government spending and increasing demand across a range of sectors, including food and beverage, technology and communications services. Therefore, in addition to direct engagement in the Papua New Guinea mining and petroleum projects, there are a range of spin-off opportunities in the Papua New Guinea market (which is still relatively unsaturated in many product and service areas). An influx of expatriate workers is, for example, fuelling a property and construction market that is currently returning landlords around 30% per annum on investment. 3.10 Specific opportunities are opening for New Zealand companies in the renewable energy sector, particularly in hydro energy, with additional (but more limited) scope for commercial engagement in geothermal energy. Papua New Guinea’s electric power demand is currently increasing at a rate of 10% per annum (in contrast to the previous average annual increase of 2-3% for the past 20 years) and this increased demand is expected to continue for the next six years. This unprecedented increase in demand is putting pressure on generation capacity, the maintenance of existing plant, energy efficiency and new developments. A number of major hydro-electric plants are planned. These developments offer significant opportunities to New Zealand companies, as New Zealand has experience in developing these forms of renewable energy. 3.11 In general, New Zealand is well known and well regarded in Papua New Guinea, and New Zealand’s commercial presence is being sought by businesses and the Government. 3.12 New Zealand companies are operating at a disadvantage compared with Australian companies that are competing for those same business opportunities. This is because Australia has had a DTA with Papua New Guinea since 1989. Under that DTA, Australian DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA 8 companies can structure their affairs to minimise or eliminate their tax obligations to the Papua New Guinea Government. Papua New Guinea’s income taxes are complex and significant. (Taxes on companies typically aggregate to at least 48%, compared to 28% in New Zealand). Reducing tax obligations to the Papua New Guinea Government provides a number of practical advantages in areas such as profit impact, compliance costs, cash flow, the ability to make competitive tenders, and the pass-through of imputation credits to shareholders. 4 Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force and not entering into force for New Zealand 4.1 As a bilateral instrument, the Papua New Guinea DTA necessarily involves a trade-off between advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand. On balance, however, entering into the Papua New Guinea DTA is expected to be in New Zealand’s overall interests. Advantages of the treaty entering into force 4.2 The advantages to New Zealand of the Papua New Guinea DTA entering into force can be summarised as follows:  The DTA can be expected to foster all forms of bilateral economic activity (such as services, trade and investment). This will benefit New Zealand in terms of employment and business opportunities and offshore earnings. As noted below in section 8: Costs, DTAs can generally be expected to give rise to a prima facie revenue cost. However, in the case of Papua New Guinea, these costs are expected to be negligible.  For New Zealand business interests, the DTA will reduce the cost of importing capital.  For investors in both jurisdictions, the DTA will reduce compliance costs and provide the certainty of low headline withholding tax rates, locked in by the treaty.  For investors, businesses and taxpayers from both jurisdictions, the DTA will provide safeguards such as a mutual agreement procedure, which will facilitate the resolution of tax disputes (including disputes in complex areas such as transfer pricing).  For taxpayers engaged in certain short-term income-earning activities in the other jurisdiction, the DTA will reduce compliance costs and provide cash flow advantages by eliminating the need to pay tax in that jurisdiction and then claim that tax against their tax liability in their home jurisdiction.  For New Zealand, the DTA will provide an equitable framework for sharing the cost of relieving double taxation between the two jurisdictions.  In some circumstances, New Zealand will no longer need to provide credits for foreign tax paid.  For tax authorities, the exchange of information mechanism will assist in the detection and prevention of tax evasion and tax avoidance. The mechanism will also be a general deterrent against evasion and avoidance activity, and will further reduce the opportunities available to residents to escape legitimate New Zealand tax. DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA 9 4.3 In 2011, the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes concluded a review of New Zealand’s legal and administrative frameworks for tax information exchange, and recommended that New Zealand should continue to develop its exchange of information network. The Papua New Guinea DTA will help New Zealand to meet this recommendation. 4.4 A final advantage of the Papua New Guinea DTA is that New Zealand and Papua New Guinea share many treaty policy positions. As a result, New Zealand was able to secure all of its key negotiating positions. The Papua New Guinea DTA therefore represents a good precedent for New Zealand in future negotiations with other countries. Disadvantages of the treaty entering into force 4.5 As noted above, DTAs offer bilateral solutions to problems that are difficult or impossible to solve unilaterally. However, a potential downside to DTAs is that those solutions are then locked in place by the treaty and are difficult and costly to change. This can create difficulties if treaty provisions need to be changed urgently. Practical experience indicates that in genuine cases, treaty partners are usually amenable to making necessary changes. However, in extreme cases, if the treaty partner were to refuse to cooperate, the treaty could need to be terminated. 4.6 A second general disadvantage of DTAs is that they typically give rise to an up-front revenue cost. This is because DTAs lower withholding tax rates on investment income and allocate taxing rights between the two jurisdictions. The allocating of taxing rights means that New Zealand will lose the ability to tax some income streams that it previously could tax (this applies on a reciprocal basis). However, as noted below in section 8: Costs, in the case of Papua New Guinea, the prima facie revenue costs are expected to be negligible. 4.7 A third general disadvantage of entering into DTAs is that costs will need to be incurred in administering the exchange of information provisions of the DTA. If a treaty partner makes requests for information under a New Zealand DTA, New Zealand will incur costs in complying with those requests. However, New Zealand already has exchange of information arrangements with 55 other jurisdictions (including 37 DTAs and 18 Tax Information Exchange Agreements) and has systems in place for administering those arrangements. The costs of providing information to Papua New Guinea under the Papua New Guinea DTA will therefore be marginal. 4.8 As noted above, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea share many treaty positions, and New Zealand was therefore able to secure all of its key negotiating positions. However, as is usual in negotiations, both sides were required to make some compromises from their starting positions. Only one compromise made by New Zealand in the Papua New Guinea DTA is of any potential significance. That compromise relates to New Zealand’s agreement to Papua New Guinea’s request for a tax sparing mechanism to be included in the treaty. Tax sparing provisions were once a common feature of DTAs between developed and developing countries. The developed country would agree to provide a tax credit for tax deemed to be paid in the developing country, but not actually paid because of a tax exemption intended to attract foreign investment. New Zealand stopped providing tax sparing provisions some years ago, for tax policy reasons. The tax sparing mechanism agreed with Papua New Guinea therefore represents a concession. However, recent changes to New Zealand’s international tax rules mean that tax sparing is now a relatively minor issue for New Zealand. Additionally, the tax sparing mechanism will apply only in circumstances agreed to between the two Governments in an exchange of letters, and it is DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA 10 not expected that the mechanism will ever be invoked. The mechanism will automatically terminate after a ten-year period. Advantages of the treaty not entering into force 4.9 It is an option not to have a DTA with Papua New Guinea. In that case, the disadvantages identified above will not arise. Disadvantages of the treaty not entering into force 4.10 If the Papua New Guinea DTA does not enter into force, New Zealand business interests will continue to operate at a competitive disadvantage with Australian firms that do have the protection of a DTA. It is likely that the Government would be strongly lobbied by those New Zealand business interests. 5 Legal obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position in respect of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms Summary of key legal obligations 5.1 DTAs do not impose requirements on taxpayers. The Papua New Guinea DTA will not (and cannot) require the imposition of a tax that is not already imposed under domestic law. The obligations that DTAs impose are on the respective New Zealand and Papua New Guinea Governments. 5.2 When income is derived from one jurisdiction (the source jurisdiction) by a tax resident of the other jurisdiction (the residence jurisdiction), both countries typically impose tax on that income. DTAs primarily relieve such double taxation by allocating taxing rights. The key allocation of taxing rights in the Papua New Guinea DTA is as follows:  Business profits of an enterprise will be taxable only in the jurisdiction in which the enterprise is resident, unless profits are derived through a permanent establishment in the source jurisdiction. In that case, the profits may also be taxed in the source jurisdiction. (Article 7 refers.) The term “permanent establishment” is generally defined in the Papua New Guinea DTA as meaning a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. However, this general rule is supplemented by a number of clarifications and deeming rules which follow New Zealand’s preferred formula, and which will ensure that New Zealand can continue to impose tax on significant business activities such as natural resource exploration or exploitation. (Article 5 refers.)  Investment income (dividends, interest and royalties) may generally be taxed in both jurisdictions. However, the amount of withholding tax that can be imposed by the source jurisdiction is limited to 15% for dividends (Article 10 refers) and 10% for interest and royalties (Articles 11 and 12 refer). The limitation does not apply if the dividends, interest or royalties are derived in connection with a permanent establishment in the source jurisdiction. In addition, interest will be exempt in the source jurisdiction if derived by the Government of the other State. DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA 11  Income from independent personal services will be taxable only in the jurisdiction in which the individual performing the services income is resident, unless (i) the individual has a fixed base in the source jurisdiction, or (ii) the income derived by the individual for performing the services exceeds US$10,000 in any twelve-month period, or (iii) the individual is present in the source jurisdiction for the purpose of performing the services for more than six months in any twelve month period. In such case, the services income may also be taxed in the source jurisdiction. (Article 14 refers.)  Income from dependent personal services will be taxable only in the jurisdiction in which the employee is resident unless the employee is present in the source jurisdiction for more than six months in a twelve-month period or the employer is a resident of the source jurisdiction (or is non-resident but the employee’s remuneration is borne by a permanent establishment in the source jurisdiction). In that case, the employment income may also be taxed in the source jurisdiction. (Article 15 refers.)  Pensions will be taxable only in the jurisdiction in which the recipient is resident. (Article 18 refers.) 5.3 A number of exceptions to the above rules also apply. These include:  Income from real property (referred to as “immovable property” in the Papua New Guinea DTA) will always be taxable in the jurisdiction where the property is situated. (Articles 6 and 13 refer.)  Profits of an enterprise from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic will be taxable only in the jurisdiction in which the enterprise is resident. However, profits from domestic carriage by ship or aircraft will always be taxable in the source jurisdiction. (Articles 8 and 13 refer.)  Directors’ fees will always be taxable in the jurisdiction in which the company paying the fees is resident. (Article 16 refers.)  Income from the activities of entertainers and sportspersons will always be taxable in the source jurisdiction. (Article 17 refers.)  Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one jurisdiction will generally be exempt from tax in the other jurisdiction. (Article 19 refers.) 5.4 Where the allocation of taxing rights permits both jurisdictions to tax an item of income, the Papua New Guinea DTA will require New Zealand to relieve double taxation of its residents by allowing a credit for the tax paid in Papua New Guinea. (Article 22 refers.) This is consistent with the unilateral relief mechanism that already applies under New Zealand domestic law. The obligation also applies reciprocally, so Papua New Guinea must allow its residents a credit for New Zealand tax paid. 5.5 In addition to the above obligations, New Zealand will be required to comply with various administrative requirements imposed by the Papua New Guinea DTA. These are as follows: DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA 12  Mutual agreement procedure. New Zealand must comply with the procedures for settling disputes set out in the mutual agreement procedure article of the Papua New Guinea DTA. (Article 23 refers.) This is discussed below, in the section Dispute resolution.  Exchange of information. As discussed, the Papua New Guinea DTA includes an Article that provides for the exchange of tax-related information between tax authorities, for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax evasion and tax avoidance. New Zealand will be required to respond to requests for information from Papua New Guinea. If Inland Revenue receives a valid request, and if it does not already hold the requested information, it must use its information-gathering powers to obtain the information. Inland Revenue can similarly request information from Papua New Guinea. (Article 24 refers.) Dispute resolution 5.6 The Papua New Guinea DTA establishes a “mutual agreement procedure” for resolving disputes. Under this procedure, a taxpayer who considers that they have been taxed incorrectly under the treaty, including in transfer pricing cases, can approach their local tax authority under Article 23 to invoke a mutual agreement procedure. If the tax authority considers the case to be justified, and is unable to resolve the case through its own actions, it must approach the tax authority of the other jurisdiction to seek a bilateral resolution. This bipartisan approach is particularly appropriate in the tax treaty context because a single issue will generally affect a person’s tax position in both jurisdictions. The mutual agreement procedure is not a true disputes resolution mechanism, as the two sides are only obliged to “endeavour” to reach resolution. However, the taxpayer remains free to pursue a case through the courts (including if they do not agree with the decision reached under the mutual agreement procedure). 5.7 The mutual agreement procedure also authorises the tax authorities of the two jurisdictions to collectively resolve any difficulties or doubts about the correct interpretation or application of the Papua New Guinea DTA. Reservations 5.8 The Papua New Guinea DTA does not allow parties to make a reservation upon ratification. 6 Measures which the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including specific reference to implementing legislation 6.1 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the Papua New Guinea DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. However, the override relates only to tax matters, and applies only in respect of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993. 6.2 The override of the Inland Revenue Acts is necessary to give effect to the core provisions of the Papua New Guinea DTA, which may provide relief from tax that would otherwise be imposed under domestic law. The override of the Official Information Act is necessary to ensure that confidential communications with the other jurisdiction do not have to be disclosed. The override of the Privacy Act is necessary to ensure that DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA 13 information regarding natural persons can be exchanged according to the terms of the treaty. 6.3 Article 26 of the Papua New Guinea DTA provides for the agreement to be brought into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes between the Contracting States. The Papua New Guinea DTA will enter into force on the date of the last of these notes. New Zealand will be able to notify Papua New Guinea that all procedures required by domestic law have been completed once the Order in Council has entered into force, which will be 28 days after its publication in the New Zealand Gazette. 6.4 Thereafter, the provisions of the Papua New Guinea DTA will have effect from various dates, according to the terms of the DTA. In New Zealand, the provisions relating to withholding taxes will generally take effect 2 months after the date of entry into force. The provisions relating to other taxes will have effect for income years beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year following the year in which the DTA enters into force. 6.5 As an alternative to the above Order in Council mechanism, the Papua New Guinea DTA could be given legislative effect by means of the enactment of a dedicated statute. However, this option would unnecessarily increase the amount of primary tax legislation, and is therefore not preferred. 7 Economic, social, cultural, and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 7.1 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. 7.2 As noted elsewhere in this National Interest Analysis, the overall economic effects of the Papua New Guinea DTA are expected to be favourable to New Zealand. This is because the Papua New Guinea DTA can be expected to encourage growth in economic activity, and to assist Inland Revenue to detect and prevent tax evasion and tax avoidance. It is not possible to quantify the economic benefits but, overall, the benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. 8 The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 8.1 DTAs constrain New Zealand from taxing certain income and limit the rate at which tax on dividends, royalties and interest can be imposed, and therefore typically can be expected to result in some prima facie reduction of New Zealand tax. 8.2 This potential upfront revenue cost is typically offset by other factors. For example, there will be an offsetting effect to the New Zealand tax base from the reduction of tax in the other country, and the reduced need for New Zealand to allow foreign tax credits. There will also be some revenue gains from the expected reduction in tax evasion and tax avoidance resulting from the DTA exchange of information provisions. 8.3 Data limitations prevent officials from accurately estimating the actual revenue cost of the Papua New Guinea DTA. However, due to the limited existing trade and investment flows between Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, any reduction of New Zealand tax is expected to be negligible. 8.4 The tax sparing provisions of the DTA are not expected to give rise to specific costs. The provisions will apply only in circumstances agreed to between the two Governments in an exchange of letters. Furthermore, the provisions will terminate after a ten-year period. 8.5 In general, as discussed above, DTAs are also expected to give rise to favourable economic benefits, such as increased cross-border services, trade and investment. Again, DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA 14 officials cannot quantify the economic benefits of the Papua New Guinea DTA but, overall, the benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. 8.6 The exchange of information provisions of the Papua New Guinea DTA will result in some administrative costs for Inland Revenue, arising from the need to respond to requests for information from Papua New Guinea. Based on previous experience, the numbers of requests are not expected to be significant. If requests are received, Inland Revenue already has efficient systems in place for administering the exchange of information provisions of New Zealand’s other 37 DTAs and 18 Tax Information Exchange Agreements, and the additional costs will be marginal. 8.7 Compliance costs for New Zealand businesses are expected to be reduced under the Papua New Guinea DTA. This is because New Zealand businesses will have clear guidance about when they will be liable for tax on activities in Papua New Guinea, in line with internationally recognised norms. 9 Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 9.1 The Treasury, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, were consulted about the terms of the Papua New Guinea DTA and the content of this extended National Interest Analysis, and agree with its analysis and conclusions. 9.2 New Zealand Trade and Enterprise was consulted in the lead-up to the negotiations, and supported the proposal to conclude a DTA with Papua New Guinea. 10 Subsequent protocols and/or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 10.1 The Papua New Guinea DTA does not expressly set out the process for amendment of the agreement, and no specific amendments are currently anticipated. However, New Zealand will consider any future amendments on a case-by-case basis. Future amendments will be subject to New Zealand’s normal domestic approvals and procedures for DTAs. 11 Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 11.1 Under Article 27 of the Papua New Guinea DTA, after the expiry of five years from the date of entry into force, either party may terminate the agreement by giving notice of termination through diplomatic channels. Article 27 generally follows the approach used in New Zealand’s other DTAs. 12 Agency Disclosure Statement 12.1 Inland Revenue has prepared this extended national interest analysis (NIA). Inland Revenue has analysed the issue of implementing the new DTA between Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. As part of that process, Inland Revenue considered the option of not entering into the treaty. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. The policy aligns with the Government Statement on Regulation. 12.2 The allocation of taxing rights under the Papua New Guinea DTA is consistent with the New Zealand negotiating model, which in turn is based on the OECD’s Model Tax Convention. The revenue cost to New Zealand as a result of the allocation of taxing rights under the DTA is expected to be negligible. DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA 15 12.3 The tax sparing mechanism agreed with Papua New Guinea represents a potential risk. The mechanism will apply only in circumstances agreed to between the two Governments in an exchange of letters. The mechanism therefore has a potential cost to New Zealand. The tax sparing mechanism could be seen as potentially creating a precedent that may lead to other developed countries seeking a similar provision. However, that precedent already exists. (Eight of New Zealand’s existing DTAs contain tax sparing provisions.) Moreover, the mechanism will terminate after a ten-year period. 12.4 An Order in Council will be required to give the new DTA effect in New Zealand law. The Order in Council will override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993; this is authorised by section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and is necessary to give effect to the terms of the new DTA. 12.5 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Treasury, have been consulted about the terms of the Papua New Guinea DTA and the content of this extended NIA, and no concerns were raised. The proposal also has the support of Trade and Enterprise New Zealand. 12.6 Inland Revenue’s view is that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on business interests; nor impair private property rights, market competition, or the incentives for business to innovate and invest; nor override fundamental common law principles.

International treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Contents Recommendation 2   Reasons for the agreement 2  Exchange of information 2  Tax for students 3  Conclusion 3  Appendix A 4  Appendix B 5  INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF THE DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH VIET NAM 2 Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Recommendation The Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, and recommends that the House take note of its report. Reasons for the agreement Viet Nam is New Zealand’s 24 th -largest trading partner. Both countries are parties to the ASEAN–Australia–New Zealand Free Trade Agreement, and are in the process of negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement; the lack of a double taxation agreement with Viet Nam is a key gap in our tax treaty network. Australia has had such an agreement with Viet Nam since 1992. No agreement had previously been reached on this matter because Viet Nam sought a tax- sparing clause in the agreement, something New Zealand prefers not to include in its tax treaties to prevent opportunities for tax avoidance. Tax-sparing is a process whereby a tax credit from one party offsets a tax exemption granted by the other. It has now been agreed that New Zealand will provide Viet Nam with a tax sparing arrangement limited to ten years’ duration, subject to anti-avoidance measures. We were told this was consistent with New Zealand’s Double Taxation Agreement with Singapore. There is expected to be little or no cost to the proposed agreement. The only cost to New Zealand would be in the form of loss of dividends, interest, and royalties, which are small as New Zealand’s investment in Viet Nam is low, and there will be some off-setting in the form of tax exemption for New Zealand. Exchange of information To help prevent tax avoidance and evasion, New Zealand generally seeks to exchange information about all types of taxes with other countries. Viet Nam has only ever exchanged income tax information with other countries, and this position is reflected in this agreement. This is not New Zealand’s preference, but the agreement does have a “most favoured nation” clause, which obliges Viet Nam to enter into negotiations with New Zealand should it enter into an agreement with another nation that allows other tax information to be exchanged. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF THE DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH VIET NAM 3 Tax for students A Vietnamese resident studying in New Zealand with a job related to the course of study, under article 20 of the agreement, in some circumstances, is not liable for income tax. The period worked must not exceed 183 days in a 12-month period. The clause is unusual. New Zealand has agreed to it because its inclusion is important to Viet Nam. We are assured by the Inland Revenue Department that this will not create a loophole allowing a student visa to be misused as a work visa. Conclusion We support the proposed double taxation agreement. The national interest analysis for the agreement is appended to this report. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF THE DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH VIET NAM 4 Appendix A Committee procedure The agreement was referred to the committee for examination on 9 September 2013. We met on 26 September and 24 October 2013 to hear evidence and consider it. We heard evidence from the Inland Revenue Department. Committee members John Hayes (Chairperson) Hon Phil Goff Dr Kennedy Graham Hon Tau Henare Dr Paul Hutchison David Shearer Lindsay Tisch INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF THE DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH VIET NAM 5 Appendix B National Interest Analysis –– Double Tax Agreement with Viet Nam 1. Executive summary 1.1 On 5 August 2013, New Zealand signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, and Protocol (collectively, the Viet Nam DTA). 1.2 Double tax agreements (DTAs) are bilateral international treaties that are principally designed to encourage growth in economic ties between countries. They do this by reducing tax impediments to cross-border services, trade and investment. New Zealand has 37 DTAs in force, primarily with its major trading and investment partners. The authorisation to negotiate and give effect to DTAs comes from section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 1.3 Consistent with the Government’s DTA Strategy it is important for New Zealand to maintain a competitive DTA network with its main trade and investment partners in order to retain and grow internationally competitive companies. Viet Nam has been identified as one of the key gaps in the New Zealand tax treaty network. This gap has been further highlighted by the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA), coming into force in 2010 (both New Zealand and Viet Nam are party to it), and the progress towards concluding the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Free Trade Agreement. Australia, by comparison, has had a DTA with Viet Nam since 1992. New Zealand has already concluded DTAs with five other key trading partners in the ASEAN region – namely Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia. 1.4 Viet Nam is New Zealand’s 24th largest trading partner (goods) and 13th largest within Asia. Education, tourism and consultation services are an increasingly important component of the economic relationship (Viet Nam was the ninth-largest source of international students in New Zealand in 2012). Opportunities are also now arising in areas such as clean technology and environmental management, agribusiness and the aviation sector. In addition, there are sizeable investments in the dairy, timber and education sectors in particular, with the prospect of future increases in outbound direct investment and foreign direct investment between New Zealand and Viet Nam. 1.5 DTAs are not just about eliminating double taxation. In the absence of a DTA, New Zealand generally relieves double taxation of its residents on a unilateral basis. However, DTAs provide a more principled and comprehensive basis for doing so, and enable the revenue cost to be shared. They also provide other advantages that can reduce the compliance cost and cash-flow implications of cross-border economic activity and enable business decisions to be made with greater certainty. For these reasons, DTAs generally tend to be favoured by business interests and other key stakeholder groups. The New Zealand Embassy in Ha Noi and Consulate/New Zealand Trade and Enterprise in Ho Chi Minh City receive regular enquiries from New Zealand businesspeople regarding the existence of a bilateral DTA. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF THE DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH VIET NAM 6 1.6 The Viet Nam DTA is broadly consistent with New Zealand’s other recent DTAs, and will be a good precedent for future DTA negotiations. However, as in all negotiations, some compromises were made by both countries. For New Zealand, the key compromise was the agreement to include a tax-sparing mechanism in the treaty. Tax sparing provisions were once a common feature of DTAs between developed and developing countries. The developed country would agree to provide a tax credit for tax deemed to be paid in the developing country, but not actually paid because of a tax exemption intended to attract foreign investment. While New Zealand stopped providing tax-sparing provisions some years ago, for tax policy reasons, recent changes to New Zealand’s international tax rules (which result in foreign dividends received by companies no longer being taxed) mean that tax sparing is now a less significant concern for New Zealand. The mechanism will apply to dividends, interest, and royalties paid from a Viet Nam source to a New Zealand resident. This mechanism does not apply where the New Zealand resident is a financial institution, and contains an anti-avoidance provision to prevent abuse. The mechanism will terminate after a 10-year period. 2. Nature and timing of the proposed treaty action 2.1 The proposed treaty action is to bring the Viet Nam DTA into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirm the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force by each country, pursuant to Article 27 of the Viet Nam DTA. 2.2 Before the treaty action is taken, the Viet Nam DTA must successfully undergo Parliamentary treaty examination, in accordance with Parliament’s Standing Order 394, and must successfully be given the force of law in New Zealand by an Order in Council made pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 3. Reasons for New Zealand becoming Party to the treaty General reasons why New Zealand enters into double tax agreements 3.1 New Zealand began entering into double tax agreements (DTAs) in 1947, and currently has a network of 37 DTAs in force, predominantly with its main trading and investment partners. 3.2 DTAs are bilateral international treaties that are principally designed to encourage growth in economic ties between countries. They do this by reducing tax impediments to cross-border services, trade and investment. The major impediment is double taxation. As explained below, DTAs allocate taxing rights and reduce withholding taxes. Entering into a DTA therefore results in a prima facie revenue cost to New Zealand. However, the expectation is that a DTA will create a more favourable economic environment that will foster an increase in cross-border income-earning activity. 3.3 At a practical level, DTAs are complex technical documents that provide an interface between two, often conflicting, tax systems. Despite their complexity, DTAs are generally favoured by all of the key stakeholder groups that are involved in cross-border economic activity: Taxpayers – A primary concern for any taxpayer contemplating entering into commercial or employment activity in another jurisdiction is that they must comply with the tax and other legal obligations of two separate jurisdictions. This can be perplexing, and obtaining professional advice or tax rulings can be costly and time consuming. Unique issues also INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF THE DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH VIET NAM 7 arise from cross-border activities, ranging from complex matters such as transfer pricing disputes, to more mundane considerations such as whether taxes paid in the other jurisdiction are creditable against home jurisdiction tax. DTAs help alleviate many of these problems. They establish a framework for the taxation of cross-border activity, prohibit discriminatory taxation, and establish a low-cost mechanism for taxpayers to raise concerns if they do not consider that the treaty is being correctly applied or interpreted. Investors – Investing across an international border always involves risk. Specific risks arise in respect of tax because of the inherent complexity of tax laws, which can lead to uncertainty as to the actual tax outcome. Tax laws can also change suddenly in some jurisdictions. DTAs assist investors by specifying the maximum rates of tax that can be applied to dividends, interest and royalties. These “headline” rates reduce compliance costs for investors by making it easier to determine the after-tax returns on potential investments. The tax rates are also “locked in” by the treaty, which means that investors can make business decisions with greater confidence. To encourage greater inward investment, New Zealand has unilaterally reduced withholding taxes on certain returns from inbound investment. However, lowering tax rates in a bilateral treaty setting ensures that the rates are also reduced on a reciprocal basis by the treaty partner. This provides benefits to domestic investors. Governments – As double taxation distorts business decisions and generally hinders cross- border economic activity, most jurisdictions unilaterally relieve double taxation of their tax residents. For example, New Zealand tax legislation relieves double taxation by allowing tax residents who derive foreign-sourced income, to credit the foreign tax paid against their New Zealand tax liability. However, DTAs provide more comprehensive relief from double taxation than is possible unilaterally, and allow the cost of relieving double taxation to be shared. They do this by allocating taxing rights between the jurisdictions concerned, on the basis of internationally accepted principles. In addition, most countries tax their residents on income earned worldwide. International cooperation between tax authorities is therefore needed to enable tax authorities to verify that income earned in other countries is reported correctly by tax residents. DTAs facilitate this by authorising the exchange of tax-related information (such as tax records, business books and accounts, bank information and ownership information). The exchanged information assists tax authorities to detect and prevent tax evasion and tax avoidance. 3.4 The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), has assumed a leading role in promoting the use of DTAs as a way of contributing to the expansion of world trade and developing the world economy. The OECD has produced a Model Tax Convention, and a comprehensive commentary, for member and non-member countries to use as a basis for concluding DTAs. As a member of the OECD, New Zealand is subject to an express recommendation issued by the OECD Council in 1997 1 for all member countries: ... to pursue their efforts to conclude bilateral tax conventions ... with those member countries, and where appropriate with non-member countries, with which they have not yet entered into such conventions ... 1 The recommendation follows similar OECD Council recommendations that have been in place since before New Zealand joined the OECD. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF THE DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH VIET NAM 8 Specific reasons for the double tax agreement with Viet Nam 3.5 New Zealand primarily enters into DTAs with countries with which it has a significant existing or potential economic relationship. Consistent with the Government’s DTA Strategy it is important for New Zealand to maintain a competitive DTA network with its main trade and investment partners in order to retain and grow internationally competitive companies. DTAs can also be entered into to exploit a particular opportunity, or to address particular taxation problems. 3.6 The lack of a DTA with Viet Nam has been one of the key gaps in New Zealand’s tax treaty network, particularly given the growing economic relevance of the Asian region to New Zealand. New Zealand already has DTAs with the other five major ASEAN nations. A DTA with Viet Nam will be an important part of the “connectivity” architecture that New Zealand seeks to put in place in its home region. This is recognised in the NZ Inc ASEAN Strategy, which was publicly launched by the Prime Minister on 5 August 2013. 3.7 Investment between New Zealand and Viet Nam, in either direction, is still not high. However, the two-way goods trade rose 20 per cent between 2010 and 2012 to NZ$777 million, with services trade in 2012 adding a further NZ$69 million 2 . This makes Viet Nam New Zealand’s 24th largest trading partner (goods), and 13th largest within Asia. Education, tourism and consultation services are already an increasingly important component of the economic relationship (Viet Nam was New Zealand’s 10th largest source of international students in 2011), but additional opportunities are now arising in areas such as clean technology, environmental management, agribusiness and aviation. The entry into force of the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA), to which both New Zealand and Viet Nam are party, has given rise to fresh opportunities to increase bilateral trade, particularly in services. The two countries will further cement their relationship in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement, which is currently in the last stages of negotiation. The TPP is expected to deliver a much more liberalised framework for cross- border services and investment that will underpin the expansion of our trade and economic relationship. 3.8 The lack of a DTA has been further highlighted by the fact that Australia has had a DTA with Viet Nam since 1992. This has meant that New Zealanders engaged in income- earning activities in Viet Nam have in some cases been operating at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis Australian residents. 3.9 New Zealand has previously held back from entering into DTA negotiations with Viet Nam because of that country’s strict requirement for tax-sparing concessions from their DTA partners. New Zealand, by contrast, has had a strong preference for not including tax-sparing concessions in DTAs. 3.10 Tax-sparing provisions were once a common feature of DTAs between developed and developing countries. The developed country would agree to provide a tax credit for tax deemed to be paid in the developing country, but not actually paid because of a tax exemption intended to attract foreign investment. Many countries, including New Zealand, stopped including tax-sparing provisions in their DTAs some years ago, for tax policy reasons (including concerns about their use in tax avoidance schemes). 2 New Zealand’s main exports to Viet Nam are dairy products, timber and timber products. Vietnamese imports have been mainly in phosphates, furniture, petroleum, nuts, footwear, telecom handsets, coffee and crustaceans. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF THE DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH VIET NAM 9 3.11 Recent changes to New Zealand’s international tax rules (which result in foreign dividends received by companies no longer being taxed) mean that tax sparing is now less of an issue for New Zealand. Tax-sparing provisions have been included in some recent DTAs, most recently in the Papua New Guinea DTA signed in October last year. Given these developments, New Zealand is no longer constrained from concluding a DTA with Viet Nam. The Viet Nam DTA includes the tax-sparing provisions requested by Viet Nam, but also includes a number of anti-abuse rules proposed by New Zealand. Moreover, the tax-sparing provisions will automatically terminate after a 10-year period. 4. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force and not entering into force for New Zealand 4.1 As a bilateral instrument, the Viet Nam DTA necessarily involves trading-off advantages and disadvantages. However, on balance, entering into the Viet Nam DTA is expected to be in New Zealand’s overall interests. Advantages of the treaty entering into force 4.2 A key advantage of the Viet Nam DTA is that New Zealanders engaging in cross- border income-earning activities can operate on an even footing with competitors from countries such as Australia, that already have the protection of a DTA. It also closes a perceived gap in New Zealand’s network of DTAs with its main trading and investment partners. 4.3 The general advantages of the Viet Nam DTA can be summarised as follows:  The DTA will reduce tax impediments to cross-border activities and transactions (such as services, trade and investment). For example, in some circumstances the DTA will only permit one country to tax a particular transaction, thereby reducing compliance costs and providing cash-flow advantages to the parties to the transaction.  The reduction in tax impediments is likely to foster increased bilateral economic activity that will benefit New Zealand in terms of employment and business opportunities, and offshore earnings.  The allocation of taxing rights under the DTA will enable New Zealand to share the cost of relieving double taxation with Viet Nam, on an equitable basis.  For tax authorities, the exchange-of-information mechanism will assist in detecting and preventing tax evasion and tax avoidance. The mechanism will also be a general deterrent against evasion and avoidance activity, and will further reduce the opportunities available to residents to escape legitimate New Zealand tax.  For New Zealand business interests, the DTA will reduce the cost of importing capital, and make it easier to repatriate profits from Viet Nam.  For investors in both jurisdictions, the DTA will reduce compliance costs and provide the certainty of low headline withholding tax rates, locked in by the treaty.  For investors, businesses and taxpayers from both jurisdictions, the DTA will provide safeguards such as a mutual agreement procedure, which will facilitate the resolution of tax disputes (including disputes in complex areas such as transfer pricing), or the non-discrimination 3 provision, which prohibits states from treating 3 Note that non-residents are not considered to be in the same circumstances as residents. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF THE DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH VIET NAM 10 nationals of the other state less favourably than their own would be treated in the same circumstances. 4.4 In 2011, the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes concluded a review of New Zealand’s legal and administrative frameworks for tax information exchange, and recommended that New Zealand should continue to develop its exchange-of-information network. The Viet Nam DTA will help New Zealand to meet this recommendation. Disadvantages of the treaty entering into force 4.5 As noted above, DTAs offer bilateral solutions to problems that cannot be solved unilaterally. However, a potential downside to DTAs is that those solutions are then locked in place by the treaty and can be difficult and costly to change. This can create difficulties if treaty provisions need to be changed urgently. Practical experience indicates that in genuine cases, treaty partners are usually amenable to making necessary changes. However, in extreme cases, if the treaty partner were to refuse to cooperate, the treaty may need to be terminated. 4.6 A second general disadvantage of DTAs is that they typically give rise to an upfront revenue cost. DTAs decrease the withholding tax rates on investment income and allocate taxing rights between the two jurisdictions. This means that New Zealand will lose the ability to tax some income streams to the extent that it could previously. This applies on a reciprocal basis, and the reciprocal reduction of Vietnamese tax will often provide an offset to the New Zealand reduction of tax (through, for example, not having to provide a foreign tax credit). In addition, any increase in cross-border activity as a result of the DTA entering into force will result in a further offset to the New Zealand reduction of tax. However, to the extent that the New Zealand reduction of tax is not completely offset, the DTA will have a net revenue cost. (Note that DTAs will generally give rise to favourable economic benefits – such as an increase in trade and investment – and these can be expected to outweigh the revenue impact.) 4.7 A third general disadvantage of entering into DTAs is the cost of administering the exchange-of-information provisions. If a DTA partner makes requests for information, New Zealand will incur costs in complying with those requests. However, New Zealand already has exchange-of-information arrangements with 47 other jurisdictions (including 37 DTAs and 10 Tax Information Exchange Agreements), as well as the systems for administering them. The costs of providing information under the Viet Nam DTA will therefore be marginal. 4.8 As noted above, in the negotiations New Zealand agreed to Viet Nam’s proposal to include tax-sparing provisions. This could be seen as a disadvantage, given that New Zealand’s established preference has been not to include tax-sparing provisions in its DTAs. However, also as noted, recent changes to New Zealand’s international tax rules mean that tax sparing is now a relatively minor issue for New Zealand, and tax-sparing provisions appear in some of New Zealand’s recent DTAs. In addition, the tax-sparing provisions include a number of anti-abuse rules, and will automatically terminate after a ten-year period. 4.9 Despite the fact that DTAs generally only apply to taxes on income (and, in the case of countries with capital taxes, to taxes on capital), the exchange-of-information provisions typically have a wider scope, applying to all taxes. However, Viet Nam has INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF THE DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH VIET NAM 11 never previously agreed to extend its exchange-of-information provisions beyond taxes on income. The Viet Nam DTA reflects this Vietnamese preference for a narrower exchange- of-information scope. This could be seen as a disadvantage. However, the wider exchange-of-information scope is a relatively recent international development, and most of New Zealand’s DTAs have a narrower scope. In addition, New Zealand asked for the insertion into the DTA of a most-favoured-nation obligation that will require Viet Nam to renegotiate the scope of the exchange-of-information provisions if they ever agree to a wider scope in any other DTA. Advantages of the treaty not entering into force 4.10 Not having a DTA with Viet Nam is an option. In that case, the disadvantages identified above will not arise. Disadvantages of the treaty not entering into force 4.11 If the Viet Nam DTA does not enter into force, New Zealand business interests will continue to operate at a competitive disadvantage, compared with Australian firms that are covered by a DTA. It is likely that the Government would be strongly lobbied by those New Zealand business interests. 5. Legal obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position in respect of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms Summary of key legal obligations 5.1 DTAs do not impose requirements on taxpayers. Moreover, the Viet Nam DTA will not (and cannot) require the imposition of a tax that is not already imposed under domestic law. The DTA obligations will apply solely to the New Zealand and Viet Nam Governments. 5.2 When income is derived from one jurisdiction (the source jurisdiction), by a tax resident of the other jurisdiction (the residence jurisdiction), both countries typically tax on that income. DTAs primarily relieve such double taxation by allocating taxing rights. The key allocation of taxing rights in the Viet Nam DTA is as follows:  Business profits of an enterprise will be taxable only in the jurisdiction in which the enterprise is resident, unless profits are derived through a permanent establishment in the source jurisdiction. In that case, the profits may be taxed in both jurisdictions. (Article 7 refers.) The term “permanent establishment” is generally defined in the Viet Nam DTA as meaning a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. However, this general rule is supplemented by a number of clarifications and deeming rules which follow New Zealand’s preferred formula, and which will ensure that New Zealand can continue to impose tax on significant business activities such as natural resource exploration or exploitation. (Article 5 refers.)  Investment income (dividends, interest and royalties) may generally be taxed in both jurisdictions. However, the amount of withholding tax that can be imposed by the source jurisdiction is limited to 5% where the dividend is paid to a company that owns at least 50% of the voting power in the company issuing the dividend, or 15% for any other dividend (Article 10 refers), and 10% for interest and royalties (Articles 11 and 12 refer). The limitation does not apply if the dividends, interest INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF THE DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH VIET NAM 12 or royalties are derived in connection with a permanent establishment in the source jurisdiction.  Income from independent personal services will be taxable only in the jurisdiction in which the individual performing the services is resident, unless (i) the individual has a fixed base in the source jurisdiction, or (ii) the individual is present in the source jurisdiction for the purpose of performing the services, for more than 183 days in any 12-month period. In such case, the services income may be taxed in both jurisdictions. (Article 14 refers.)  Income from employment will be taxable only in the jurisdiction in which the employee is resident unless the employee is present in the source jurisdiction for more than 183 days in a 12-month period, or the employer is a resident of the source jurisdiction (or is non-resident but the employee’s remuneration is borne by a permanent establishment in the source jurisdiction). In that case, the employment income may be taxed in both jurisdictions. (Article 15 refers.)  Pensions will be taxable only in the jurisdiction in which the recipient is resident. (Article 18 refers.) 5.3 A number of exceptions to the above rules also apply. These include:  Income from real property, including income from alienation of real property (referred to as “immovable property” in the Viet Nam DTA), will always be taxable in the jurisdiction where the property is situated, regardless of whether the residence country also has a taxing right. (Articles 6 and 13 refer.)  Profits of an enterprise from the operation or alienation of ships or aircraft in international traffic will be taxable only in the jurisdiction in which the enterprise is resident. However, profits from domestic carriage by ship or aircraft will be taxable in both jurisdictions. (Articles 8 and 13 refer.)  Directors’ fees will always be taxable in the jurisdiction in which the company paying the fees is resident, regardless of whether the country in which the director is resident also has a taxing right. (Article 16 refers.)  Income from the activities of entertainers and sportspersons will always be taxable in the source jurisdiction, regardless of whether the residence country also has a taxing right. (Article 17 refers.). If the visit is wholly or mainly supported by the public funds of either state, then it is taxable only in the residence country.  Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one jurisdiction will generally be exempt from tax in the other jurisdiction. (Article 19 refers.) 5.4 Where the allocation of taxing rights permits both jurisdictions to tax an item of income, the Viet Nam DTA will require New Zealand to relieve double taxation of its residents by allowing a credit for the tax paid in Viet Nam. (Article 22 refers.) This is consistent with the unilateral relief mechanism that already applies under New Zealand domestic law. The obligation also applies reciprocally, so Viet Nam must allow its residents a credit for New Zealand tax paid. 5.5 As noted above, the Viet Nam DTA includes tax-sparing provisions. These provisions, located at Article 22(3) to (5), require New Zealand to allow its residents to claim a foreign tax credit in certain circumstances, even though no tax has been paid in Viet Nam. The tax-sparing credits apply solely in the case of Vietnamese tax incentives that promote foreign investment for development purposes. They are designed to ensure that the tax incentives are not clawed back by New Zealand taxing its residents in full INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF THE DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH VIET NAM 13 (which would remove the incentive for New Zealanders to invest in the Vietnamese development areas). As noted above, anti-abuse rules have been built in to the tax-sparing provisions, to ensure that they are used appropriately. The tax-sparing provisions will also automatically terminate after a 10-year period. 5.6 The non-discrimination provision requires that New Zealand does not subject Viet Nam nationals to a greater tax burden than New Zealand nationals would be subject to in the same circumstances, in particular with regard to residence. (Article 23 refers.) This requirement applies to both taxation and connected requirements. Similar rules apply for permanent establishments, deductions and New Zealand companies that are wholly or partly owned or controlled by Viet Nam residents. This provision does not create an exception to the related-party dealing rules around interest or royalty payments, or associated party dealings. 5.7 In addition to the above obligations, New Zealand will be required to comply with various administrative requirements imposed by the Viet Nam DTA. These are as follows:  Mutual agreement procedure. New Zealand must comply with the procedures for settling disputes set out in the mutual agreement procedure article of the Viet Nam DTA. (Article 24 refers.) This is discussed below, in the section Dispute resolution.  Exchange of information. As discussed, the Viet Nam DTA includes an Article that provides for the exchange of tax-related information between tax authorities, for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax evasion and tax avoidance. New Zealand will be required to respond to requests for information from Viet Nam. If Inland Revenue receives a valid request, and if it does not already hold the requested information, it must use its information-gathering powers to obtain the information. Inland Revenue can similarly request information from Viet Nam. (Article 25 refers.) Dispute resolution 5.8 The Viet Nam DTA establishes a “mutual agreement procedure” for resolving disputes. Under this procedure, a taxpayer who considers that they have been taxed incorrectly under the treaty, including in transfer pricing cases, can approach their local tax authority under Article 24 to invoke a mutual agreement procedure. If the tax authority considers the case to be justified, and is unable to resolve the case through its own actions, it must approach the tax authority of the other jurisdiction to seek a bilateral resolution. This bipartisan approach is particularly appropriate in the tax treaty context because a single issue will generally affect a person’s tax position in both jurisdictions. The mutual agreement procedure is not a true disputes resolution mechanism, as the two sides are only obliged to “endeavour” to reach resolution. However, the taxpayer remains free to pursue a case through the courts (including if they do not agree with the decision reached under the mutual agreement procedure). 5.9 The mutual agreement procedure also authorises the tax authorities of the two jurisdictions to collectively resolve any difficulties or doubts about the correct interpretation or application of the Viet Nam DTA. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF THE DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH VIET NAM 14 Reservations 5.10 The Viet Nam DTA does not allow parties to make a reservation upon ratification. 4 6. Measures which the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including specific reference to implementing legislation 6.1 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the Viet Nam DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. However, the override relates only to tax matters, and applies only in respect of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993. 6.2 The override of the Inland Revenue Acts is necessary to give effect to the core provisions of the Viet Nam DTA, which may provide relief from tax that would otherwise be imposed under domestic law. The override of the Official Information Act is necessary to ensure that confidential communications with the other jurisdiction do not have to be disclosed. The override of the Privacy Act is necessary to ensure that information regarding natural persons can be exchanged according to the terms of the treaty. 6.3 Article 27 of the Viet Nam DTA provides for the agreement to be brought into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes between the Contracting States. The Viet Nam DTA will enter into force on the date of the last of these notes. New Zealand will be able to notify Viet Nam that all procedures required by domestic law have been completed once the Order in Council has entered into force, which will be 28 days after its publication in the New Zealand Gazette. 6.4 Thereafter, the provisions of the Viet Nam DTA will have effect from various dates, according to the terms of the DTA. In New Zealand, the provisions relating to withholding taxes will generally take effect on 1 January following the year of the date of entry into force. The provisions relating to other taxes will have effect for income years beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year following the year in which the DTA enters into force. 6.5 As an alternative to the above Order in Council mechanism, the Viet Nam DTA could be given legislative effect by means of the enactment of a dedicated statute. However, this option would unnecessarily increase the amount of primary tax legislation, and is therefore not preferred. 7. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 7.1 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. 7.2 As already noted, the overall economic effects of the Viet Nam DTA are expected to be favourable to New Zealand. This is because the DTA can be expected to encourage growth in economic activity, and to assist Inland Revenue to detect and prevent tax evasion and tax avoidance. 8. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 8.1 New Zealand will forgo some revenue from the limitation of its taxing rights, as outlined above. This will mean that New Zealand will not be able to tax some income that 4 Reservations typically only feature in multilateral treaties. When permitted, they effectively enable a party to specify which treaty obligations they are committing to. However, reservations typically do not feature in bilateral treaties. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF THE DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH VIET NAM 15 is currently taxed under domestic law, and that the rate of tax that can be imposed on certain other income will be reduced. 8.2 This revenue cost will include tax forgone in relation to short-term activities of Vietnamese residents in New Zealand, which the DTA will exempt from New Zealand tax. It may also reflect reduced tax on royalties derived from New Zealand by residents of Viet Nam, in respect of which the DTA will restrict withholding tax rates to 10% (the domestic law rate being 15%). There may also be some revenue cost from reduced withholding tax rates on dividends and interest derived from New Zealand by residents of Viet Nam, although that tax is already largely relieved under domestic law. 8.3 Because investment flows from Viet Nam to New Zealand are currently low, investment returns paid from New Zealand to Viet Nam in the form of dividends, interest and royalties are correspondingly low. The prima facie revenue cost to New Zealand is therefore expected to be negligible. 8.4 Viet Nam will be similarly constrained in terms of the tax it can impose on income derived by residents of New Zealand. This reduced foreign tax will tend to flow through to the New Zealand tax base through a reduction in credits for foreign tax paid. In addition, the exchange of information provisions of the DTA will enhance our ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. 8.5 Finally, the DTA will generally give rise to favourable economic benefits (such as increased trade and investment). To the extent that the cost to the New Zealand revenue is not fully offset by the factors mentioned above, we would expect that the economic benefits of the DTA will outweigh the costs. 8.6 The tax sparing provisions of the DTA are not expected to give rise to specific costs. This is because of recent changes to New Zealand’s international tax rules that generally result in foreign dividends received by New Zealand companies no longer being taxed. As discussed, the tax sparing provisions will terminate after a ten-year period. 8.7 The exchange of information provisions of the Viet Nam DTA will result in some administrative costs for Inland Revenue, arising from the need to respond to requests for information from Viet Nam. Based on previous experience, the numbers of requests are not expected to be significant. If requests are received, Inland Revenue already has efficient systems in place for administering the exchange of information provisions of New Zealand’s other 37 DTAs and 10 Tax Information Exchange Agreements in force, and the additional costs will be marginal. 8.8 Compliance costs for New Zealand businesses are expected to be reduced under the Viet Nam DTA. This is because New Zealand businesses will have clear guidance about when they will be liable for tax on activities in Viet Nam, in line with internationally recognised norms. 9. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 9.1 The Treasury, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, were consulted about the terms of the Viet Nam DTA and the content of this extended National Interest Analysis, and agree with its analysis and conclusions. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF THE DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH VIET NAM 16 10. Subsequent Protocols and/or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 10.1 The Viet Nam DTA does not expressly set out the process for amendments to the agreement, but amendments are typically made by negotiating an amending Protocol. New Zealand will consider any future amendments on a case-by-case basis. Future amendments will be subject to New Zealand’s normal domestic approvals and procedures for DTAs. 10.2 Only one future amendment to the DTA is currently contemplated. Article V of the Protocol to the Viet Nam DTA is a most-favoured-nation obligation that applies to Viet Nam. It provides that if, in any future DTA, Viet Nam agrees to extend the scope of the exchange-of-information article to taxes not otherwise covered by the DTA, it will enter into negotiations with New Zealand with a view to providing a similar extension of scope to New Zealand. 11. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 11.1 Under Article 28 of the Viet Nam DTA, five years from the date of entry into force, either party may terminate the agreement by giving notice of termination through diplomatic channels. This is the same approach taken in New Zealand’s other DTAs. 12. Agency Disclosure Statement Inland Revenue has prepared this extended NIA. Inland Revenue has analysed the issue of implementing the new DTA between Viet Nam and New Zealand, and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. As part of that process, Inland Revenue considered the option of not entering into the treaty. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. 12.2 The allocation of taxing rights under the Viet Nam DTA is consistent with the New Zealand negotiating model, which in turn is based on the OECD’s Model Tax Convention. Although the revenue cost to New Zealand as a result of the allocation of taxing rights under the DTA cannot be accurately measured, Inland Revenue estimates that the revenue cost to New Zealand as a result of the allocation of taxing rights will be negligible. 12.3 The tax sparing mechanism agreed with Viet Nam represents a potential risk. The mechanism therefore has a potential cost to New Zealand. The tax sparing mechanism could be seen as potentially creating a precedent that may lead to other developing countries seeking a similar provision. However, that precedent already exists. (Six 5 of New Zealand’s existing DTAs contain tax sparing provisions.) Moreover, the mechanism has been narrowly crafted, contains an anti-abuse rule, and will terminate after a ten-year period. 12.4 An Order in Council will be required to give the new DTA effect in New Zealand law. The Order in Council will override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993; this is authorised by section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and is necessary to give effect to the terms of the new DTA. 12.5 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Treasury, have been consulted about the terms of the Viet Nam DTA and the content of this extended NIA, and no concerns were raised. 5 A DTA has also been signed with Papua New Guinea, which includes tax sparing provisions. Once that agreement enters into force the number will increase to seven. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF THE DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH VIET NAM 17 12.6 Inland Revenue’s view is that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on business interests; nor impair private property rights, market competition, or the incentives for business to innovate and invest; nor override fundamental common law principles.

Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, Amended by the 2010 Protocol Report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Contents Recommendation 2  Appendix A 3  Appendix B 4  MULTILATERAL CONVENTION ON MUTUAL ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE IN TAX MATTERS 2 Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, Amended by the 2010 Protocol Recommendation The Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, Amended by the 2010 Protocol, and recommends that the House take note of its report. The Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters authorises the tax authorities of the signatory countries to assist each other regarding the exchange of information, unpaid tax recovery, and service of documents. It provides a means of significantly increasing New Zealand’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and evasion without the cost and resources that would be required for a bilateral agreement. New Zealand is one of 54 countries that have signed the convention. New Zealand has existing tax treaties with 27 of the signatory countries. We note that as a signatory, New Zealand has some mechanisms available to avoid working with particular countries should it wish. It can oppose other countries’ entrance into the convention, and it can also refuse information requests, for example on human rights grounds. There are also safeguards in the convention: a country does not have to comply with a request if it is at a variance with that country’s law, for example, or if the request will lead to discrimination. We have no other matters to bring to the attention to the House. The national interest analysis for the convention is appended to this report. MULTILATERAL CONVENTION ON MUTUAL ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE IN TAX MATTERS 3 Appendix A Committee procedure The international treaty examination of the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Tax Matters, Amended by the 2010 Protocol, was referred to the committee on 14 June 2013. We met on 1 August and 8 August 2013 to consider the agreement, and we heard evidence from the Inland Revenue Department. Committee members John Hayes (Chairperson) Hon Phil Goff Dr Kennedy Graham Hon Tau Henare Dr Paul Hutchison Su’a William Sio Lindsay Tisch MULTILATERAL CONVENTION ON MUTUAL ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE IN TAX MATTERS 4 Appendix B National Interest Analysis Executive summary 1. New Zealand signed the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, as amended by the 2010 Protocol (the Convention) on 26 October 2012. Once the Convention enters into force for New Zealand, it will enable Inland Revenue to engage in the following forms of cooperation on tax matters with the tax authorities of other signatory countries:  exchange of information;  assistance in recovery of tax; and  service of documents 2. Exchange of information treaty arrangements enable tax authorities to assist each other in the detection and prevention of tax evasion and tax avoidance. In the absence of exchange of information arrangements, tax authorities is more limited in verifying whether activities and income conducted or derived offshore have been correctly reported for tax purposes. New Zealand has been entering into exchange of information arrangements bilaterally in double tax agreements (DTAs) since 1947 and in tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) since 2008. Fifty-five DTAs and TIEAs have been signed to date. New Zealand therefore has considerable experience in administering exchange of information treaty provisions. 3. Similarly, assistance in recovery treaty arrangements enable tax authorities to assist each other in recovering unpaid taxes from absconding taxpayers. In the absence of exchange of information arrangements, tax authorities generally cannot recover unpaid taxes from a person who resides offshore. New Zealand has been entering into assistance in recovery arrangements bilaterally in DTAs since 2004 and currently has five such arrangements in force. 4. Assistance in the service of documents is essentially intended to support assistance in recovery, by ensuring that documents such as notices of assessment or reminders actually reach the taxpayer concerned. New Zealand has no experience in this form of assistance. However, international experience indicates that, in practice, service of documents is of itself successful in resulting in payment of unpaid tax. 5. In 1988, the Convention opened for signature by member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and of the Council of Europe. In 2010, the Convention was amended to enable any country (not just OECD or Council of Europe member countries) to sign. This development means that there are clear advantages to OECD member countries signing the Convention – in particular, networks of assistance arrangements can be extended without the time-consuming and expensive process of negotiating and bringing into force bilateral DTAs and TIEAs. Signing the Convention will also demonstrate New Zealand’s commitment to tax cooperation. MULTILATERAL CONVENTION ON MUTUAL ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE IN TAX MATTERS 5 6. Signing the convention will require New Zealand to contribute to the OECD’s annual costs of maintaining a coordinating body to oversee the Convention. The OECD advises that the annual contribution is approximately 5,000 euros per annum. This cost will be met by Inland Revenue from within existing baselines. 7. The text of the Convention is attached as Annex A. A schedule of the countries that have signed the Convention to date is attached as Annex B. Nature and timing of the proposed treaty action 8. The Convention was signed by New Zealand on 26 October 2012. After completing all domestic procedures for the ratification, New Zealand will deposit with the Secretary-General of the OECD 1 an instrument of ratification expressing its intention to be bound by the provisions of the Convention. The Convention will enter into force for New Zealand three months after the deposit of the instrument of ratification. The procedures relating to signature, ratification and entry into force are set out at Article 28 of the Convention. 9. Before ratification, the Convention must go through the Parliamentary treaty examination process and must be incorporated into New Zealand domestic law (by means of an Order in Council made pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007). 10. Given that the Inland Revenue Acts 2 are currently drafted in contemplation of bilateral tax treaties, some minor legislative amendments may need to be made to provisions of those Acts to ensure that they will operate correctly in the context of a multilateral treaty. 11. It is expected that these steps will be completed, and that the Convention will enter into force for New Zealand, by mid-2013. Reasons for New Zealand becoming party to the treaty International developments 12. The OECD website describes the Convention as follows: “The Convention facilitates international co-operation for a better operation of national tax laws, while respecting the fundamental rights of taxpayers. The Convention provides for all possible forms of administrative co-operation between states in the assessment and collection of taxes, in particular with a view to combating tax avoidance and evasion.” Three forms of cooperation in tax matters can be established under the Convention:  exchange of information;  assistance in recovery of tax; and  service of documents. 13. In the absence of a treaty for cooperation in tax matters, tax authorities are generally constrained by the international principle that countries do not assist each other in the enforcement of tax laws. The New Zealand courts have confirmed that this principle 1 Pursuant to Article 2(3) of the Convention, the Secretary-General of the OECD is one of two official depositaries. The other is the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe. 2 The Inland Revenue Acts are the Acts administered by Inland Revenue. They are listed in a schedule to the Tax Administration Act 1994. MULTILATERAL CONVENTION ON MUTUAL ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE IN TAX MATTERS 6 applies in New Zealand. 3 The secrecy provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994 also effectively limit cooperation on tax matters with other jurisdictions unless authorised by a treaty 4 . 14. However, New Zealand, like most countries, taxes its residents on their worldwide income (that is, on all income, whether derived from New Zealand or elsewhere). Globalisation has increasingly removed many of the obstacles to cross-border exchanges of goods and services and to the movement of persons, technology and capital. Residents therefore have considerable scope for conducting business and other income-earning activities in other jurisdictions. The particular benefit of a treaty for cooperation in tax matters is that it empowers tax authorities to ensure that their residents are correctly reporting all worldwide income and activities, and to facilitate improved collection of unpaid tax from absconding taxpayers. 15. Most developed countries, and many developing countries, have therefore for many years been building networks of treaty arrangements that provide for cooperation between tax authorities. The OECD has taken a lead role internationally in promoting such cooperation, and in developing treaty mechanisms and guidelines to ensure that the cooperation is effective. The traditional instrument promoted by the OECD for this purpose is the (bilateral) double tax agreement (DTA). 5 However, DTAs are complex technical agreements that deal with a wide range of tax issues other than cooperation, and they are time-consuming, resource-intensive and expensive to negotiate, bring into force and maintain. 16. In 1988, the OECD and Council of Europe jointly developed the Convention as a multilateral alternative for OECD and Council of Europe member countries. However, it was largely ignored at the time, for a number of reasons, including the fact that OECD and European countries already had substantive networks of bilateral DTAs in place between them, and bilateral DTAs tended to be preferred because they provided a range of benefits in addition to tax cooperation. In addition, assistance in recovery provisions generally only started featuring in DTAs from 2003, and so in 1988 they were relatively novel (particularly for non-European Union countries). Many countries (including New Zealand) preferred to see how well the multilateral approach to tax cooperation worked for other countries before committing themselves to it. 17. International concerns over lack of exchange of information have been building for some time. Because DTAs are generally only appropriate for major trading and investment partners, and the Convention was only open to signature by OECD and Council of Europe member countries, the OECD in 2001 developed the tax information exchange agreement (TIEA). It was intended that this instrument, which, unlike a DTA, deals only with exchange of information, could be used to establish bilateral cooperation arrangements with jurisdictions such as tax havens. However, a number of jurisdictions, including tax havens, were generally reluctant to enter into such agreements. 3 Connor v Connor \[1974\] 1 NZLR 632. 4 Section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 imposes the requirement to maintain secrecy. Section 86 of the Act contains the exception for treaty authorisation. 5 The OECD’s “Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital” forms of the basis of most DTAs entered into worldwide, and the OECD has also produced a comprehensive commentary with a view to ensuring uniform interpretation and application of DTA provisions. The UN has also produced a model tax convention. However, apart from a few departures that give a more favourable allocation of taxing rights to developing countries in some key areas, the UN model largely adopts the OECD model tax convention. MULTILATERAL CONVENTION ON MUTUAL ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE IN TAX MATTERS 7 18. The international concerns over lack of exchange of information were brought to a head by the recent global financial crisis. At the same time as governments faced declining tax revenue, many found themselves bailing out financial institutions that had been using schemes involving unregulated offshore finance centres to deprive those very governments of tax revenue. In addition, a number of scandals broke in the media that revealed significant levels of tax evasion by (often high-profile) individuals using international finance centres. A key contributing factor in these problems was lack of exchange of information in tax matters by the jurisdictions in which those international finance centres were located. 19. This resulted in an intense international focus on requiring a change of stance from international finance centres, tax havens and other jurisdictions that had previously refused to cooperate on exchange of information. The G20 led this action. G20 leaders made clear statements that they will deploy sanctions against non-complying jurisdictions. In addition, the G20 established an international organisation, the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of information for Tax Purposes (the Global Forum), to conduct peer reviews of countries to ensure compliance. In response, virtually all international finance centres, tax havens and other “secrecy” jurisdictions have now committed to what is known as the “international standard for transparency and exchange of information in tax matters”. 20. Building appropriate treaty networks is a key aspect of implementing the international standard. However, building treaty networks on a bilateral basis can be a time- consuming, resource-intensive, expensive and (particularly for smaller jurisdictions) onerous process. This has renewed interest in the Convention as a means for countries to quickly establish and/or expand their treaty networks. In 2010, the Convention was updated to ensure that it reflects the latest developments to the international standard, and it was also opened to signature by all countries (not just OECD and Council of Europe member countries). The OECD has requested all of its member countries to sign the Convention as quickly as possible. This would send an appropriate signal about the commitment of all OECD member countries to the international standard. It would also ensure that non-OECD jurisdictions that sign the Convention can be assured of establishing a wide network of assistance arrangements with developed countries at a single stroke. A total of 38 countries (including 24 OECD member countries) have signed the Convention to date, with many more expected to sign. Australia signed the Convention in November 2011. New Zealand’s position 21. Inland Revenue has long experience in administering bilateral treaties for cooperation in tax matters, but has no previous experience in entering into multilateral tax conventions as these are unusual internationally. The Legal Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which advises on and oversees all New Zealand treaty actions, has therefore been closely consulted in respect of, and agrees with, the proposal for New Zealand to sign the Convention. 22. Reflecting New Zealand’s experience in administering treaty arrangements for cooperation in tax matters, Inland Revenue has a very active exchange of information work programme. We have been entering into exchange of information arrangements since 1947 (and have signed 37 DTAs and 18 TIEAs) and into assistance in recovery arrangements since 2004 (with five arrangements currently in force – four in DTAs and another in a stand-alone bilateral tax recovery convention). These treaty provisions are all administered by Inland Revenue. MULTILATERAL CONVENTION ON MUTUAL ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE IN TAX MATTERS 8 23. Reflecting the general international experience, Inland Revenue has found exchange of information provisions to be critical to its efforts to detect and prevent tax evasion and tax avoidance. A number of court decisions have examined and upheld key aspects of New Zealand’s exchange of information policy and practice. Both internationally and in New Zealand, assistance in recovery provisions have proven to be very effective in ensuring that absconding taxpayers pay unpaid taxes. 24. However, cooperation treaties can be concluded only with jurisdictions that are willing to engage in such cooperation. Inland Revenue therefore strongly supports the international initiatives to ensure other countries’ full compliance with the international standard. In general, signing the Convention is one way in which New Zealand can demonstrate its commitment and support to those international efforts. 25. Conversely, failure to sign the Convention may send a signal that New Zealand does not support the current international initiatives to promote exchange of information and other forms of cooperation. Only ten OECD countries (including New Zealand) are yet to sign the Convention. If it does not sign the Convention, New Zealand risks being seen as unsupportive of the international approach to countering tax evasion and tax avoidance. 26. A key practical benefit for New Zealand of ratifying the Convention is a reduction in the future resource and administrative costs of having to negotiate new bilateral treaties or update existing ones. More specifically:  Where New Zealand has no existing DTA or TIEA Of the 38 countries that have signed the Convention to date, 14 are countries with which we do not currently have a DTA or TIEA. Becoming party to the Convention will therefore significantly expand New Zealand’s network of assistance arrangements. As other countries sign the Convention, our network will continue to expand accordingly.  Where New Zealand has an existing DTA In respect of those countries that have signed the Convention, and with which New Zealand already has a DTA in place, in 18 cases New Zealand can ensure that its existing exchange of information arrangements in those DTAs are upgraded to the latest international standard (given that the Convention represents the most up- to-date and prescriptive wording).  Where New Zealand has no existing assistance in recovery arrangements Given that only a limited number of New Zealand’s DTAs, and none of its TIEAs, provide for cooperation in tax matters other than in the form of exchange of information, New Zealand can effectively update those existing treaty agreements to include assistance in recovery and service of documents without any need to negotiate amendments. 27. Note that where New Zealand already has exchange of information and/or assistance in recovery under an existing bilateral treaty, the OECD multilateral treaty will in some cases result in a second exchange of information and/or assistance in recovery mechanism. However, this duplication of mechanisms in place would not create problems. In practice, information could be exchanged under either treaty instrument. MULTILATERAL CONVENTION ON MUTUAL ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE IN TAX MATTERS 9 Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force and not entering into force for New Zealand Exchange of information 28. In the absence of exchange of information, Inland Revenue is more limited in investigating commercial and financial transactions conducted in other jurisdictions and to verify whether taxpayers are correctly reporting income-earning activities conducted in those jurisdictions. Exchange of information arrangements in a treaty enable Inland Revenue, when auditing or investigating the tax affairs of a particular taxpayer, to request information from the tax authority of the treaty-partner jurisdiction. The requested tax authority is then obliged under the treaty to use its information-gathering powers to obtain the requested information and to provide it to Inland Revenue. 29. Any information that is foreseeably relevant to the tax enquiry can form the subject of the request, but in practice the three most common forms of requested information are:  accounting information (such as books of account, contracts and invoices);  financial information (such as bank account transactions); and  ownership information (that is, information on the legal and beneficial ownership of commercial and legal entities). 30. Given the personal and commercial nature of much of the information held by tax authorities, strict secrecy rules typically apply to ensure that such information is not divulged to the wider community. 6 Exchange of information arrangements override such secrecy rules but contain within themselves a number of safeguards to ensure that exchanged information is only disclosed to authorise persons, and is only used for authorised purposes. 31. As noted above, Inland Revenue has a long history (over 60 years) of applying exchange of information treaty arrangements in practice. It currently has signed 55 treaty arrangements for exchange of information, and a number of court decisions have confirmed key aspects of Inland Revenue’s exchange of information policy and practice. Inland Revenue has a very active exchange of information programme, and it therefore now has considerable experience to draw upon in evaluating the benefits of exchange of information. That experience clearly shows that exchange of information is an effective tool in the detection and prevention of tax evasion and tax avoidance. It also shows that the benefits of being able to obtain information from other countries far outweigh the costs of complying with the reciprocal treaty obligation to obtain and provide information to other countries. 32. Given the growing importance of exchange of information internationally, treaty arrangements between developed countries have developed to encompass forms of exchange of information other than on request. Such other forms of information exchange include:  automatic exchanges (in which tax authorities agree to provide certain generic types of information such as non-resident withholding tax deducted from interest payments): 6 Inland Revenue, as noted above, is subject to comprehensive secrecy rules pursuant to section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. MULTILATERAL CONVENTION ON MUTUAL ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE IN TAX MATTERS 10  spontaneous exchanges (in which a tax authority will pass on information uncovered during an investigation that it considers of interest to the other tax authority):  the conduct of simultaneous tax examinations (in which, for example, two tax authorities will investigate the affairs of a multi-national company at the same time, and share the information discovered):  and industry-wide exchanges. 33. Taxpayers who are intent on undertaking tax evasion or tax avoidance can generally be expected to attempt to exploit gaps in the network. Therefore, it is clear that the wider the network of exchange of information arrangements that a country has in place, the more effective it will be in defeating tax evasion and tax avoidance. As noted above, of the 38 countries that have signed the Convention to date, 14 are countries with which New Zealand does not have existing exchange of information arrangements. Signing the Convention will therefore enable New Zealand to widen its network by a factor of around 25 percent, without having to undertake separate negotiations with individual countries. As additional countries sign the Convention, the New Zealand network will continue to expand. 34. The international focus on exchange of information during the last decade resulted in the OECD updating its standard wording for treaty provisions, to ensure that they are sufficiently prescriptive so as to operate effectively. The new standard OECD wording was then adopted by the United Nations (UN). When the Convention was amended in 2010, to open it up for signature by all countries, the wording of the exchange of information provisions was also upgraded to the latest OECD and UN wording. A particular advantage for New Zealand in signing the Convention is that, even where bilateral exchange of information arrangements are already in place under a DTA, in 18 of those cases the arrangements will be updated to the international standard without any need to negotiate amendments to DTAs. 35. The only identifiable disadvantages of signing the Convention are that New Zealand will be required to respond to requests for assistance from other countries and will be required to contribute annually toward the OECD’s cost of maintaining a co-ordinating body to oversee the Convention. The OECD advises that this cost is around 5,000 euros per annum. 36. In respect of the first of these items, Inland Revenue already has 55 exchange of information treaty arrangements, has considerable experience in processing requests made under those arrangements, and has efficient systems in place. The administrative costs of processing additional requests under the Convention are therefore expected to be minimal. 37. In respect of the annual contribution, the cost will be met by Inland Revenue from within existing baselines. For New Zealand, the on-going annual cost is expected to be offset by on-going benefits in terms of reduced tax evasion and tax avoidance and improved collection of unpaid taxes. In addition, signing the Convention will provide an upfront benefit to New Zealand from the reduced need to negotiate and give effect to DTA amendments and TIEAs in respect of mutual assistance. Other forms of assistance 38. Assistance in recovery provisions enable a tax authority to ask the tax authority in a treaty-partner country to use its debt-collection powers to collect unpaid tax from an MULTILATERAL CONVENTION ON MUTUAL ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE IN TAX MATTERS 11 absconding taxpayer. For example, New Zealand already has assistance in recovery provisions in place in its DTA with Australia. If a New Zealand taxpayer moves to Australia and leaves behind an unpaid tax debt, Inland Revenue can ask the Australian Taxation Office to use its debt-recovery powers to collect the debt on our behalf and to remit the payment back to New Zealand. 39. Assistance in recovery provisions have some history within the European Union, but for most countries only began being commonly adopted within the last ten years (usually in DTAs). New Zealand entered into its first assistance in recovery arrangement in 2004 and now has five such arrangements in place. Because this form of assistance is relatively novel, it has taken some time to build up experience of this arrangement working in practice. The experience gleaned to date, both from the operation of New Zealand’s assistance in recovery provisions and as generally advised by other countries, is that it works very well in practice. In many cases, writing to an absconding taxpayer to advise that assistance in recovery provisions will be invoked has proven to be sufficient by itself to elicit immediate payment. When the provisions are actually invoked, the process of collecting the unpaid tax has worked extremely well. 40. Assistance in the service of documents is essentially intended to support assistance in recovery. It can be used to ensure that documents such as notices of assessment or reminders actually reach the taxpayer concerned. This ensures that enforcement steps are not taken against a taxpayer who is genuinely ignorant of the tax claim. New Zealand has no experience in this form of assistance. However, international experience indicates that, in practice, service of documents is of itself successful in resulting in payment of unpaid tax. 41. A key advantage of signing the Convention is that New Zealand, which currently has only a modest network of assistance in recovery arrangements, and no service of documents arrangements, can significantly widen its network without any need to renegotiate amendments to existing DTAs. 42. The only identifiable disadvantage of signing the Convention is that New Zealand will be required to respond to requests for assistance from other countries. Again, Inland Revenue has experience in processing such requests and has efficient systems in place. In addition, as noted above, international and New Zealand experience to date is that large numbers of requests do not need to be made. The administrative costs of processing additional requests under the Convention are expected to be marginal and will be met by Inland Revenue within existing baselines. Wider (international) considerations 43. New Zealand is an OECD member country. Although there is no legal obligation on New Zealand to support OECD initiatives, in this case New Zealand does strongly support the initiative to promote cooperation between tax authorities. (It is in New Zealand’s overall interests that other jurisdictions, which have traditionally opposed effective exchange of information, will enter into exchange of information arrangements with us.) The act of signing the Convention will provide a positive signal of that support to the international community. 44. The advantages outlined above for the treaty entering into force outweigh the identified disadvantages. Accordingly, it is in New Zealand’s overall interests to enter into the treaty. MULTILATERAL CONVENTION ON MUTUAL ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE IN TAX MATTERS 12 Legal obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position in respect of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms 45. The obligations that will arise under the Convention will fall on Inland Revenue. The Convention will not give rise to obligations for taxpayers or for other Government agencies. 46. The key obligation that will be imposed on Inland Revenue under the Convention will be to respond to requests for assistance from other signatory countries as they arise. In the case of a request for information, if Inland Revenue does not already hold the information, it will be obliged to use its information-gathering powers to obtain and forward that information to the treaty-partner country in a timely manner. Similarly, for assistance in recovery requests, Inland Revenue will be obliged to use its debt-recovery powers to collect unpaid tax debt and to forward the payments to the treaty-partner country. Service of documents likewise involves an obligation on Inland Revenue to use its powers to ensure that tax notices and legal documents are served on relevant taxpayers. 47. As noted, Inland Revenue already has considerable experience in all forms of exchange of information and has in recent years been building experience in assistance in recovery. As a result, efficient systems for responding to incoming requests for assistance have been developed. Therefore, although entering into treaty arrangements for cooperation in tax matters gives rise to obligations on New Zealand to respond to incoming requests, the administrative costs imposed on Inland Revenue when responding to those requests have not been onerous. The additional obligations that would arise from signing the Convention are expected to be minimal. 48. A subsidiary obligation that will arise under the Convention is for Inland Revenue to maintain strict confidentiality in respect of the information that it may obtain under the exchange of information provisions of the treaty. Such information may only be disclosed to authorised persons, and only for authorised purposes. This obligation already applies to Inland Revenue under domestic law (section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994). 49. The exchange of information is the core form of assistance established under the Convention and cannot be reserved against. The other forms of assistance – assistance in recovery and service of documents, set out in Article 30(1) – can be reserved against, but I understand that in practice very few countries are entering such reservations. New Zealand does not intend to make any significant reservations at the time of ratification. 50. The Convention does not contain a dispute-resolution provision. 51. Signature of the Convention by New Zealand will not give rise to obligations to or in respect of the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau. Measures which the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including specific reference to implementing legislation 52. As is currently the case for DTAs and TIEAs, the provisions of the Convention will need to be given the force of law in New Zealand. 53. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 authorises the making of an Order in Council that ensures that assistance arrangements in a DTA will have effect despite anything in the Inland Revenue Acts or in certain other prescribed Acts. (Such an override is necessary, for example, to ensure that Inland Revenue’s strict secrecy provisions do not become an obstacle to the exchange of information.) The reference to “double tax MULTILATERAL CONVENTION ON MUTUAL ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE IN TAX MATTERS 13 agreement” in section BH 1 expressly extends to other bilateral treaties, such as TIEAs (by virtue of its definition). However, section BH 1 does not contemplate (and therefore may not authorise) entering into arrangements for assistance in tax matters in a multilateral context. 54. A review is currently being undertaken to determine whether section BH 1 needs to be amended to enable it to apply to the Convention. Options being considered are (i) whether to extend the section BH 1 Order-in-Council-making power to ensure that it applies to the Convention, or (ii) to expressly refer to the Convention in section BH 1 without any need for a subsequent Order in Council. Other consequential amendments to other aspects of the Inland Revenue Acts may be needed to ensure that the Convention’s provisions will continue to work correctly. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 55. No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. 56. The overall economic effects are expected to be favourable. The Convention will enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax evasion and tax avoidance and to collect unpaid tax from absconding taxpayers. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 57. The Convention will not impose any fiscal costs on New Zealand or compliance costs on taxpayers, other than an annual contribution to the OECD’s cost of maintaining a coordinating body to oversee the Convention. The OECD advises that the annual contribution is approximately 5,000 euros per annum. This cost will be met by Inland Revenue from within existing baselines. 58. The Convention will also give rise to administrative costs for Inland Revenue, in complying with requests for assistance by other countries. However, as noted, New Zealand has experience in dealing with such requests and has efficient systems in place. The additional administrative costs from requests that will arise under the Convention are expected to be marginal and will be met by Inland Revenue from within existing baselines. Subsequent protocols and/or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 59. As noted above, the Convention was amended by the OECD in 2010 (to open it to signature by all countries, and to upgrade the wording of the exchange of information provisions to the latest international standard). No further protocols are envisaged. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 60. The Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty action. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 61. Article 31 of the Convention provides that any party may, at any time, denounce the Convention by means of a notification addressed to one of the depositaries. (The official depositaries are the Secretaries-General, respectively, of the OECD and of the Council of Europe.) Denunciation becomes effective on the first day of the month following the expiration of a period of three months after the date of receipt of the notification by the depositary. MULTILATERAL CONVENTION ON MUTUAL ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE IN TAX MATTERS 14 62. Any party that denounces the Convention remains bound by the obligation to maintain confidentiality in respect of all information that it has received from treaty-partner countries. Agency disclosure statement 63. Inland Revenue has prepared this extended national interest analysis. It has undertaken an analysis of the issue of implementing the Convention, and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. It has considered all other relevant options in that process, including the option of not signing the Convention. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. 64. New Zealand has long experience in administering bilateral treaty arrangements for cooperation in tax matters, but has no previous experience in entering into multilateral tax conventions as these are unusual internationally. The Legal Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, that has expertise in respect of multilateral treaties and which advises on and oversees all New Zealand treaty actions, has therefore been closely consulted in respect of, and agrees with, the proposal for New Zealand to sign the Convention. 65. Signing the Convention will result in a requirement for New Zealand to contribute annually toward the OECD’s cost of maintaining a co-ordinating body to oversee the Convention. The OECD advises that this cost is around 5,000 euros per annum. This cost will be met by Inland Revenue from within existing baselines. For New Zealand, the on- going annual cost is expected to be offset by on-going benefits in terms of reduced tax evasion and tax avoidance and improved collection of unpaid taxes. In addition, signing the Convention will provide an upfront benefit to New Zealand from the reduced need to negotiate and give effect to DTA amendments and TIEAs in respect of mutual assistance. 66. There is a question whether and specific legislative amendment in respect of the implementation of a multilateral treaty is needed. DTAs and TIEAs are implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Order in Council; this is authorised by section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The Order in Council provides that the DTA and TIEA provisions will override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993; this is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA or Protocol. The provisions of the Convention will similarly need to be implemented into New Zealand domestic law. A review is currently being conducted to determine whether section BH 1 will also enable an Order in Council to be made in respect of the Convention. If not, a legislative amendment will first need to be made to section BH 1. 67. Inland Revenue is of the view that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on businesses; impair private property rights or market competition; adversely impact the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest; or override fundamental common principles.

On 6 November 2012, New Zealand signed the Third Protocol Amending The Convention Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of Malaysia For The Avoidance Of Double Taxation And The Prevention Of Fiscal Evasion With Respect To Taxes On Income (the Third Protocol). 2. Exchange of information provisions are designed to enable tax administrations to assist each other in the detection and prevention of tax evasion and tax avoidance. For example, a tax administration which wishes to confirm that a particular taxpayer has correctly reported income earned in a foreign jurisdiction, or which is investigating a suspected tax avoidance structure, can request relevant records (business books and accounts, bank information, ownership information, and other tax related information) from the other country. If the requested tax authority does not itself hold the information, it is required under the DTA to use its information gathering powers to obtain the information and to forward it to the requesting country. 3. The Third Protocol updates exchange of information provisions of the 1976 double tax agreement between New Zealand and Malaysia, to take into account international developments in the prevailing international standard for exchange of information. In particular, the updated provisions will now prohibit interference by bank secrecy laws. New Zealand does not have bank secrecy laws. Malaysia does not have bank secrecy laws generally, but it has established the Island of Labuan as an international finance centre which is protected by bank secrecy laws. 4. The Third Protocol will facilitate more effective exchange of information between New Zealand and Malaysia, by enabling Inland Revenue to request and obtain information that previously may have been unobtainable by view of Malaysia’s bank secrecy laws. Nature and timing of proposed binding treaty action 5. The Third Protocol Amending The Convention Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of Malaysia For The Avoidance Of Double Taxation And The Prevention Of Fiscal Evasion With Respect To Taxes On Income (the Third Protocol) was signed on 6 November 2012. 6. The proposed binding treaty action is to bring the Third Protocol into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirm the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force by each country, pursuant to Article 2 of the Third Protocol. PROTOCOL TO DOUBLE TAX AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE NEW ZEALAND AND MALAYSIA 5 Reasons for New Zealand to become a Party to the treaty 7. The purpose of the Third Protocol is to update the Exchange of Information Article in their 1976 DTA with New Zealand to the new international standard for full and unrestricted exchange of information. Double tax agreements (DTAs) are bilateral international treaties that are principally designed to encourage growth in economic ties between countries. DTAs encourage growth in economic ties by reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment. More specifically they provide greater certainty of tax treatment, eliminate double taxation, reduce withholding taxes on cross-border investment returns, and exempt certain short-term activities in the host state from income tax. 8. For tax administrations, the Exchange of Information Article of a DTA is a key feature. It enables tax authorities to assist each other in the in the detection and prevention of tax evasion and tax avoidance. For example, a tax administration which wishes to confirm that a particular taxpayer has correctly reported income earned in a foreign jurisdiction, or which is investigating a suspected tax avoidance structure, can request relevant records (business books and accounts, bank information, ownership information, and other tax related information) from the other country. If the requested tax authority does not itself hold the information, it is required under the DTA to use its information gathering powers to obtain the information and to forward it to the requesting country. 9. DTA provisions generally override domestic law. However, DTA Exchange of Information Articles typically contain a proviso that “In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation ... to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State”. This proviso is included for sound reasons (principally to protect the rights and safeguards accorded to persons under domestic law). However, it leaves open a loophole that countries can exploit by introducing legislation that blocks the effective exchange of information in key areas. Because of the above proviso in our DTAs, the Exchange of Information Article is then defeated in that it cannot override such domestic legislation. 10. In recent years, the importance of effective exchange of information has received increasing international attention. This has resulted in concerns being raised, in particular, with regard to bank secrecy rules and domestic tax interest rules. “Bank secrecy” laws prohibit the disclosure of bank information to revenue and other regulatory authorities. “Domestic tax interest” laws prohibit a tax authority from using its information gathering powers in response to requests for information from a DTA partner unless that tax authority itself has an interest in obtaining that information. 11. In response, in 2003, the OECD updated the Exchange of Information Article in its model tax convention to specifically override bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules. The 2003 wording of the OECD Exchange of Information Article is now referred to as “the new international standard for full and unrestricted exchange of information”. 12. Malaysia does not have general bank secrecy laws, but it has established the Island of Labuan as an international finance centre which is protected by bank secrecy laws. However, Malaysia has now agreed to update the Exchange of Information Article in their 1976 DTA with New Zealand to the new international standard for full and unrestricted exchange of information. PROTOCOL TO DOUBLE TAX AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE NEW ZEALAND AND MALAYSIA 6 Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force and not entering into force for New Zealand 13. The Third Protocol will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from Malaysia, in particular, from the Island of Labuan. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 14. New Zealand does not have bank secrecy or domestic tax interest rules. Therefore there is not expected to be any change in respect of Malaysian requests for information from New Zealand. No disadvantages to New Zealand from entering into the Third Protocol have been identified. 15. It is an option for New Zealand to retain the current Exchange of Information Article in the Belgian DTA. That is, continue to only exchange information with Malaysia on a limited basis. However, this will reduce New Zealand’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. 16. On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interest to enter into the Third Protocol with Malaysia. Legal obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position in respect of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms 17. The Third Protocol will not impose any specific obligations on New Zealand in addition to those that already exist under the Exchange of Information Article of the DTA. The sole impact of the Third Protocol is to obtain additional obligations from the Malaysian Government to provide a greater range of information to New Zealand than is currently the case. 18. The dispute settlement mechanisms that are currently in place for the Malaysian DTA will also apply to the Third Protocol. Measures which the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including specific reference to implementing legislation 19. Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the Second Protocol will be implemented domestically by means of an overriding Regulation. 20. Section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 authorises the making of an Order in Council to give the provisions of a DTA overriding effect in relation to the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993. The override of the Inland Revenue Acts is necessary to give effect to the terms of the Protocol, given that it requires New Zealand to provide information it holds to foreign jurisdictions which is forbidden under those Acts. The Official Information Act is overridden to ensure that communications with other states during negotiations are not disclosed. The Privacy Act is overridden to ensure that information can be exchanged regarding natural persons under the exchange of information provisions of the DTA. 21. After the Order in Council has entered into force, New Zealand will notify Malaysia by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into PROTOCOL TO DOUBLE TAX AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE NEW ZEALAND AND MALAYSIA 7 force of the Third Protocol are complete. Malaysia will likewise notify New Zealand by diplomatic note when it has completed its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for giving effect to the Third Protocol. The Third Protocol will enter into force on the date of the receipt of the last notification. Its provisions will then have effect for requests made on or the date of entry into force with regard to tax years beginning on or after 1 January following entry into force. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 22. No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 23. No costs are anticipated. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 24. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and concur with the terms of the Third Protocol. No private sector consultation has been entered into. Subsequent protocols or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 25. No future protocols are anticipated. New Zealand would consider proposed amendments on a case by case basis and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the normal domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 26. It is intended that the Third Protocol remains in force as long as the Malaysian DTA is applicable. 27. Either party may terminate the Malaysian DTA by giving notice of termination, through diplomatic channels, on or before 30 June in any calendar year, in accordance with Article 25 of the Malaysian DTA. Agency Disclosure Statement 28. Inland Revenue has prepared this extended national interest analysis. It has undertaken an analysis of the issue of implementing the Third Protocol that amends the DTA between New Zealand and Malaysia, and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. It has considered all other relevant options in that process. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. 29. The Third Protocol amends the DTA between New Zealand and Malaysia by updating the exchange of information Article of the DTA to bring it in line with international norms. To the extent that costs arise from implementing the Third Protocol, they will be limited to administration costs. However, given that the DTA already includes exchange of information provisions (albeit a more restricted version), no additional costs are anticipated. 30. An Order in Council is required to implement the Third Protocol into New Zealand domestic law. The Order in Council will override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official PROTOCOL TO DOUBLE TAX AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE NEW ZEALAND AND MALAYSIA 8 Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993; this is authorised by section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and is necessary to give effect to the terms of the Third Protocol. 31. Inland Revenue notes that the form of the Third Protocol and national interest analysis is consistent with previous protocols concluded by and national interest analyses prepared by New Zealand. The amendment made by the Third Protocol to the exchange of information Article of the DTA is consistent with the approach adopted in other DTAs and Protocols that New Zealand has signed since 2004. 32. Inland Revenue is of the view that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on businesses; impair private property rights or market competition; adversely impact the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest; or override fundamental common principles.

Taxation of foreign superannuation 2 3 OVERVIEW Clauses 2(14), 6, 7, 8, 9, 17, 18, 25, 30, 40, 41, 42, 43, 66, 67, 75, 103(9), (10), and (11), 106, 115, 116 and 117 People who migrate to New Zealand (or those who return to New Zealand after working overseas) frequently have contributed to superannuation schemes in their previous country of residence. The current rules for taxing New Zealand residents on their foreign superannuation are complex and can be difficult for taxpayers to understand. In some cases, superannuation interests are subject to tax on accrual under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules. In other cases, a person may be taxed on receipt depending on the legal structure of the foreign scheme (such as whether the scheme is structured as a company or a trust). The tax treatment differs according to which set of rules applies. As a result, it is not always clear that the rules result in a fair outcome, particularly for lump-sum amounts. An issues paper proposing reforms to simplify the tax treatment of foreign superannuation was released in July 2012. Fifty-nine submissions from a variety of interested parties – including individuals, professional advisory firms and pension transfer agents – were received. The proposals included in this bill took into account suggestions put forward in submissions and consultation. The bill proposes a new cohesive set of rules to replace the current rules applying to interests in, and income from, foreign superannuation schemes from 1 April 2014. It is proposed that the FIF rules will generally cease to apply to foreign superannuation interests, unless they are ―grandparented‖. Instead lump-sum amounts received from 1 April 2014 would be taxed on receipt under one of two new calculation methods: the schedule method or the formula method. The schedule method is the default method. It is designed to approximate the tax that would have been paid on accrual while the person was New Zealand-resident, in conjunction with an interest charge that recognises that the payment of tax has been deferred until receipt. The formula method taxes the person based on the actual gains while they were resident in New Zealand, again in conjunction with an interest charge that recognises that the payment of tax has been deferred until receipt. The new rules will also allow people who have transferred their funds to a KiwiSaver scheme to withdraw an amount to pay their tax liability arising from the transfer. The bill also contains a concessionary ―15% option‖ to assist taxpayers who have not previously complied with their tax obligations. Fifteen submissions were received in relation to the foreign superannuation proposals included in the bill. Most of these proposals broadly supported the changes proposed by the bill. A number of submissions addressed the transitional measures and the concessionary ―15% option‖ for taxpayers who have not previously complied. 4 This officials‘ report proposes several policy and technical changes to the foreign superannuation proposals in the bill. Two changes relate to the proposed optional KiwiSaver withdrawal mechanism. Officials propose that KiwiSaver providers should inform Inland Revenue when a taxpayer has used the proposed optional withdrawal facility, and where the provider‘s systems allow it, pay the amount directly to Inland Revenue. Officials also propose that the facility should be able to be used if the person‘s student loan repayment obligation increases as a result of the transfer. A third change relates to how transfers of a foreign superannuation interest from one person to another are taxed when the transfer occurs on death or relationship split. Officials propose making the bill more consistent with other parts of the Income Tax Act 2007 that deal with the transfer of assets in such situations. A further proposal is to restrict the application of the proposed regime to foreign superannuation interests where the rights to the interest were first acquired while the taxpayer was non-resident. Officials note that this is consistent with the existing law for such taxpayers. Several submitters noted that the proposed changes as introduced could potentially result in effective double taxation for taxpayers who are required to pay tax under the new rules and have not complied with their obligations under the FIF rules in the past. To ensure that the rules work as intended, officials propose that these taxpayers should not also be liable for their unpaid FIF tax obligations. A number of minor changes and drafting clarifications are also proposed. 5 SUPPORT FOR REFORM Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Arthur Jacobson, Baucher Consulting Limited, Chris Pearson, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Ernst & Young, Financial Services Council, Grey Power New Zealand Federation Incorporated, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, PricewaterhouseCoopers) A number of submitters have expressed their broad support for the proposed changes to the taxation of foreign superannuation interests (Arthur Jacobsen, Chris Pearson, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Ernst & Young, Financial Services Council, Grey Power New Zealand Federation Incorporated, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, PricewaterhouseCoopers). Two submitters supported the move to clarify the rules, and to exempt taxpayers during the first 48 months on residency (Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited). One submitter stated that the proposed changes contained in the bill represent an acceptable compromise between the proposals in the officials‘ issues paper and the submissions received in response to the issues paper (Arthur Jacobsen). One submitter is pleased that the proposed rules provide options (schedule method and formula method) (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants). Another submitter expressed his support for the move to receipts-based taxation for foreign superannuation interests as the proposed changes would bring the New Zealand tax code in line with other countries (Chris Pearson). Comment Officials welcome the support for the bill. Officials note that an issues paper proposing changes to the tax treatment of foreign superannuation was released in July 2012. Fifty-nine submissions from a variety of interested parties – including individuals, professional advisory firms, and pension transfer agents – were received. A number of changes to the original proposals were made as a result of submissions, including the introduction of an alternative method of calculating actual gains (the ―formula method‖). Recommendation That the submission be noted. 6 SCOPE OF CHANGES Issue: Receipts-based approach should be available only where the rights in the scheme were first acquired while non-resident Clause 8 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The receipts-based approach contained in the bill should be available only where the rights in the foreign superannuation scheme were first acquired when the person was a non-resident. Where the person first acquired the rights in the foreign superannuation scheme while they were New Zealand resident, the FIF rules would generally apply. Comment Under current law, foreign superannuation schemes are taxed either under the FIF rules, or taxed upon receipt (or transfer) under the company, trust, or other tax rules. Broadly speaking, rights acquired while a person was resident in New Zealand are subject to the FIF rules. The bill as introduced does not restrict the receipts-based approach to situations where the person was non-resident when they acquired the rights in the scheme, although persons who were New Zealand resident at the time of acquisition would not be eligible for the four-year exemption period (this means that they would instead apply the schedule or formula method based on the date that they acquired the rights in the scheme). However, officials consider that the receipts-based approach is not appropriate for taxpayers who first acquire rights in a foreign superannuation scheme while they are already New Zealand resident. Under existing law, this is reflected in the fact that the FIF rules generally apply where the rights in the foreign superannuation scheme were acquired while resident in New Zealand. The policy intention of the changes contained in the bill – in particular, moving to a receipts-based approach – is to make it easier for people who have migrated or returned from overseas with foreign superannuation to comply with their New Zealand tax obligations. While the receipts-based approach in the bill broadly approximates the FIF treatment in terms of the amount of tax actually payable, an important difference is that under the receipts-based approach, if a person leaves New Zealand before receiving the lump sum they will not be subject to any tax. We consider that allowing taxpayers who acquire rights in a foreign superannuation scheme while they are New Zealand resident to use the receipts-based approach could undermine the existing rules that generally apply for portfolio investments. For example, a New Zealand resident intends to retire overseas and wants to save for their retirement through a managed fund. 7 If they choose to save through a New Zealand-based managed fund, they will be subject to New Zealand tax on their investment gains as they are earned (paid by the managed fund). If they choose to save through a foreign managed fund, they will be subject to New Zealand tax under the FIF rules on the gains as they are earned. If the receipts-based approach is available to them, it is possible that a taxpayer who intends to retire overseas may be able to invest into a foreign fund that is set up to provide retirement benefits, and choose to withdraw that lump sum when they move overseas. This would mean that they would not pay any tax on the gains they earned in that fund while they were New Zealand resident. Officials consider that this is not consistent with the underlying policy intention of the rules. Complexity can arise where rights in an employment-related scheme are acquired partly while non-resident and partly while resident. This could occur, for example, if the employer or employee continues to contribute to the scheme or where rights are vested while the person is a New Zealand resident. Under the existing rules which determine whether the FIF rules or other receipts-based rules apply, in many cases, such as where rights in an employment-related scheme were acquired partly while non-resident and partly while resident, the rules must be apportioned. That is, the FIF rules apply to those rights that were acquired while New Zealand resident and other tax rules would apply to the remainder of the rights. Officials do not favour such an apportionment approach, as it is highly complex and compliance-heavy. Rather, officials consider that the receipts-based approach should be available only where the person first acquired the rights while they were non-resident. A non-resident means someone who was not New Zealand resident under YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Where the person first acquired the rights in the foreign superannuation scheme while they were New Zealand resident, the FIF rules would generally apply. As noted above, in general, this recommendation would mean that there is no change from the position under existing law for those taxpayers with a foreign superannuation scheme that they have acquired while New Zealand resident, because the FIF rules generally apply where the rights in the foreign superannuation scheme were acquired while the person was resident. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 8 Issue: Lump sums should not be taxed Clauses 8 and 18 Submission (Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, Ernst & Young) One submitter argued that unless the pre-New Zealand capital base was merely nominal at the time the person became resident in New Zealand, the entire value of a lump sum withdrawal should not be taxed (Ernst & Young). Two submitters stated that the schedule and formula methods imply that capital gains of superannuation funds should be taxed. This appears to eliminate the capital/revenue distinction within the Act and runs counter to the intention of the changes introduced in the Portfolio Investment Entity regime in 2007. The schedule method unfairly penalises foreign superannuation schemes relative to other investments, such as residential property held on capital account (Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited). Comment The rationale behind the changes is to apply accrual taxation to lump sums, but instead of this being payable annually under the FIF rules it would be accumulated and payable only on receipt. An interest factor would be incorporated into the calculations to account for the use-of-money benefit that a person receives by not paying tax annually. The eventual tax liability would, therefore, be a function of the length of time that the person holds the interest (as a New Zealand resident) before the income is received. A longer duration implies a greater deferral benefit. Officials consider that this will ensure that the quantum of tax paid is relatively similar as for other assets (such as interests in foreign investment funds or foreign bank accounts). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 9 Issue: New rules should apply to pensions Clauses 8 and 18 Submission (KPMG) The proposed treatment for lump sums should also apply to pensions. Comment The submitter is concerned that, by taxing pensions in full, there is no acknowledgement that pensions comprise both income and capital. The submitter argues that the methodology underlying the schedule method could be applied to pensions as it should be possible to derive a taxable percentage based on the total value of the pension pot. Officials disagree with this submission. A key reason for changing the current rules is the complexity of the current rules in respect of lump sums. Officials are of the view that the complexity of the rules has been a factor in non-compliance. The same non-compliance that exists in relation to lump sums does not exist with periodic pensions. This is partly due to the fact that the taxpayer is simply required to include the value of the pension in their income tax return. This is consistent with the expectation of taxpayers. Requiring individuals to apply the schedule method or something similar to their pension would significantly increase complexity. In addition, it would require a boundary to be drawn between social security pensions (which would continue to be taxed in full) and other types of pensions, which would introduce further complexity. Officials are of the view that an increase in complexity could adversely affect compliance. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 10 Issue: Eligible foreign superannuation funds Clause 8 Submission (Chris Pearson) It should be clarified which schemes are included in the definition of a ―foreign superannuation scheme‖. Comment The submitter notes that the proposed legislation does not make it clear what superannuation funds would be taxed under the proposed new rules. The submitter suggests that it should include a number of common United States superannuation products and retirement savings schemes. Officials note that the definition of foreign superannuation scheme is an existing definition in the current law. It is reasonably broad, and would likely include the schemes the submitter has mentioned. However, more specific clarification would be more appropriate in a guidance document rather than in the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials‘ comments. Issue: Clarifying the definition of foreign ―superannuation scheme‖ Clause 8 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of a foreign ―superannuation scheme‖ in the current law should be clarified to ensure that it does not include overseas social security schemes. This will preserve the existing tax treatment of payments from such schemes. This should be made retrospective to 2004. Comment It has been generally accepted that overseas social security schemes that make payments similar to New Zealand Superannuation are not subject to the FIF rules. Rather, when pensions or lump sums are paid from such overseas social security schemes, they will be subject to tax under the ordinary tax rules. 11 In general, this means that pensions from overseas social security schemes are subject to full tax. The taxation of lump sums depends on the character of the lump sum, but they are generally not taxed. We consider that continuing this current tax treatment is appropriate in the context of the proposed changes. The proposed new rules will apply to interests in a foreign ―superannuation scheme‖. They are not intended to apply to overseas social security schemes that make payments similar to New Zealand Superannuation. The definition of a ―superannuation scheme‖, when originally enacted in 1989, excluded the historical equivalent of New Zealand Superannuation. Inland Revenue‘s view is that the definition of a ―superannuation scheme‖ also excluded overseas social security schemes that make payments similar to New Zealand Superannuation. In 2004, as part of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act, the definition of ―superannuation scheme‖ was restructured. It appears that, as a result of these drafting changes, it is not clear that the definition excludes overseas social security schemes that are similar to New Zealand Superannuation. This is not the intended policy outcome. Officials consider that the definition of a ―foreign superannuation scheme‖ should be clarified to ensure that it does not cover overseas social security schemes, consistent with the original intention under the 1976 and 1994 Income Tax Acts. This will preserve the existing tax treatment of payments from such schemes. This should be made retrospective to the enactment of the rewritten Income Tax Act in 2004. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 12 RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER TAX RULES Issue: Pensions from trusts and companies Clauses 6 and 66 Submission (Matter raised by officials) It should be clarified that a pension derived from a foreign superannuation scheme that is a company should not be a dividend. Similarly, it should be clarified that pensions derived from a foreign superannuation scheme that is a trust should not be taxed under the trust rules. Comment In many cases, the foreign superannuation scheme will legally be a unit trust, and therefore subject to the company tax rules. In other cases, the foreign superannuation scheme will legally be a trust, and therefore subject to the trust tax rules. The proposed legislation provides that, when the foreign superannuation scheme is a company, a lump sum withdrawal is not a dividend. Similarly, the bill proposes that a lump sum withdrawal from a foreign trust that is a foreign superannuation scheme will not be a taxable distribution. In both cases, it is instead intended that the lump sum will be subject to the new rules. In current legislation, pensions are taxed under a separate charging provision. However, it appears that it may not be clear whether this provision takes precedence over the company and trust rules. It should be clarified that a pension received from a foreign superannuation scheme that is a company should be taxed as a pension and not be treated as a dividend. Similarly, it should be clarified that a pension received from a foreign superannuation scheme that is a trust should be taxed as a pension and not be taxed under the trust rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 13 Issue: Application of trust rules Clauses 66 and 67 Submission (Ernst & Young) There should be a statutory provision that the trust rules do not apply to foreign superannuation schemes or to income or benefits from them. Alternatively, distributions from superannuation schemes should be excluded from the definition of ―taxable distribution‖ in relation to non-complying trusts. Distributions from foreign superannuation schemes should be excluded from the definition of beneficiary income. Comment The bill proposes that a lump-sum withdrawal from a foreign trust that is a foreign superannuation scheme will not be a taxable distribution. Instead, it is intended that the lump sum will be subject to the new rules. A trust will only be a non-complying trust if it has a New Zealand-resident settlor and does not meet certain obligations. The bill provides that a contribution made to a foreign superannuation scheme will not automatically mean that the person is a settlor. This means that contributions to a superannuation scheme from a person made while they are New Zealand resident will not result in the foreign trust becoming a non-complying trust. We consider that this should largely meet the submitter‘s concern that such situations should not be taxed under the trust rules. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 14 Issue: Trust rules – contributor is not a settlor Clauses 2 and 67 Submission (Ernst & Young) The amendment that a person who makes a contribution to a trust that is a foreign superannuation scheme is not a settlor of the trust should be retrospective, rather than applying from 1 April 2014. Comment As noted above, a provision in the rules provides that a contribution to a foreign superannuation withdrawal will not automatically mean that the person is a settlor. Officials understand that this issue will rarely arise in practice, because most schemes to which a person contributes will be unit trusts, and, under current rules, will therefore be subject to the company rules rather than the trust rules. Officials consider that a retrospective change of this nature may cause further uncertainty, and therefore do not favour this approach. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Transfers following death and divorce Clause 8 Submission (Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, Ernst & Young, KPMG) Submitters have requested clarification of the treatment of transfers that occur following a relationship split, or upon death of the transferor. In particular, clarification is sought on how the new rules interact with the existing death and divorce rollover provisions. Comment As currently drafted, the bill proposes that the transfer of a foreign superannuation interest to another person is a taxable event. This is the same position as existing law. The original policy intention when the bill was introduced was that this would also include situations where a transfer occurs as part of a relationship property agreement, for example upon divorce. The tax liability would be based on the transferor‘s years of residence. Similarly, the bill also proposes that upon death, the transfer of a foreign superannuation interest from the deceased to another person would generally constitute a taxable event. 15 Again, this is the same position as existing law. This is roughly consistent with other parts of the Act which provide that there would be a market value disposal and acquisition upon death. The bill proposes an exception to this where, upon death, the foreign superannuation interest is transferred from one New Zealand resident to another New Zealand resident. In this case, rollover relief would be provided so that the interest is not taxable at the time of the transfer, but rather when the transferee ultimately makes a withdrawal. When the transferee does make a lump-sum withdrawal, their assessable period would be deemed to have begun when the deceased‘s assessable period began. Several submitters questioned how this proposal would relate to other parts of the Income Tax Act which deal with property transfers in the event of death or a relationship break-up. In particular, other provisions in the Income Tax Act ensure that a transfer which occurs as part of a relationship agreement is, in certain circumstances, not a taxable event. Instead, the transferee takes on the cost base of the transferor and would need to account for this when they ultimately dispose of the asset. Further, other provisions in the Act provide rollover relief only upon death in the situation where the interest is transferred to the surviving spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner. (Again, in this situation, the surviving spouse, civil union partner, or de factor partner ̳steps into the shoes‘ of the deceased and takes on their cost base). Officials now consider that a better approach would be to broadly align the treatment of transfers upon death and relationship split with the treatment in other parts of the Act, with some minor modifications to ensure that the integrity of the proposed new rules is maintained. Under this approach, a transfer of a foreign superannuation interest from one person to another would generally constitute a taxable event, as per the current drafting in the bill. However, where the transfer occurs as a result of divorce, the end of a civil union, or the end of a de facto relationship and the transferee is a New Zealand resident, rollover relief would be provided. When a lump-sum withdrawal is ultimately made by the transferee, they would be taxed as though their assessable period had begun when their ex-partner‘s assessable period began. We also propose that where the transfer occurs upon the death of the transferor, rollover relief would be provided only where the transferee is a New Zealand resident and is the surviving spouse, civil union partner, or de factor partner. The assessable period would similarly be calculated from the beginning of the deceased‘s assessable period. Transfers to any other person should be taxed when the transferor dies. Officials consider that this would be broadly consistent with the existing approach for rollover relief in other parts of the Income Tax Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials' comments. 16 Issue: Drafting clarification – transfer to a non-resident upon death Clause 8 Submission (KPMG) Under the current drafting, the transfer of an interest from a New Zealand resident to a non-resident upon death would not be taxable. There should be confirmation that there would be permanent rollover relief on death where the beneficial interest transfers to a non-resident (KPMG). Comment As noted in the section above, the original policy intention was that when an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme is transferred upon death from a New Zealand resident to a non-resident, the transfer would be taxable according to the deceased‘s assessable period. The current drafting does not adequately reflect this policy intention and the provision will need to be adjusted. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that the policy intention as outlined by officials should be clarified. . Issue: Provisional tax No clause Submission (Ernst & Young, Financial Services Council, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society) Foreign superannuation withdrawals should not be considered when determining a taxpayer‘s obligation under the provisional tax rules. The additional ―withdrawal tax liability‖ should be excluded from the definition of ―residual income tax‖. (Financial Services Council, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society). The withdrawal tax liability described in CZ 21B (the 15% option) should be expressly excluded from the definition of residual income tax in YA 1 (Ernst & Young). Comment When a taxpayer has a residual tax liability of $2,500, they are required to account for the provisional tax rules. 17 A concern raised by one submitter is that if the withdrawal was made late in their income year, use-of-money interest would be applicable to the first two provisional tax instalments that were missed, as the tax legislation assumes it was received evenly throughout the year (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants). Officials note that this is only the case if the taxpayer is already considered to be a provisional taxpayer. If they are not a provisional taxpayer before the lump-sum withdrawal, then they would not be subject to any use-of-money interest for the missed provisional tax instalments. They would however be required to account for provisional tax rules in the following income year. Officials note that there are a number of ways in which provisional tax may be managed. One submitter notes that a tax liability arising from use of the 15% option in relation to past non-compliance should not be included as residual income tax. This is because the income actually arose in a past year, but for the purposes of the 15% option the income would be deemed to arise in the 2013–14 or 2014–15 income year (Ernst & Young). Officials note that there are no current exemptions for certain types of income under the provisional tax rules. Introducing an exemption for foreign superannuation withdrawals could create an unintended precedent. The issue raised by submitters also exists in relation to other lump-sum payments, for example lump-sum compensatory payments from ACC. No relief from the provisional tax rules is provided for such payments. As such, any decision here would set a precedent for other lump-sum payments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 18 SCHEDULE METHOD Clauses 8 and 106 Issue: 5% rate is too high Submission (Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, Ernst & Young, Financial Services Council, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The underlying rate of return used for the purposes of the schedule method is too high and should be 3.5% or 4%. Baucher Consulting Limited and the Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand raised the issue in their written submission, and suggested an alternative underlying rate of return of 3.5% in their oral submission. Comment The proposals in the bill rely on an underlying rate of return of 5% to calculate the tax ultimately payable on a lump sum. Submitters argued that the actual returns are likely to be less than the 5% rate of return used by the schedule method model for calculating tax, particularly following the global financial crisis. Managers‘ fees also have the effect of reducing the value of a person‘s interest, especially when the interest is low in value. Officials note that while the schedule method assumes an underlying rate of return of 5%, we consider this assumption to be robust. Historically, average rates of return are more in line with the assumed 5%. Submitters also argued that the fair dividend rate (FDR) method under the FIF rules should not be used as a precedent (FDR provides a rate of return of 5% of the opening value of the interest). Under the FIF rules, the 5% FDR acts as a cap on taxable income from the foreign superannuation scheme. When the actual rate of return is greater than 5%, taxpayers are still able to use FDR. When the return is less than 5%, taxpayers who are individuals are taxed on that. When there is a loss, no tax is paid. Submitters argued that these factors mean that on average, the taxable rate of return for foreign superannuation under the FIF rules is about 3.5%. Officials note that when the issues paper proposing changes to foreign superannuation was released in July 2012, some submitters suggested that the growth rate should be lowered. Other submissions on the issues paper suggested that the growth rate should not begin until 4 years post-migration, rather than the first year of migration (as was in the original issues paper). 19 The proposals in the bill pick up the latter approach – that is, delaying the start of the growth rate until four years post-migration. Officials consider that this is a sensible approach as it prevents a cliff face after the four-year exemption. However, allowing both the four-year exemption and a lower growth rate would be too concessionary. Officials also note that taxpayers would have the formula method available as an alternative to the schedule method. Using the formula method would prevent over- taxation when the average rate of return is lower. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The schedule year fraction should not reach 100% Submission (Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, Ernst & Young) The schedule year fraction should never reach 100% (Ernst & Young). The schedule year fraction should be capped at 75% (Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited). Comment Officials note that the formula used to calculate the schedule method takes into account the deferral benefit received by a taxpayer from not paying tax on accrual. In theory this means that the schedule year fractions could exceed 100% after year 26, but a decision was made to cap the rate at 100%. Capping the schedule year fractions at a rate lower than 100% would have the effect of understating the deferral benefit for the taxpayers who gain the most from deferring the payment of tax – those who have held their interest for several decades. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 20 FORMULA METHOD Clauses 8 and 103(10) Issue: The ―grow rate‖ should be removed Submission (Ernst & Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers) The ―grow rate‖ should be removed from the formula method. Alternatively, the relevant rates could be provided by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue each year or else set out in a schedule (Ernst & Young). Comment The submitters note that the formula method, as an alternative to the schedule method, is too intensive, restrictive, and complex to be a viable option for taxpayers to apply. This is because people will struggle to understand and apply the concept of the interest component to account for the deferral of tax (―grow rate‖). Officials note that accounting for the deferral benefit is a major component of the proposed new rules for taxing foreign superannuation interests, particularly when taxpayers may hold these interests for at least 20–30 years before bringing them into the New Zealand tax base. Officials do not believe that calculating the ―grow rate‖ is too intensive, restrictive, or complex. The ―grow rate‖ formula utilises information that the taxpayer would have used in calculating other components of the formula method. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Changing the tax rate in the ―grow rate‖ calculation Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The tax rate used to calculate the ―grow rate‖ should be the taxpayer‘s actual marginal tax rate. Where the actual rate has fluctuated during the relevant period, an averaging calculation should apply or the taxpayer should use the highest marginal rate applying over the period. 21 Comment The term ―grow rate‖ assumes that the person is on the highest marginal tax rate. The submitter argues that when the taxpayer‘s actual marginal rate is less, this inappropriately inflates the benefit of the deferral and the actual marginal rate should be able to be used if it is less. Officials are of the view that this would add unnecessary complexity to the proposed legislation. This would particularly be the case if the taxpayer were required to calculate their average marginal tax rate over a 20 or 30 year period, when tax rates may have fluctuated or they may not have access to the required information. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application to defined benefit schemes Submission (Ernst & Young, Financial Services Council, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The formula method should be available to taxpayers with defined benefit schemes. The submitters note that actuarial valuations are available and are considered to be a recognised means of valuing interests in defined benefit schemes. There should be a separate option available to taxpayers with interests in defined benefit schemes (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants). Comment In establishing the formula method, officials were concerned that reliable actuarial valuations of defined benefit schemes are not available. While it is possible in theory to obtain actuarial valuations, these can vary greatly. This raises serious integrity issues. Submitters did not provide further suggestions on how these integrity issues could be addressed in practice. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 22 RECOGNISED CONTRIBUTIONS Clause 8 Issue: Voluntary contributions should be deductible Submission (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Voluntary contributions should be considered recognised contributions and therefore deductible (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants). Comment Under the new rules, tax is imposed when a lump sum is received or transferred under either the schedule or formula method. The schedule method works backwards to presume, on the basis of the assumed interest rate, a particular value of the superannuation interest at the beginning of the person‘s assessable period. Any difference between the transferred amount and this ̳deemed‘ original value is treated as gains. The deemed gains are taxable, while the deemed original value is not. The underlying result is that the schedule method treats contributions made while an individual is New Zealand-resident partly as investment gains and effectively taxes them as such. There are different ways of relieving this potential over-taxation. The approach taken in the bill is to apply the schedule method to the amount of the lump sum after deducting the value of certain contributions made while New Zealand-resident, as long as those contributions have been subject to New Zealand tax. This reduces the amount of the lump sum on which the schedule year fraction is applied by the value of the contributions, thereby reducing the individual‘s taxable income. While this has the advantage of being a very simple approach, it does have the result of being overly concessionary in most circumstances. This is because the deductions reduce the value of the lump sum on which the schedule year fraction is applied, but the schedule year fractions already implicitly divides the lump sum into capital amounts and gains. This effectively means that the individual would receive a double deduction for the contribution. Because of this potential for under-taxation, contributions are subject to certain restrictions before they are ―recognised‖ (that is, deductible under either the schedule or the formula method). In particular, voluntary contributions made to a foreign superannuation scheme after the individual becomes New Zealand resident would not be deductible. Only compulsory contributions required under the scheme‘s rules would be deductible. Apart from the issue of under-taxation in respect of the schedule method, officials are also concerned about the potential for undermining the FIF rules – that is, a person who wishes to be subject to receipts-based taxation rather than the FIF rules could use the rules to route money through ―voluntary contributions‖ into their foreign superannuation scheme and avoid being taxed annually. 23 This is also why officials also propose in this report to restrict the receipts-based approach to taxpayers who first acquired their foreign superannuation interest while non-resident. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Voluntary contributions should be deducted under the formula method Submission (Financial Services Council) Voluntary contributions should be considered recognised contributions under the formula method only (Financial Services Council). Comment One submitter acknowledged that allowing a deduction for voluntary contributions may be problematic for the schedule method, but submitted that voluntary contributions should be allowed only under the formula method, as the concern does not apply to the formula method. Officials agree that allowing a deduction for voluntary contributions under the formula method does not present the same concerns of under-taxation as for the schedule method. This is because the formula method relies on actual information to divide a lump sum into a capital amount and gains. However, as noted above, officials consider that there is a concern that a person who wishes to be subject to receipts-based taxation rather than the FIF rules could use the rules to route money through ―voluntary contributions‖ into their foreign superannuation scheme and avoid being taxed annually. This is also why officials also propose in this report to restrict the receipts-based approach to taxpayers who first acquired their foreign superannuation interest while non-resident. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 24 TRANSFERS TO NEW ZEALAND SCHEMES Clause 8 Issue: Tax on transfers to locked-in New Zealand schemes Submission (Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Transfers from foreign superannuation schemes to locked-in New Zealand superannuation schemes should be exempt from tax because the submitters do not consider such transfers to be income. They believe that no present entitlement to the funds arises at the point of transfer, so, the transfer should be treated as a capital transaction. (Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited). Transfers to locked-in New Zealand superannuation schemes should not be taxed if they are locked in for 10 years (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) or if they are subject to anti-deferral measures, such as a minimum lock-in period (KPMG). These submitters argue that encouraging residents to repatriate their foreign superannuation schemes to New Zealand is beneficial not only for the New Zealand tax base, but also for New Zealand‘s funds management industry. However, they acknowledge officials‘ concerns regarding possible abuse and propose that an additional condition be attached to the transfer to mitigate this possible abuse – that the scheme must remain locked-in for a minimum period. Comment The intention behind the rules is to approximately tax the gains that the person made while they were resident in New Zealand. Exempting transfers into locked-in schemes would create a significant inequity between New Zealand residents with foreign superannuation schemes and those with other financial assets such as New Zealand superannuation schemes, shares, or bank deposits. Officials also note that new residents will have four years to transfer their superannuation tax-free. Their tax liability gradually increases after that four-year period. This policy setting is expected to provide an incentive for taxpayers to transfer their superannuation to New Zealand sooner rather than later. Officials consider that the submitters‘ proposals would instead encourage residents to keep their foreign superannuation interests offshore and only transfer their interest into a locked-in New Zealand scheme immediately before they are able (and wish) to use the funds. They would pay no New Zealand tax while their interest was offshore, which could potentially be several decades. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 25 Issue: Receiving superannuation scheme should inform individual of tax implications Submission (Charter Square Services) The New Zealand schemes accepting transfers from overseas should be required to inform the individual making the transfer of the tax implications. \[Raised in the oral submission\] Comment Under the new rules, people who transfer their funds to superannuation schemes may or may not have a tax liability in respect of that scheme (which will generally depend on their duration of residence in New Zealand). Officials agree that it is important for individuals to understand their tax obligations before they decide to make a withdrawal or transfer. A difficulty with this submission is that the superannuation scheme cannot provide specific advice to individuals that is tailored to their situation as the superannuation scheme is not a tax agent. Officials will be working with the industry to ensure that appropriate general information can be communicated to individuals. At this point in time, officials do not consider that a legislative requirement is necessary. Recommendation That the submission to require schemes to inform the individual of the tax implications be declined, but that the issue be noted by the Committee. 26 WITHDRAWALS FROM KIWISAVER Clause 115 Issue: Optional withdrawals from KiwiSaver could trigger UK QROPS rules Submission (Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, Charter Square Services, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers) An agreement should exist between Inland Revenue and the United Kingdom‘s HM Revenue and Customs regarding the possible interaction between the United Kingdom‘s rules and the proposed KiwiSaver withdrawal mechanism (Charter Square Services). Three submitters suggest that Inland Revenue should clarify the interaction with the UK QROPS rules (Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants). Alternatively, transfers of foreign superannuation funds from the UK into QROPS should not be taxed (PricewaterhouseCoopers). One submitter states that transfers into KiwiSaver should not be taxed (KPMG) Another submitter has submitted that there should be a legislative solution to ensure that the QROPS rules are not triggered (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants). One submitter states that any tax leakage from exempting transfers into QROPS would be insignificant as any UK tax paid should ordinarily be available as a foreign tax credit (PricewaterhouseCoopers). A submitter also states that in having the proposed rules apply to transfers from UK superannuation schemes to New Zealand QROPS would result in additional reporting responsibilities in the United Kingdom (PricewaterhouseCoopers). Comment The ―qualifying recognised overseas pensions schemes‖ (QROPS) regime is administered by the UK's HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). It allows individuals with interests in UK pension schemes to transfer their interests to certain overseas schemes (QROPS) without incurring any UK tax charges. The majority of New Zealand superannuation schemes that qualify as QROPS are KiwiSaver schemes. Once a person has transferred from a UK scheme to a QROPS, there are specific provisions relating to how an individual may access their funds. If the individual makes a withdrawal from the QROPS and was a UK resident in any of the five preceding income years, the withdrawal may be classed as an unauthorised withdrawal and may be subject to an unauthorised payment charge and surcharge of up to 55%. 27 The new rules for taxing foreign superannuation contained in this bill propose a mechanism that would allow a person who transfers their foreign superannuation into a KiwiSaver scheme, and who has a resulting tax liability, to withdraw a portion of their superannuation to pay that tax liability (the ―withdrawal mechanism‖). This is an optional facility that is intended to make it easier for people to meet their tax obligations. Taxpayers do not have to use the facility and can choose to pay their tax liability from other funds if they prefer. One submitter states that in making a withdrawal from their KiwiSaver using the proposed withdrawal mechanism, an individual may trigger this QROPS penalty charge and the scheme could be delisted as a QROPS. Officials have confirmed with HMRC that the introduction of the withdrawal mechanism would not impact the ability of KiwiSaver schemes to qualify as QROPS. Officials understand that the penalty charges exist to protect the integrity of the UK‘s tax system and pension regime, and that an exemption for the proposed withdrawal mechanism from the UK‘s unauthorised payment charge and surcharge is unlikely. However, we believe that the risk of triggering the unauthorised payment charge is relatively low and does not require a policy response of exempting transfers into QROPS from New Zealand tax. First, the penalty charge is only levied by HMRC if the individual was a UK resident in any of the five income years before the withdrawal. Under the proposed legislation, individuals who transfer within the first four years of becoming New Zealand resident would have no New Zealand tax to pay and would therefore not need to utilise the proposed withdrawal facility. Second, while there may be some overlap for a new migrant in the fifth year of residence the proportion of the transfer that is assessed as income is only 4.76%. At the top marginal tax rate of 33%, the effective tax rate on the transfer would be approximately 1.57%. As this is a low effective tax rate, we expect that most individuals should be able to satisfy their tax liability out of other funds rather than using the KiwiSaver withdrawal facility. This means that they would be able to avoid the QROPS unauthorised payment charge. One submitter states that any tax leakage from exempting transfers into QROPS would be insignificant as any UK tax paid should ordinarily be available as a foreign tax credit (PricewaterhouseCoopers). Officials consider this to be incorrect. Under the double tax agreement (DTA) between New Zealand and the UK, New Zealand usually has the sole right to tax such lump sums. This means that New Zealand is not required to provide a foreign tax credit and the taxpayer should apply to HMRC for a refund of UK tax paid. 28 The submitter also states that in having the proposed rules apply to transfers from UK superannuation schemes to New Zealand QROPS would result in additional reporting responsibilities in the United Kingdom (PricewaterhouseCoopers). This is also incorrect as the proposed rules do not change the reporting requirements of the QROPS regime., Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: KiwiSaver provider must be sufficiently satisfied before approving a withdrawal Submission (KPMG) The requirement that the KiwiSaver provider must be sufficiently satisfied with the KiwiSaver member‘s application to withdraw the amount of the tax liability before releasing the funds should be removed. Comment Officials consider this requirement to be necessary to maintain the integrity of the KiwiSaver rules. Officials do not believe that this will be overly onerous for the provider. Schemes would require a statutory declaration from the member, and may require other evidence (such as a tax assessment) as considered appropriate by the provider. Officials note that similar requirements appear in other provisions governing permitted withdrawals in the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 29 Issue: Notification of withdrawal and payment to Inland Revenue Submission (Matter raised by officials) KiwiSaver providers should be required to notify Inland Revenue upon allowing a withdrawal from KiwiSaver to pay a person‘s tax liability and should also pay the amount directly to Inland Revenue if their systems allow them to do so. Comment The proposed withdrawal mechanism allows a KiwiSaver provider to approve a withdrawal from KiwiSaver to pay a person‘s tax liability, in limited circumstances. At the moment there is no requirement for KiwiSaver providers to notify Inland Revenue about the request or pay the amount directly to Inland Revenue. We consider that this is inappropriate as Inland Revenue may not be aware of an individual withdrawing an amount and failing to pay their tax liability. We consider that requiring KiwiSaver providers to notify Inland Revenue upon allowing a withdrawal, and requiring them to pay the amount direct to Inland Revenue (if their systems allow it) will support the integrity of the KiwiSaver rules and ensure that the withdrawal mechanism operates as intended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Student loan repayment obligation arising from a transfer of a foreign superannuation scheme into KiwiSaver Submission (Matter raised by officials) When a taxpayer applies to their KiwiSaver provider to withdraw the amount of the tax liability arising from the transfer into KiwiSaver, they should also be able to withdraw an additional amount to meet a student loan repayment obligation. This should be limited to the amount of the student loan repayment obligation that is attributable to the assessable income in relation to the foreign superannuation transfer. Comment Where a portion of the foreign superannuation transfer is taxable income, a corresponding student loan repayment obligation may arise for that income year. Officials consider that this is an appropriate result as the portion included in the income tax return is income derived by the person, and so should be taken into account when calculating such obligations. 30 However, officials acknowledge that taxpayers who transfer their foreign superannuation interest into KiwiSaver may experience further cash flow difficulties in meeting their student loan repayment obligations that arise from that transfer. Officials therefore consider that when a taxpayer applies to their KiwiSaver provider to use the proposed withdrawal mechanism to pay their transfer tax liability, they should also be permitted to withdraw an applicable amount to meet their student loan repayment obligations, but only to the extent that it arises as a result of the transfer. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Time limit for withdrawal mechanism Submission (Matter raised by officials) The time limit applying to when an application for a KiwiSaver withdrawal may be made should be amended so that the application must be made within two years of the ̳foreign superannuation withdrawal‘ being included in the appropriate income tax return. For this reason, it should also be made clearer that the withdrawal mechanism is only available when the lump sum has been assessed as income. Comment The proposed legislation currently provides that, in order to use the proposed KiwiSaver withdrawal mechanism, the application to the KiwiSaver provider needs to be made within two years of the transfer. However, the tax liability is only confirmed when the taxpayer returns the appropriate portion of the transfer in their income tax return and it is assessed as income. Therefore officials consider it more appropriate for the two-year limit to start from when the lump sum has been assessed as income. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 31 Issue: Is the withdrawal option available for partial transfers into KiwiSaver? Submission (Charter Square Services) A taxpayer who has transferred their foreign superannuation into a non-KiwiSaver New Zealand superannuation scheme, should be able to use the KiwiSaver withdrawal option by first transferring the amount of the tax liability from the non-KiwiSaver scheme into a KiwiSaver scheme then making the application for withdrawal. \[Raised in the oral submission\] Comment The withdrawal option is only available to taxpayers who have transferred into KiwiSaver schemes. There are a number of New Zealand superannuation schemes that are not part of the KiwiSaver regime. The reason behind creating a withdrawal option for KiwiSaver is due to the ease of making an amendment to the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Extending the withdrawal option to non-KiwiSaver schemes would require amending the trust deed for each scheme. Officials note that there is nothing preventing non-KiwiSaver schemes from providing such a withdrawal facility without government intervention. Some – although not many – of these non-KiwiSaver schemes qualify as QROPS under the UK‘s ̳qualified recognised overseas pension schemes‘ regime (for further information see ̳Issue: Withdrawals from KiwiSaver could trigger UK QROPS rules‘). This means that a number of UK migrants may transfer into these schemes but would not have access to the KiwiSaver withdrawal option to pay their tax liability. However, a taxpayer who has transferred to a non-KiwiSaver superannuation scheme may know what their liability arising from the transfer is. They may then transfer this exact amount of the tax liability from a non-KiwiSaver scheme to a KiwiSaver scheme and then use the withdrawal facility to withdraw that full amount and pay Inland Revenue. The submitter notes that the current drafting of the proposed legislation does not prevent this from occurring. Officials do not think that this will be a significant issue as the majority of transfers made by UK migrants will be into KiwiSaver schemes. Inland Revenue will monitor the situation to see if any problems will arise. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 32 PAST WITHDRAWALS – 15% OPTION Clauses 25, 116 and 117 Issue: Support for 15% option Submission (Ernst and Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Two submitters are supportive of the proposed concessionary option available to taxpayers who have previously not complied with their tax obligations (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants). Comment Officials note the support for the proposed concessionary option. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Retrospectivity Submission (Elaine Hope, Leonie Walker) One submitter stated that people who complied with the law previously should not have to pay 15% tax on a retrospective basis. Another submitter stated that the changes should not be brought in retrospectively; the new rules should apply on a prospective basis. Comment The 15% option does not retrospectively impose a tax liability on any individuals. Taxpayers who made a lump-sum withdrawal or transferred their foreign superannuation scheme before 1 April 2014 and complied with the law that existed at the time in relation to their scheme are not required to take further action. This includes people who have not paid any tax because an exemption applied to their situation under existing law (for example, because they were a transitional resident at the time). In these situations, the taxpayer will have no tax obligations as there was no liability under the existing law. However, officials understand that a number of people who made a withdrawal or transfer may not have complied with their tax obligations. 33 These taxpayers can apply the law as it applied to their interest at the time that they made the withdrawal. They may be subject to use-of-money interest or penalties, although these may be reduced where the taxpayer voluntarily discloses their tax liability. Alternatively, they can choose to use the 15% option proposed in the bill. The 15% option is a concessionary, low-cost alternative option for taxpayers who have made a lump-sum withdrawal or transfer before 1 April 2014, and who did not fulfil their tax obligations in relation to the foreign superannuation interest. Under this option, the person can include 15% of their lump sum as income in their 2013–2014 or 2014–2015 tax return, and apply their marginal tax rate to that amount. For example, a person who transferred $100,000 would include $15,000 in their tax return. If their tax rate is 33%, they will have tax to pay of $5000. It is important to note that taxpayers are not required to use the 15% option proposed in the bill and may instead choose to apply the law as it existed at the time. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Past non-compliance should not be pursued Submission (Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited) Non-compliance should not be pursued and therefore the 15% option should not be available. Comment As noted above, a number of people have not complied with their tax obligations in relation to their foreign superannuation. The 15% option is intended as a low-cost concessionary measure for taxpayers to get their tax affairs in order. However, it should be noted that although non-compliance has been high, a number of people have complied with their tax obligations. The approach suggested by the submitter is likely to undermine voluntary compliance, which is a cornerstone principle of New Zealand‘s tax administration. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 34 Issue: Interest and penalties Submission (Ernst & Young, Financial Services Council) The revised due date that applies in relation to the 15% option should also apply to non- compliant taxpayers who choose to apply the law that existed at the time. Comment Taxpayers have an obligation to comply with the tax rules governing their foreign superannuation interest at the time they are required to. Officials are of the view that non-compliance should not be rewarded, but acknowledge that the existing rules are complex. The 15% option is intended to be a low-cost option available to non-compliant taxpayers to help them get their tax affairs in order. As it is an option, if a taxpayer chooses not to use, their liability under the existing law should remain. Officials note that penalties are generally reduced for voluntary disclosures. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Timeframe Submission (Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The window for the 15% option should be aligned with the period for which a taxpayer is required to keep tax records (i.e. seven income years) and non-compliance before that should not be audited (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants). The window for the 15% option should begin on 18 December 2006 or 1 April 2010. Non-compliance before this should not be audited. 18 December 2006 is proposed as this was the date of royal assent of the bill that excluded certain Australian superannuation schemes from the FIF regime. The rationale behind 1 April 2010 is that it is the beginning of the income year in which a number of articles highlighting the potential tax implications arising from lump-sum payments and transfers were published. (Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited). 35 Comment The 15% option is a concessionary measure and officials therefore disagree with limiting its scope. Officials note that the extent of audit activity relating to previous non-compliance will be determined according to how Inland Revenue‘s resources may be best utilised, as is normal tax administrative practice. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Interests in foreign investment funds – clarification Submission (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Taxpayers who did not comply with the FIF rules should be able to use the 15% option if they have made a lump-sum withdrawal before 1 April 2014 (KPMG). It should be clarified that taxpayers who have not complied with their obligations are able to choose between applying the law as it was at the time of withdrawal in each of the relevant income years, or paying tax on 15% of the withdrawal. If there were any applicable exemptions available to them at the time taxpayers should be able to utilise these (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants). Comment The policy intention is that taxpayers who have made a withdrawal and who have not complied with their obligations are able to choose between applying the law as it was at the time of withdrawal, or paying tax on 15% of the withdrawal. If there were any applicable exemptions available to them under the law that applied at the time, taxpayers should be able to utilise these. Officials consider that this is, in general, sufficiently clear in the legislation. However, one submitter noted that the current drafting does not seem to allow taxpayers who were non-compliant with the FIF rules and who made a withdrawal to use the 15% option in relation to past lump-sum withdrawals. Instead these people would only be able to use the law that existed at the time (i.e. recalculate their FIF liabilities). Officials agree that the proposed legislation should be clarified so that non-compliant FIF taxpayers who made a lump-sum withdrawal before 1 April 2014 should have the 15% option available to them. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials‘ comments. 36 Issue: Withdrawals derived after 1 April 2014 should also be eligible for the 15% option Submission (Offen Advisors Limited, Owens Tax Advisors Limited) The 15% option should be extended so that taxpayers who transfer their foreign superannuation scheme up to six months after 1 April 2014 are eligible to use the 15% option. Comment The policy intention is that taxpayers who derive a lump sum on or after 1 April 2014 would be subject to the proposed new regime. Officials consider that it would be inappropriate to have the concessionary 15% option available for a longer period as it would undermine the proposed new regime. Furthermore, officials consider that as part of the submission it would be necessary to amend the application date of the proposed regime, because it would be inappropriate to have the proposed new regime and the concessionary 15% option both applying at the same time. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 37 TRANSITIONAL ISSUES AND APPLICATION DATE Clauses 2(14), 8 and 103(9) Issue: Grandparenting under the FIF rules–support Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) One submitter welcomes the ability for taxpayers who have complied with the FIF rules to continue using the FIF rules. Comment Officials note the submission. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Recognising FIF tax already paid for taxpayers who choose not to use the grandparenting option Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Ernst & Young, Financial Services Council, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Where the FIF rules have been applied in an income year, the assessable period should commence from the following income year, if the person changes to the new rules (Ernst & Young, Financial Services Council, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants). This could be achieved by adding the number of FIF-compliant years to a person‘s exemption period to effectively extend the exemption period (Corporate Taxpayers Group). Alternatively, a deduction should be allowed for tax on FIF income already paid with respect to that foreign superannuation interest. The amount of FIF income returned should be deducted from the value of the lump sum, or a tax credit should be allowed to offset tax already paid on attributed FIF income (Financial Services Council, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Ernst & Young). A third option should be provided for taxpayers wishing to transition from the FIF rules into the new rules:  Taxpayers undertake a wash-up calculation to ensure that tax is not underpaid to the extent that the taxpayer has made lump-sum withdrawals during the time they were calculating income under the FIF rules 38  The 15% option should be available to compliant taxpayers who wish to transition out of the FIF rules  Taxpayers would then apply the proposed new rules to any lump sum withdrawals made going forward. (Corporate Taxpayers Group). Comment The issue relates to taxpayers who currently have an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme and have returned FIF income in the past. Under the proposed new rules, those taxpayers would be able to continue using the FIF rules, as long as they complied with the FIF rules prior to 20 May 2013 (the date of introduction of the bill). All other taxpayers must account for tax under the new rules (that is, upon receipt). Taxpayers who choose not to use the grandparenting provision could be subject to double taxation of the same income when they move from accounting for income under the FIF rules to paying tax under the proposed new rules. The underlying issue is that the new rules do not account for FIF tax already paid. Officials note that under the FIF rules, no tax is paid when a withdrawal is ultimately made. The new rules propose allowing this tax treatment to continue for taxpayers who have already returned income under the FIF rules. This means that taxpayers who continue to use the FIF rules will not be overtaxed. Officials acknowledge that there is potential for effective over-taxation if a person chooses to be taxed under the new rules instead of continuing to be taxed under the FIF rules. However, it is not clear why a taxpayer would generally wish to use the new rules if they have already paid tax under the FIF rules. Officials do not consider that this is an issue that will arise in practice. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: ―Turning off‖ the FIF rules for non-compliance in the past Submission (KPMG, Offen Advisors Limited, Owens Tax Advisors Limited) The submitters are concerned at the potential for double taxation if Inland Revenue pursues past non-compliance in the case of a person who did not comply with the FIF rules and is subject to the new rules on lump sums received after 1 April 2014. This issue does not apply to people who have already made a withdrawal. One submitter suggests that the FIF rules should not apply where lump-sum withdrawals are taxed from 1 April 2014 under the new rules (KPMG). 39 Others submit that the legislation should be amended to ensure that only one regime – either the FIF regime or the proposed new regime – applies to withdrawals derived after 1 April 2014 (Offen Advisors Limited, Owens Tax Advisors Limited). Comment Officials expect that a large group of people have not accounted for income under the FIF rules in previous years. The policy intention is that these taxpayers would be subject to the proposed new rules on any withdrawals made on or after 1 April 2014. It is not intended that these taxpayers would also be subject to audit activity on their unpaid FIF tax. This is because the proposed rules for taxing lump sums would account for any tax that should have been paid on accrual, regardless of whether that tax was paid. Officials agree that if these taxpayers were subject to the new rules on lump sums, but also remained liable for unpaid FIF tax in relation to that scheme, there would be an element of double taxation. This is undesirable. It is also undesirable that taxpayers be subject to the FIF regime rather than the proposed new rules, if they do not meet the conditions for grandparenting. Officials agree that, in these situations, the FIF rules should not apply to a person‘s interest for past years if their interest is subject to the new rules. This proposal would ensure that taxpayers are not over-taxed, and also has the advantage of simplicity, which is consistent with the intent of the proposed rules. (It should be noted that an exception to this would be where the taxpayer acquired the interest in the foreign superannuation scheme while already New Zealand resident. As noted in this report, officials consider that the receipts-based approach should be available only where the rights in the scheme were first acquired while non-resident. This means that these taxpayers would still be subject to the FIF rules and so would remain liable for unpaid FIF tax.) Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials‘ comments. 40 Issue: 15% option should be available in cases where a lump sum has not been derived Submission (Offen Advisors Limited and Owens Tax Advisors Limited) Taxpayers who did not comply with the FIF rules, and have not made a withdrawal by 31 March 2014 should be permitted to use the 15% option in relation to their foreign superannuation interest as if they had made a withdrawal. That is, they should be able to return 15% of the value of the FIF interest in respect of their past FIF obligations. Comment Officials note that the underlying problem is that there is potential for effective double taxation, if the person is subject to tax under the new rules. Officials note that the proposal to waive previous FIF obligations (Issue: ―Turning off‖ the FIF rules for non-compliance in the past) would address this problem. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Cut-off date for grandparenting is not adequate Submission (Ernst & Young, Offen Advisors Limited, Owens Tax Advisors Limited) The submitters argue that 20 May 2013 is not an appropriate cut-off date for the grandparenting provision. One submitter states that there may be a number of taxpayers whose interests in foreign superannuation schemes have only just become FIF interests since the beginning of their 2012–13 income year (generally from 1 April 2012). This may be because they were previously transitional residents. Generally, the standard filing deadline for these taxpayers would be 7 July 2013 so many may have not yet filed their tax return by 20 May 2013. As a result, such taxpayers would have no opportunity to be grandparented (Ernst & Young). The cut-off date for grandparenting under the FIF rules should instead be 7 July 2013 (Ernst & Young). Taxpayers who previously did not comply with the FIF rules, and who return 15% of the value of the FIF interest in order to remedy this non-compliance, should be able to continue using the FIF rules from 1 April 2014. (Offen Advisors Limited, Owens Tax Advisors Limited). 41 Comment The policy intention is to reduce complexity and minimise compliance costs, and to that end, all effected taxpayers should be brought into the new regime for taxing foreign superannuation interests. However, some taxpayers have already complied with the FIF rules in the past in respect of their foreign superannuation interest. To ensure that this group of taxpayers do not face increased compliance costs, the proposed legislation permits those taxpayers to continue using the FIF rules rather than requiring them to comply with the new regime. This reasoning does not apply to taxpayers who have not yet returned any income under the FIF rules. Officials are of the view that the date of introduction of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill (that is, 20 May 2013) is an appropriate date for grandparenting and that grandparenting should not be extended to other taxpayers. One submitter noted that there is a small group of taxpayers who have only just become subject to the FIF rules from the 2012–13 year because they ceased to be a transitional resident during the 2012–13 income year, and who may not have submitted their tax return by 20 May 2013 so would not have the opportunity to be grandparented (Ernst & Young). Officials note that such taxpayers would generally have no FIF income as they would not have had an ―opening market value‖ for their scheme at the beginning of the income year. This means that they would be unlikely to have FIF tax to pay for the 2012–13 income year. The FIF grandparenting provision is therefore not necessary for these taxpayers, and officials consider that the new rules should apply to them. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Grandparenting under the FIF rules when no FIF income or a FIF loss Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Ernst & Young) The legislation should clarify that grandparenting under the FIF rules should be available to taxpayers with no FIF income or a FIF loss is reduced to zero when filing a return. 42 Comment In a small number of circumstances, a taxpayer may have complied with the FIF rules in relation to a foreign superannuation interest, but have no FIF or may have a FIF loss. This would not be included in the person‘s tax return. It is not clear that they will be grandparented under the FIF rules, as the amount returned in these circumstances will be exactly zero. Officials agree that taxpayers in this situation should be able to continue using the FIF rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Evidentiary standards for grandparenting under the FIF rules Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Further guidance needs to be provided on the evidentiary standards that must be satisfied for the purposes of grandparenting. In particular, the submitter notes that Inland Revenue may not be aware that a taxpayer has complied with the FIF rules because where there is a double tax agreement in force, a FIF disclosure form is not required (Corporate Taxpayers Group). Comment Officials do not consider that any special rules are needed. The person must be able to show that they were subject to the FIF rules and complied with their obligations under the FIF rules, including correctly returning FIF income (if there was any) in respect of the FIF interest. Officials will include a comment to this effect in a Tax Information Bulletin or similar guidance following enactment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 43 Issue: Earlier application date of new rules for certain withdrawals Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Taxpayers should be permitted to apply the proposed new rules for any foreign superannuation withdrawal derived in the 2012–13 or 2013–14 income year. This means that for withdrawals derived in the period 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2014, taxpayers would have the two originally proposed options (15% and existing law) as well as a third option of using the schedule or formula method. Comment Officials note that the 15% option is already a concessionary option. Further, this proposal would add complexity to the transitional period as taxpayers would then need to consider three different methods when complying with their tax obligations. Officials therefore do not consider that a third option is warranted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date Submission (Ernst & Young) References to 1 April 2014 may cause confusion for taxpayers with non-standard balance dates. The legislation should expressly provide that the rules will apply from taxpayers‘ 2014–15 income years. Comment The new rules apply for any withdrawals or transfers that are made on or after 1 April 2014. Officials consider that this is simple and easy for taxpayers to understand. The submitter‘s suggestions would mean that some taxpayers with non-standard balance dates could start the rules at a different date to other taxpayers, which is likely to be confusing for taxpayers and more difficult to administer. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 44 EXEMPTION PERIOD Clause 8 Issue: Pre-1 April 2014 migrants should receive an exemption period Submission (Ernst & Young, Financial Services Council, Offen Advisors Limited, Owens Tax Advisors Limited) Submitters are concerned that under the current drafting, it is not clear that residents who arrived before 1 April 2014 would be eligible for an exemption period. They request clarification that once the new provisions apply, they would also be capable of applying to all persons who held foreign superannuation interests as at 1 April 2014. Comment Officials consider that the existing drafting is sufficiently clear that taxpayers who became New Zealand resident before 1 April 2014 would have the exemption period available to them. The proposed legislation applies to foreign superannuation withdrawals derived on or after 1 April 2014. It then works backward to calculate a taxpayer‘s assessable period and thus, their exemption period. This means that for all withdrawals made on or after 1 April 2014, the taxpayer would have an exemption period available to them if they meet the other conditions. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Parity between transitional residents and other residents Submission (Charter Square Services, Ernst & Young) The same restrictions that apply to transitional residents should also apply to other residents in respect of the exemption period (Charter Square Services). Alternatively, the proposals should not have specific rules for transitional residents. Rather, the exemption period should apply to all taxpayers (Charter Square Services). The period of transitional residence may be slightly longer than 48 months in some cases, as the 48 months runs from the month in which an individual obtains a permanent place of abode or exceeds 183 days‘ presence in New Zealand within a 12-month period. This should also apply for other new residents who are not transitional residents to achieve parity of treatment (Ernst & Young). 45 Comment The current law provides for a four-year exemption for new migrants who meet the criteria for being a transitional resident. However, migrants who have been away from New Zealand for less than 10 years are not eligible to be a transitional resident. In addition to this, migrants who receive Working for Families tax credits during their transitional residence period will generally cease to be transitional residents. A design feature of the new rules is to extend the four-year exemption to all taxpayers with interests in foreign superannuation schemes that were acquired while they were overseas. This will simplify the rules and ensure that everyone will receive an exemption period regardless of whether they are in receipt of Working for Families tax credits or were non-resident for less than 10 years. The four-year exemption period that is proposed for residents who do not meet the transitional migrant criteria is intended to broadly match the rules for transitional residents. However, the current drafting may lead to differences in the timing of the exemption period. In particular, one submitter states that when a transitional resident receives Working for Families tax credits, they then cease to be a transitional resident. This submitter states that the exemption period would then be cut short for such a taxpayer. There is no such restriction for non-transitional residents who receive Working for Families tax credits (Charter Square Services). This is not the policy intention. Rather, when a transitional resident ceases to be transitional resident part-way during their transitional residence period, their exemption period should still continue for the full 48 months. This is discussed in further detail in ―Issue: Ceasing to be a transitional resident and the impact on the exemption period‖. Officials consider that the exemption period available to non-transitional residents should be aligned with the exemption period that applies to transitional residents. As such, it is recommended that the provision in the transitional residents rules that may result in a transitional residence period of slightly longer than 48 months should also be available to non-transitional residents in relation to their exemption period. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials‘ comments. 46 MISCELLANEOUS Issue: When is a transfer ―received‖? Clause 8 Submission (Charter Square Services) There can be a long time delay between when a foreign superannuation scheme releases the funds of an individual and when the receiving New Zealand fund cashes in the cheque. The time at which the transfer is received should be clarified as it could impact the individual‘s tax liability. Comment Officials understand that when an individual transfers their foreign superannuation interest into a New Zealand or Australian scheme, it is ―received‖ when the New Zealand or Australian scheme receives it. Officials consider that this could be clarified in guidance. We understand that the submitter is concerned that when a taxpayer makes an application to transfer their foreign superannuation scheme towards the end of an income year, the New Zealand scheme may not receive it until part–way through the next income year. This would have the result of pushing the taxpayer into a higher schedule year fraction. Officials note that this timing of income is a standard feature of the Income Tax Act 2007 and that taxpayers have sufficient opportunity to plan when to transfer their scheme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 47 Issue: Tax bracket creep Clause 8 Submission (KPMG) The tax rate which applies to a lump-sum withdrawal should be calculated with reference to the taxpayer‘s average New Zealand income in the year of withdrawal and the previous four years, or else added to a taxpayer‘s income, and spread over the year of withdrawal and the following four years. Comment This would add unnecessary complexity, as the taxpayer would be required to obtain further information about previous income years or would be required to file IR 3 income tax returns for more years than required under the rules as currently proposed. The issue raised by the submitter also exists in relation to other lump-sum payments, such as lump sum compensatory payments. No similar relief is provided other lump sums. As such, any decision here would set a precedent for other lump sum payments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: De minimis threshold Clause 8 Submission (Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited) There should be an aggregate $50,000 de minimis exemption for transfers to QROPS or KiwiSaver. The submitters argue that this would encourage compliance as taxpayers would be able to transfer relatively small foreign superannuation scheme interests to New Zealand without penalty. Comment Officials note that the proposed rules do not penalise taxpayers who transfer their foreign superannuation interests to New Zealand. The tax imposed on the transfer would be the same as if the taxpayer had accounted for tax on accrual. A de minimis exception from certain tax requirements is sometimes appropriate where the compliance costs outweigh the tax involved. Officials consider that the proposed rules are as simple as possible while still maintaining fairness, and therefore do not believe that a case can be made for a de minimis threshold. 48 Officials also note that no precedent for an exemption from tax for de minimis amounts exists under the current rules. There is a de minimis exception available under the FIF regime, but this does not meant the taxpayer is exempt from tax altogether. The taxpayer would instead be required to account for tax paid when the income is received, either as a lump sum or a pension. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Past non-compliance should be given a full amnesty, but the schedule method should be more punitive Clauses 25, 106, 116 and 117 Submission (Charter Square Services) The 15% option for past non-compliance should be reduced to 0%, but going forward the schedule method should be more punitive so that taxpayers are encouraged to transfer during the exemption period. \[Raised in the oral submission\] Comment This submission consists of two points that are to be considered together. The submitter argues that providing a full amnesty would reduce the number of resources Inland Revenue would otherwise divert into audit activity. Furthermore, it would encourage migrants who have not transferred their retirement savings to New Zealand to do so before 31 March 2014, thereby bringing a large amount of money into the New Zealand tax base. Officials do not agree that the submitter‘s arguments outweigh the consequences that would occur from rewarding non-compliance. As noted in the issue “past non- compliance should not be pursued” a 0% rate for past non-compliance would adversely affect voluntary compliance, which is a cornerstone principle of New Zealand‘s tax administration system. The submitter provides that in conjunction with this full amnesty, the schedule method needs to be more punitive once a taxpayer‘s exemption period has expired. To achieve this, the submitter proposes that once the exemption period has ended, the assessable period would be calculated from their first day as a New Zealand resident. The effect of this is that in the fifth year of residence, the schedule year fraction would be 23.07% rather than the 4.76% as currently proposed. The rationale is that by making the rate more punitive, it would encourage more migrants to transfer their retirement savings to New Zealand during the exemption 49 period. This would have the effect of bringing the funds into the New Zealand tax base sooner. Officials disagree with this analysis as the tax implications of the transfer of a foreign superannuation interest are often an afterthought. We do not believe that making the schedule method more punitive would have a significant effect on the number of transfers made during the exemption period. Officials are also opposed to this submission because it creates a cliff face in the schedule method. The schedule method is designed as a sliding scale. Under the submitter‘s approach, a difference of one day could see a taxpayer being assessed on 23.07% of a lump sum rather than 0%. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Review section 70 of the Social Security Act 1964 No clause Submission (Grey Power New Zealand Federation Incorporated) Section 70 of the Social Security Act 1964 should be objectively reviewed, with the objective being to devise a commensurate arrangement for existing immigrant retirees. Comment The submitter argues that the proposed changes heavily incentivise individuals to withdraw their foreign superannuation and transfer the proceeds to New Zealand. They argue that the proposed changes bestow a favourable option on new immigrants that was not available to existing retirees, because the only practical option available to existing immigrant retirees was to leave their contributions in foreign superannuation schemes until they matured in the form of an annuity or indexed periodic remittance. Officials note that the proposals in the bill are aimed at ensuring that there is no disincentive for taxpayers to transfer their foreign superannuation to a New Zealand superannuation scheme compared to leaving their superannuation overseas (rather than providing an incentive). In broad terms, we do not consider that the proposals create a relative disadvantage for taxpayers who can only take their foreign superannuation in the form of an annuity or periodic remittance. The submitter states that this perceived inequity may be resolved by arranging an objective review of section 70 of the Social Security Act 1964. Section 70 of the Social Security Act 1964 provides for the deduction of an individual‘s foreign social security pension from their New Zealand Superannuation entitlement. This deduction occurs when the foreign social security pension forms part of a programme of benefits and pensions that are paid for similar circumstances as New Zealand benefits and pensions; 50 and the overseas pension scheme is administered by the government of the country that pays the pension. Officials note that this issue is not related to the contents of the bill. In discussions between officials from Inland Revenue, Treasury, and Ministry of Social Development, it was noted that no review of section 70 of the Social Security Act 1964 is planned. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Social security agreement between New Zealand and the United Kingdom Submission (Matter raised by Committee) The Committee requested further information regarding whether there should be a social security agreement between the UK and New Zealand to account for social security pensions paid by the UK, which currently are not indexed for inflation. Comment Officials understand that a social security agreement currently exists between New Zealand and the UK. Social security agreements are negotiated and administered by the Ministry of Social Development, and are not affected by the proposals in the Bill. Officials have consulted with the Ministry of Social Development, who have provided the information set out below. The Social Security Agreement between New Zealand and the UK The text of the Social Security Agreement between New Zealand and the UK was last revised in 1983 and was specified in the Social Security (Reciprocity with the United Kingdom) Act 1983. This Act was revoked on 1 April 1990 and replaced by the ̳Social Welfare (Reciprocity with the United Kingdom) Order 1990‘ (the Agreement) from that same date but the text remained unchanged. The Agreement determines access to and treatment of social security payments between the countries and ensures that the two countries share the benefit and pension costs of mutual clients. In general, the Agreement provides the following benefits: • people from the UK who move to New Zealand can use the Agreement to help them meet the residence criteria for New Zealand benefits that are covered by the Agreement 51 • New Zealanders who live in the UK can use their New Zealand residence to help them meet the residential/contribution criteria for UK benefits and pensions. In 1983 when the Agreement was last revised, New Zealand had no ability to make payments to superannuitants who were residing in any overseas country. Consequently, the UK Agreement reflects that position. Under the Agreement, New Zealand benefits are not payable to residents of the United Kingdom, However, as the Agreement allows periods of residence in New Zealand to be treated as periods of contributions in the UK, former New Zealand residents, provided that they have not lived in a country other than New Zealand or the UK, are able to access the basic United Kingdom State Pension at the full standard rate. New Zealand‘s ability to pay pensions overseas was introduced from 1 April 1990 and the social security agreements that New Zealand has entered into since that time, such as the Netherlands Agreement, allow for payment of New Zealand Superannuation to overseas residents. Non-indexation of UK pensions paid to New Zealand residents and a revision of the Agreement UK pensioners living overseas in certain countries, including New Zealand, Australia, Canada and South Africa, have their UK State Pension rates ―frozen‖. In other words, their State Pension is paid at the same rate as it was when they first became entitled, or the date they left the UK if they were already pensioners then. The frozen rates do not apply to people living in countries where a reciprocal social security agreement with the UK allows for increases to be paid or where a person lives in a European Economic Area (EEA) country. The New Zealand/UK Agreement does not provide for UK pension increases. Officials note that this issue is not related to the contents of the bill. However, officials from the Ministry of Social Development have advised that they have discussed the frozen pension policy with UK officials. UK officials have advised that there are no plans to amend this policy for UK pensioners residing in New Zealand. New Zealand officials from the Ministry of Social Development will continue to discuss the subject with UK officials when the opportunity arises. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 52 DRAFTING CLARIFICATIONS Issue: Use of 15% option after the 2014–15 income year Clause 25 Submission (Matter raised by officials) When a non-compliant taxpayer chooses to use the 15% option in proposed CZ 21B in an income year after 2014–15, they should have their 2014–15 income year reassessed. Comment Consider the situation where a non-compliant taxpayer chooses in, say, the 2018–19 income year to use the 15% option in relation a lump sum derived before 1 April 2014. The current drafting allows the taxpayer to return the 15% in their 2018–19 income tax return. However, the drafting provides that the due date associated with the tax on that 15% would be that of the 2014–15 income year. This would not be feasible for Inland Revenue‘s systems as it would require there to be a split due date for the person‘s terminal tax liability in 2018–19 income year. The drafting should be amended so that in such a scenario, the taxpayer should have their 2014–15 income tax return reassessed by Inland Revenue in order to use the 15% option. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. . Issue: DTA and Australian pension override Clause 8 Submission (Ernst & Young) The legislation should expressly provide that the provisions of CF 3 are subject to applicable double tax agreements (DTAs) and the exemptions in CW29 and CW 29B. Comment Officials consider that the existing legislation is sufficiently clear that the applicable DTAs and the exemptions in CW29 and CW 29B apply to the proposed regime in CF 3. 53 The proposed legislation has been drafted so that CF 3(1) identifies which particular events are considered to be taxable. Officials do not consider it necessary that the proposed legislation should expressly provide that proposed CF 3 is subject to the exemptions in CW 29 and CW 29B. Subpart CW deals with exempt income. In particular, CW 29 and CW 29B exempt from income tax transfers between certain Australian superannuation schemes and transfers from Australian superannuation schemes into KiwiSaver. It follows that CF 3 would be subject to the provisions of CW. Double tax agreements have an overriding effect under BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. However, officials will consider these points for the purposes of any future guidance to be released. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Explicit legislative clarification that transfers to purchase an annuity are not income Clause 8 Submission (Ernst & Young) The legislation should also expressly provide that withdrawals/transfers/commutations to purchase an annuity from a foreign provider are not income (Ernst & Young). Comment Under the proposed rules, the policy intention is that transfers from one foreign scheme to another foreign scheme will not be taxable. (This does not apply to transfers to Australian schemes, because subsequent withdrawals from Australian schemes are generally not taxable under New Zealand law). The policy intention is that this would also apply where the transfer is made in order to purchase an annuity from another foreign superannuation scheme. Officials consider that the drafting is sufficiently clear on this point. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 54 Issue: Explicit legislative clarification of events that are not taxable Clause 8 Submission (Ernst & Young, KPMG) The legislation should expressly provide that transfers between foreign superannuation schemes outside Australia are not income (Ernst & Young). The legislation should clarify that a person who ceases to be a resident of New Zealand does not automatically trigger a taxing event (KPMG). Comment The proposed legislation has been drafted so that CF 3(1) identifies which particular events are considered to be taxable. It is implicit that the cessation of New Zealand residence is not a taxable event and no other part of the Income Tax Act 2007 would impose such an ―exit tax‖. It is also implicit that transfers between non-Australian foreign superannuation schemes, or where the funds are used to purchase an annuity would not be taxable. Officials acknowledge that these submitters wish to improve the clarity of the proposed legislation, but consider that adding a specific provision to proposed CF 3 detailing events that are specifically not taxable would add unnecessary complexity to the proposed legislation. It could also create confusion as certain events may not appear in legislation as either taxable or non-taxable. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Multiple assessable periods Clause 8 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The legislation needs to be amended so that multiple periods of residence are aggregated when calculating a taxpayer‘s assessable period, if a taxpayer has more than one period of residence for a given foreign superannuation interest. Comment The submission concerns someone who becomes resident with a foreign superannuation interest, ceases to be a resident, then becomes resident again. 55 The policy intention is at that all periods of residence during which the interest has been held will be aggregated for the purposes of calculating the assessable period. Officials consider that the current drafting does not achieve this policy intention. If an individual held an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme during two different periods of residence, the current drafting would only calculate the assessable period in reference to the second period of residence. The current wording of the legislation would effectively ignore the first period of residence. To ensure that the proposed legislation works as intended, a legislative amendment is required. As the policy intention is that there would only be one assessable period for each foreign superannuation interest belonging to a person, further changes may be required to proposed CF 3(10) and CF 3(15)(d) which refer to ―an assessable period‖. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. The matter has been referred to drafters. Issue: Ceasing to be a transitional resident and the impact on the exemption period Clause 8 Submission (Charter Square Services, Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section CF3(3)(a) says ―a person who is a transitional resident‖, but it should be ―qualifies as a transitional resident‖ (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants). Someone who is a transitional resident but then ceases to be because they apply for a WINZ benefit will not benefit from a full four-year exemption period under the current drafting (Charter Square Services). Section CF 3(4)(a) should refer to both HR 8(2) and (3) (Ernst & Young). Comment Proposed section CF 3(3)(a) refers to someone who is a transitional resident under HR 8(2) disregarding any choice under HR 8(4). HR 8(2) provides the conditions under which a person may qualify as a transitional resident. HR 8(4) provides that a person is no longer a transitional resident either by choice or if they receive Working for Families tax credits. One submitter states that if an election to not be treated as a transitional resident is made under HR 8(4), then CF 3(3)(a) would not work in its current form. This is because the person is not a transitional resident(New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants). 56 The policy intention behind CF 3(3)(a) is that a person who otherwise qualifies as a transitional resident but is not a transitional resident because they receive working for families tax credits, should still receive a four-year exemption period. This is why proposed CF 3(3)(a) states ―... disregarding any choice under section HR 8(4)‖. Officials acknowledge that the current drafting may not achieve this result. The submitter‘s suggestion may solve this issue. Another submitter states that a person ceases to be a transitional resident when they apply for a benefit from Work and Income New Zealand. They are concerned that if this occurs partway through the four-year period, they would not get the benefit of the full exemption period (Charter Square Services). Officials note that HR 8(4) and subsequently HR 8(5) do not prevent an individual from being a transitional resident if they are in receipt of a benefit. As such, it is not the benefit from Work and Income New Zealand that disqualifies the person from being a transitional resident. We do note, however, that Work and Income New Zealand may include certain Working for Families tax credits in the benefit that is provided to the individual. In this scenario, it is intended that the taxpayer would still receive the full four-year exemption period. As stated above, this is why proposed CF 3(3)(a) states ―... disregarding any choice under section HR 8(4)‖. The alternate wording provided by the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants may also resolve the concern raised by Charter Square Services. Officials agree that the proposed wording of CF 3(3)(a) may require amendment to reflect that a person who qualifies as a transitional resident but elects not to be one, should still receive a full exemption period. Officials note that the HR 8(3) provides for the calculation of the period of transitional residence. The timing of the exemption period for taxpayers who qualify as transitional residents (regardless of any choice under HR 8(4)) is the period provided by the transitional residence rules Officials agree that proposed CF 3(4)(a) which provides this should refer to HR 8(3). Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials‘ comments. 57 Issue: Definition of ―exemption commencement‖ and ―exemption period‖ Clause 8 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society) The timing of the ―exemption commencement‖ should be made clearer. The definitions of ―exemption commencement‖ and ―exemption period‖ should be made clearer as they are difficult to follow as presently drafted. The submitters acknowledge that the intention of the legislation is to have the exemption period begin when the person became resident (either under domestic legislation or for the purposes of a double tax agreement). The submitters are of the view that the current drafting does not give a specific start date for the exemption period. It should be defined as the date upon which the relevant individual becomes a New Zealand resident who is not a non-resident for the purposes of a double tax agreement. One submitter has provided possible alternative drafting that could clarify when the exemption period would start (New Zealand Law Society). Comment Officials agree that this provision may be able to be made clearer. Officials also note that the provision as it relates to the start date of exemption period for non-transitional residents could also be improved. Currently, the bill provides that the start of the exemption period for a person who is not a transitional resident is either 1. when the person becomes a New Zealand resident, or 2. when they ―tiebreak‖ to New Zealand under a DTA (if they are a non-resident under a double tax agreement). The second part of the provision was included to deal with the situation of a person who is resident under New Zealand‘s domestic law, but who is treated as a non-resident of New Zealand under a double tax agreement. For example, they might own a house in New Zealand, then live and work in the UK for 7 years and acquire an interest in a UK scheme (while retaining ownership of their house in New Zealand), and then move back to New Zealand. Without the second part of the provision, it was unclear on which date their exemption period would start. Officials now consider the concern originally identified would generally no longer arise, because Inland Revenue considers that a person will not retain their New Zealand residence under domestic law solely because they own a house in New Zealand. 58 As a result, the second part of the provision is no longer relevant. This would also have the advantage of being more consistent with the exemption period start date for transitional residents. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials‘ comments. Issue: Definition of ―foreign superannuation withdrawal‖ and ―super withdrawal‖ Clause 8 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The term ―super withdrawal‖, which is used in sections CF 3(7) and (9) should be replaced with ―foreign superannuation withdrawal‖, and CF 3(8)(a) and (10)(a) should be repealed. Comment The submitter notes that ―foreign superannuation withdrawal‖ is defined in section CF 3(1). ―Super withdrawal‖ is defined in section CF 3(8)(a) and (10)(a) as the amount of foreign superannuation withdrawal, for the purposes of CF 3(7) and (9), respectively. The submitter appreciates that this drafting may try to improve the clarity of the legislation for readers, but argues that it is unnecessarily convoluted. Officials note that where ―super withdrawal‖ appears in proposed 3(7) and (9), it is as part of a formula. This means that it is necessary to subsequently state what the terms in each formula are. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Use of ―transit‖ as a term Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) In clause 8, section CF 3(11) and (15), the term ―opening value‖ should be used rather than ―transit‖. 59 Comment The term ―transit‖ means the opening value of the person‘s interest in the scheme at the beginning of their assessable period. This should be amended to ―opening value‖ instead, which is a term used in other parts of the Income Tax Act 2007, and is more descriptive. Officials agree with the submitter‘s analysis. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of assessable period Clause 8 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Clause 8 Section CF 3(5)(a) currently reads ―beginning from the last of‖. This should read ―beginning from the last day‖. Comment Proposed section CF 3(5)(a) provides when a taxpayer‘s assessable period should begin. It takes into account a number of factors such as if a person receives an exemption period, and if not, when they became resident or when they first acquired an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme. The policy intention is that the assessable period should begin when the last of the events listed in proposed CF 3(5)(a) occurs. Officials consider that wording proposed is appropriate and does not require amendment. However, officials note that the proposed change to restrict the new rules to interests in foreign superannuation schemes that were first acquired while the taxpayer was non- resident would result in minor amendment to proposed CF 3(5)(a) to ensure that it operates correctly. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 60 Issue: Residence under a double tax agreement Clause 8 Submission (Ernst & Young) The current drafting CF 3(16)(a) refers to a person who ―is a New Zealand resident and is a non-resident under no double tax agreement‖. It does not read clearly or easily, so it should be amended. In contrast, CF 3(3) refers to ―a New Zealand resident who is not a non-resident under a double tax agreement‖ which is much simpler to read. Comment Officials will consider whether the drafting could be improved. Recommendation That the submission be noted. The matter has been referred to drafters. Issue: Definition of ―distribution time‖ Clause 8 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) There should be a general definition of ―distribution time‖. Comment ―Distribution time‖ is defined in the proposed section CF (8)(c)(iii) for the purposes of the formula in the proposed section CF 3(7). However, there is no corresponding definition for that term as it is used in sections CF 3(10) and CF 3(15). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. The matter has been referred to drafters. 61 Issue: Definition of ―distributed gain‖ and ―gains out‖ Clause 8 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The drafting in relation to the ―gains out‖ definition (proposed section CF 3(10)(b)) is difficult to follow and is at risk of being circular, as ―gains out‖ is a component of the ―distributed gain‖ definition but uses the ―distributed gain‖ definition itself. Comment Officials note that the intention of the ―gains out‖ term is to capture what has previously been calculated as the ―distributed gain‖ for withdrawals in previous income years in relation to this taxpayer and foreign superannuation scheme. As ―gains out‖ captures past calculations of ―distributed gain‖, the drafting is not circular where lump-sum withdrawals have been in the past. If the taxpayer has not previously taken any lump-sum withdrawals, then the value of ―gains out‖ is zero. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of ―contributions‖ in CF 3(12)(d) Clause 8 Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Ernst & Young) The definition of ―contributions‖ in proposed section CF 3(12)(d) should refer to ―recognised contributions under subsection (16)‖. Comment The current drafting of CF 3(12)(d) refers to ―contributions to the interest in the scheme made before the distribution time‖. This is inappropriately broad as it would allow a taxpayer to take a deduction for contributions made before they were New Zealand resident. This would lead to under-taxation. Officials intended that only contributions made during a person‘s assessable period should be deductible, subject to other conditions. 62 The drafting proposed by the submitter would be consistent with other sections where a deduction for certain contributions is allowed (CF 3(7), the corresponding definition in CF 3(8)(b), CF 3(14), and the corresponding definition in CF 3(15)(d)). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of ―withdrawals‖ in CF 3(12)(b) Clause 8 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Proposed section CF 3(12)(b) should be amended to ensure that only withdrawals in the ―assessable period‖ are taken into account in that definition, for the purposes of calculating the ―calculated gains fraction‖ in CF 3(11). Comment The definition of ―calculated gains fraction‖ in proposed section CF 3(11) incorporates ―withdrawals‖ and ―contributions‖. A taxpayer is only permitted a deduction for ―contributions‖ where they have been made at a time when the taxpayer was New Zealand resident. The submitter notes, however, that there is no such requirement for the purposes of the ―withdrawals‖ definition. A corresponding requirement should apply for withdrawals, as any withdrawal made prior to a taxpayer becoming New Zealand resident should not be relevant for the purposes of determining gains accrued during the assessable period. This would have the effect of overstating the gains that have accrued to the individual while they were New Zealand resident. Officials agree that this is not the intended result. It was intended that only distributions made during a person‘s assessable period would be relevant for the calculated gains fraction. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 63 Issue: Definition of ―accrued total‖ in CF 3(15)(d) Clause 8 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Proposed section CF 3(15)(d) should be amended to ensure that only distributions in the ―assessable period‖ are taken into account in that definition. Comment This issue is similar to that titled ―Definition of ―withdrawals‖ in CF 3(12)(b)‖ For the purposes of the formula in CF 3(14), CF 3(15)(d) provides a definition of the term ―accrued total‖. This term takes into account all previous distributions, but only recognised contributions to the extent that they were made during the person‘s assessable period. This would have the effect of overstating the gains that have accrued to the individual while they were New Zealand resident. This is not an intended result. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: ―Gains out‖ Clause 8 Submission (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Law Society) ―Gains out‖ is used in two slightly different manners in CF 3(9) and CF 3(15)(a), which could cause confusion. The term in CF 3(15)(a) should instead be ―distributed gain‖ as it refers directly to what was calculated in CF 3(9). Comment The dual use of ―gains out‖ is unintended as they do not bear the same meaning. ―Gains out‖ defined in proposed CF 3(15)(a) refers to the formula in CF 3(13). As the formula method requires the calculation of more than one formula, multiple uses of a term with different meanings may unduly increase the complexity of the method. Officials agree with the analysis provided by submitters. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 64 Issue: Incorrect reference to ―distributed gain‖ Clause 18 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Proposed section CW 28C(a) refers to the ―distributed gain‖ given by section CF 3(7). It should instead refer to the ―assessable withdrawal amount‖ which would be consistent with proposed section CW 28C(b). Comment The submission is correct as CW 28C(a) makes reference to CF 3(7), which contains the formula used to calculate the ―assessable withdrawal amount‖. ―Distributed gain‖ has a different meaning and would be incorrect in this context. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.. 65 FURTHER GUIDANCE No clause Issue: Formula method example in bill commentary Submission (New Zealand Law Society, PricewaterhouseCoopers) The example in the bill commentary does not illustrate how the ―grow rate‖ should operate. This should be provided in further guidance (New Zealand Law Society). The example in the bill commentary incorrectly refers to the value of the interest at the time of migration, rather than at the beginning of the assessable period. The commentary should be clarified to prevent any mismatch (PricewaterhouseCoopers). Comment The example in the bill commentary relating to the formula method only covers the formulae in proposed CF 3(9)–(12). This can be found on page 15 of the bill commentary. The calculation of the ―grow rate‖ found in proposed CF 3(13)–(15) were not provided due to the length of the example. Officials agree with the submission that the remainder of the example should be published in a guidance document. The example sets out a scenario for ―Thomas‖. It states that ―Thomas migrates to New Zealand with a foreign superannuation scheme worth NZ$100,000‖. Thomas would receive a four-year exemption period so to use the formula method, Thomas would need to know the value of the fund at the end of his exemption period (and beginning of his assessable period). The current drafting achieves this, but the example is incorrect. The example should state that the scheme was worth NZ$100,000 at the beginning of his assessable period once his exemption period had expired. Officials agree that this error should be corrected in future guidance. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 66 Issue: Publication of the proposed changes Submission (KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed changes, once enacted, should be publicised as widely as possible. Comment Inland Revenue is working on a communication strategy for the proposed changes, which will explain the changes to affected taxpayers. The messages will depend on what a person‘s circumstances are. The communications strategy will take into account Inland Revenue‘s range of communication methods, including working with relevant industries and practitioners. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 67 Mineral mining 68 69 MINERAL MINING Clause 13 Issue: Exploration expenditure and the claw-back rule Submissions (Straterra, OceanaGold, Ernst & Young, Solid Energy New Zealand Limited/New Zealand Coal & Carbon Limited, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Newmont Waihi Gold Limited) 1. The proposal to claw-back exploration expenditure that produces an asset used in the extraction of minerals should not go ahead. 2. Such a claw-back rule is contrary to the tax treatment of research and development (R&D) expenditure and feasibility expenditure, and general taxation principles. 3. The distinction between the exploration and development phases is clear (or at least not substantially worse than any other boundary issues in taxation), so the claw-back rule is redundant. 4. Australia does not have any claw-back rule in its regime. 5. Any issues can be dealt with through the usual audit and anti-avoidance measures. Comment Officials do not accept the analogy between mining exploration expenditure and R&D. R&D expenditure is designed to create a novel product or process. By contrast, mining exploration expenditure is more likely to be using existing techniques to uncover a new mineral deposit. This is not to say that a mining company cannot incur R&D expenditure if it is developing a new product or process. Officials do accept the analogy between exploration expenditure and feasibility expenditure, but do not consider that this is a reason for dispensing with the proposed claw-back rule. Submitters have pointed out that, in the ordinary course of events, a taxpayer is required to make a judgement as to whether or not a deduction is available. Once that decision is made then the taxpayer is locked into that decision. This reasoning ignores the fact that self-assessments can be amended at later times, either through the disputes procedure or by the agreement of the Commissioner. However, more fundamental is the apparent assumption by some submitters that feasibility expenditure is always deductible. Submitters have referred to the Commissioner‘s interpretation statement on feasibility expenditure (IS 08/02: Deductibility of Feasibility Expenditure) to support the proposition that exploration expenditure should be subject to the normal tax rules that relate to feasibility. Officials note that the interpretation statement states, at paragraph 8: 70 ...for feasibility expenditure to be deductible... there must be a sufficient relationship or nexus between the expenditure and the taxpayer‘s business or income-earning activity. Any expenditure incurred before the establishment of a business or an income- earning process will not fulfil this statutory nexus because the expenditure will have been incurred too soon. Officials therefore consider that, for a newly-established mining operator, prospecting and exploration expenditure may never be deductible because there is no income- earning activity for the expenditure to relate to. In this respect, the automatic deduction for prospecting and exploration expenditure provided for in the bill is concessionary to such miners, and creates certainty to all miners in that they do not have to determine how their expenditure would be treated if it were subject to the general feasibility rules. When a line is drawn in tax legislation between expenditure that is immediately deductible and expenditure that is required to be capitalised, this will generally create an incentive for affected taxpayers to reclassify expenditure in favour of the category for which immediate deductions are available. Officials accept that, by allowing a category of expenditure to always have immediate deductions (exploration expenditure), the proposed rules create this incentive. The claw-back rule is designed to address this tension. If expenditure is incorrectly classified, deductions will be added back as income and depreciated. It also addresses the situation that a miner may face in circumstances where they are genuinely unsure as to whether expenditure will create a lasting asset or simply be unsuccessful exploration expenditure. If no lasting asset is created, the deduction will remain in place. If it transpires that the expenditure has created an asset that will be used during the extraction process, it is the economically correct result that the expenditure be added back and depreciated over the useful life of the asset created (in this case, a mine). Submitters have commented that, in almost all cases, the claw-back rule will have no practical application. The submissions note that mining operators take the decision to move from an exploration phase to a development phase very seriously because committing to development is committing significant financial resources. Decisions of this nature will invariably be taken at board level and detailed records will be available to identify when one phase ends and the other begin. Officials accept that this may be the case. However, this is not sufficient justification for removing the claw-back rule. The rule is designed largely to remove the incentive to reclassify expenditure. In many respects, if it never gets used, it will be a mark of its success, rather than of its inherent failure. In any event, even when the decision to move to development is clearly marked in time, this does not mean that some expenditure has not been inadvertently misclassified in the prospecting phase. Submissions have also pointed out the difficulty that a mineral miner may have in apportioning expenditure that is subject to the claw-back rule. An example raised in oral submissions was that a miner might build five roads into a site during the exploration phase and only use one of those roads in the extraction process. Officials accept that, in circumstances such as these, some sort of apportionment will be necessary. However, the requirement to apportion expenditure is a regular feature of tax legislation and it is generally achieved by fair and reasonable methods. Officials do 71 not consider an apportionment exercise carried out to comply with the claw-back rule to be any different in this regard. Officials note the situation in Australia but do not consider regimes operated in other jurisdictions to be determinative of what is appropriate for the New Zealand context. However, an accurate apportionment does however hinge off having appropriate records on which to base it on. On this subject, officials have also considered a point that was raised by the technical advisor to the Select Committee. The advisor has pointed out that it would be difficult for a taxpayer to comply with the claw-back rule in any period where they were no longer required to keep records for tax purposes. Officials have sympathy with this view and therefore consider that the application of the claw-back rule should be limited to expenditure incurred in a period for which the miner is required to keep records for the purposes of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Although this arguably creates an incentive for a miner to extend their development phase to avoid the application of the claw-back rule, officials do not consider this will be a substantial issue in practice. It is not the aim of these rules to impose record-keeping requirements on mineral miners over and above those that apply to other taxpayers. Recommendation That the submissions be declined, except that the claw-back rule be limited in its application to the period for which a miner would be required to keep records for tax purposes. Issue: Timing of the claw-back rule is uncertain Clause 13 Submission (Newmont Waihi Gold Limited) The claw-back rule applies to expenditure incurred after the 2012-13 income years under DU 1(1)(b), but that provision does not apply until the 2014-15 income year. Comment Officials agree that the claw-back rule should only apply to expenditure incurred after the new rules take effect. This will avoid unnecessary retrospective application. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 72 Issue: ―Life of Mine‖ concept for depreciation purposes Clause 35 Submission (Solid Energy New Zealand Limited/New Zealand Coal & Carbon, Ernst & Young, Straterra, PricewaterhouseCoopers, OceanaGold, Newmont Waihi Gold Limited) The proposed use of the assumed life of the mine as the basis of spreading mining development expenditure should not go ahead (Oceana). The straight line and diminishing value methods of depreciation provided for in the bill do not adequately reflect the realities of the industry. Income is ̳lumpy‘ and depreciation should be allowed to follow this income pattern. The most effective way of achieving this would be to allow depreciation on a ―unit of production‖ or ―extraction‖ basis, or at least an option to deduct on that basis. This would more closely align the treatment with that of the coal and petroleum mining industries. Alternatively, miners who use IFRS or other generally accepted accounting practice for financial reporting purposes should have the option of applying their financial reporting method for income tax purposes, without any adjustments being required (Ernst & Young, Oceana). The rules should allow for deductions when mines are ―mothballed‖ (i.e., abandoned projects). Comment Officials accept that a unit of production basis for determining the life of a mine is an appropriate measure. However, it is important to establish an appropriate denominator for any depreciation calculation using this basis. Officials understand that some miners base their units of production used in their accounts on the units extracted over the ―economically recoverable amount‖. We consider this would be an inappropriate measure for tax purposes because it would be subject to fluctuation in accordance with things like the prevailing commodity prices. It is for this reason that we also disagree with the proposition of final deductions being available if a mine is ―mothballed‖. For example, if a mineral price dropped significantly, a miner might determine that it was no longer economical to recover any more minerals. The mine would be ̳mothballed‘ and all further development expenditure taken as a deduction. If, the following year, the commodity price rose again, the miner might make the decision that more minerals could be extracted at a profit. The miner would be utilising the original development expenditure to restart the mine but would have already claimed all deductions in respect of those assets. Such an outcome would fail to recognise that the development assets have a useful life that at least partly depends on the minerals still being in situ rather than simply the commodity price on any given day. Officials therefore consider that any depreciation on a unit of production basis should take place as a function of the ―proven and probable‖ mineral reserves. Such an outcome is consistent with the proposals in the original officials‘ issues paper that suggested these revised rules and would also be consistent with a depreciation method available to petroleum miners under the Income Tax Act 2007. Officials accept that a unit of production method is probably only of value to miners that produce IFRS accounts. Requiring all miners to produce equivalent accounts just 73 to determine their depreciation calculations may impose significant compliance costs on smaller operators. Therefore, officials consider that the following rules should apply to determine which method is used:  Miners can use the unit of production method, as set out above, if they produce IFRS accounts or otherwise keep appropriate records for this method to be verified; otherwise  Miners can use the methods currently provided for in the bill, meaning they depreciate their costs over a period not shorter than the life of mine estimated in their accounts (or over the period they reasonably estimate the mine to operate if they are not required to perform any such calculations for the purposes of their accounts). Officials consider this combination of methods can provide the maximum flexibility to miners without imposing significant compliance costs – while also providing appropriate outcomes from a policy perspective. However, to avoid additional complexity, officials recommend that, once a person has made their choice of deduction method (when commercial production commences), that method should be retained for the entire life of the mine. Officials accept that any depreciation method has potential to create ̳trapped‘ development expenditure at the end of a mine‘s life. This issue is covered in the ―refundable credit‖ section, below. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted and unit of production method, based on proven and probable reserves, be included as a depreciation method in the bill. Issue: Drafting issues for ―Life of mine‖ Clause 35 Submission (Ernst & Young) The use of the terms ―income year‖ and ―spreading period‖ in proposed sections DU 6 and DU 7 that may cause uncertainty and potentially lead to disputes. Comment Officials agree that confusion in this regard is undesirable. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 74 Issue: Unit of measure: ―mine‖ or ―permit area‖ Clause 35 Submission (OceanaGold, Newmont Waihi Gold Limited, Straterra) Some miners have multiple mines in one permit area, whereas others have a single mine that covers multiple permit areas. Given some mines have shorter life-spans than others in the same permit area, it is penal to enforce depreciation of development expenditure on a permit area basis because some of this expenditure may relate to a relatively short- lived mine. Comment Officials accept that depreciation should generally be based on the estimated useful life of the actual income-producing asset. There are therefore good policy reasons for allowing depreciation deductions over the life of a particular mine if the expenditure is properly attributable to that mine. The concern would be if the rules allowed a miner to inappropriately allocate expenditure to a shorter-life mine in order to accelerate depreciation deductions. Officials have contacted colleagues in the Resource Markets Policy Team of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) to see if the differentiation between ―permit area‖ and ―mine‖ is likely to be significant in practice. MBIE is of the view that almost all mineral miners will only have one mine per permit area, and that the two terms will effectively be interchangeable in those cases. Those miners that do have a mine that covers several permit areas are likely to be large operators that are required to produce audited IFRS accounts. Officials have confidence in the fact that there is a high degree of rigour that goes into these accounts that should prevent costs being misallocated to shorter-life projects. Officials therefore consider that a mineral miner should be able to use an individual mine as the measure for depreciation purposes. However, this option should only be available to miners that produce audited IFRS accounts and the allocation of expenses to individual mines should only be allowed if they are permitted for the purposes of those accounts. If expenses cannot be so allocated, the default position should be that the life of the permit area is the relevant depreciation measure. This approach would appear to provide a full market capture (on the understanding that only large mining operators will have more than one mine), while still preventing inappropriate allocation of expenses in such cases. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to the ―mine‖ option only being available to miners that produce audited IFRS accounts and the allocation of expenses to individual mines should only be allowed if they are permitted for the purposes of those accounts. 75 Issue: Refundable credit for development expenditure Clause 88 Submission (OceanaGold) OceanaGold agree that there should be a tax credit for mineral miners, but are concerned about how it will work in practice and submit that it should have wider application. Depreciating development expenditure over the life of the mine creates the potential for ―black-hole‖ expenditure to arise. This may occur if the depreciation deductions available in the final year of the mine‘s operation exceed any income derived from the mine in that year. The refundable credit mechanism should be extended to cater for this eventuality. Comment Officials accept that this is an issue. It is not the intention of these rules to create black- hole expenditure for miners in the circumstances described. However, officials would be reluctant to recommend a system whereby a mineral miner could obtain a refundable credit in advance of when it was appropriate. The refundable credit mechanism is designed to prevent a miner having deductions at the end of the life of the mine when there is no corresponding income to offset the expenditure. In order to be consistent with this principle, a refundable credit for development expenditure should only be available after mining operations have ceased. To have otherwise may allow a miner to write development expenditure down to zero on the basis that their accounts show the mine has no residual life and, if they had insufficient income in that final year, claim a refundable credit. However, the mine may just be ̳mothballed‘. If the miner then started using the mine again (because the commodity price rose), they would still be using the same assets created by the original development expenditure, but would have claimed all that expenditure as a deduction. To prevent this result, while still producing an appropriate policy outcome, officials consider that the refundable credit should be available for residual development expenditure, but only when it is certain that mining operations have ceased. The most effective way of achieving that result would be to provide that the credit was only available in the year that the miner relinquishes its rights under the relevant permit. ―Relinquish‖ is a term that is already used for the purposes of the petroleum mining rules and there are legislative markers in the Crown Minerals Act that set out when a miner finally surrenders rights to mine an area. Tying the credit to these dates already provided for in relevant statutes will provide certainty to both miners and Inland Revenue in determining when the refundable credit is available in respect of development expenditure. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials‘ comments. 76 Issue: Extend the refundable credit to petroleum miners Clause 88 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The proposed refundable credit rule should be extended to other regimes within the Income Tax Acts such as the petroleum mining sector. There is currently uncertainty as to whether the existing loss carry back rule that applies to petroleum miners can operate beyond the four-year statutory time-bar for amending assessments. Alternatively, the loss offset and refund rules should be revised to ensure that their operation is consistent with the operative provisions in the Income Tax Acts, including the petroleum mining rules. Comment The refundable credit proposed for mineral miners is an economic equivalent to the loss carry back rule available to petroleum miners – in this respect, we consider there is an inherent consistency between the two. This is further demonstrated in the proposed changes to quantum of the tax credit for non-company miners (see ―amount of tax credit‖ submission, below). As the submitter notes, the petroleum loss carry back rule contains a provision that explicitly overrides the statutory time-bar. However, officials consider the policy intent of these provisions is clear. Further, officials are not aware of the argument used by submitters ever being adopted by Inland Revenue to disadvantage a petroleum miner in practice. Officials also consider making the changes proposed in the submission would be inappropriate for the following reasons:  The changes in the current bill are focussed on mineral mining, not petroleum. The petroleum rules are relatively complex and officials would be concerned that amending one part of them without adequate consideration of the rules in general may result in unintended consequences.  Making changes to the petroleum mining rules at this stage in the bill‘s progress would preclude consultation with the wider industry. Officials are reluctant to recommend changes to such a significant sector without providing that industry with an opportunity to comment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 77 Issue: Refundable credit should be based on tax paid by the mining company, not the particular permit area Clause 88 Submission (Newmont Waihi Gold Limited) The refundable credit should be limited to tax paid by the mining company, not ring- fenced to the particular permit area. Comment The refundable credit is designed to ensure that the appropriate amount of tax is paid on a project by project basis. Allowing the refundable credit to operate on a company may allow a company to effectively cash-out a loss on any given mine. Cashing out losses is not a general feature of the New Zealand tax system. 1 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Rehabilitation expenditure Clause 35 Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, Solid Energy New Zealand Limited/New Zealand Coal & Carbon Limited, OceanaGold, Straterra, New Zealand Law Society, Newmont Waihi Gold Limited) Allowing a deduction for rehabilitation expenditure only when it is paid is penal when compared to the general rules. A deduction should be available when:  The expenditure is incurred;  A provision is able to be made in the miner‘s audited accounts for rehabilitation costs. The provision that allows a deduction for rehabilitation expenditure should be stated to supplement the general permission because such deductions may only be available after income-earning activity has ceased. (Ernst & Young) Mining companies will have agreements with agencies such as the Department of Conservation and local authorities to undertake the rehabilitation work. This provides assurance that the work will be carried out. The quantum of the provision is capable of reasonable estimation (PricewaterhouseCoopers). The definition of rehabilitation expenditure is too narrow as it does not refer to all legislation that may require rehabilitation work to be carried out. (OceanaGold) 1 Officials do note the recent issues paper related to the cashing-out of certain types of R&D expenditure, but consider this to be a carefully defined initiative to assist start-up companies, and not something that has application in the context suggested here. 78 Some submitters noted their support for the proposal to allow a tax credit for rehabilitation expenditure where there is insufficient current year income to offset the expenditure (OceanaGold), given the restrictions on the ability to group losses, and the existence of a similar rule for petroleum miners (New Zealand Law Society). Comment The bill provides that a deduction for rehabilitation expenditure is available when the amount is paid. Officials considered this approach provided certainty to the parties concerned and also aligned the deduction to what is understood to be the practice in the petroleum mining sector. Allowing a deduction on the basis of amounts paid is also not unprecedented in the Income Tax Act. 2 However, officials accept that the general rule for deductibility for tax purposes is to allow the deduction when it is incurred. In saying that, officials are concerned that submitters are collapsing the two possible alternative positions into one. Officials consider there are fundamental differences between the legal test of when expenditure is ―incurred‖ and the tests used for accounting purposes to determine whether a provision should be made. This is rightfully so given the two sets of rules ultimately serve slightly different purposes. Accounting rules can be incorporated into tax rules when they produce appropriate policy outcomes. However, there will be circumstances where accounting tests are inappropriate for tax purposes, and officials consider this is such a case. Officials consider that allowing a deduction based on the provisioning in accounts would allow inappropriately large deductions to be taken upfront, when there is insufficient certainty that such expenditure will be incurred for tax purposes. Although it is accepted that provisions in audited accounts are valued and estimated to the best of the person‘s ability, there is considerable uncertainty as to whether the expenditure is accurate, whether the timing of the expenditure is accurate or even if the relevant person will ever incur the expenditure. For example, the legal obligation to carry out rehabilitation expenditure rests with the permit holder. However, a permit is transferable personal property – it is possible for a miner to sell their permit and with it the obligation to perform the rehabilitation work. A provision in the miner‘s accounts is justified because this future obligation will impair the value of the company (and presumably result in a lower purchase price for the permit as the purchaser will also inherit the rehabilitation obligations), but it is not considered to be a reasonable basis on which to allow a tax deduction. Equally, other Government agencies will require undertakings from miners to ensure that the land cannot simply be abandoned after mining has concluded. These arrangements are appropriate to achieve those policy objectives. However, they also are not considered as a suitable measure to quantify tax deductions. Officials have previously mooted the idea of a special account that a miner could contribute to in order to access tax deductions for rehabilitation expenditure 3 but, in responses to the officials‘ issues paper, industry were firmly opposed to this approach. 2 See for example, section EA 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which relates to the deferred payment of employment income 3 Taxation of specified mineral mining: An Officials’ Issues Paper – 31 October 2012, at page 22 79 In summary, officials accept that, for the purpose of consistency, there are good reasons for rehabilitation expenditure to be deductible when it is ―incurred‖. In saying this, it is not anticipated that the change will result in a significant difference in practice from the ―paid‖ test currently in the bill – the legal test for ―incurred‖ (as set out in case law) will still need to be satisfied before a deduction can be taken. For the submissions regarding:  the general permission, officials agree that this change is justified, given expenditure may be incurred after the miner‘s income earning activities have ceased;  definition of rehabilitation expenditure being too narrow, officials accept that the definition should cover other legislation to the extent necessary. Finally, officials consider the changes proposed here will also address an Ernst & Young submission regarding the use of the word ―incurred‖ in proposed section LU 1. Recommendation That the submission that rehabilitation expenditure be deductible when it is incurred be accepted. That the submissions that rehabilitation expenditure be deductible based on provisions in the person‘s accounts be declined. That the submission suggesting that the rehabilitation deduction provision should supplement the general permission be accepted. The submission suggesting that the rehabilitation expenditure definition cover other applicable legislation that may require rehabilitation work to be carried out be accepted. Issue: Definition of ―development expenditure‖ Clause 35 Submissions (Straterra, OceanaGold, Solid Energy New Zealand Limited/New Zealand Coal & Carbon Limited, Ernst & Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Newmont Waihi Gold Limited) The definition of development expenditure in the bill:  is too broad and may capture expenditure that is better described as ―operational‖;  is incomplete and may result in black-hole expenditure being incurred;  should draw a distinction between immovable and movable property;  should distinguish between depreciable property and other property (the latter being depreciated over the life of the mine)  should be expanded to include vessels to accommodate the fact that mining can take place offshore (PricewaterhouseCoopers); 80  operational mining expenditure should be deductible in the year incurred rather than spread over the life of the mine (Ernst & Young, Straterra). Comment The definition of ―development expenditure‖ is essentially designed to capture the costs of developing the mine to the point when commercial extraction can begin and any expenditure after that point that has an enduring benefit to the mining operations. In this respect, the rules attempt to mimic the general tax rules – in that expenditure on creating a capital asset is capitalised into the cost of that asset and any ̳capital improvements‘ that are made after the asset is in operation is similarly capitalised into the cost-base and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset. It is not the intention of the rules to capitalise expenditure that is only related to the day- to-day operation of the mine after commercial production has commenced. Officials consider this can best be addressed by creating a new definition of ―operational expenditure‖ and specifically carving that type of expenditure out of ―development expenditure‖. If this is done, the expenditure that is left will be capital in nature and appropriate to deduct over the life of the mine. With regard to the completeness of the definition, officials consider that the creation of a defined ―operational expenditure‖ term should address this concern. Expenditure incurred after commercial extraction begins will be either ―operational‖ or not. Under officials‘ suggestion, operational expenditure would be subject to the normal tax rules. So if, for example, a miner purchased a piece of plant that was only going to be used for operational expenditure, it would be deductible in accordance with its estimated useful life as a stand-alone piece of plant. Similarly, revenue expenditure for operation matters would be immediately deductible. Assets that are used for multiple purposes should be apportioned in an appropriate manner. Officials do not agree that a distinction should be drawn between movable and immovable property, or that there should be types of property that is always depreciable according to set rules. Immovable property will generally have an estimated useful life that is contingent on the life of the mine, so it is appropriate that it is depreciated over that timeframe. However, that does not mean that movable property cannot be used to create assets of enduring benefit. Take, for example, a digger that is exhausted in the development phase of the mine. From a tax policy perspective, the ̳right‘ outcome is that the cost of that digger is depreciated over the life of the asset it has created; in this case the mine itself. The benefit from the expenditure on that digger lasts for the length of the mine. This can be compared with a similar digger that is only used for extracting minerals – the benefit from its work is only derived while it is still operational so it should be depreciated over its useful life as a stand-alone asset. Officials agree that the addition of ―vessels‖ would add clarity to the definition. 81 Recommendation That a new definition of ―operational expenditure‖ be added to the bill and that operational expenditure should be carved out of the development expenditure definition. The definition of ―development expenditure‖ should include vessels. That the submissions that assets be distinguished by whether they are movable or immovable, or always be classified in a particular way, be declined. Issue: Land expenditure Clause 13 and 35 Submission (Ernst & Young) It is not clear why all land should be treated as revenue account property simply because it may have been acquired in connection with mining operations but are not directly part of those activities. The legislation should clarify how the proposed land rules are intended to interact with the general tax rules for revenue account property. Comment The submission is of the view that because proposed section CU 2 treats land as being on revenue account when it is ―acquired for the purposes of... mining activities...‖ this will capture an inappropriately large amount of land, such as land acquired in other locations for office or administrative purposes. Officials agree that there is no good policy reason for capturing such land within the mining land rules. The policy intent behind the land provisions was only to capture land that includes, or is intended to include, all or part of a permit area. Officials had considered that the use of the term ―mining operations‖, which is itself a defined term in proposed section CU 7, limited the scope of the land rules to such land. However, we accept that the wording in this regard is not as clear as it could be. Officials also agree that it would be useful to clarify the inter-relationship between the proposed rules and the general revenue account property rules so that the specific land rules applied in preference to the general rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted so that:  proposed section CU 2 be clarified to only applying to land that contains all or part of a permit area; and  the specific land rules override the general revenue account property rules. 82 Issue: Premium on land No clause Submission (OceanaGold, Straterra) Any premium paid by a mineral miner for land should be included as ―development expenditure‖ and depreciated over the life of the mine. Comment Officials accept that mineral miners can pay a premium for land, on the basis that the existing landowner will inflate their sale price once they are aware their land may contain mineral deposits. In theory, any overpayment will be for the minerals within that land, so that portion of the expenditure will devalue as those minerals are extracted. However, there are genuine valuation issues associated with attempting to calculate any premium paid. Valuations for land can differ significantly even before mineral deposits are added to the equation. Although officials are aware that there are tax rules for forestry that allow the cost of the trees to be separated from the cost of the land. However, forestry assets are inherently easier to value because they are above land and readily quantifiable. Although a mineral miner will not buy land unless they are relatively certain it will contain commercially viable deposits, officials do not consider that valuing those deposits with sufficient certainty to allow a tax deduction (even over time) is possible. There are also compliance costs issues associated with obtaining such valuations. Officials consider that motivating miners to obtain valuations may result in dead-weight costs being incurred. In officials‘‘ view, the only time that any premium can effectively be valued is at the time the land is disposed of (when the difference between the cost price and the resulting land value is crystallised). The refundable credit for losses made on land sales is designed to address this premium issue. If a mineral miner has actually paid a premium for land and is forced to take a loss when the land is ultimately sold, the credit may be available to ensure that no capital loss is suffered. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 83 Issue: Grouping No clause Submission Mining companies should be allowed to group with non-mining companies. Allowing grouping with any company is consistent with the tax rules that apply to other taxpayers. (KPMG, Straterra, OceanaGold) Grouping should at least be available until a continuity breach (PricewaterhouseCoopers). The general loss rules that apply to all taxpayers should apply to mineral mining. (Solid Energy New Zealand Limited/New Zealand Coal & Carbon Limited, Straterra) Comment Under existing tax rules, which the bill does not propose to significantly alter, a mineral mining company can only form a tax group with other mineral mining companies. This restriction on grouping for miners is seen by officials as inter-related with the existing concession that allows mineral miners‘ losses to survive a continuity breach (in other words, a change in majority shareholding). Under this continuity rule, if a mineral mining company suffers a breach in continuity, any losses in existence at the time of that breach are able to be carried forward to future years. 4 This differs from the general tax rules, under which losses that exist at the time of a continuity breach are permanently forfeited. Officials are concerned that if these losses are allowed to survive a continuity breach, but mining companies were also allowed to group with any other company, opportunities for inappropriate loss trading may arise. The concession around continuity breaches is designed to recognise that mineral mining is a risky, but capital intensive industry. It may be that equity finance is the only way that a start-up miner can raise sufficient funds to make a viable operation. The flip-side of retaining this concession is that losses should only be used to offset mining income. Officials consider the best way to ensure this result is to limit the ability for mining companies to group with non-mining companies that may derive income from other sources. Allowing grouping only up until the point of continuity breach, would solve some of these issues, but would be complicated to administer as it would involve a mining company having different treatment to another mining company. Officials consider it is preferable to treat the industry as a whole and have one set of rules applying to it. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 4 Such losses are only able to be offset by income earned from the relevant permit area. 84 Issue: Loss continuity rules No clause Submission The proposal not to change the rule that allows losses to survive a continuity breach are welcomed. (Straterra, OceanaGold, PricewaterhouseCoopers) The loss continuity rule should be clarified so that it covers all of the new types of expenditure covered in clause 35. (Straterra, OceanaGold) The existing loss continuity rules do not work as intended (OceanaGold) Comment Officials agree that the loss continuity rules should apply to all types of expenditure. This would align them with the current treatment, which is intended to be retained. With regard to possible flaws in the existing rules, officials consider the solution proposed would effective require each mining permit to be treated as a silo so that loss- offset could be maximised. The logical extension of this would be that, in the converse situation when a particular permit area was in profit, a company could not use losses in another permit area to shelter those losses. We do not consider this would be an acceptable solution for the industry. Ultimately, officials consider the loss continuity rules work for the situation they are designed for – when a company is required to breach continuity to raise funds to carry on its operations. Recommendations The submission regarding the types of expenditure that can survive a continuity breach be accepted. The submission regarding possible existing flaws in the continuity rules be declined. 85 Issue: International competiveness No clause Submission (Straterra) The proposed changes demonstrate a lack of understanding of the nature of investment in minerals in New Zealand. It is not about whether or not to allocate a New Zealand investment dollar in minerals or other sectors; it is about being competitive for attracting global minerals investment into New Zealand, as opposed to elsewhere in the world Comment Officials continue to hold the view set out in the Regulatory Impact Statement outlining the proposed changes (http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2013-ris-arfsrm- bill-2.pdf). Of particular relevance to addressing the submitter‘s concerns are paragraphs 15-17 of that statement: 15) Tax concessions that favour one particular industry distort investment decisions and the productivity of capital. Distortions arise in this context if a tax concession induces people to invest in a particular sector that, in the absence of the tax, they would not invest in. If businesses are effectively subsidised through the tax system, it also has the potential to distort the domestic labour market through that industry being in a position to offer remuneration that a non-subsidised business could not match. 16) New Zealand’s framework for taxing inbound capital is based around applying broadly the same tax rules no matter which area of the economy the capital is invested. This is consistent with our broad-base, low rate tax framework. This is why, for example, the same company tax rate applies to companies across the New Zealand economy. The logical extension of option 1 \[maintaining the existing concessionary regime\] would be to abandon this framework and apply lower effective tax rates on foreign investment into certain areas of the economy. Not only would such an approach put the company tax base at extreme risk, it would likely result in unfair and inefficient outcomes. In addition, it would strongly encourage industries to lobby Government for industry-specific tax concessions. 17) Further, we consider that, even if tax settings are a consideration when investing into a certain jurisdiction, they will - provided the rules are not actively discriminatory - be relatively insignificant compared to other factors, such as a country’s infrastructure, the skill of its labour force and the market price of the mineral in question. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 86 Issue: Offsetting losses No clause Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Miners should be able to offset losses from one permit area against income derived in respect of another permit. Comment Apart from the restriction on grouping and ring-fencing of losses that survive a continuity breach, mentioned above, officials consider that losses from one permit area will be able to be used to offset income from another. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Changing structures No clause Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Mining companies should be allowed to change business structures (to, for example, a partnership). A mechanism should be in place to allow this to happen without tax impost. Comment Officials do not consider a mechanism that allows a mineral miner to change business structures is appropriate in this instance. Very often there are sound tax policy reasons for crystallising gains and losses at the time a business structure is changed. The only recent precedent for allowing such a tax free transfer was when loss- attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs) were removed from tax legislation. That was a special case because the LAQC structure was being disbanded. In this instance, there is no impediment to a miner carrying on business in a company structure – in fact officials consider that the vast majority of miners would wish to carry on in that way. Introducing extremely complex rules (the LAQC rules cover approximately 4 pages of legislation) to address a theoretical problem would appear to be unnecessarily complex. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 87 Issue: Amount of tax credit Clause 88 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) That the rate of tax that applies to refundable credits for specified mineral miners who are neither companies nor trustees should be clarified. Comment Officials agree that the amount of the tax credit should be clarified in cases where the credit is available to non-companies. Officials suggest that the credit should be based on the previous year‘s income of the person, subject to the proposed cap on the credit. This would mean that, for an individual, the credit would be limited to the tax paid in the previous year from their mining activities. If that income is insufficient to absorb all of the losses, it would be carried back to the previous year (where the same treatment should apply) and so on. Mining income should be treated as the first income such a person derives. Reimbursing trustees at the trustee rate may overcompensate the trust – particularly if the income from previous years has been distributed to low-income beneficiaries. Officials therefore consider that, in the hands of a trustee, the credit should be limited to the total tax paid by the trustee and its beneficiaries in the previous year. This should be limited to income derived from mining activities in the previous year and based on an assumption that all of the trust‘s income was mining income and was the first to be distributed to beneficiaries. Such rules would be consistent with the policy that the tax credit is the economic equivalent of the loss-carry back rule that applies to petroleum miners. Example: Individual Sam is a ―mineral miner‖ who also has a part-time job. In each of years 1 and 2, Sam earned taxable income of $80,000 in total from is mining activities and $20,000 from his job. At the end of year 2, Sam‘s mining activity ceases and in year 3 Sam incurs $150,000 of rehabilitation expenditure and derives no other income. Sam is entitled to a tax credit. The amount of the credit is calculated by looking back at the total tax paid in the previous years. The first year to consider is year 2. Sam derived $80,000 in taxable income from mining that year. Sam‘s tax liability on that $80,000 was $17,320. Sam still has $70,000 of rehabilitation expenditure that has not been offset, so that is carried back to year 1. Sam‘s $80,000 of taxable mining income from that year exceeds the $70,000 still to be offset, so Sam is required to calculate the credit based on the first $70,000 of income. The tax on $70,0000 is $14,020. Sam‘s total tax credit on his $150,000 rehabilitation expenditure is $17,320 + $14,020 = $31,340. 88 Example: Trust The trustee of the Mining Trust is a ―mineral miner‖. The trust has three beneficiaries: Amy, Ben and Charlie. In year 1, the trust earned $100,000 taxable income. It distributed $20,000 to each of the beneficiaries as beneficiary income and retained $40,000 as trustee income. The beneficiaries are in the following situations for the year:  Amy has carried forward losses of $50,000;  Ben has no income other than that received from the trust;  Charlie is employed on an annual salary of $100,000. At the end of year 1, the trust‘s mining activity ceases and in year 2 it incurs $80,000 of rehabilitation expenditure and derives no other income. The trust is entitled to a tax credit. The beneficiary income from year 1 is required to be counted first. For each $20,000 distribution, the tax liability was as follows:  Amy paid no tax because the distribution simply absorbed some of her losses;  Ben paid tax on $20,000 at $2,520;  Charlie earned a total of $120,000 but his distribution is treated as his first income, meaning his tax liability on the $20,000 is also treated as being $2,520. This makes a total credit from the $60,000 distributed of $5,040. There is still $20,000 of rehabilitation expenditure required to be offset at the trustee tax rate, making an additional credit of $6,600. The trustee‘s total tax credit is therefore $5,040 + 6,600 = $11,640. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials‘ comments. Issue: Application date for changes Clauses 10−12, 13, 19−24, 27, 28, 34, 35, 37, 39, 56−60, 64 76−85, 88 and 103(2), (3), (5) – (7), (12), (14), (15), (17) – (36), (40) –(43), (47−(51) Submission (Newmont Waihi Gold Limited, Ernst & Young) The proposed timing of the changes will give miners with an early balance date insufficient time to change systems to accommodate them. Information needs to be recorded in real-time in order to achieve compliance. The proposed changes are currently expressed as coming into force on 1 April 2014. This should be amended so that they apply from the 2014-15 income years an later. 89 Comment Officials agree that legislation with retrospective effect is not ideal, even if it is only for a very small number of taxpayers. However, although any new rules would alter the tax treatment of various types of expenditure, it does not mean that it will impose increased information-capture responsibilities on miners. Expenditure would need to be recorded whether a deduction was being claimed under the existing rules or the new rules – the difference is how that expenditure is accounted for in tax returns. There is not expected to be filing obligations before these rules take effect. The legislation already provides that the revised rules would apply from the 2014-15 income years, so officials do not consider any changes are required in this regard. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Review of existing depreciation rules No clause Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers, OceanaGold, Newmont Waihi Gold Limited) The depreciation rates for mining should be reviewed with a view to adding additional assets to the relevant depreciation determination and consulting with the industry to determine appropriate useful lives. Comment From a policy perspective, plant and machinery used in mineral mining should be able to be depreciated over its estimated useful life (or, in the case of plant and machinery used to develop the mine, over the life of that mine). Policy officials understand that Inland Revenue‘s depreciation rates have been recently audited by a third party (including those rates applicable to the mining sector). That audit found the current rates to be appropriate. However, officials encourage submitters to contact Inland Revenue if there are items that should be on these tables of rates but are not currently listed. Equally, if there are genuine concerns over the rates that are listed, submitters are welcome to contact the Department to discuss those concerns. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 90 Issue: Depreciation of low-value items No clause Submission (Waihi Gold Limited) The current thresholds under which low-value items can be immediately deducted should be reviewed, and – in the mining context – should be lifted to $5,000 for individual items and $10,000 for a pool of items. Comment Officials note the concerns, but consider this is an issue of application to more than simply mining. There are many capital intensive industries where higher-value items are used more frequently. Any review of these thresholds should be carried out as part of a broader initiative and not be industry specific. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Farm-out rules Clauses 19 and 35 Submission Uncertainty in those rules can currently be mitigated by agreeing an approach with Inland Revenue. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Straterra) It is appropriate to align the farm-out rules with those of petroleum miners. This is an area that could be reviewed at a later date if Inland Revenue agrees there are issues with the application of the rules. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Recommendation That the submission be noted. 91 Canterbury earthquake tax measures 92 93 Issue: Comments on general earthquake-related provisions SOP 257 – clauses 25B, 25C, 37B, 52B, 52C, 52D, 55B and 59B Submission (Corporate Taxpayer’s Group, Deloitte, KPMG, NZICA) These submitters expressed their support for the broad direction of the earthquake- related relief measures, and the amendments that took into account the current state of play with the recovery and rebuild of the Canterbury region. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: The bill extends the time limit for Canterbury Earthquake tax measures from 2015-16 to 2018-19. SOP 257 – clauses 25C, 37B, 52B, 52C, 52D, 55B and 59B Submission (Deloitte, NZICA, KPMG) The proposal to extend the time limit for the Canterbury Earthquake tax measures to 2018-19 is welcome. However, the Government should commit to reviewing the time limit again in 2017. Comment The bill does not preclude a review of the time limit in 2017. Nevertheless, the Government has not signalled an intention to review the time limit unless there is a compelling reason to do so. The progress of the rebuild of Canterbury will clearly have a bearing on this. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 94 Issue: The bill requires that a new property must be ―acquired‖ by 2018-19 in order to qualify for the depreciation recovery income roll-over relief. SOP 257 – clauses 52B and 52C Submission (Deloitte, NZICA) To qualify for the roll-over relief a taxpayer must have either purchased or built a new property in the Canterbury area before 2018-19. This timeframe is unrealistic given the current pace of rebuilding in Canterbury. Obstacles to rebuilding in this timeframe include the time required for Christchurch council to grant occupancy certificates for new buildings or resource consent for the build. Submitters propose that ―acquired‖ by 2018-19 refer to when construction of a new property has commenced. The test for when construction has commenced could be, for example, based on evidence of a binding contract and expenses already incurred in relation to the new building (similar to the provisions in EE 31 of the Income Tax Act). Comment The key concern of submitters is that the deadline for taxpayers to have purchased or built a new building by 2018-19 is too soon. Rather than introducing a lower threshold to qualify for the relief from depreciation recovery income (e.g. a commitment to rebuild rather than a new build itself), officials consider reviewing the deadline in 2017 if it becomes clear that there are some real obstacles to rebuilding that is preventing taxpayers from acquiring a new building within the 2018-19 timeframe. If taxpayers became eligible for relief from depreciation recovery income before the purchase or construction of a new building, this would require an estimate of the cost of the new building before the real cost has been finalised. The cost of the new building is critical to calculating the amount of depreciation recovery income relief. Officials consider this approach would add complexity (namely a new rule on how to estimate the cost of a building before it has been built and a reconciliation with the actual costs of the new building once the building has been finished) and uncertainty. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: To qualify for the roll-over relief for a replacement building a taxpayer is required to have applied to the appropriate authority for consent to build. SOP 257 – clauses 52B and 52C Submission (Deloitte, Ernst & Young, NZICA) The requirement for taxpayers to have applied for building consent by the end of the 2015-16 income year in order to access roll-over relief for the 2016-17 to 2018-19 income years is unduly onerous. 95 While it is preferable to have no ―checkpoint‖ in the 2015-16 income year, if one is necessary, we suggest that it should involve the taxpayer having completed concept designs and plans by the end of the 2015-16 income year. Alternatively, the reference to consent should be clarified to mean resource consent as opposed to building consent. (Deloitte) Comment Officials agree that it is preferable to remove the requirement for taxpayers to have applied for building consent by the end of the 2015-16 income year in order to access roll-over relief for the 2016-17 to 2018-19 income years. This is because of the on- going uncertainty around current planning and rebuilding activities in Canterbury. While, as noted above, there is no intention at this stage to review the 2018-19 time limit unless there is a compelling reason to do so, officials consider that any such review should consider whether it is appropriate to tighten the requirements for accessing roll-over relief. This would be to ensure that relief is targeted at taxpayers who can demonstrate a genuine commitment to rebuilding in Canterbury. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Making roll-over relief available to taxpayers who reinvest other than through a company. SOP 257 – clause 52C Submission (Deloitte, Ernst & Young, NZICA) Currently the proposed amendment only allows for the reinvestment into a replacement property in Canterbury through a company. The bill should be amended to allow for a replacement property to be constructed or purchased through other investment entities, such as a partnership, trust or look-through company. Comment The extension of the rollover relief provisions aims to ensure affected taxpayers continue to qualify for the relief in situations where they do not invest directly themselves but they invest through a company. The provisions strike a balance between catering for the situations where taxpayers may choose to invest with other investors rather than directly and keeping the rules as simple as possible. Companies are the most common vehicle for investment. As at June 2012 there were 548,000 registered companies in New Zealand compared to only 1,300 limited partnerships. Extending the eligibility of rollover relief to look-through companies and limited partnerships would require additional rules for these investment vehicles. Joint investment entities such as look-through companies and limited partnerships could easily establish a company to 96 acquire a new property and the investors (look-through company shareholders and limited partners) could still remain eligible for the rollover relief. Officials note that the rules cater for trustee shareholders; trusts themselves are unlikely to be used as joint investment entities. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: When tax liability is triggered at the end of the roll-over relief period, the liability should be spread over a ten year period following the end of the relief period. SOP 257 – clauses 52B and 52C Submission (NZICA) Taxpayers may not know whether roll-over relief applies until close to the 2018-19 income year deadline. If a taxpayer discovers in 2019 that the roll-over relief is not available to them, the tax liability may affect their business. Spreading any depreciation recovery income that might be triggered close to the time limit over ten years would lessen this impact. Further, a ten-year spreading provision would reduce uncertainty to taxpayers and minimise the impact on their investment decisions close to the 2018-19 time limit. Comment If by 2018/19 a taxpayer has not met the criteria for rollover relief, they will not have built or purchased a new building in the Canterbury region. Nevertheless, the taxpayer will still have benefited from a deferral of their tax liability from 2011. Providing further relief for taxpayers that are not rebuilding in the Canterbury region is not consistent with the intent of the relief policy and a ten-year spreading rule adds complexity to the existing rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 97 Issue: Amendment to s EE 23BB to allow for owners who are planning to acquire an interest in a reinvestment entity SOP 257 – clause 52C Submission (Deloitte) New section EZ 23BB should be expanded to allow for owners who are planning to, but have not yet, acquired an interest in the entity undertaking reinvestment (analogous to the requirement in s EZ 23B that a taxpayer must plan to acquire replacement property). Alternatively, if it is intended that taxpayers initially elect into roll-over relief through existing s EZ 23B and then elect into s EZ 23BB once they have acquired an interest in a reinvestment entity, s EZ 23B‘s requirement for the original owner to plan to acquire replacement property should be expanded to include acquisition of replacement property through another entity. Comment Section EZ 23BB applies where a person receives insurance proceeds for earthquake- damaged depreciable property, would have depreciation recovery income and has an interest in an entity that will acquire replacement property. By contrast, existing s EZ 23B applies where a person receives insurance proceeds for earthquake-damaged depreciable property, would have depreciation recovery income and plans in the current year to acquire depreciable property. Officials agree that some form of transitional rule is required for taxpayers who have initially elected into roll-over relief under existing s EZ 23B because they plan in the current year to acquire replacement property but will now be acquiring replacement property through a joint investment entity (and so meet the criteria for electing into new s EZ 23BB). This is discussed further below in relation to the submission ―Clarifying the transition between ss EZ 23B and EZ 23BB‖. Recommendation That the submission be noted subject to officials' comments. Issue: Rename ―suspended recovery income‖ in s EZ 23BB SOP 257 – clause 52C Submission (Deloitte) Under s EZ 23BB, both the short-term deferral of depreciation recovery income (which exists until the replacement asset is acquired) and the long-term deferral (which exists until the interest in the replacement asset is sold) are called ―suspended recovery income‖. The long-term deferral of depreciation recovery income under the section should be named something other than ―suspended recovery income‖ for clarity. 98 Comment The term ―suspended recovery income‖ is used in s EZ 23BB to refer to the amount of depreciation recovery income that can be deferred until or unless specific events occur. Officials consider that the use of the term is sufficiently clear. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Expansion of s EZ 23BB to cater for rebuilding occurring by an entity in the same group SOP 257 – clause 52C Submission (Deloitte) New s EZ 23BB should be expanded to cater for the situation where reinvestment occurs through a company which is in the same group of companies as the company that owns the destroyed property that is being replaced. Comment While officials recognise that investment to acquire replacement property may occur through a company that is in the same group as the company that owns the destroyed property being replaced, it is considered that expanding depreciation roll-over relief to group company situations would add significant complexity to the rules. This is because the rules would need to be modified to fit with the tax rules that apply to groups of companies e.g. loss grouping. This complexity is undesirable as it is at odds with the policy intent of ensuring that depreciation roll-over relief is clear and straightforward to apply. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 99 Issue: Clarification of timing of amendment to s EE 52 SOP 257 – clause 55B Submission (NZICA) The amendment to s EE 52 should be drafted so that it is clear that it will not result in a taxpayer incurring a tax liability in a period earlier than the period in which the Bill is enacted. Comment Section EE 52 specifies the amount of depreciation recovery income that a person has when they receive insurance proceeds for damage to a depreciable asset. The amendment to s EE 52 contained in the bill seeks to clarify that if damaged property is disposed of before the insurance proceeds are received, the proceeds will be treated as being derived immediately before the disposal. This is in order to remedy a gap in the legislation. If a person receives insurance proceeds for a damaged building and the building is then sold, the owner is taxed on the insurance proceeds. However, if the damaged building is sold before the insurance proceeds are received by the owner, the proceeds are not taxable. The amendment applies from 25 June 2013, which is the date that the Supplementary Order Paper on further Canterbury earthquake tax measures was released. The reason for this application date is that applying the amendment from the beginning of the 2014- 15 income year may give taxpayers a window of opportunity to prevent their insurance proceeds from being taxable (by selling their buildings to associates before 1 April 2014, for example). Also, this approach is consistent with the approach taken in the past to the application date for generic (albeit Canterbury earthquake-related) amendments clarifying the treatment of insurance proceeds. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarifying the transition between ss EZ 23B and EZ 23BB SOP 257 – clauses 52B and 52C Submission (NZICA, Ernst & Young) Many taxpayers who will wish to use new EZ 23BB to claim depreciation roll-over relief will have already relied on s EZ 23B in earlier income years to suspend recognition of depreciation recovery income. Accordingly, the legislation should explicitly provide for a transition for taxpayers from s EZ 23B to s EZ 23BB. 100 Alternatively, section EZ 23BB should apply from a future date and a transitional provision should be introduced for taxpayers who have elected under section EZ 23B (NZICA). Comment New s EZ 23BB applies from 4 September 2010, which is the date of the first Canterbury earthquake. However, many taxpayers seeking to claim relief from depreciation recovery income will have already done so under existing s EZ 23B. Officials agree that a transitional rule should be included to allow taxpayers who have claimed relief under s EZ 23B to claim relief under s EZ 23BB going forward. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials‘ comments. Issue: Clarify maintenance of suspension of income beyond 2018-19 income year SOP 257 – clause 52C Submission (Ernst & Young) It should be clarified that there will be no claw-back of depreciation recovery income under the proposed s EZ 23BB after the 2018-19 income year, where taxpayers retain their interests in the company acquiring replacement property and the latter retains the replacement property. Comment The policy intent is that there will be no claw-back of depreciation recovery income unless: i. no replacement property has been acquired by the end of the 2018-19 income year; or ii. the taxpayer exits the company holding the replacement property; iii. the taxpayer goes into liquidation or bankruptcy; or ii. the replacement asset is disposed of. Officials consider this is achieved by the current drafting of s EZ 23BB. Guidance on the application of the section will be provided through the Taxation Information Bulletin, once the bill is enacted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 101 Issue: Ensure clear initial suspension of depreciation recovery income SOP 257 – clause 52C Submission (Ernst & Young) It is submitted that s EZ 23B(2) and new s EZ 23BB(2) should be amended to ensure there is a clear initial suspension of a taxpayer‘s depreciation recovery income. The concern is that as each of these provisions currently refers to amounts which may be depreciation recovery income in or after the current year, describing them by reference to the excess recovery amounts ―that remain at the beginning of the current year‖ after earlier adjustments and attributions, may mean that there is no clear initial suspension of the amount that would otherwise be depreciation recovery income. Comment Officials consider that the drafting of s EZ 23B(2) and new s EZ 23BB(2) ensures that there is an initial suspension of a taxpayer‘s depreciation recovery income. This is achieved through the reference to an ―amount that may be depreciation recovery income of the person in or after the current year‖. However, guidance on the application of the sections will be provided in the Taxation Information Bulletin, once the bill is enacted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Calculation of suspended amounts under new s EZ 23BB SOP 257 – clause 52C Submission (Ernst & Young) The submitter states that the various calculation provisions in new s EZ 23BB need revising to ensure taxpayers have effective suspension of the full amount of their depreciation recovery income until the replacement property is fully acquired, which may occur over several years. Comment Officials consider that the various calculation provisions in new s EZ 23BB work as intended, which is to ensure taxpayers have effective suspension of the full amount of their depreciation recovery income until replacement property is fully acquired by the end of the 2018-19 income year. Further guidance on the application of the calculation provisions will be provided in the Taxation Information Bulletin, after the bill is enacted. 102 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarify meaning of ―settlor‖ and quantification of settlements and trust corpus for the purposes of s EZ 23BB SOP 257 – clause 52C Submission (Ernst & Young) The submitter suggests clarifying the meaning of ―settlor‖ as it is used in s EZ 23BB. Section EZ 23BB deals with taxpayers suspending recognition of their depreciation recovery income if they are the settlors of trusts of which the trustee(s) hold voting interests in an ―owning company‖. The submitter also suggests clarifying the quantification of settlements and trust corpus for the purposes of s EZ 23BB. Comment Officials agree that the meanings of ―settlor‖, ―corpus‖ and ―settlement‖ should be clarified in the context of s EZ 23BB. At present, these terms are defined only in relation to specific sections (which do not include ss EZ 23B or EZ 23BB). Officials consider that these definitions should instead be made generic – this will ensure that they apply in the context of s EZ 23BB. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials‘ comments. Issue: Replacement of revenue account property SOP No 257 – clause 25B Submission (NZICA) Revenue account property (RAP) rollover relief should allow the taxpayer to claim the relief even if the replacement property is not revenue account property. The issue arises where the original property only became RAP by virtue of a disposal within ten years of acquisition. This is because the original property may be deemed to be held on revenue account because of associations or building development activities that the owner was involved with at the time of, or shortly following, the acquisition of the property. 103 If such a property is disposed of within ten years of its acquisition, or within ten years of the development activity, it will be treated as revenue account property, rather than a capital asset. If the disposal is triggered or brought forward by the Canterbury earthquakes, this means the owner cannot retain the property for longer than the ten years – and so avoid the tax liability on the proceeds from disposal of revenue account property. If these associations or activities no longer exist at the time the new property is acquired, they will not ―taint‖ any replacement building. So it may not be possible for the replacement property to be treated as a revenue account property, and so the RAP roll-over relief at section CZ 25 of the Income Tax Act 2007 cannot be used. Comment The RAP roll-over relief has always required both the original and the replacement property to be held on revenue account. This is because the purpose of the roll-over relief is merely to delay the tax that would arise on the eventual sale of the replacement property; it does not remove the tax obligation altogether. However, this tax liability will only arise if the replacement property is RAP. If the replacement property is not or does not become RAP, there will be no ―RAP income‖ arising in the future from the replacement‘s disposal. Officials note that the issue raised could theoretically, prevent an owner of property that was deemed to be RAP from accessing the RAP rollover relief going forward. However, in order to apply the RAP roll-over relief to property that is not, in and of itself, RAP at time of acquisition, would require some complex and potentially onerous tracing provisions. One possible option is to deem replacement property to be RAP if the roll- over relief is claimed, but this creates difficulties when the property is eventually sold, in determining how much of the profit from that sale should be subject to tax. That is, the question arises of how to restrict the liability to the profit that would have arisen on the original property, allowing also for interest value over time. Officials note that there is no evidence that this issue is actually causing any difficulties for Canterbury taxpayers in practice, which would justify adding further complex rules and tracing provisions to this rollover relief option. Further, section CZ 26 of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains an exemption for income from certain property disposals within 10 years of acquisition, so this not an issue for taxpayers whose RAP is acquired by the Crown, which would include many of the worst affected RAP owners in the Christchurch CBD area. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 104 Issue: Application of revenue account property rollover relief SOP No 257 – clause 25B Submission (NZICA) The revenue account property (RAP) rollover relief at section CZ 25 should apply to an amount of income arising from the disposal of RAP under the following provisions, because the earthquakes will have triggered the provision: o Section CB 6 – disposal: land acquired for purpose or with intention of disposal o Section CB 7 – disposal: land acquired for purposes of business relating to land o section CB 9 – disposal within 10 years: land dealing business o section CB10 – disposal within 10 years: land development or subdivision business o section CB 11 – disposal within 10 years of improvement: building business o section CB 12 – disposal: schemes for development or division begun within 10 years o section CB 14 – disposal: amount from land affected by change and not already in income Comment RAP roll-over relief was introduced in 2011, and initially applied only to income arising from the disposal of buildings held on revenue account, if the building was rendered useless or destroyed by the earthquake. This income arises under section CG 6, which applies when a person receives an amount for the loss or destruction of, or damage to, trading stock. As noted in the submission, buildings are defined as ̳trading stock‘ for the purposes of section CG 6 if their disposal creates income under section CB 6 to CB 15. The RAP relief was extended in 2012 to apply to land. It was also extended to apply to buildings which were not necessarily rendered useless or destroyed, but were being purchased by the Government under its compensation package, under the recovery/rebuild plan. However when the section was extended, it still only applied to income that was considered to arise under section CG 6. For some of the buildings, because they had not actually been destroyed, the income could arise not under section CG 6, but under the provisions at sections CB 6 to CB 14. The amendments proposed in the supplementary order paper 257 already amend section CZ 25 to include sections CB 6 and CB 7. Income arising under sections CB 9 to CB 11 and CB 14 from the disposal of buildings which are not necessarily rendered useless or destroyed, but are purchased by the Government under a compensation package, are addressed by the exemption at section CZ 26. So these sections should not be included in the RAP rollover relief rule at section CZ 25. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 105 Issue: Revenue account property rollover relief formula SOP No 257 – clause 25B Submission (NZICA, Ernst and Young) The formula for calculating the amount of the revenue account property (RAP) roll-over relief is circular, because section CZ 25(3)(a)(i) is based on the result of section CZ 25(3)(a)(ii), and vice versa. The formula leads to unexpected results in circumstances where the cost of the replacement property exceeds the costs of the previous property (worked examples provided). More guidance should be provided on how the formula should be applied. Comment The purpose of the RAP roll-over relief is to delay the tax that would arise on the disposal of the original RAP, until the eventual sale of the replacement property; it does not remove the tax obligation altogether. When the replacement RAP is eventually sold on, the ―profit‖ will be taxed at that later stage. RAP rollover relief allows for an equivalently valued RAP to be purchased with the receipts from the original RAP by deferring the payment of the associated tax. If The formula provides for the RAP income amount derived to be pro-rata If not all of the receipts from disposal of the original RAP are used to purchase replacement RAP, there is no deferral of tax on the unused remainder, that is, there is a pro rata approach, which is achieved through the formula. The three main situations and outcomes can be summarised as: i. The cost of replacement RAP is less than the insurance proceeds and less than the cost of the original RAP. In this situation no rollover relief will be due, because the tax liability arising on the sale of the original RAP can be met without affecting the taxpayers‘ ability to purchase the new RAP. ii. The cost of replacement RAP is less than the insurance proceeds but more than the cost of the original RAP. In this situation a portion of the insurance proceeds received is taxable as income (under either section CB 6, CB 7, CB 12, CB 13 or CG 6) immediately in the year of receipt, because it is not all needed to purchase the replacement RAP. The formula in section CZ 25(3) requires a pro-rata approach. The remainder of the income that is not taxed immediately is still rolled-over to reduce the cost price (for the purposes of section EA 2) of the replacement property. iii. The cost of replacement RAP is equal to or more than the insurance proceeds, and more than the cost of the original RAP. 106 In this situation all the proceeds are put towards the replacement RAP. There is no pro- rata, and the full amount of taxable income will be rolled over. The previous drafting in section CZ 25(3) meant that the formula simply did not apply in the third situation. The proposed amendments re-draft this formula to cover all three scenarios. No change in outcome was intended; however officials agree that the calculation of one of the elements ( ̳excess recovery‘) is unclear. This term ―excess recovery‖ was intended to mean the excess (difference) between the amount received for the disposal of the original property and the cost of the replacement property. Officials agree that the derivation of this element of the calculation should be clarified in the drafting, and the drafting of the formula could be simplified to avoid any apparent circularity. Officials will consider the comments about the provision of more guidance by Inland Revenue on the application of this formula, including a worked example. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. On enactment of the bill guidance on the amendments and the formula will be released in Inland Revenue‘s Tax Information Bulletin, as usual. Issue: Section CZ 26 exemption where income arises under section CB 12 SOP No 257 – clause 25C Submission (NZICA) The exemption at section CZ 26 applies to income arising for the disposal of land and buildings purchased by the Government under its compensation. It should also apply to income arising under section CB 12. Some taxpayers will be required to commence development or division work within ten years, as a result of the earthquakes, and should have access to the RAP rollover relief and/or the exemption provision. Comment The section CZ 26 exemption was designed for situations where the owner wished to take up the Government offer of purchase following the damage caused by the earthquake. However, taking up the offer would mean they could not retain the land for the requisite 10-year period, and so could not prevent income arising under sections CB 9 to CB 11. It is not intended to provide extended relief for decisions around development and division which took place after the earthquake. 107 Section CB 12 taxes income from land in situations where work is commenced within ten years of acquisition. The time of disposal of the land is irrelevant. Section CB 12 does not have an ̳end date‘ – that is to say, if the person entered into non-minor developments within 10 years of acquisition they should always have known they were liable for income tax on disposal. Therefore the owner has not lost the ability to retain the land for a requisite period as there is no requisite period linked with disposal under section CB 12. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Cross-reference in s EE 1(3)(d) SOP 257 Submission (Ernst & Young) Section EE 1(3)(d) should be amended to include a reference to depreciation recovery income under the proposed new s EZ 23BB. Comment Officials agree that s EE 1(3)(d) should be consequentially amended to refer to depreciation recovery income calculated under s EZ 23BB. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Replacing ―affected property‖ with ―affected class‖ in s EZ 23B(4)(a) SOP 257, clause 52B Submission (Deloitte) There are only two instances in s EZ 23B(4)(a) where ―property‖ should be changed to ―class‖. The second instance of the word which refers to ―other replacement property‖ should not be changed to ―other replacement class‖. 108 Comment Officials agree that there are only two instances in s EZ 23B(4)(a) where ―property‖ should be changed to ―class‖. The existing reference to ―other replacement property‖ should remain. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Unnecessary colon in s EZ 23B(5)(a)(i) SOP 257, clause 52B Submission (Ernst & Young) The amendment to s EZ 23B(5)(a)(i) appears to include an unnecessary colon. Comment Officials agree that there is an unnecessary colon in the amendment to s EZ 23B(5)(a)(i) – this should be corrected so that ―cost of the affected property‖ is replaced with ―cost of the affected class‖. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Drafting amendments to s CZ 25 SOP No 257 – clause 25B Submission (NZICA, Deloitte) 1. The title of section CZ 25(5) should be updated to refer to the new 2018/19 income year deadline. 2. In section CZ 25(3)(a)(i) it should be clarified that the ―total amount of deductions under sections DB 23 and DB 27‖ are referring to the original (affected) RAP and not the cost of acquiring the replacement RAP. 3. Section CZ 25(3)(a) and section CZ 26 should expressly override section CG 6, to ensure that income from the disposal of land and buildings held on revenue account, to which the RAP rollover relief applies, cannot also be considered to still arise under section CG 6. 109 Comment 1. Section CZ 25(5)(a) is being amended so that a taxpayer is liable to tax on amount of income equal to the amount of any remaining suspended recovery income at the end of the 2018-19 income year, not the 21015-16 year as currently. The title should be updated to reflect this extension. 2. Section CZ 25(3)(a)(i) should refer to total amount of deductions under sections DB 23 and DB 27 for the affected RAP. 3. Section CZ 25(3) already provides relief from section CG 6, if the taxpayer elects to use the RAP rollover provision under section CZ 25(1). Section CZ 26 prevents sections CB 9 to CB 11 from applying to a person, land or building. This means that section CG 6 cannot apply, as the land or building cannot become trading stock through the definition of trading stock at section YA 1 – which relies on income arising under sections CB 6 to CB 15. Recommendation That submissions 1 and 2 be accepted and submission 3 be declined. 110 111 Policy matters 112 113 WORKING FOR FAMILIES TAX CREDITS Issue: Complexity of Working for Families tax credit rules Clauses 89-98 Submission (NZICA) The Working for Families tax credit (WFF) rules in subpart MA to MK should be reviewed and simplified and made more coherent. Continual redrafting of the legislation has made it difficult to determine a person‘s entitlement. Comment There are trade-offs to consider when making a payment system more coherent and/or simple. Significant changes generally result either in families receiving less, or Governments spending more. Improving coherence may lead to systems becoming more complex. There are also concerns about accuracy and integrity. For example, a review in 2001 recommended simplifying the family scheme rules, to reduce compliance costs and complexity by moving away from a welfare-based definition of income and aligning rules with a tax-based definition of income. However, a tax-based definition of income does not always provide a good estimate of the resources available to a family as the tax system can ignore payments received by families where it has been taxed elsewhere (such as distributions from trusts or fringe benefits). The broadening of the definition of family scheme income from 2011 was in response to concerns about the fairness and integrity of the family scheme income rules. There had been an increase in the level of the tax credits over 2004-2007 and changes in how businesses were being structured (for example, as family trust-owned companies). The 2011 broadening reforms sought to recognise the resources available to some families and to better identify those families in genuine need of additional government assistance. The trade-off is an increase in complexity and for some families an increase in compliance costs and reduction in payments. It is possible to align the wording and formulae in section MB 4 (relating to close companies) and section MB 7 (relating to trusts and trust-owned companies). In particular, the terminology on voting interests and shareholding in a company could be rationalised; the references to a company‘s accounting year in section MB 4 could be aligned with references to the company‘s income year in section MB 7; and the attribution of net company income to a shareholding trustee less dividends in section MB 7 could be aligned with the proposed formula in section MB 4 on the attribution of net company income less dividends to a major shareholder. It makes sense to rationalise the provisions that employ a similar concept, such as the attribution of company income in sections MB 4 and MB 7. These minor changes would reduce compliance costs with minimal impact on Government spending. Officials will be reviewing the IR215 form and supporting information to see if we can provide better guidance on the income information that is required from families. In 114 some cases it may be appropriate for a person to seek assistance from their accountant or tax advisor to complete parts of the form, such as determining the end-of-year net income of the close company in which they are a major shareholder. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, subject to officials‘ comments. Issue: Settlor test for Working for Families tax credits in section MB 7 Clause 92 Submission (NZICA) The use of the settlor test for Working for Families tax credits should be reviewed as the settlor test makes the rules very complex and difficult to apply. Alternatively, the definition for settlor in the context of section MB 7 should be clarified. Comment Officials consider the use of the settlor test continues to be appropriate. Section MB 7 attributes the net income of a trust (including trust-owned companies) to the settlors of that trust for inclusion in family scheme income. The definition of settlor in section MB 7 is the same as that used throughout the Income Tax Act 2007. The only exception is a specific exclusion in section MB 7 that a person is not a settlor for family scheme income solely as a result of providing personal services for less than market value in the administration of the trust or the maintenance of trust property. The submitter has raised the issue whether a person is a settlor if they are a beneficiary who has a credit balance (undrawn funds) in their beneficiary account with the trust. This is a wider question of who meets the definition of settlor in the Income Tax Act 2007, although the answer will have implications for parents who are or may be subject to income attribution under section MB 7. Inland Revenue is considering its response. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 115 Issue: Negative amounts calculated under section MB 4 — close company income Clause 91 Submission (NZICA) The formula in section MB 4 is being amended to confirm that it cannot result in a negative amount. This amendment should not proceed. A negative amount should be allowed to avoid double counting the same income. Comment Section MB 4 as proposed in the bill specifically states the amount to be included in family scheme income ―is the greater of zero and the amount given by the formula‖. This clarifies the previous wording, which referred to the amount of family scheme income calculated under the section being ―reduced by‖ the total dividends paid. The drafting confirms the long-standing policy that negative amounts are not taken into account. Similar wording exists in section MB 7, stating that the amount of dividends being deducted cannot exceed the amount of net company income attributed to the shareholding trustee. Dividends received by a person are included in family scheme income as they are taxable income of the person. Section MB 4 seeks to attribute income that is retained in the close company; represented in the formula by net income of the company less total dividends paid. This avoids double counting of income which is earned and paid out as dividend in the same year. It is possible that close company income would be attributed under section MB 4 to a parent in one year and when company income is paid out as a dividend in the following year is included as family scheme income in that following year. It is also possible that this does not occur, as the person may not be eligible for Working for Families tax credits in either of those years or may not be involved in the close company in one year. The scope of the WFF tax credit is to provide financial assistance for families in need in that year rather than looking at overall family income across several years. Disallowing negative amounts is consistent with this annual focus. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 116 Issue: Updating Working for Families tax credit references Clause 89, 90, 118 Submission (Matter raised by officials) There should be a consistent use of the term ―family scheme income‖ to refer to income calculated under subpart MB. The term ―net income‖ should not be used when referring to income calculated for the family scheme. Also, a provision‘s heading still refers to Family Support which has since been renamed. Comment This Bill corrects references in the Income Tax Act 2007 and uses ―family scheme income‖ when referring to income calculated for the family scheme in subpart MB. There are other references to ―net income‖ used to calculate a Working for Families tax credit (in the Tax Administration Act 1994) and ―net income‖ under subpart MB (in the Health Entitlement Cards Regulations 1993) where the context of the section means that ―family scheme income‖ is the most appropriate term. These other references should be amended to refer to ―family scheme income‖. The heading to section 84 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 refers to family support payments. Family support was renamed as the family tax credit from 2008. Also, section 84 refers to the disclosure of information to prevent double payment of a Working for Families tax credit. The heading should be amended to reflect the purpose of the section. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 117 NOTIONAL INTEREST UNDER IFRS Clauses 38 and 55 Issue: Description of the problem is incorrect Submission (Law Society) The way the problem has been described in the bill commentary – namely that deductions may be allowed for notional payments – is inappropriate. The financial arrangements recognise notional payments in other situations. Comment Officials agree that a clearer problem description would be that taxpayers may be able to claim deductions for payments where there is no economic substance. This will be reflected in the Tax Information Bulletin on enactment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Change of spreading method adjustment should be removed Submission (KPMG, NZICA) The requirement to perform a change of spreading method adjustment for taxpayers who have been claiming deductions (or paying income tax) on interest-free loans should be removed. The bill proposes that this adjustment be performed in the 2014/15 income year, which will have begun for some early balance-date taxpayers before the bill receives Royal assent. If the adjustment is to be kept, taxpayers should have the option of performing this adjustment in the 2015/16 income year. Comment The purpose of requiring the change of spreading method adjustment is to reverse any deductions a taxpayer has previously taken under an interest-free loan. Without this requirement, taxpayers will not have to reverse these deductions until the loan expires, which may not be for many years. This could provide a significant timing advantage. Officials therefore do not agree that the change of spreading method adjustment should be removed. 118 Officials also disagree with deferring the timing for this adjustment. While some early balance-date taxpayers will have already started the 2014-15 income year before the bill receives Royal assent, we do not expect them to have to file their tax returns until well after this occurs. In addition, officials consider that affected taxpayers have been aware of this change for some time. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Application date of the proposal Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, NZICA) The application date for this change should be deferred until the 2014/15 income year. Comment Officials agree. This change would align the application date of the proposal with the year the change of spreading method adjustment is required. It will also mean the change generally applies prospectively. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Compliance costs Submission (NZICA) This change should only be enacted after consideration is given to the associated compliance costs. Comment The IFRS financial reporting spreading method generally reduces compliance costs by allowing amounts financial arrangements to be spread as they are under IFRS accounting. However, good tax policy can require a departure from IFRS treatment where it would produce an inappropriate result for tax purposes. This amendment is a reflection of this policy. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 119 Issue: Drafting of the proposal Submission (Ernst & Young) The wording of proposed section EW 15D(2)(ad) is unclear and should be revised. Comment Officials agree. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 120 OVER-CREDITING OF IMPUTATION CREDITS IN EXCESS OF FIF INCOME Clauses 15 and 86 Issue: Need for amendment Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Ernst & Young) The amendment is unnecessary because the current rules provide the correct result over time. Comment The proposed amendment addresses a mismatch arising under the current tax rules in relation to imputed dividends paid by Australian companies under the trans-Tasman imputation rules but where the investment is taxed under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules. This mismatch arises because the imputation credits are calculated on the basis of the dividend paid but income tax arises only on the FIF income. The actual dividend is not taxed. When the dividend exceeds the FIF income, the resulting excess imputation credits could be used to offset tax on other income such as salary and wages. Allowing the New Zealand investor to receive imputation credits in excess of their tax liability on their Australian investment is inconsistent with the policy rationale underlying the imputation regime, which is to eliminate double taxation of New Zealand company profits. Double taxation only arises to the extent of FIF taxation. The proposed amendment limits the amount of imputation credits – which are attached to a dividend received from an Australian company – which a resident can use to offset the New Zealand tax. The amendment requires the imputation credits to be calculated on the basis of the resident‘s FIF income from that company, rather than on the actual dividend. Officials consider that this is an effective and simple solution. Officials do not agree with the submission that it would be appropriate to allow imputation credits in excess of the amount that offsets the New Zealand tax on the FIF income which the Australian investment produces. Officials consider the amendment is consistent with the existing rule that allows a tax credit for foreign tax paid on the dividend received by New Zealand resident even though the actual dividend is not subject to New Zealand tax because the shareholder is subject to the FIF rules. However, in this case, the foreign tax credit is limited to the New Zealand tax liability on the FIF income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 121 Issue: Allowing excess credits to be carried forward or backwards Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Ernst & Young) If the submission above is not accepted, excess imputation credits should be able to be carried forward or carried backwards and offset against FIF income in other periods. Comment Where an Australian investment is subject to the FIF rules, officials consider it is appropriate to place a limit on the amount of trans-Tasman imputation credits attached to a dividend received from the Australian investment in that year. The amount of imputation credits should be calculated on the basis of the New Zealand resident investor‘s FIF income from the company in that year. Any solution involving the carry forward or the carry backwards of imputation credits would be very complex for both taxpayers to comply with and for Inland Revenue to administer. The proposed amendment requiring the amount of imputation credits to be calculated on the basis of the New Zealand resident‘s FIF income from an Australian investment provides an effective and simple solution to the problem of over-crediting of imputation credits in excess of FIF taxation. The solution suggested by the submission would also not be consistent with the rule that allows a credit for foreign tax paid on a dividend received by New Zealand resident even though the actual dividend is not subject to New Zealand tax because the investment is taxed under the FIF rules. However, in this case, the foreign tax credit is limited to the New Zealand tax liability on the FIF income, and there is no provision for the carry forward or the carry back of credits. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 122 Issue: Limiting amendment to certain FIF calculation methods Submission (KPMG) The limitation on imputation credits should only apply if the FIF income calculation method used is the fair dividend rate (FDR) or cost method. Comment The proposed amendment will require imputation credits attached to dividends paid by an Australian company to be calculated on the basis of the New Zealand shareholder‘s FIF income, rather than on the actual dividend. Officials consider there is no basis for distinguishing between FIF calculation methods. The amendment should therefore apply equally regardless of the FIF calculation method used. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 123 DEDUCTIONS FOR HOLDERS OF DEBT – COMPLIANCE CHANGE Issue: Support for compliance change Clause 29 Submission (KPMG, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Law Society) The submitters support the change to allow creditors an automatic bad debt deduction in certain situations. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Situations to which the compliance change applies Clause 29 Submission New Zealand Law Society The submitter seeks confirmation that holders of financial arrangements that have been discharged without consideration or that have become irrevocable or unenforceable through the lapse of time will still be entitled to a bad debt deduction if written off as bad after the discharge or lapse of time. Alternatively, it is submitted that the proposed amendments be extended to include other situations where a debt has been compromised, namely, when a financial arrangement has been discharged without consideration, or has become irrevocable or unenforceable through the lapse of time. Comment The primary object of the proposal is to minimise compliance costs faced by small taxpayers and only in situations where it was clear the debt was bad. The rationale was that the requirement for a debt to be written off before a bad debt deduction is taken can be unnecessarily onerous for creditors. This is because they would need up-to-date knowledge of the financial state of the debtor in order to take the bad debt deduction in time. In some situations, creditors are not informed of upcoming liquidations or bankruptcies so they would need to regularly check the companies register or public listings for updates on the financial status of debtors. In comparison, officials consider that the compliance criteria for creditors of debts that have been discharged without consideration or become irrevocable or unenforceable through the lapse of time are not onerous. These creditors should have adequate notice 124 that the debtor is unable to meet their obligations in full and have sufficient time to write off the debt as bad under current rules. Furthermore, the requirement to write off a bad debt is a way of proving that taxpayers have turned their mind to the debt and that the debt is truly bad. In the case of a remission of law or a composition with creditors, it is highly likely the debt is a bad debt and the creditor should be allowed a deduction (as is intended under current policy settings). Officials do not consider it necessary to prove the debt is bad by writing it off and therefore removing the compliance cost for these creditors is appropriate. In comparison, debts that have been discharged without consideration or become irrevocable or unenforceable through the lapse of time are not necessarily bad debts. Officials consider that to amend the bad debt deduction rules so that it is not necessary to write off the debt would make it too easy to take a deduction and could present a risk to the revenue base. In these cases where it is not clear that the debt is a bad debt, officials consider that the current write-off compliance criteria should remain. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date of compliance change Clause 29 Submission (Ernst & Young, NZICA, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The time of application of the changes should not depend on when taxpayers have filed their returns. Taxpayers who have applied the current law should be allowed to claim a bad debt deduction from the 2008-09 year onwards. (Ernst & Young and NZICA) The application date should be amended if it is intended to have effect for any taxpayers from the 2008-09 year other than those who have not yet filed their returns for any relevant previous year (Ernst & Young and Corporate Taxpayers Group). An amendment should be made so that the proposed change is retrospective to confirm tax filing positions previously adopted and simply prevent taxpayers from reopening historic positions to take advantage of the amendment (Corporate Taxpayers Group). Comment The current application date of 2008-09 was chosen on the basis that it would ensure targeted taxpayers affected by the high compliance criteria (primarily small investors in failed finance companies) would be able to benefit from the amended tax rules. In theory, taxpayers that would be disadvantaged by the originally proposed application date (and that the submitters are proposing the change should extend to) are those that made an economic loss on a financial arrangement, failed to write off the bad debt in time, and returned income under current law. Officials are not aware of any such taxpayers and it is considered highly unlikely that taxpayers would have taken this tax 125 position. To extend the application date to such taxpayers could result in high administrative costs and potential operational implications. However, to ensure a fair result, officials agree that the proposed change should extend to taxpayers who filed taking the position described above in years from 2008-09. It is considered that as there will be very few (if any) taxpayers who applied the current law and will benefit from the retrospective application date, any additional administrative costs incurred as a result of accepting this submission would be negligible. Officials also agree that, as currently drafted, where a taxpayer has filed an income tax return prior to the date of Royal Assent, and claimed a bad debt deduction when the debt was not written off in time, that taxpayer will still technically be non-compliant with the Act. This class of taxpayer should be entitled to access the new rules. Officials therefore agree that an amendment be made so that the proposed change is retrospective to confirm tax filing positions previously adopted, however, as noted in the comment above, taxpayers will not be prevented from reopening historic positions to take advantage of the amendment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. 126 DEDUCTIONS FOR HOLDERS OF DEBT – BASE MAINTENANCE CHANGE Issue: Support for base maintenance change Clauses 26 and 29 Submission (NZICA, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The submitters support the principle that holders of debt should only be able to take a deduction for the true economic cost. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Base maintenance change – current law is sufficient Clause 29 Submission (NZICA) The current rules sufficiently achieve the desired outcome of limiting deductions for bad debts to the economic cost and therefore the amendment should not proceed. While the base price adjustment (BPA) may not always be performed in the same year as the bad debt deduction is taken, this is a timing difference only and the overall outcome is appropriate. If this is not accepted, the BPA formula should be amended to eliminate the timing mismatch rather than the bad debt rules. Comment Officials agree that, overall, the BPA (a wash-up calculation that is performed when the financial arrangement comes to an end) will mean the correct tax outcome should eventually be reached under current law. However, as noted by the submitter, the creditor is able to benefit from a timing advantage because the bad debt deductions could be taken well before income from the BPA is recognised. This result is not in line with the current policy settings for bad debt deductions, and it means taxpayers can take a deduction for an amount greater than the cash/economic loss incurred. Furthermore, the timing advantage also presents a risk to the integrity of the revenue base especially if a BPA is never performed meaning the timing advantage becomes a permanent tax advantage. It is these advantages that the base maintenance change is seeking to rectify. 127 Officials consider the interaction of the bad debt rules and BPA formula result in the correct outcome for taxpayers, and that an amendment to the BPA formula is therefore unnecessary. Bad debt deductions have always been outside the financial arrangement rules. There are two main reasons for this. Firstly they apply to debts other than financial arrangements, and secondly, deductions for bad debts are not part of the usual income/expenditure on financial arrangements and need to be dealt with separately as bad debts. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: New regime for bad debt deductions arising from financial arrangements Clause 29 Submission (Baycorp) Given the complexity of the bad debt rules and their interaction with the financial arrangement rules and the base price adjustment calculation, a new policy should be set with one regime rather than the current interaction of two regimes (financial arrangements and bad debt deductions). Comment Amending the financial arrangement rules was considered during the policy development. However, officials believe that the (complex) financial arrangements rules generally work well and amending these rules would add additional complexity which may unintentionally affect other arrangements. Furthermore, as noted in an earlier submission, bad debt deductions have intentionally been placed outside the financial arrangement rules, firstly because they apply to debts other than financial arrangements, and secondly, because deductions for bad debts are not part of the usual income/expenditure on financial arrangements and need to be dealt with separately as bad debts. Given that officials consider the proposed new rules will achieve the desired outcome, it is considered unnecessary to introduce a new regime to the Income Tax Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 128 Issue: Incorrect result when the consideration paid for a debt is less than the face value Clause 29 Submission (KPMG, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Baycorp) Where a debt is purchased for less than its face value and is later remitted, the base maintenance change neglects the fact that the ―amount remitted‖ component will potentially produce an income result in the base price adjustment (BPA) formula, and result in over-taxation. This is an unintended outcome of the rules, but one for which the full bad debt deduction is currently needed as an offset. The bill restricts the available bad debt deduction without similarly limiting the corresponding income under the BPA formula. The one-sided nature of this amendment needs to be addressed. If it is intended that bad debt deductions be taken under two provisions (subsection DB 31(2) for income amounts and subsection DB 31(3) for principal amounts), this should be made clear in the legislation. (Baycorp) Comment Officials consider that, together, the financial arrangement rules (including the BPA) and the proposed bad debt deduction provisions will achieve the correct result. That is, the proposed rules sufficiently allow deductions to be taken when a debt is transferred for less than the face value of the loan. This can be illustrated by an example. Example A debt with a face value of $50m is acquired for $1m by Company B who is a dealer in the financial arrangements. Company B does not receive any income from the debtor and the entire $50m debt is eventually remitted by law. Company B has suffered an economic loss of $1m. On remission Company B performs a BPA (wash-up calculation) as follows: BPA: consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted = ($1m) – $0 + $0 + $50m = $49m income Under the new rules, bad debt deductions could be taken as follows:  $1m under subsection DB 31(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 – being a deduction for the amount not received by a dealer in financial arrangements, but limited to the consideration paid for acquiring the debt; and  $49m under subsection DB 31(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 – being a deduction for an income amount (the BPA income) not received. Officials have discussed the application of the rules with the submitters, and after further consideration Corporate Taxpayers Group and KPMG are comfortable that the 129 legislation works as intended and that deductions can be taken under both subsections DB 31(2) and (3). Officials do not consider it necessary or desirable to amend the legislation to clarify the application of the rules. However, the intended application of the rules will be explained in a Tax Information Bulletin following enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting for limited recourse arrangement rule Clause 29 Submission (NZICA, Corporate Taxpayers Group , Baycorp) The definition of ―limited recourse arrangement‖ as currently drafted is confusing and should be redrafted as it is not clear what the proposed definition is intended to capture. Comment Officials agree that the definition of ―limited recourse arrangement‖ could be made clearer. The rule regarding limited recourse arrangements is intended to be an anti- avoidance measure to ensure dealers and holders are only able to take bad debt deductions for the true money at risk. Without this rule it would be possible for one party (party 1) to borrow money from another party (party 2) by way of a limited recourse arrangement (Loan A). The amount borrowed under Loan A could be used to fund the purchase of a debt (the underlying debt). The limited recourse arrangement for Loan A could then be structured so that the borrowed funds were only repayable up to the amount received under the underlying debt. Without a limited recourse arrangement rule party 1 could take a bad debt deduction for the full amount owing under the underlying debt, even though they have not made a true economic loss because the money effectively comes from party 2 and is only repayable to the extent that the underlying debt is repaid. In this situation party 1 should only be able to take a bad debt deduction up to the amount that truly represents an economic loss. If they were able to take a deduction for more than this, they would receive an excessive and unjustified advantage. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 130 Issue: Rationale for limited recourse arrangement rule Clause 29 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Proposed subsection DB 31(4C), an anti-avoidance provision which limits bad debt deductions for dealers and holders to the amount not subject to limited recourse, should be removed. As currently drafted, it extends too far because it prevents a deduction being taken where a true economic loss has been suffered. Comment Officials agree that a bad debt deduction should be allowed where a true economic loss has been suffered. As noted in the previous submission, it is recommended that the drafting of the limited recourse rule be amended to ensure it is clear what the provision is intended to capture. This redrafting will ensure that the submitter‘s concern is addressed and that where a true economic loss has been suffered, the limited recourse arrangement rule will not prevent a bad debt deduction from being taken. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Exception to limited recourse arrangement rule Clause 29 Submission (Baycorp) A collection agreement, where the collection is outsourced and a commission amount is paid for that collection service, should not be a limited recourse arrangement. Comment Officials do not see how a collection agreement, as described above, would fall within the current definition of ―limited recourse arrangement‖. The base maintenance change is intended to ensure bad debt deductions are limited to the true economic loss and the limited recourse arrangement rule is a supporting anti-avoidance measure to ensure this result is achieved. A collection agreement would only be affected by this anti- avoidance measure if there is a limited recourse component to the agreement. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 131 Issue: Application date of base maintenance change Clause 26 and 29 Submission (NZICA, Baycorp) As currently proposed, taxpayers who have taken excess deductions will be required to return those amounts as income in the 2014-15 year. If the amendment proceeds, it should be prospective only. (NZICA) The rule which requires certain income to be returned in the 2014-15 year is not appropriate. This is especially so given the submitter considers the application of the current rules does not provide a windfall but is a necessary consequence of how the bad debt rules and the base price adjustment (BPA) calculation are set up to work. As currently drafted, a taxpayer could be overtaxed after receiving both BPA income and income under the proposed claw-back rule. Retrospective legislation should be avoided to provide certainty to taxpayers. (Baycorp) Comment Under the current tax rules holders of debt can take bad debt deductions for amounts owing even where the holder has not suffered an economic loss. This result is not in line with the existing policy for bad debt deductions. It also results in an unjustified timing advantage and presents a risk to the integrity of the revenue base. As drafted, the base maintenance changes will apply from the date of introduction of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill, and there will be a retrospective claw-back rule to require taxpayers who have taken excess deductions (that is, deductions exceeding the cost of acquisition and any income returned), to return those amounts as income in the 2014-15 year. The effect of the claw-back rule is that the rule is retrospective for financial arrangements that are in existence in the 2014–15 year, and affected taxpayers must return extra income prospectively (in the 2014–15 year). Officials consider that this is justified because it puts them back in the same position they should be in, in line with the policy intent. There is no concern with financial arrangements that have ended prior to the 2014–15 year, as the BPA (wash-up calculation) that would have been performed should have squared-up any excess deductions taken. The reason for the claw-back rule is that, notwithstanding the current legislative wording, it is not considered reasonable for taxpayers to take deductions for more than their economic loss under the financial arrangement. It is not anticipated that a large number of taxpayers will be affected by the claw-back rule; however, it is necessary for base maintenance reasons. There will be a savings provision for taxpayers who are involved in assessments that are subject to the tax disputes process. 132 Officials agree with Baycorp that there may be some circumstances where the proposed claw-back rule would result in too much tax being paid and therefore recommend a slight amendment to the claw-back rule to ensure the correct policy result is achieved. Recommendation That the submission be declined subject to officials‘ comments. 133 FINANCIAL REPORTING Clauses 109–111 Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The CTG supports the general proposal that Inland Revenue, as the biggest user of financial statements, should prescribe the minimum financial reporting requirements. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Support for the consultation requirement Submission (CTG, NZICA) The submitters endorse the requirement that the Minister of Revenue be satisfied that consultation has been appropriate before the Orders in Council are recommended. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: The minimum requirements should be no more than what is presently required Submission (NZICA) That the Inland Revenue requirements should be no more extensive than what Inland Revenue generally requires taxpayers to provide currently. Comment Currently Inland Revenue does not set requirements for the specific form and detail of financial statements that it requests. One of the outcomes of the project will be the setting of minimum requirements by Inland Revenue, which will allow some consistency in the information requested. 134 Officials discussed this with NZICA who advised that compliance cost concerns are behind this submission. Officials have always been aware that the question is the balancing between these compliance costs and the availability of appropriate information. All parties are agreed that there is no point setting the minimum financial reporting requirements such that general purpose financial statements are required and this has never been Inland Revenue‘s intention. The consultation process is intended to ensure that this balance is right. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Timelines for compliance with request to produce financial statements Submission (NZICA) That it be made clear that taxpayers will be given reasonable time to furnish the financial statements following a request by Inland Revenue. The body of the submissions suggests a three month period. The submitter would prefer this to be codified into the legislation rather than confirmed in a statement issued by Inland Revenue. Comment The submission raises two separate but associated points, the period and the codification of the period. NZICA advise that there should be a reasonable time period. Officials agree. Officials expect that the financial statements would be prepared, or largely prepared, as part of the tax return preparation process. Thus the production of financial statements should not be a time consuming exercise. The NZICA submission seems to envisage that the preparation of financial statements and supporting data analysis may in some cases commence after the request. If this is accepted then the question must be asked as to the basis on which the tax return was prepared. Generally Inland Revenue allows 28 days for the provision of requested information, but it will take into account circumstances where different periods are appropriate. For example, when the taxpayer is subject to an adverse event a longer period might be appropriate. Alternatively, where the taxpayer is an insolvent company a shorter period might be appropriate. The 28 days could be codified, but that would reduce flexibility and would be unusual given that none of its other information requests are subject to codified periods. Rather 135 the more general practice seems to work satisfactorily while proving appropriate flexibility. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in principle, but, consistent with current practice, the time period generally be limited to 28 days and that the codification request be declined. 136 137 Remedial matters 138 139 REMEDIAL CHANGES TO THE TAXATION OF INSURANCE BUSINESS (Clauses 2(6) and (13), 32 and 33, 36, 37B, 44 to 54, 87, 100 to 101 and 103(44) to (46 and (54)) The bill contains a number of technical remedial changes to the tax treatment of general and life insurance business conducted in New Zealand. Issue: Reserves – deductions for claims under non-participation policies Submissions (Matter raised by officials) Further technical revision to section DR 4(1) is required to ensure that deductions do not arise for any savings returns to the policyholder that might be included in a claim. Comment Clause 33(1) of the bill amends section DR 4 of the Income Act 2007 and improves the Act‘s internal linkages relating to the rules about deductions for life-risk claims paid under a life insurance policy including reserving amounts (described in sections EY 20 and EY 23). The change ensures that deductions are defined in the context of non- participation policies. To further ensure that deductions for claims allowed under section DR 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are limited to non-participation policies, officials recommend a further technical change by specifying the deduction for a claim does not arise if the life insurance policy is a profit participation policy or the expenditure or loss is in connection with an annuity. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that section DR 4 be amended by specifying that a deduction does not arise in respect of a claim under a profit-participation policy or an annuity. 140 Issue: Reserves – setting an opening balance for reserves when general and life insurance business is transferred from non-residents to New Zealand insurers Submissions (Matter raised by officials) The rules for calculating the opening balance for reserve connected with business that is transferred from a non-resident to a New Zealand resident insurer needs to take into account the actuarial assumptions used by the non-resident. Comment Clauses 36 and 44 respectively amend sections DW 4 and EY 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and set out a method for calculating the opening balance of reserves for insurance business that is transferred by a non-resident insurer to a New Zealand resident insurer. The amendment is intended to remove a risk that insurance business could be transferred from a jurisdiction that does not have similar commercial or tax regulatory environment to New Zealand with the result that deduction entitlements or taxable income could be over-or- understated. The proposed amendment requires New Zealand resident insurers to restate the closing balance of the transferred reserve as if the relevant insurance policies had been sold in New Zealand. The change focuses on the requirements of the reserve by reference to IFRS 4 but does not specify the assumptions that are used to support the calculation. This omission could, at worst, allow an overstated deduction to result, if for example, a New Zealand-resident insurer were to unduly suppress a risk margin on transfer but later revise the actuarial assumptions supporting the reserve to create a deduction in New Zealand. A further risk is that the amounts required by financial reporting and the judgement exercised by accountants under those standards can depart from the assumptions and methods required and used by an actuary. To prevent this situation from arising, officials recommend that the proposed amendments make particular reference to the rules in the Income Tax Act (rather than IRFS 4) in connection with the assumptions and methods that support the calculation of the various reserves when the transferor is a non-resident. For general insurers this will involve calculating the outstanding claims reserve by reference to a statutory formula that requires an actuarial determination of the insurer‘s incurred (but not reported) claims, reported claims and an appropriate risk margin.. Life insurers will need to make reference to sections EY 23 to 27. Consequential changes are also required to sections ED 3 and EY 5 to deal with part-year transfers. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, and that sections DW 4(4B) and EY 5(4B) be amended by adding the additional requirement that the opening balance be calculated using actuarial assumptions and methods set out in Income Tax Act 2007. 141 Issue: Policyholder base income – allocation of income Submissions (Matter raised by officials) Improvements recommended to assist reader comprehension about the application and effect of the allocation rules for investment income derived by non-participation policies. Comment Clause 45 amends section EY 15 to clarify its relationship with section EY 19. Section EY 15 defines the income that should be allocated to the policyholder base. Section EY 15(2) specifies that policyholder income is limited to the amount provided for in the formula set out in that section. Any excess income becomes shareholder base income under section EY 19. The purpose of the amendment is to specify when investment income is allocated between the shareholder base and the policyholder base. The effect of the proposed amendment is unclear as it is currently expressed. Officials recommend that the amendment be redrafted. To support the operation of the allocation rule in section EY 15(2), it is also recommended that the definition of ―investment income‖ in section EY 15(1) be amended so that it includes income that arises from the operation of the Income Tax Act 2007. The change does not extend the scope of the policyholder base but clarifies that income created by the Income Tax Act from investments can also be apportioned between the policyholder and shareholder bases. Under current law, income deemed to arise under the Income Tax Act from investments is arguably treated as policyholder income only. Consequential changes are also recommended to sections EY 16(2), the deduction rules for non-participation policies, to reflect the clarified relationship between sections EY 15 and EY 19. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that section EY 15(2) be amended so that the reference to section EY 19 be removed. Section EY 15(1) be amended by clarifying that the term ―investment income‖ also includes income from investments that arises through the operation of the Income Tax Act 2007. 142 Issue: Profit participation policies – discounting future entitlements to income Submissions (Financial Services Council, Matter raised by officials) The changes proposed to sections EY 17 and EY 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007 should also apply to sections EY 28 and EY 29. (Financial Services Council) The amendments to section EY 17 and EY 21 should be reworded to assist comprehension of the sections. (Matter raised by officials) Comment Clauses 46 and 49 amend sections EY 17 and EY 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure that any claim the shareholder base has on future income derived on investment income is correctly valued. The change involves replacing the current discount factor which requires a risk-free rate, with a discount rate that is actuarially determined. The discount rate used should be the same as the one used by a life insurer for financial reporting purposes. The relevant discount rate is net of tax. The amendments in the bill ensure that the Income Tax Act allocates the correct amount of future income to the shareholder base. The Financial Services Council has asked that the proposed amendment also apply to sections EY 28 and EY 29 which deal with ―other profit‖. ―Other profit‖ is income or expenditure that arises when there are changes in actual cashflows when contrasted against expected cashflows connected with the assets created by profit participation policies. The submission seeks a change to the way the Income Tax Act values policy liabilities in sections EY 28 and EY 29. Following discussions with the Financial Services Council, officials consider that the matter relates to the way the Income Tax Act 2007 expresses the concept of future amounts which are used to calculate a life insurer‘s exposure to policy liabilities and contractual claim over future earnings from managing policyholder assets. The discussions have also pointed to wider legislative matters affecting the calculation of ―other profit‖ in sections EY 28 and EY 29. Officials are currently reviewing the operation of the rules for calculating ―other profit‖, and the Financial Services Council‘s submission will be considered as part of it. As such, officials do not recommend making the change suggested by the Financial Services Council at this time, but will consider the matter for a future taxation bill. Officials do consider, however, that there is benefit in altering the amendment affecting the definition of ―present value (actuarial net)‖ in the bill. Rather than prescribe the manner of discounting, which carries the risk of mandating requirements that would normally not be used by life insurers, officials recommend changes to clauses 46 and 49 143 in connection with the amendments to sections EY 17 and EY 21 to specify that future amounts be recognised net of tax. A further change is recommended in sections EY 17(2)(c) and EY 21(2)(c) that would substitute the words ―future bonus declarations‖ with ―portions of future profits‖. Life insurers do not receive bonus declarations from managing policyholder assets – they receive a share of future profits. Recommendation That the submissions be declined in part. Sections EY 17 and EY 21 be amended so that future amounts are calculated net of tax. In sections EY 17(2)(c) and EY 21(2)(c) replace the words ―future bonus declarations‖ with the phrase ―portion of future profits‖. 144 REMEDIAL AMENDMENT TO THE TIME BAR FOR AMENDMENT OF INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT Clause 114 Issue: Remedial amendment to the time bar for amendment of income tax assessment Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The Corporate Taxpayer Group supports the proposal to clarify that the time bar applies to the Commissioner reducing the amount of a net loss on the basis that this restores the original policy intent. Comment Officials note the submission in support of the amendment to the time bar. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 145 PIE REMEDIALS Issue: FIF management fee rebates Submission (Deloitte) The legislation should be amended so that a person is not taxed on rebates of fees they have derived in relation to an interest in a FIF where the person has not been allowed a deduction for the payment of the fees, irrespective of the source of the rebate of fees. As the amendment would simply align the legislation with existing policy, it should have an effective date of 1 April 2009, when the relevant rule was introduced. Comment Section EX 59(2) treats a person with an interest in a FIF as having no income from the interest for a period other than FIF income. Section EX 59(2B) contains an exception where the amount derived by a person from an interest in a FIF is a rebate of fees and the person was allowed a deduction for the payment of the fees. Where a PIE invests in a FIF and calculates its FIF income using the fair dividend rate method, the PIE will be taxed on management fee rebates received from an investment manager engaged by the FIF, but the management fees are not deductible to the PIE because they are incurred by the FIF, not by the PIE. As the submitter notes, the policy intent behind the insertion in 2009 of section EX 59(2B) was to ensure tax symmetry with regards to management fees and any related rebates for a FIF investment. Officials therefore consider that in the situation described above, where the PIE has not taken a deduction for the payment of the fees, they should not be taxed on a rebate of those fees, irrespective of the source of that rebate of fees. Officials also agree with the submitter that any amendment should exclude persons who use the comparative value method for calculating their FIF income, as a full deduction for management fees charged to the FIF is effectively achieved where this method is used. Because the amendment proposed is a clarification in relation to section EX 59(2B), officials agree that it should be effective from 1 April 2009, with application for the 2009–10 and later income years (i.e., in line with the amendment that inserted section EX 59(2B). The retrospective application should be at the taxpayer‘s discretion. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 146 Issue: Definition of ―percentage‖ in a formula Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of ―percentage‖ in the formula used by a PIE for calculating amounts attributed to investors should be changed to ensure that it accommodates term funds with a fixed unit value. Comment Section HM 36(2) contains a formula which a multi-rate PIE uses to calculate the PIE income (or loss) attributable to each investor. The formula in section HM 36(2) contains the item ―percentage‖, which, as defined in section HM 36(3)(a), ―is the percentage of the investor‘s entitlement to a distribution by the PIE to the investor class‖. In the case of term funds with a fixed unit value (e.g., $1), where investors enter the fund at different times, but for the same price. This is because it is unclear whether the ―investor‘s entitlement to a distribution‖ referred to is the entitlement that accrues for the period on any given day, or is the total amount that would be distributed to the investor if a distribution was made on that day (and thus would not reflect their pro rata interest in the fund). The uncertainty could be resolved by amending the definition of ―percentage‖ in the formula to ensure that term funds with a fixed unit value are accommodated. As this amendment would ensure that the legislation reflects the existing policy position, application for the 2010–11 and later income years is considered appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that this change apply for the 2010–11 and later income years. 147 IMPUTATION CREDIT ACCOUNT Australian ICA company definition Clause 103(4) Submission (Ernst & Young Limited) It is not clear why the proposed definition of "Australian ICA Company‖ \[in clause 103(4)\] should refer to a company which "must" establish and maintain an ICA under section OB 2 when the latter section provides a choice. We suggest it refer to a company which chooses to establish and maintain an ICA under section OB 2. Comment A company resident in Australia may choose, if eligible, to opt into the New Zealand imputation system, under which the benefit of corporate tax paid in New Zealand is passed onto its shareholders. Once that choice is made and notice given to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, the Australian company must apply New Zealand‘s imputation rules. and is referred to as an Australian ICA company. The main obligation arising for an Australian ICA company is to establish and maintain an imputation credit account (ICA). This involves keeping a record of imputation credits and imputation debits to the ICA. We agree with the submitter that the drafting of the definition of Australian ICA company should be based on the taxpayer‘s choice to apply the imputation rules and not solely on the obligation to establish and maintain an ICA. We also recommend that consequential amendments be made to section OB 2 for consistency with the recommended amendments to the definition of Australian ICA company. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials‘ comments above. Issue: Definition of imputation credit account company (ICA company) Clauses 99 and 103(13) Submission (Matter raised by officials) That section OB 1 be amended to more clearly reflect the distinction between the application of the imputation rules to New Zealand resident companies and the obligation to establish and maintain an imputation credit account (ICA). 148 That the term ―ICA company‖ be defined to include a New Zealand resident company to which section OB 1 applies, and also an Australian resident company that has chosen to opt into the New Zealand imputation system. Comment Clause 99 Section OB 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (2007 Act), as drafted in clause 99, does not clearly distinguish between which companies the imputation rules apply to and the primary obligations under the imputation rules for an ICA company. The policy intent for section OB 1 is to state that:  The imputation rules apply to all New Zealand resident companies, except for the types of companies listed in section OB 1(2).  The main obligations of an ICA company are to establish and maintain an imputation credit account (ICA). We recommend that section OB 1(1) and (2) be amended to better reflect this policy. Clause 103(13) We also recommend that the definition of ―ICA company‖ in section YA 1 be consequentially amended (in clause 103(13)) to reflect that an ICA company is a company to which the imputation rules apply. This approach results in the definition of ―ICA company‖ referring to both a New Zealand resident company that must apply the imputation rules and an Australian ICA company that has chosen to apply the imputation rules. In the 2007 Act, the definition of ―ICA company‖ does not include an Australian ICA company, which differs from its corresponding definition in the Income Tax Act 2004. This omission, inadvertently arising in the rewrite of the imputation rules, arguably results in some administrative imputation rules in the Taxation Administration Act 1994 not applying to Australian ICA companies. The policy intention is that these administrative rules should apply to both a New Zealand resident company and an Australian ICA company. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 149 COMMENCEMENT AND APPLICATION FOR AMENDING PROVISIONS Issue: Amending provisions to include income years. Submission (Ernst & Young) The submitter states that the Bill includes reference to various provisions coming into force on a specific date. The submitter believes that the application of many, if not all of those, should also refer to the relevant income (or imputation) years for which they take effect, or for which repealed provisions no longer apply. The submitter requests that all the application provisions should be further reviewed. Comment Standing Order 253(1) states that a bill must include a distinct clause stating when the bill comes into force. In this bill, the relevant clause is clause 2. The effect of clause 2 is to give the date or dates on which the text of a principal Act is affected by amendments in a clause of the bill. Such a date is often called the commencement date of the amendment. For some amendments, a commencement date is sufficient to specify the intended effect of the amendment. If a provision is intended to apply to payments as they occur, for example, the text of the provision at the time of the payment will determine the tax treatment of the payment. The amended text will then apply to payments made on or after the commencement date for the amendment; the original text will apply to payments made before the commencement date. Often, however, the effect of the amendment is intended to be more complex. A common example is an amendment intended to affect taxpayers for a specific income year and later income years. For two taxpayers with different income years, a particular day may occur in an affected income year for one taxpayer but in an earlier income year for the other taxpayer. A payment by one of the taxpayers on the day will be intended to have a different tax treatment from a payment made by the other taxpayer on the same day. But the text of the principal Act on that day will be the same for both taxpayers. To produce the desired effect, the usual practice is to include a provision specifying the transitional effect of an amendment. Such a provision is expressed in terms of the way in which the amending clauses and subclauses apply and is commonly referred to as an application (sub)clause. Standing Orders do not specify the placement of application clauses in the Act and they are customarily included as a subclause in the clause to which they relate. The need for an application subclause depends on the circumstances of the particular amendment being considered and there are usually some clauses in a tax bill that do not have an application subclause. 150 Officials note that the commencement dates and application provisions for amendments relating to specific topics are discussed elsewhere under those topics. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 151 Matters raised by officials 152 153 UPDATE TO CROSS-REFERENCE: KIWISAVER TRANS-TASMAN PORTABILITY SCHEME Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 189(5) of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 introduced the new trans-Tasman portability scheme for KiwiSaver. The scheme went live on 1 July 2013, following the completion of the necessary legislative processes in New Zealand and Australia. Under the portability scheme, a KiwiSaver member who permanently migrates to Australia can transfer all of their KiwiSaver funds, including any KiwiSaver member tax credits (MTCs), to an Australian complying superannuation scheme. Clause 17 of Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 provides that before any MTCs can be withdrawn from KiwiSaver on retirement, serious illness or death, the member (or their personal representatives) must provide a statutory declaration confirming their eligibility for these MTCs. Any MTCs that were incorrectly claimed are refunded to the Crown. The trans-Tasman transfer rules allow MTCs to be taken to Australia. So a statutory declaration confirming eligibility/entitlement should be provided, for consistency with the other MTC withdrawal rules. Comment The reference at clause 17 should be updated to include transfers under the trans- Tasman portability rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 154 HEALTH ENTITLEMENT CARDS: CORRECTING REFERENCE TO WORKING FOR FAMILIES TAX CREDITS Clause 118 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Health Entitlement Cards Regulations (the Regulations) contain references to the different components of the Working for Families tax credits. When the tax credits were renamed in 2004, not all references in the Regulations were updated. The Regulations refer to credits of tax under Part M of the Income Tax Act being included in a person‘s income when assessing entitlement to the Community Services Card. Since then, Part M has been amended to also include the KiwiSaver member tax credit but the Regulations were not updated to exclude this tax credit. Comment A person‘s entitlement to the Community Services Card is based on their income plus any Working for Families tax credits they receive. The Regulations refer to these tax credits by name. The out-dated reference to the former names for some components of the Working for Families tax credits means a literal reading of the Regulations can lead to an incorrect calculation of income. This is because the name ―family tax credit‖ now applies to what used to be known as the family support tax credit and no longer to the minimum family tax credit. The incorrect name reference could also impact on the authority of Inland Revenue to transfer information on the payment of the minimum family tax credit to the Ministry of Social Development for the purpose of calculating entitlement to the Community Services Card. It was never intended that the Community Services Card definition of income include KiwiSaver member tax credits. Rather it was intended to only cover the Working for Families tax credits in subparts MA to MF and MZ. Officials from Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Social Development recommend the Regulations be amended to refer to the correct names of the components of the Working for Families tax credits, and to the correct cross- references in the Income Tax Act 2007 for the Working for Families tax credits. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 155 CHARITABLE OR OTHER PUBLIC BENEFIT GIFT Submission (Matter raised by officials) That the definition of ―charitable or other public benefit gift‖ be amended to restore the reference to the phrase ―gift of money‖. Comment The policy intention is that the tax credit for a charitable or other public benefit gift requires the gift to be made in money, or be a subscription paid to a society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund referred to in section LD 3. The rewrite of this definition into section LD 3 omitted the phrase ―of money‖ on the basis the language of the provision provided sufficient direction that the gift was required to be paid in money. However, questions have been raised with officials on whether this drafting approach definitively requires the gift to be paid in money. Officials recommend that the definition of ―charitable or other public benefit gift‖ be amended to clarify the definition of ―charitable or other public gift‖ is a monetary gift. This is consistent with the long standing policy and the corresponding provision of the Income Tax Act 2004. We also recommend this amendment apply to charitable or other public benefit gifts made after the enactment of the amending legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 156 THIN CAPITALISATION RULES Submission (Matter raised by officials) That an incorrect cross reference in section FE 41 to section FE 40 has resulted in an unintended change in legislation arising from the rewrite of the thin capitalisation provisions. Comment The issue arises from a submission to the Rewrite Advisory Panel that the association rule in section FE 41 should apply only to determine whether the thin capitalisation rules apply to companies with tiered ownership structures. The submission is that the effect of the current wording in section FE 41 results in the association rule applying for the whole of subpart FE rather than just section FE 41. The Panel has recommended a retrospective remedial change to correct the drafting, but did not recommend a savings provision. We agree with the Panel‘s conclusions and recommendations. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.

Clauses 28 and 29(1) As part of the Budget 2012 legislation, section EC 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007 was amended so that, from 18 August 2011 (the date the officials’ issues paper, Herd scheme elections, was released) elections by farmers to use the herd scheme could not be revoked. As a consequential to other livestock valuation amendments proposed in this bill, that legislation has been rewritten. Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, WHK) The application date of this amendment should be 24 May 2012 when the Budget 2012 amendments were introduced, instead of the retrospective date of 18 August 2011. Comment WHK argues that retrospective legislation is inappropriate unless there are exceptional circumstances or a high revenue risk. The Ministers of Finance and Revenue, when they announced this amendment on 28 March 2012, advised that the change was to prevent an estimated $275 million loss in the tax base over the next few years. Any change to the application date would not be appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 4 CESSATION OF FARMING – GENERAL RULE Clause 30 The bill proposes that section EC 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007 be amended so that when a farmer sells up and retires, they should be required to use the herd values nearest to the date of sale to calculate their final livestock tax liability. Presently, when they sell up before 31 January and cease deriving farming income they have a choice of whether to use last year’s or the current year’s herd values to calculate this final tax liability. This choice results in a systemic fiscal tax opportunity against the revenue base for farmers, who will always choose the most tax advantageous result. Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, WHK) Retiring farmers should still have an option about which herd value to use. Comment NZICA states in its submission: Currently this section is optional so long as the farmer qualifies, which provides farmers with a tax opportunity. By making it compulsory, appropriate certainty is provided to both farmers and to the Government. The quote from NZICA’s submission answers the submission. Officials agree – farmers should not be left with a potentially fiscally expensive systemic tax opportunity in this situation. The proposed amendment in the bill prevents that. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (WHK, Brandt Segedin LP) The application date of this provision should be deferred from 28 March 2012 to the commencement of the 2013–14 income year (WHK), or the 2012–13 income year (Brandt Segedin LP). Comment The WHK submission effectively asks for the deferral of the switching of the rules that used to offer retiring farmers a potential tax advantage. The 28 March 2012 announcement was unequivocal. While the baseline effect of extending this may not be very significant, most farmers and their accountants would have acted through 2012–13 as if it had been repealed, and would not have made elections. Farmers who did make elections were presumably hoping for a windfall gain. 5 Both submissions suggest that the 28 March 2012 application date would cause confusion because the commentary to the bill suggests that the effective application date is the 2012–13 income year. Officials doubt that this will result in any real confusion, but there is no reason why the application date could not be the start of the 2012–13 income year. This is not a substantive change. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, and apply from the commencement of the 2012–13 income year. Submission (Chapman Tripp) The pre-1993 version of the “cease farming” election should effectively be re-instated. This referred to the farmer ceasing farming, whereas the 1993 version (still current) refers to the farmer ceasing to derive farming income. Comment The cease farming election as introduced in 1989 had no explicit requirement that the farmer cease deriving income from farming. All the farmer had to do was cease farming to qualify for the election. The objective of the election was to allow farmers to finalise their farming tax affairs if they ceased farming before the end of their income year. This implies that they must cease deriving income from farming otherwise, how could they be said to have ceased farming and be in a position to finalise their farming tax affairs. The requirement to cease deriving income from farming was inserted as part of the 1993 rewrite of the livestock valuation provisions. Because this was a very small part of a much larger rewrite, no specific detail on the rationale behind the change is available, but it logically follows from the objective of the provision. The rule is unambiguous and has been unchanged for almost 20 years. The submission arises because dairy farmers typically recognise their bonuses from their dairy companies on more of a cash basis, and the last of these bonuses is paid out in July or August, which is in the retired farmer’s next income year. Thus it is clear that the farmer cannot finalise their affairs for the year in which they sold their livestock and thus there is no need (or capability) to finalise their farming tax affairs in the year in which they sold their livestock. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 6 DISPOSAL OF LIVESTOCK TO AN ASSOCIATED PERSON The bill contains provisions to prevent associated persons transactions (say a sale by a farmer to a family trust of which he or she is a beneficiary) from being used to avoid the compulsory nature of the herd scheme. The purchaser has to assume any herd scheme election and base herd scheme numbers of the vendor. In effect this means that both parties use the same herd scheme values for tax purposes for their closing values in the year of the transfer and as a result one party’s taxable income is the other party’s taxable loss to the extent the transfer values differ from the herd scheme values. Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants – supplementary submission) That NZICA understands the tenor of this proposal. Recommendation Noted. Submission (KPMG) Requiring associated parties to also use the herd scheme goes too far. Comment Inland Revenue is currently reviewing the 2009 tax returns of about 400 dairy farmers who conducted associated persons transactions. Some of these may be found to be tax avoidance, and, if so, the average tax avoided is about $100,000 per farmer. If avoidance is found, the issue is about using associated party transactions to exit from the herd scheme. The submission suggests this goes too far without putting up an alternative. During consultation there was agreement that the associated persons issue should be addressed, No satisfactory alternative mechanisms have been found. Recommendation That the submission be declined 7 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants – supplementary submission) The 31 October date that applies to determine whether to use opening or closing herd scheme values for non-associated party sales when there is a cessation from farming should also apply to associated persons transactions. Comment The associated persons tax position on a transfer of herd scheme livestock is a mirror image – one party’s gain will be the other party’s loss. The submission notes that the closer we get to herd scheme values the less volatile the tax impact will be. Further, as NZICA points out, this is consistent with the treatment of non-associated persons sales where the volatility objective is the same. However, this can only easily work in situations when the vendor sells all of their specified livestock. When there is a partial sale the vendor still has to calculate an opening herd scheme adjustment and it would be inappropriate to require this to be partially turned off. However, the underlying point is addressed by the next submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants – supplementary submission, WHK) Solely for tax purposes, the associated persons transaction should be deemed to take place at herd scheme values. Comment The submission suggests that total tax neutrality can be achieved if, solely for tax purposes, the transaction is deemed to take place at herd scheme values. NZICA points out that this would be an appropriate extension of “the unique features of the herd scheme’s capital adjustments that distinguish herd scheme livestock from more ordinary trading stock”. Officials believe the submission has merit. The bill forces the associated person to step into the shoes of the vendor for some herd scheme reasons – herd scheme elections and the herd scheme base number calculations. This merely extends that concept. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 8 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants – supplementary submission) The purchaser should be deemed, for income tax purposes, to acquire the herd scheme livestock in the same year the vendor sold it. Comment NZICA points out that the objective of this submission is to achieve symmetry between the two associated parties in the unusual situation when the parties have different balance dates. Officials agree that when the person acquiring the herd scheme livestock does so in a different income year to the income year that the vendor sold the livestock, the herd scheme adjustment does not work properly for the purchaser. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (Ernst & Young) Proposed section EC 4B should be amended to make it clear which parties to an associated persons transaction its various subsections are referring to. Comment Officials agree that further clarity can be provided. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 9 EXCEPTIONS TO THE ASSOCIATED PERSONS RULE The bill proposes an exception to the proposed associated persons rule when there is a genuine inter-generational transfer of an ownership interest in livestock to children or grandchildren. The suggested grounds for this are very limited, and essentially require the children or grandchildren to have no direct or indirect ownership interest in the livestock before the transfer and the parents or grandparents to have no direct or indirect ownership interest in the livestock after the transfer. This is to ensure that the inter- generational transfer is genuine. Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) NZICA supports the concept of this exception. Recommendation Noted. Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The exception should be extended to beneficiaries of a trust (whether the trust owns the livestock directly or indirectly) where they only have a beneficial interest in the trust. Comment Given the modern discretionary trust, a “beneficial interest” could amount to almost all the privileges of ownership (for example, receipt of all the farming income). In this case it is not viable to suggest that the beneficiary is not already, at least economically, an owner of the livestock. Further, it would be very difficult to distinguish this “full ownership” beneficial interest from beneficial interests that were considerably less than this. Further, from a tax policy perspective, this seems inappropriate – if the children or grandchildren have an direct or indirect interest in the income from the sale of livestock then they have, at least in an economic sense, an interest in the livestock. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 10 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The exception should be extended to situations when the children or grandchildren receive their direct or indirect interest in livestock by way of a testamentary bequest. Comment When the older generation has ceased farming and the younger generation has begun farming as a result of the death of the famer the policy parameters for inter-generational relief apply. The present drafting of this relief does not look beyond the testamentary trust in deciding association and therefore “tainting”. Thus, as the bill was introduced, relief would not be available. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (WHK) Inland Revenue should be given a discretion in determining which associated persons’ transactions the exception applies to. Comment In the last 10 years Parliament has removed most of the discretions that used to apply. In their place the legislation has been amended to provide more certainty. Inland Revenue would not have the resources to review applications on a taxpayer-by-taxpayer basis. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The farming structure should not dictate whether or not the exemption applies. Comment We have discussed this with NZICA and they now agree that this submission has been addressed. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 11 Submission (Ernst & Young) The definition of “associated persons” should be revisited as it seems that siblings of either generation, or grandparents, who are operating independently could “taint” the transaction and inappropriately limit the conceptually correct application of the exception. Comment Officials agree that associated party farmers that are completely independent could limit the application of the exception. This would further and inappropriately limit what is already, by intent, a relatively narrow exception. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, WHK) Use of the term “in the ordinary course of business” as a limitation to the more general associated persons rule should be clarified. Comment WHK submits that the bill should be amended to provide further clarity. We have discussed this issue with the other submitter, NZICA, which agrees that any clarification should be by way of example in the Tax Information Bulletin. The Tax Information Bulletin is published by Inland Revenue when the legislation is enacted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and an example be provided in the relevant Tax Information Bulletin. 12 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The limitation that requires the vendor to cease deriving income from specified livestock should be marginally widened. Comment The concern is that the vendor might retire to a lifestyle block and keep a few animals. This should not disqualify the parties from accessing the exception to the associated persons rule. An amendment to insert a business requirement into the cessation rule would address this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 13 LIVESTOCK CLASSES Clause 59 The bill proposes that, from the tax year ended 31 March 2013, the Friesian and Jersey beef cattle classes, and the Red and Wapiti deer classes, be combined as at the margin it can be difficult to determine which class a particular line of stock should be in. Further, there are anecdotal suggestions that some advisors view this as an opportunity for tax planning. Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, WHK) This should be deferred as the legislation will not be passed by May 2013 when the 2013 herd values will be announced. Comment The submission is correct. However, in the circumstances it is appropriate to deal with the underlying dilemma and suggested opportunity. This could be done by requiring that, for the purposes of calculating minimum herd scheme numbers for the 2012–13 income year, these classes are combined. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and instead, for the 2012–13 year, the classes of Friesian and Jersey dairy cattle, and Red and Wapiti deer, be combined for the purposes of calculating minimum herd scheme numbers. 14 LIVESTOCK VALUATION ELECTIONS Submission (WHK) The present requirement for farmers to make a separate written election to use the herd scheme should be repealed. Comment This requirement has existed since the herd scheme was introduced in 1997. The need for it has been well illustrated over the last few years when the various herd scheme rules have been pushed to the boundary, and, in some cases, potentially over the boundary. Inland Revenue’s use of this written notice has been a part of ensuring that farmers have complied with the various technical rules over this period. While the amendments proposed in the bill should limit opportunities for farmers and their accountants to push the boundaries, this has yet to be proven. In the meantime, officials believe that the information gained from this notice is still necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 15 Assets expenditure 16 17 OVERVIEW Background Some assets, such as holiday homes, aircraft and boats are sometimes used to earn income for their owners, and are also used privately. These are referred to as mixed-use assets. Currently, the tax rules allow deductions for expenditure incurred in earning taxable income and disallow deductions for expenditure that relates to the private use of an asset. However, these rules can be difficult to apply to expenditure that does not clearly relate to either the income-earning or private use of an asset. Examples include expenditure that arises while a holiday home, boat or aircraft is unused, and expenditure on general repairs and maintenance. Generally, under current law, owners will claim that their asset is available for income- earning use when the asset is not being used privately. This provides them with a basis for claiming tax deductions for expenses relating to this period. However, if the asset is primarily a private asset, or the income-earning and private use are relatively equal, the level of deductions owners can claim will not be aligned with the actual income-earning use of the asset. The proposed new rules are designed to improve fairness in the tax system by ensuring that tax deductions are broadly aligned with the income that is earned. They are also intended to increase economic efficiency by reducing the extent to which investment in such assets is driven by tax considerations. The proposed new rules have been developed in response to submissions received on the officials’ issues paper, Mixed-use assets, released in August 2011, and subsequent consultation with interested parties. Key concepts in the bill The bill proposes new rules that prescribe the amount of deductions that owners of certain assets can claim. Generally, the rules will apply to assets which are used to earn income, are used privately, and are unused for more than 62 days in an income year. There are three possible ways to deal with the deductibility of expenditure incurred in relation to a mixed-use asset which does not relate directly to income-earning or private use – such as mortgage interest or rates which relate to periods when the asset was unused:  Allow deductions for all such expenditure, on the basis that the asset is available for income-earning use when empty (the present rule).  Deny deductions for all such expenditure, on the basis that the asset is essentially a private asset.  Allow deductions for some proportion of those costs, on the basis that the asset has a dual purpose. 18 These proposals choose the proportionate deduction approach. This allows a deduction for general expenditure on the basis of actual income-earning use divided by the total actual use of the asset. So, if an asset is used privately for 30 days, and used to earn income for 30 days, 50 percent of most expenditure will be an allowable deduction. Specific rules for companies The new rules apply to assets held by individuals, partnerships and certain companies. Proposed rules for companies override the general rule for companies that interest incurred by companies is always deductible (subject only to the thin capitalisation rules), regardless of the use of the borrowed funds. The special interest deductibility rules in companies also extend to other companies in the same group as the company that owns the mixed-use asset and to shareholders. Deduction quarantining Under the proposed changes in the bill, asset owners who generate a loss from their asset and earn less than a 2% rate of return are not able to offset that loss against other income, but can carry it forward to use against future income from the mixed-use asset. This rule is designed to address situations when use is low and the chosen apportionment rule does not deliver a sensible outcome. Application dates The proposals in the bill as introduced apply from the commencement of the 2013 income year. Fiscal implications It is forecast that this measure will have a revenue gain of approximately $50 million a year. General theme of the submissions received Submissions were received from 11 submitters on the mixed-use asset proposals. Submitters ranged from the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and the New Zealand Law Society to professional firms and businesses involved in renting mixed-use assets. No submissions were received from actual owners of mixed-use assets. Most submitters stated that they supported the approach of apportioning expenditure based on the use of the asset as set out in the bill. No submitters opposed it. Matters raised by submitters were:  concern about the degree of complexity of the rules applying to companies, in particular; and  concern about the proposed loss quarantining rules. A number of other comments, including many technical comments, were also raised. 19 MAIN POLICY ISSUES RAISED IN SUBMISSIONS Issue: The proposed commencement date of the 2013–14 income year is effectively retrospective Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Deloitte, Bell Gully, KPMG) The bill is likely to become law in the second half of 2013 calendar year, but applies from the commencement of the 2013–14 income year. The 2013–14 income year starts on 1 April 2013 for most taxpayers, and even earlier for some. This means the legislation is effectively retrospective, and does not provide an opportunity for taxpayers to plan for it. It should be deferred by a year, and take effect from the beginning of the 2014–15 income year. Submitters also suggested that “transitional rules” should be provided to allow companies to transfer assets to other entities. Comment The policy objective of these measures is to achieve a better balance of fairness between those who own mixed-use assets and those who do not. It is obviously desirable to achieve fairness sooner than later. The Government’s intention to reform this area was first announced in the Budget of May 2011, followed by an issues paper released in August 2011. Taxpayers have therefore had some prior warning that change was likely in this area. While those earlier statements did not include detail about the interest rules for companies in particular, the bill was introduced in September 2012 which gave six months for a risk- averse taxpayer with the standard 31 March balance date to restructure their affairs. There are two transitional rules requested by submitters:  a rule dealing with the tax consequences of depreciation recovery, when an asset is transferred for more than its tax book value; and  a rule dealing with the deemed dividend implications of the transfer of an asset from a company to a shareholder or associate for less than its market value. These changes have been requested to enable assets to be transferred out of companies without “adverse” tax consequences. Officials consider that these concerns have some merit, and make the following recommendations. 20 The bulk of mixed-use assets will be short-term holiday accommodation. Discussions with external parties lead officials to understand that most baches will be held in simple ownership structures, where the concerns raised by submitters are less. Officials therefore recommend that the 2013–14 income year commencement date should continue to apply to these assets. Other assets – boats and aircraft – make up a small percentage of the pool of mixed-use assets. Due to difficulties ascertaining the number of these assets which potentially fall within the mixed-use asset rules, and the mix of their income-earning and private use, they have not been included in the fiscal estimate of these proposals. Given the smaller number and lower values of these assets compared with baches, we expect the revenue raised from them to be a relatively small proportion of the total revenue raised. Some of these assets, in particular aircraft, will possibly be held in more complex structures for commercial (rather than tax) reasons. For these reasons, officials therefore consider that it would be reasonable to defer the implementation date of the mixed-use asset rules to assets other than land until the commencement of the 2014–15 income year. While the revenue collected from them will be a relatively small proportion of the total revenue raised, it is important that they are included in due course from a fairness perspective. The interest-stacking rules which apply to companies can have some adverse effect on the tax positions of those companies, and those who control those companies may choose to transfer the assets out of companies into other ownership structures where different interest allocation rules apply. Where those assets have been depreciated to a value below their market value, depreciation recovery will be triggered. Submitters have proposed that a transitional rule be introduced under which assets can be transferred out of companies without triggering depreciation recovery. Officials consider that it is reasonable to allow assets to be transferred on this basis, provided that assets are transferred to shareholders in proportion to their shareholding, and the shareholders acquire the assets at the same tax book values as the company which transferred them. This means that a tax liability for depreciation recovery will arise if the shareholders subsequently dispose of the asset for an amount greater than the asset’s tax book value. Officials consider that this rule need only be made available until the end of the 2013–14 income year, and that it should only be available to companies which hold mixed-use assets at 31 March 2013. In light of the above approach to dealing with assets held in companies, officials do not consider that an exemption from the dividend rules as requested by some submitters is necessary. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, in part. 21 Issue: The rules are unduly complex Submissions (Ernst & Young, Chapman Tripp, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, Deloitte, Bell Gully) Submitters’ concerns about complexity took a number of forms:  The rules should either not proceed or be revised and redrafted to provide a much simpler approach.  The rules need to be simple, because they are to be applied by relatively small and unsophisticated taxpayers.  The complexity creates a risk of non-compliance.  Rather than enacting such complex rules, it would be better to focus on the enforcement of apportionment rules already contained in the Income Tax Act 2007.  The entry criteria should be high and focused on situations when the current outcomes are inappropriate. Comment The bill as introduced contained two main areas of complex legislation:  the rules which deal with interest deductions in corporate groups; and  the rules which deal with deduction quarantining in corporate groups. The main issue which arises is the ability for an interest deduction, which relates to the holding of the mixed-use asset, to be incurred in another entity in a corporate group. It is necessary to look beyond the company that owns the assets to other companies and shareholders which incur interest costs to ensure the arrangements which already exist now are treated fairly. Further, without rules addressing interest deductibility in complex structures, officials expect that the number of assets held in such structures would increase. These rules are therefore necessary and unavoidably complex. However, these complex rules only need to be considered by taxpayers when the structure in which the mixed-use asset is held is itself complex. The rules are relatively straightforward to apply when, as will be almost always the case, the asset is not held in a complex structure. However, officials understand that a relatively small proportion of mixed-use assets are held in companies, and of those, a much smaller proportion are held in complex corporate groups. Officials suggest that the Committee consider the proportion (and circumstances) of mixed-use assets these complex rules will apply to, rather than the number of pages of the bill they occupy. Detailed recommendations later in this report do, however, seek to streamline these rules where possible. 22 The majority of mixed-use asset owners, which are individuals, partnerships, qualifying companies, look-through companies and trusts, will be primarily concerned with the core apportionment rule, which officials do not consider to be complex, and which has been broadly accepted by submitters. A number of detailed recommendations have been made later in this report to streamline this and other rules which apply to these asset owners. The deduction quarantining rule is required to deal with the consequences of the application of the simple apportionment formula to expenses. This is explained in more detail later in this report. We do not agree with the submission that the policy objective can be achieved by enforcement of existing legislation. The approach that a full deduction can be claimed for “empty but available for use days” is made under current law and an attempt by the Commissioner to enforce a different approach is very likely to be unsuccessful. Even if the Commissioner were to be successful, current law would effectively permit sheltering of interest in structures involving companies, and these structures would soon become ubiquitous. The fairness objectives of these proposals would not be achieved by this approach. Finally, Inland Revenue hopes to be able to make an on-line tool available for asset owners and tax agents to help them to make the calculations required by this legislation. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: The rules applying to companies are too complex Submission (BusinessNZ) Some amendments to the fringe benefit tax (FBT) and deemed dividend rules would meet concerns in this area. Comment The policy objective of the mixed-use asset rules is to better align deductions that are claimed with the taxable income that is earned. This is achieved by limiting the deductions which can be claimed for periods when the asset is not in use. FBT and the deemed dividend rules take a different approach, which is to impose a tax liability on the private use of a company’s assets. For the FBT or the deemed dividend rules to address the policy issue here, it would be necessary for an FBT liability or a deemed dividend to arise when the asset was unused. 23 This would give rise to a number of concerns:  It would be conceptually difficult for people to understand why a tax obligation would arise when their asset was available for use, even though they did not use it.  It would be necessary to ascribe a value to unused days. This would be difficult because it would not be appropriate to ascribe the same value as a day of actual use. Therefore the question would arise over what value would be appropriate – for example, would it be 90 percent, 30 percent or 25 percent of the value of an actual day of use?  It would inevitably generate entirely different outcomes from a deduction apportionment rule. Incentives would be created for people to move assets into, or out of, company structures to reduce their tax liabilities. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Interaction between these rules and other provisions which deal with personal use of assets Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young) Under current law, FBT and deemed dividend rules apply to tax private use of company assets. The mixed-use asset proposals do not explain their relationship with these rules, and there is a concern that a form of double taxation would arise if both the mixed-use asset and the FBT or deemed dividend rules were to apply. Comment The FBT and the deemed dividend rules work well where a shareholder or an associate uses an asset owned by a company, but they do not deal with the time the asset is not used but available for use. As a general principle, the policy objective of the proposals of matching deductions to income-earning use is therefore more likely to be achieved by the mixed-use asset rules applying rather than the FBT or deemed dividend rules. This is also more likely to create an entity-neutral outcome, under which the incentive to move assets in or out of companies to achieve a more favourable tax outcome is minimised. However, this is subject to several important caveats. Officials have recommended later in this report an amendment to the definition of “assets to which these rules apply”. Certain assets where the private use is incidental and subject to FBT or the deemed dividend rules are recommended to be excluded from the proposed mixed-use asset rules. 24 Officials agree that, where the mixed-use asset rules apply, FBT should not also apply, and that a new provision should be included to this effect. Officials also note that, where the benefit provided is in the form of accommodation, an income tax liability may arise to the recipient. Officials recommend that where the mixed-use asset rules apply, the provision of accommodation not give rise to an income tax liability. In any circumstances where FBT does apply, or the provision of accommodation gives rise to an income tax liability, the use should be treated as an income-earning day under the apportionment formula. This is subject to an additional change in the area of shareholder-employees, who can choose whether the use of an asset is subject to the FBT or dividend rules. The use ought always to be subject to the deemed dividend rules, so that the mixed-use asset rules apply. This amendment is necessary because, where use is relatively low and expenses high, FBT will generally give a more favourable outcome than the mixed-use asset rules and to allow a choice would provide a tax planning opportunity. However, officials do not agree that where the mixed-use asset rules apply, the deemed dividend rules should not also apply. A simple comparison can be made with a cash dividend. A cash dividend is not deductible to the company which pays it, but is income to an individual who receives it. Imputation credits may be available to meet the tax liability on that income. This is exactly the same result that would be achieved by having both the mixed-use asset and the deemed dividend rules apply to an asset. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, in part (see later recommendation). Issue: The interest rules which apply to companies unfairly treat debt as applying to the mixed-use asset first Submission (KPMG, Bell Gully, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, Chapman Tripp, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young) The debt-stacking rule which applies to corporate groups is unfair because it is based on an assumption that any borrowings firstly relate to the mixed-use asset. A number of submitters suggested that a debt-tracing rule be available instead, and some submitters suggested that a gross assets / gross debt formula be used instead. Comment The policy objective of the proposed rules is to ensure that only an appropriate proportion of the expenditure which relates to a mixed-use asset is deductible. 25 Since 2001, a rule has existed under which all debt incurred by most companies is deductible (subject only to the thin capitalisation rules). This rule overrides the tracing rule that would otherwise apply, which requires identification of the application of each amount borrowed by a company to determine whether the interest was deductible or not. The rule that all debt was deductible was introduced to address the compliance costs which companies were incurring in ensuring that all of the interest they did incur was deductible. The 2001 rules are based on two related assumptions:  all money is fungible; and therefore  tracing is essentially impossible in corporate groups. Submissions stating that debt relating to a mixed-use asset can somehow be traced inside a corporate group runs counter to the basis on which the 2001 rules operate. Officials’ view is that it would be conceptually inconsistent to operate two sets of rules, one assuming companies could trace debt and the other assuming they could not, at the same time. Corporate groups would eventually structure their affairs to ensure that no debt was able to be traced to the mixed-use asset and so avoid apportionment of any interest expenditure. Other submitters suggested a gross assets / gross debt formula. This approach requires first ascertaining the value of all of the assets held by the group, the value of assets held by other corporate shareholders that have an interest in the company which holds the asset, and the value of the shares in the group held by natural (individual) persons. All of the debt held by all of the members of the group, other corporate shareholders and the relevant debt held by natural persons then needs to be identified. A ratio is then calculated which is the value of the mixed-use asset divided by the total asset value calculated earlier. This ratio is then applied to the interest expenditure of every member of the group and the relevant interest expenditure of any corporate and individual shareholders to calculate the part attributable to the mixed-use asset. The apportionment ratio is then applied to deny a deduction for a part of that interest expenditure by each group company and each shareholder. Officials consider that the requirement to collect information from every group member and every shareholder, and for each to be denied a proportion of their interest deduction, makes this an extremely compliance-heavy approach compared with the interest- stacking rule. Under the interest-stacking rule, once sufficient debt has been identified (which may well be in the asset-owning company or its immediate parent) interest deductions in other companies and shareholders are unaffected by the mixed-use asset rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 26 Issue: Interest rules set a dangerous principle for denying deductions for other interest costs not incurred in generating assessable income and should not proceed Submission (BusinessNZ) These rules set a dangerous precedent for unprincipled, wide-ranging and complex interest allocation and ring-fencing rules. The rationale is that no deduction should be allowed for interest costs which are not incurred in generating income. This reasoning could also be applied to interest incurred to generate untaxed offshore income or assets which do not produce income (such as land which is land-banked). Comment The submission is understandable, but it misinterprets the purpose of the proposals. The concern with an element of mixed-use asset expenditure is not that it is not incurred in generating income, but that it is incurred to deliver a private benefit. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Interest rules are too complex, unprincipled and a deemed income solution would be preferred Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Interest rules are complex and there is concern about the interest allocation proposal. A deemed income solution would be preferable. Comment The policy objective of the rules is to appropriately match deductions for expenditure incurred in relation to an asset with the balance of its income-earning and private use. A further important objective is to do this in a way which is relatively neutral across entities, to minimise the incentive for people to shift assets from one entity type to another to reduce their tax liability. Using a deemed income rule for companies instead of applying the apportionment rule to interest would create the following problems:  Different tax outcomes would arise between companies subject to the deemed income rules, and other entities which would presumably not be. 27  Setting the appropriate rate of return would be difficult, highly subjective and extremely controversial.  A deemed income approach would effectively set a base-line, which would mean that those who actually earned less than the prescribed level of income would be over-taxed (and those who earned more would be under-taxed). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Apportionment of interest deductions should only apply to the company which owns the asset Submission (Ernst & Young, KPMG) Only the company which holds the asset should be subject to apportionment-of-interest deductions. KPMG suggests that if debt is deliberately structured elsewhere the anti- avoidance rules can be applied. Comment The policy objective of the rules is to ensure that deductions for expenditure align with the income-earning use of the underlying asset. It is extremely easy to ensure that interest deductions arise in a different entity than the one which holds the asset by having the asset owned in a company which purchases it with cash. The cash in the company comes from the allotment of fully paid-up share capital. The funds to purchase the share capital are borrowed by the shareholder (corporate or otherwise) who subscribes for the shares. Since the money was borrowed to purchase shares in a company, a deduction is generally allowed in full for any interest incurred. This is the reason it is necessary to apply the rules on interest deductions beyond the company which owns the asset. If this was not done it is conceivable that the transfer of mixed-use assets into company structures as described above would become commonplace, defeating the policy intention of the rules. Officials consider that relying on the application of anti-avoidance rules to address such transactions would be inappropriate, inefficient, and would give rise to considerable uncertainty. Further, this would be an unusual use of these rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 28 Issue: Regulatory impact statement Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The regulatory impact statement understates the level of compliance costs arising from interest-stacking rules on companies and shareholders. Comment The regulatory impact statement acknowledges that compliance costs for asset owners would be likely to increase, particularly in the short term, as owners will be unfamiliar with the new rules. It went on to state that the additional compliance costs would be expected to reduce in the long-term as owners become more comfortable with the new rules. We acknowledge the submitter’s concern. The interest-stacking rules only become complex to apply when the structure in which the mixed-use asset is held is complex. Officials consider, having discussed this issue with external stakeholders, that a very small minority of mixed-use assets will be held in complex structures, and often they will be there for tax reasons. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: No justification for deduction quarantining rules Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, Bell Gully) The deduction quarantining rules are unnecessary and should be removed as the apportionment rules already provide equitable outcomes. Comment There were a number of alternative approaches to determining the deduction entitlement arising from days a mixed-use asset is unused. The principal options were: Approach one: allowing full deductions for expenditure relating to unused days, on the basis that the asset was available for income-earning use on all of those days (the present rule); Approach two: disallowing a deduction for the expenditure relating to unused days, on the basis that these are essentially private assets (the tightest rule); and 29 Approach three: allowing a deduction for a proportion of the expenditure relating to unused days, recognising that there is validity in both of the above approaches. The different outcomes that each approach delivers can be demonstrated with a simple example: Example A bach has annual expenses of $20,000 and is rented for 30 nights per year at $200 per night, and used by its owners for 30 nights per year. Apportionment equation Allowable deductions Profit (loss) Approach one (335/365) x $20,000 $18,356 ($12,356) Approach two (30/365) x $20,000$1,644$4,356 Approach three (30/60) x $20,000 $10,000 ($4,000) The third approach – a middle ground – is the key component of these proposals. The apportionment formula is applied regardless of the level of total use, or income-earning use, of the asset. This is in contrast to the approach suggested in the issues paper, which suggested a mixture of the three approaches discussed above, applying different approaches at different levels of income-earning use. This approach was not pursued in response to submissions that suggested that it was too arbitrary. However, as demonstrated in the above example, when income-earning use is low, this middle ground is arguably too generous. This is because an asset with low levels of total use, and low levels of income-earning use, relative to its total expenses, will often generate persistent tax losses. If approach two had been taken, the taxable income would have been $4,356 and a quarantining rule would not have been necessary. A loss of this nature might genuinely arise on a one-off or occasional basis, as a consequence of a poor rental season due to external or unforeseen factors. However, if a loss of this type is persistently generated, it suggests that the rules have allowed excessive deductions. This is because the tax outcome under the mixed-use asset rules is supposed to be a commercially realistic one, and it is not commercially realistic to have continual tax losses. Continual losses are likely to arise because tax deductions are being given for private expenditure. In the income year in which the loss arises, it is not possible to know whether the loss is a consequence of unforeseen events, or is a consequence of excessive deductions being allowed. This can, however, be known over a number of years, because a loss due to unforseen events is unlikely to be repeated, whereas a loss due to excessive deductions being allowed under the apportionment formula will be. The deduction quarantining rules therefore take a “wait and see” approach as a loss in a single year will be allowed against profits in future years, whereas long-term losses will effectively be permanently denied. 30 Officials consider this approach to be preferable to a “threshold” test which would deny deductions to those with low levels of income-earning use, because a threshold test would permanently deprive the asset owner who suffered unforeseen circumstances of the benefit of the deductions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Concepts of private use Submissions (Chapman Tripp, New Zealand Law Society, Bell Gully, Ernst & Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, BDO) The rules should use the derivation of market value consideration as the test for whether there is private use or not. (Chapman Tripp) The concepts of private use in the “gateway” tests and the apportionment test should be the same; having different tests complicates the rules and increases compliance risks. (New Zealand Law Society, Bell Gully, Ernst & Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Chapman Tripp) Where market value is received from an associate, use should not be treated as private use. (Chapman Tripp, Ernst & Young, New Zealand Law Society, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Where market value consideration is received for all use by owners or associates, the use should be considered income-earning use and the related expenditure fully deductible. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Deloitte) Where less than market value is received, it is inequitable to tax the income but treat the days as private days, thereby denying any deduction. The income should be exempt, and the New Zealand Law Society and Bell Gully suggest an alternative of taxing the income but allowing a pro-rated deduction based on the proportion of market value the income represents. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, Bell Gully, Ernst & Young, BDO) Comment The proposals set out two different concepts of private use – one which applies to determine whether an asset is subject to the rules or not (referred to as “private use”), and the other which is used in the apportionment formula to determine the extent to which certain expenditure will be deductible (referred to as “private days”). An asset will be subject to the rules if it is used by the person who holds it or an associate, or the person who holds the asset derives less than market value income from its use. 31 However, for the apportionment formula, private days do not include days when the asset is used by an associate of the person who has the asset, provided the person pays market value. The reason for this distinction was to prevent owners avoiding the application of the rules (particularly the deduction quarantining rules) merely by the owner or associates paying market value for the use of the asset. Officials accept that the difference between the various concepts introduced in the bill is potentially confusing, and recommend the adoption of a single concept of private use:  when the asset is used by a natural person who holds the asset, or an associate of that person (who is also a natural person), regardless of the amount received for the use; or  when the amount received from the asset is less than 80 percent of the market value of the asset. The suggested definition is simpler than two private-use concepts and still satisfies the policy concern around the avoidance of the rule. Further, it is suggested that when either of these two rules apply, any income received should be treated as exempt income. This aligns the treatment of income and expenditure, another issue raised by several submitters. Officials do not agree that when market value is received from the owner or associate, relevant expenditure should be fully deductible. This would allow an asset which was used substantially by its owners to be treated as fully deductible if the owners made arrangements to somehow pay themselves for the use. This would defeat the purpose of the rules. A better approach seems to be, as outlined above, for the expenditure to be non-deductible (by treating the use as a private day) but the income as non-assessable. Officials accept that it is inequitable to tax the income received from a below-market value transaction but deny any deduction by treating the days as a private day. It would be possible, but complex, to allow a pro-rated deduction, and a simpler alternative seems to be to treat both the income and the relevant deductions as outside the tax base. However, a person should not be able to elect to be outside the tax base by renting their asset for an amount slightly less than market value, as this would potentially enable them to derive untaxed profits. Officials therefore recommend a threshold of 80 percent – so that where an amount which is 80 percent of market value or greater is received, the income will be taxable and a full deduction will be allowed, and where the amount received is less than 80 percent, the income will be outside the tax base and no deduction will be allowed. Recommendation That the submissions that the private use and apportionment test be the same, and that receipt of amounts less than market value (where the amount is less than 80 per cent) be accepted, and other submissions be dealt with in the manner noted above. 32 Issue: Restriction of use of quarantined deductions Submission (New Zealand Law Society) If the deduction quarantining rules are not to be removed, they should be relaxed to allow quarantined losses to be offset against income for other mixed-use assets. Comment As explained earlier, the purpose of the deduction quarantining rule is to address situations in which the apportionment rule has effectively allowed a deduction for private expenditure. The rule therefore needs to be applied on an asset-by-asset basis, and it is not compatible with the “wait and see” concept which underlies the rule to allow losses from one asset to be offset against profits from another in the year in which they are incurred. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Deduction quarantining is a permanent denial of a deduction for business expenditure Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The submitter is concerned that when a quarantined deduction arises in one year, and in a subsequent year the asset is not a mixed-use asset and generates a profit, the quarantined deduction will not be able to be offset against any subsequent profits. Comment As noted above, the purpose of the deduction quarantining rules is to address situations in which the apportionment rule has effectively allowed a deduction for private expenditure. When that situation has arisen, the amount quarantined is not business expenditure at all, but excess private expenditure. However, when the asset has been affected by an unforeseen event, the amount is arguably business expenditure. Officials believe that almost all of the situations which fall within the deduction quarantining rules will be when deductions have previously been allowed for private expenditure, and that any permanent denial is appropriate. 33 However, a matter which the Committee’s advisor has raised with officials is the application of this rule where an asset is damaged, written off by the insurance company, and replaced with another asset. In this instance, officials agree that it would be reasonable for quarantined losses to continue to be available where the replacement asset is substantially identical. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that the Committee advisor’s point be accepted. Issue: Application of opt-out rules to companies Submission (Matter raised by officials) The opt-out provisions in the proposals have unintended consequences when applied to companies, and should be restricted to other entities. Comment The proposals allow the owner of a mixed-used asset to treat any income arising from it as exempt income but not claim any deductions for expenditure relating to the asset. The owner can choose to do this in two situations:  when the income from the asset is below a threshold of $1,000; or  when the asset produces quarantined deductions in the income year. The opt-out rules are designed to reduce compliance costs when assets have either low levels of income-earning use or no revenue is lost by taking the asset out of the tax system (because it is in loss anyway). However, they have an unintended consequence when applied to assets owned by companies, which is that the disapplication of the mixed-use asset rules would allow a corporate group to claim all of its interest deductions. This is most obviously the wrong result when the asset was opted out because income from it was less than $1,000, but is also wrong when the proposals produce quarantined losses. There would therefore be significant advantages to an asset owner of an asset which qualified under the opt-out provisions to move that asset into a company structure. This would be inefficient as well as defeating the policy intention of the rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 34 OTHER POLICY ISSUES RAISED IN SUBMISSIONS Issue: Relationship between the core provisions and mixed-use asset rules Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Chapman Tripp) The relationship between the core provisions and subpart DG needs to be clarified. There is a concern that expenditure which is apportioned by the mixed-use asset rules will already have been apportioned by the core provisions. The motor vehicle logbook provisions provide a good model. Comment The policy intention of the mixed-use asset rules is that they provide an elaboration of the concept of apportionment which appears in the core provisions. There is certainly no intention that two “layers” of apportionment apply and officials are happy to recommend clarification of the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Treatment of capital expenditure Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Deloitte) In some instances, a mixed-use asset may be used in a way which is neither private nor income-earning. An example would be when a helicopter was used to view a property which the owner was considering purchasing. This kind of capital use is already non- deductible and should be excluded from the apportionment formula. Comment There are two issues at stake here. First, deductions for the actual use of the helicopter should be denied only once – having the capital component denied by the core provisions and then again by the mixed-use asset rules is not the correct outcome. This will be remedied by addressing the relationship between the core provisions and the mixed-use asset rules, as outlined above. 35 The second issue is the impact that this kind of non-deductible use has on the apportionment formula, which addresses expenditure which is not directly attributable to use. Much of this expenditure relates to periods when the asset is unused. Officials consider it is reasonable for non-deductible capital use to be treated under the apportionment formula in the same way as non-deductible private use. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to the comments above. Issue: Application of rules to companies other than close companies Submissions (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Law Society) Section DG 2(4) provides that the proposals only apply to companies which are close companies, but it is unclear whether this restriction is intended to apply just to the company which owns the asset or to all companies to which the rules might apply (such as companies which are shareholders of companies which own the asset). The application of this rule should be clarified. (Ernst & Young) The current drafting of the rules would include within them a company which is a wholly owned subsidiary of a widely held company. This was presumably not intended. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The mixed-use asset rules should only apply to a subsidiary company when any parent companies are also close companies. However, they should also apply to appropriate companies held by trusts and trustees. The rules should be redrafted to clearly achieve these objectives. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 36 Issue: Application of rules to look-through companies Submission (Ernst & Young) The general definition of “company” excludes look-through companies (LTCs) so it is assumed that the proposed interest expenditure rules do not apply to them or where LTCs are shareholders in other companies which own mixed-use assets. The position of LTCs should be clarified expressly. Comment The policy intention of the rules is to capture assets which are held by individuals or in structures which are under the control of a small number of individuals. LTCs ought to be subject to these rules and an amendment is required. Limited partnerships and qualifying companies should also be explicitly dealt with. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of “close company” Submission (BDO) This bill would be an ideal opportunity to clarify paragraph (a) in the definition of “close company” to make it clear whether or not a “natural person” can include a natural person trustee. Comment This matter is being considered by officials as part of a separate project, but is not part of this bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 37 Issue: Guidance on what is expected to support positions taken on private use Submission (KPMG) Inland Revenue should give some guidance on what is expected to support positions taken on private use. Comment Inland Revenue will publish information on the new rules once enacted. That information will include guidance on the records required to be kept of private use. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Assets rented to associates, or for less than market value Submission (KPMG, Ernst & Young) When an asset is used purely by associates, even when they pay market value, all of the use of the asset will be private use, so the mixed-use asset rules will not apply. Ernst & Young note that this will also arise if the asset is always rented for less than market value. Comment Recommendations made elsewhere in this report propose to treat use by associates and use for which less than 80 percent of market value is paid as private use and as giving rise to exempt income. Officials agree that the application of the rules could be made clearer if the reference to earning “income” was changed to refer to “income (including exempt income)”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 38 Issue: Range of assets subject to rules Submissions (WHK, New Zealand Law Society) Assets used predominantly for business purposes or acquired predominantly for business purposes should be excluded from the rules. (WHK) The provisions include within their ambit assets which are not made available for rental use, but which are used within a business. It is unclear whether they are intended to be subject to the rules, and how the apportionment rules should apply to them. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Officials propose to refine the scope of the rules to more precisely capture the key assets where the policy concern arises. This could be done by an additional provision that the rules will only apply to:  land (including buildings on land);  boats; and  aircraft. This will mean that the rules will not apply to assets like bulldozers which are unlikely to deliver significant private benefit in their use. While assets used in a business for non-rental use are not the predominant focus of these proposals, there will be some assets held in a business when private use is material, such as a helicopter which is used by a farmer and also to take the farmer and his friends heli- skiing. It is appropriate that the mixed-use asset rules apply to this kind of asset in the same way that they would apply if the helicopter was rented out and used by the owner for heli-skiing. However, an asset which is used inside a business is more likely to be acquired for the purposes of that business, rather than for private purposes. We recommend a new exemption from the rules for assets where:  the principal use in the income year has been as part of a business, which is not a rental business; and  the private or non-business use is minor; and  when the asset is owned by a trust or company, the FBT or deemed dividend rules apply. Officials prefer a test based on use in the income year, rather than “purpose of acquisition”. A “purpose of acquisition” test is highly subjective and does not reflect that the use of an asset might change over time. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 39 Issue: Application of rules to assets which change in use during the year Submissions (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The rules will apply to assets which change in use during the year, such as a house which is occupied by the owner, empty for a period of time, and then rented to a long- term tenant. (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A rental property which is rented and used privately for the entire year should not fall within the rules just because the tenant is away on holiday or working elsewhere for 62 or more days. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Officials agree that these circumstances should not bring an asset within the rules. Two amendments are proposed to address these concerns:  a new exclusion for residential property which is rented on a long-term basis (existing concepts used for GST will be relied on); and  a rule that provides that when an asset changes use during the year, the mixed-use asset rules will only apply to the part of the year for which the asset is used on a short-term rental basis. This second rule is necessary to deal with situations such as when an owner lives in a property for the first part of the year, and then uses it as a bach for their own use and for short-term rental for the second part of the year. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Application of rules to leased assets Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) It is unclear whether the rules will apply to assets which are leased from an independent third party, or if they do, how the $50,000 threshold should apply. It is suggested that the threshold should apply to the lease payments made each year. Comment The proposals are intended to apply to leased assets. This is necessary both to reflect commercial reality and to ensure that mixed use asset owners are not able to structure around the application of the rules using lease arrangements. 40 The $50,000 threshold is part of the existing gateway test and provides that an asset which is not land is not subject to the rules unless it has a cost to the person of $50,000 or more. It would clearly not be sensible, and would provide a tax planning opportunity, if people were able to enter into long-term leases and not be subject to the rules because the $50,000 applied to the amount of the annual lease payments. Officials recommend that when an asset is leased on a long-term basis, the $50,000 threshold apply to the market value of the asset when the person first leased it. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Application of $50,000 threshold to land Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There is no need to refer separately to land in the gateway test – land will have a cost of more than $50,000 anyway so the $50,000 threshold on its own is sufficient. Comment The current gateway test provides that assets will be subject to the mixed-use asset rules if they (amongst other things) are either land or have a cost of more than $50,000. Given land is an appreciating asset it seems possible that some taxpayers will own land which has been held for a long time and has a cost of less than $50,000. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: $50,000 threshold should be raised to $250,000 Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Given the objective of the proposals is to target high-value assets, the threshold of $50,000 is too low, and should be increased to $250,000. 41 Comment The objective of the proposals is not to target high-value assets; it is to increase fairness by ensuring that the owners of assets used privately and to earn income claim a fair proportion of their expenditure as deductible. The purpose of the $50,000 threshold is to exclude from the rules assets where the expenditure claimed is likely to be less significant, and the compliance costs are arguably not justified. This is inevitably arbitrary, but it is important to note that the boats and aircraft to which this rule applies can have significant maintenance costs. Officials do not support increasing this threshold. Recommendation That this submission be declined. Issue: Risk of an asset being subdivided into a number of assets to fall below the $50,000 threshold Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There is a risk that people will seek to divide what is a single asset from a user perspective into a number of separate assets to fall below the $50,000 threshold. We recommend that the definition should be supplemented with a requirement that the item of property be a unit against which the extent of repairs and maintenance would be measured. Comment This seems a reasonable concern for assets such as power boats, where it might be argued that the motor and the hull could be treated as separate assets with one or both below the $50,000 threshold. This would defeat the policy objective of the rules. A definition which aggregates assets which are effectively used as a single asset would address this concern. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 42 Issue: Concept of cost when a deduction is allowed elsewhere in the Act Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) When a deduction is allowed elsewhere under the Act in relation to the acquisition of an asset, its cost could be reduced or even zero, which may not be appropriate in some cases. Comment Officials agree that it would be undesirable for assets to fall below the $50,000 threshold test just because an argument could be made that their cost was reduced or even zero. This should be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application of $50,000 threshold to partnerships and look-through companies Submission (Matter raised by officials) Partners in a partnership and shareholders in look-through companies (LTCs) complete tax returns based on their share of the income and deductions. It would be unsatisfactory if applying the $50,000 threshold on an individual basis could see an asset with a total cost of more than $50,000 falling outside the rules. Comment It would defeat the fairness objectives of the rules if an asset which had a cost of $50,000 or more fell outside the rules just because it was owned in a partnership or LTC structure. This should be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 43 Issue: The expression “motor vehicle” is not defined Submission (Ernst & Young) Motor vehicles are excluded from the mixed-use asset rules, but the expression “motor vehicle” is not defined for these purposes. Comment The policy intention of the legislation is that “motor vehicle” should have its ordinary meaning in this context, so no definition is required. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Single asset used for multiple purposes Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The legislation does not provide for assets that can have multiple concurrent uses, and this should be amended. For example, a strata title of a building may be divided into a number of apartments used in different ways. Comment The intention of the legislation is that taxpayers take sensible rather than unduly technical approaches to the expression “item of property” when in instances like this the logical approach would be to apply the gateway tests to each apartment. It is not clear how this approach could be detailed in legislation, but some examples of this approach could be provided by Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 44 Issue: Exclusion for assets when “area apportionment” basis is too wide Submission (New Zealand Law Society) An asset where all or part of the expenditure is apportioned on an area or other similar basis is excluded from the rules. This exclusion is too wide for an asset which has multiple uses, such as a bach which has a doctor’s surgery at the front of it, and the exclusion should be made on an expenditure basis. Comment The general policy intention is that the mixed-use asset rules do not apply when existing similar apportionment methods apply, such as the rules under which apportionment by area is carried out. When an asset has multiple uses as described, the mixed-use asset rules should still apply to the expenditure which relates to mixed use. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Concept of “active use” Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Ernst & Young) The concept of “use” for income-earning purposes should include periods when an amount is paid for the use of the asset which prevents any other use, but the asset is not actually used – for example, a bach is booked and paid for but the person does not show up. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The concept of “use” does not accord with the normal position under income tax law as use for income-earning purposes – the focus of the rules should be on periods for which no income is earned from any source. (Ernst & Young) Comment The primary purpose of the concept of “active use” is to distinguish from periods when the asset is “available for use”. Officials agree that the kind of time periods described above by NZICA should be treated as income-earning periods. 45 The issue with the approach suggested by Ernst & Young is that the issue that these proposals are seeking to address is the concept that time periods when a mixed-use asset is not being physically used to earn income, but is available and being marketed for income earning use, can be treated as use for income-earning purposes. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: The concept of “private use” is too wide Submissions (New Zealand Law Society, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The concept of “private use” captures all use by the person or any associate, whether income earning or not. This is much too wide. (New Zealand Law Society) It should be made clear that when the person using the asset is not the owner and is not associated with the owner – such as an employee – the use is not private use. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The intention of this provision is to capture all situations where the asset is used by the person who holds the asset, or an associate of that person, where that person is a natural person (individual). Officials agree that the rules should be clarified to make this intention clear. The example given by NZICA is not intended to be captured by the rules. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Market value, discounts and compliance costs Submission (Bell Gully, KPMG, Ernst & Young) The definition of “market value” should be amended to provide for customary use such as volume discounts. (Bell Gully) Inland Revenue should provide some guidance on what is required to establish market value, especially in circumstances when a discount has been provided because, for example, the property has proved hard to let. (KPMG) 46 Because of the compliance costs and risks of dispute, it is unreasonable to require taxpayers to establish that all income derived, even from unrelated parties, is at market value. For example, a taxpayer starting out in business may rent an asset at a reduced price for marketing purposes. (Ernst & Young) Comment The concept of market value used in the legislation is defined in the legislation and follows the fringe benefit tax definition. It refers to transactions made in the open market, freely offered, on ordinary terms, and to a member of the public at arm’s length. Officials consider that the examples raised by submitters would all fall within this definition. However, guidance material published when the legislation is enacted could confirm this point. Recommendation That the submissions about amending the definition of market value be declined, but the submission about Inland Revenue providing guidance be accepted. Issue: Exclusion from private use Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Ernst & Young, New Zealand Law Society) Where an asset is used as part of a business for deriving indirect income this use should not constitute private use. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Where income is derived indirectly, it is too difficult to determine whether the income from the use of the asset is a market value amount. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Ernst & Young) The requirement that the income derived directly or indirectly from the use of the asset is a market value amount should be removed as it is too difficult to apply. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The only requirement for use to be excluded from private use is that a market value amount is derived from direct or indirect use, and all other provisions should be deleted. (New Zealand Law Society) The requirement that the amount paid includes an amount for the services of the person should be removed, as it is too difficult to ascertain where the asset is used in the person’s own business. (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) 47 Comment The submissions refer to an exception to the definition of “private use”. The purpose of the exception is to exclude ordinary business and commercial use by the owner from the definition of private use. However, officials understand that as presently drafted the exclusion may not cover all business and commercial use arrangements. Two amendments are proposed in response to other submissions which ought to reduce the frequency with which this exemption needs to be relied upon. Use will not be treated as private use when either:  in the income year the asset has been principally used in a business which is not a business of renting out the asset, the private use is minor and (when owned by a company or trust) that private use has been subject to FBT or the deemed dividend rules; or  at least 80 percent of market value has been paid for the use of the asset. However, submitters had a concern that when an asset was used in a business in a way which generated income indirectly, it was impossible to know whether the requirement that the “income derived indirectly from the use of the asset is a market value amount” was satisfied. The example was given of a farmer who used his helicopter to check on his stock. In a bad year – such as a year of drought – the farmer may make a loss. The connection between the income he derives from selling sheep and the use of the helicopter are too remote. Officials agree that there may be a better way to address these kinds of situations, such as an exclusion from the concept of private use where the asset is used in a person’s own business as part of the ordinary income earning process of that business. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, subject to officials’ comments above. Issue: Associated persons test Submission (KPMG) The associated persons test should not be varied from 25 percent to 5 percent. This creates additional complexity and compliance issues because people who are not normally treated as associated will be for the purpose of these rules. 48 Comment The original intention of this amendment was to refine the targeting of the rules to companies controlled by 10 or fewer shareholders. However, the amendment is ineffective to do that, and officials recommend that it be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application of rules where reimbursement payments are received Submission (BDO) It is unclear how the rules apply when a person uses an asset owned by another person and reimburses the owner for their expenditure. Comment Under the recommendations in this report, a payment which is less than 80 percent of the market value of the use of the asset would be treated as private use, and the income would be exempt. An amount which is 80 percent or more of market value would be an income-earning day and the income would be taxable. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Treatment of time spent maintaining the asset Submissions (PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Bachcare, TradeMe) Time spent by the owner preparing or maintaining the asset for income-earning purposes should not be private use. KPMG suggests an integrity measure could be to limit this to days when the property is not suitable for ordinary use. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG) 49 Owners should be allowed to stay in the property to carry out maintenance at the beginning and end of each holiday season – two days for every six-month period when the bach is rented out for 30 days in each six-month period is suggested. (Bachcare) Owners should be able to stay in the property to carry out maintenance. This should not be treated as private use – staying in the property will be a practical necessity if they live some distance away. (TradeMe) Comment Careful consideration when developing these proposals was given to the concept of excluding “maintenance days” when the owner works on the asset. The following factors count against allowing maintenance days to be excluded from the private use calculation:  The inherent difficulties with defining a “maintenance day”. For example, would the person be required to spend some, all, or a substantial part of the day working on the asset? How would this be enforced?  Allowing maintenance days to be excluded from private use would provide an opportunity for some asset owners to combine their private use with maintenance to achieve greater levels of deduction. For example, there would be a risk that bach owners could claim what is essentially a private day as a maintenance day because they mowed the lawns every two weeks or so.  The likelihood that many owners do combine private use and maintenance. The submissions about people needing to travel some distance to carry out maintenance are useful. Different people will value their time in different ways, but it seems likely that if people really did need to travel a considerable distance to reach their bach, and received no private benefit from being there, then they would pay for someone else to carry out the maintenance rather than incur the travel time and costs. For these reasons, officials do not consider that a blanket exemption for “maintenance days” should be allowed. However, there may be circumstances when the owner of an asset – typically a bach – needs to repair damage caused by a renter. Officials recommend elsewhere in this report that a deduction is allowed for these costs without apportionment. When the owner of the bach needs to stay in the bach to carry out this kind of repair, it would be reasonable not to treat that as private use. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, subject to officials’ comments above. 50 Issue: Treatment of periods when the owner is relocating the asset to enable income-earning use Submission (KPMG) When the owner spends time moving the asset (such as a boat or a helicopter) to enable income-earning use, this should not count as private use. Comment This raises many of the same questions as the owner staying at a bach for maintenance purposes. The private benefit derived from an asset like a boat or an aircraft is typically the enjoyment of using – sailing or flying – it. It is not clear to officials that this enjoyment is eliminated simply because that use is to be followed or preceded by a rental use. However, there may be instances when the costs of the relocation of the asset are explicitly or implicitly incorporated in the amount charged for the asset. Where additional income is derived in this way, it is reasonable that the period the owner spends relocating the asset not be treated as private use. Recommendation That the submission be accepted subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Treatment of periods when the property is unavailable due to external contractors’ work Submission (Bachcare) Periods when the property is unavailable due to it being repaired by external contractors should not be included in any private use. Comment Periods when the property is unavailable due to it being repaired by external contractors is not included in any private use under either the proposals as introduced or as recommended to be amended in this report. Officials have discussed this with the submitter, and the submitter has accepted this point. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 51 Issue: Treatment of periods when the asset is unavailable due to income- earning process Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Income earning days should include days when the asset is unavailable for private use, even if it is not actively used to earn income on those days. An example would be a plane which is rented to fly to Sydney, and then rented to fly back one week later. It is not economic to return the plane to New Zealand between rentals, so it remains in Sydney where it is unavailable for private use. Comment The situation described above seems reasonable, although the plane being in Sydney does not render it unavailable for private use if the owners or associates happened to be in Sydney at that time. However, introducing such an exemption into the proposals would risk the policy intention of ensuring that a fair proportion of expenditure is deductible. An exemption would give the wrong result in the following example:  A boat owner lives in Wellington.  He places his boat with a Marlborough Sounds yacht charter business.  A number of bookings are made throughout the summer.  The yacht is moored in the Marlborough Sounds for the entire summer because that is where each charter begins and ends. An exemption would allow the owner to claim that the entire summer was an income- earning period. It is not clear how a fair distinction could be drawn between this kind of situation and the charter plane described above, and in either case the asset is available for private use in the “between hire” periods anyway. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 52 Issue: Definition of “interest expenditure” is too broad Submission (KPMG, Ernst & Young) The proposals include in the definition of “interest” amounts paid on fixed-rate foreign equity or fixed-rate shares, and stapled debt securities. These are currently not deductible for companies, but the effect of this proposal is to allow a deduction for a proportion of them. This component should be removed from the proposals. Comment There are two implications in the submission:  amounts paid on fixed-rate foreign equity or fixed-rate shares and stapled debt securities do not need to be brought into the apportionment rules, because they are not deductible;  a further consequence of the rules is that a part of these amounts are made deductible. Neither of these outcomes are sensible and officials agree with the submissions that these provisions ought to be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Financial arrangement deductions are not matched by financial arrangement income Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Bell Gully) Expenditure under a financial arrangement is subject to apportionment under the rules, but income amounts will be taxable in full. The rules should be clarified and where expenditure is apportioned, income should also be apportioned. (New Zealand Law Society, Bell Gully) It is not clear that a loss in respect of a foreign currency arrangement would satisfy the requirement for being deductible in full. This creates a mismatch, as the income will be taxable in full. (Bell Gully) 53 Comment Financial arrangement income is taxable even if the financial arrangement is held entirely for private purposes. There is no inconsistency with allowing a deduction for only a part of the expenditure but taxing all income amounts. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Interest expenditure incurred by individuals who are trustees Submission (Ernst & Young) Interest deductions for individuals are only subject to apportionment when the interest is incurred in relation to the asset. It is unclear whether this rule also applies when the individual is acting as a trustee. Comment The policy intention is that interest expenditure incurred by individuals is only subject to apportionment when the underlying debt was incurred to acquire the mixed-use asset (or shares in a company or group of companies which holds a mixed-use asset). This is the “tracing rule”. This approach is even more relevant when the individual is a trustee, as it would be inappropriate for that person to have apportionment apply to debts incurred in their personal capacity. Officials consider that the legislation – which simply requires that “the person is not a company” – is sufficiently clear to ensure that the tracing rule applies to individuals who are trustees, as they are clearly not companies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 54 Issue: Interest deductions incurred by partners in partnerships Submission (Matter raised by officials) Additional rules are needed to ensure that the apportionment rules apply to partners in both ordinary partnerships and limited partnerships. Comment The proposals contain “look-through” rules to ensure that shareholders in companies will be subject to limitations on their deductions if the company which owns the asset does not have sufficient debt. Similar rules are required for partners in ordinary and limited partnerships, to ensure that, when partners borrow to acquire their interest in an ordinary or limited partnership, interest deductions on those borrowings are potentially subject to apportionment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application of mixed-use asset rules to qualifying companies and look-through companies Submissions (Ernst & Young, Matter raised by officials) The general definition of “company” excludes look-through companies (LTCs) so it is assumed that the proposed interest expenditure rules do not apply to them or where LTCs are shareholders in other companies which own mixed-use assets. The position of LTCs should be clarified expressly. (Ernst & Young) The proposals need to be amended to deal with interest incurred by qualifying companies, look-through companies and their shareholders, which have different treatment under current law than ordinary companies. (Matter raised by officials) Comment The proposals deal with interest in companies in the following way:  Apportionment is first applied to interest incurred (on debt up to the value of the asset) by the company which owns the asset.  It is then applied to group companies and other corporate shareholders (if necessary), applying the stacking rule.  It is then applied to any non-corporate shareholders (if necessary) applying the tracing rule. 55 A number of problems arise applying this standard framework to qualifying companies:  Qualifying companies are not subject to the rule under which all interest they incur is deductible, which makes it unreasonable to apply the stacking rule to them. Interest apportionment inside qualifying companies should therefore be on a tracing basis.  For the rules to operate fairly, it still remains necessary to consider interest incurred by shareholders to acquire his or her shares in the qualifying company, and potentially apply apportionment to it. In the case of LTCs, the stacking rules will not apply because they are excluded from the legislative definition of “companies”, and so the tracing rules will automatically apply. However, as with LTCs, it remains necessary for the rules to operate fairly, and to consider interest incurred by shareholders to acquire their interest in the company, and potentially apply apportionment to it. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Expenditure which relates to both mixed-use assets and other assets Submission (Bell Gully) The rules should provide guidance on how to deal with expenditure which relates to both mixed-use assets and assets which are not subject to the mixed-use asset rules. Comment The objective of the proposals is to ensure that an appropriate proportion of expenditure on mixed-use assets is subject to the rules. Expenditure which does not relate to mixed- use assets should be entirely outside the rules. There will be some instances when a single item of expenditure relates to both mixed use and other assets – for example, rates on an aircraft hangar that is used to house two aircraft, one of which is a mixed-use asset and the other which is solely used privately. Officials consider that the current form of the legislation is sufficient for taxpayers to be able to make the kind of sensible apportionment that this example would require. For example, the expenditure which is subject to the apportionment formula is “... the total expenditure or loss that is incurred by the person for an income year in relation to the asset”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 56 Issue: Rule for expenditure related to income-earning use Submission (Ernst & Young) It is unclear whether expenditure such as rates, insurance and utilities can satisfy the requirement for expenditure to be solely attributable to the income-earning process. Comment The proposals divide expenditure into three categories – expenditure which relates solely to income earning (full deductions can be claimed), solely to private use (no deductions can be claimed), and the remainder (deductions are apportioned). The “solely incurred” test is necessary to ensure that taxpayers can only claim full deductions for expenditure which delivers no private benefit. Periodic charges like rates and insurance are more likely to be suited to the third category (apportionment) as they relate to both income earning and private use, and it could be difficult to divide the expenditure into the three separate categories. However, these kinds of periodic charges could be divided into the three categories described above and this would produce the same outcome. Other expenditure such as for utilities, which may vary between periods of use and non- use, and between different users, may give a slightly different outcome if entirely apportioned or separated into the three categories. However, because of the compliance cost of splitting the expenditure between each category, apportioning the entire item of expenditure is an acceptable outcome. Given this approach, officials are therefore unconcerned that some items of expenditure might not satisfy the “solely” test, which is otherwise necessary to ensure the rules are robust. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Companies and the rule for expenditure on income-earning use Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The requirement that “the person not reasonably expect to receive a personal benefit” makes no sense when the person who holds the asset is a company. 57 Comment The submitter is correct and the legislation should be amended to include situations where no benefit is received by a natural person who is associated with the person who incurs the expenditure. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Requirement that all repair and maintenance expenditure be apportioned Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, KPMG) The requirement that all repairs and maintenance expenditure be apportioned is an unfair outcome when the expenditure was incurred to remedy damage caused by a renter. NZICA notes that it is also the wrong outcome when the expenditure is incurred to remedy damage caused during private use. Comment Officials agree that when the expenditure is incurred to remedy a specific instance of damage caused by a renter – such as a hole in a wall –the cost of the repair should be entirely deductible. However, officials are not convinced that maintenance expenditure falls within the same category. Maintenance is the remedying of gradual deterioration or wear and tear, rather than something attributable to a specific instance. It will therefore result from either the passage of time or use over time – in which case apportionment seems to be the right approach. Officials recommend that asset owners be allowed a deduction for repairs which are carried out solely to repair damage caused by a renter, and similarly, that repairs which are carried out solely to repair damage caused by a private user be non-deductible. Officials recommend no change to the proposal that maintenance expenditure be required to be apportioned. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, subject to officials’ comments above. 58 Issue: Reference to “rating” in the interest and deduction quarantining provisions Submission (Ernst & Young) The reference to the “amount given by rating” in the provision dealing with the asset value for interest deduction purposes should be amended to make it clear that it is the rateable value of the relevant land plus improvements. This same issue also arises in the deduction quarantining provisions. Comments The interest deduction provisions which apply to companies which hold a land-based mixed-use asset require companies to compare the value of that asset to the company’s debt. The rateable value of that asset is used as a proxy for market value. Similar language is used in the deduction quarantining provisions – deduction quarantining only applies to land-based assets when the gross income derived from the asset is less than 2 percent of the amount given by its most recent rating. The legislative references could usefully be clarified, perhaps by reference to the concepts of annual value, capital value and land value in section 13(3) of the Local Government (Rating) Act 2002. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Value of land in the interest provisions should be cost Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society) The cost of land, rather than its rateable value, should be used as the value against which debt is assessed. Comment The interest provisions assess the current debt position of the company. It therefore makes sense that this is assessed against the current asset value of the company. Officials therefore do not agree that the cost of land should be used in this provision. 59 However, it is inconsistent with this approach to use cost as the basis for assets which decline in value, as the legislation does now. Officials therefore recommend that the provision which deals with non-land assets be amended to use the tax book value for depreciation purposes as a reasonable proxy for the current value of these assets. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Use of word “complex” in heading of interest provisions Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The word “complex” should not be used in the heading of the interest provisions because it suggests something inappropriate about such matters. The word should be replaced with “corporate”. Comment The purpose of the heading was to distinguish between the provisions which come before it, which deal with the deductions for individual asset owners, and the provisions which come after it, which provide additional rules when assets are held in companies. The implication which the submitter draws was not intended, and officials do not think it is a necessary inference of the language used. However, officials are indifferent between the words “complex” and “corporate” and are happy to recommend the submission be accepted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Use of expression “voting interest” in relation to companies Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Ernst & Young) The mixed-use asset proposals use the expression “voting interests” to refer to the shareholding a company has in another company. However, general legislation provides that the voting interest that a company would otherwise have in another company is to be attributed to its shareholders. This provision needs to be disabled, as it is elsewhere in the Act. 60 Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Requirement for companies to provide statements to shareholders Submission (Chapman Tripp) The requirement for companies to provide statements to their shareholders to enable shareholders to take interest apportionment calculations seems problematic given the possibility of different balance dates and return filing obligations. More work should be undertaken to identify a sensible and workable basis for interest apportionment, and in the meantime the proposals should not proceed. Comment While some entities and individuals may have different balance dates, those balance dates all relate to the same income year, and return filing dates do not differ for the income year regardless of when the balance date is in that income year. Accordingly, officials do not agree that significant issues will arise where companies and shareholders have different balance dates. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Need for information to be provided by group companies and shareholders Submission (Ernst & Young) The Tax Administration Act provision which requires the person who holds the asset to provide information to shareholders needs to be amended to require other group companies and shareholders to provide information to the person who holds the asset. This will enable sequential application of the interest expenditure and deduction quarantining rules. 61 The provisions assume that the same person will be preparing returns for all parties and able to use all information. This may not accord with professional responsibilities. Comment The rules for both interest expenditure and deduction quarantining have been carefully designed to minimise the requirements for two-way information flows. In the case of interest expenditure, companies within the group will need to provide information to whoever is making the interest apportionment calculations. However, it does not seem necessary to legislate for that within a group of companies. This is especially the case given the recommendation elsewhere in this report to exclude certain group companies with minority shareholders from interest apportionment. No two-way supply of information is necessary for the apportionment of interest by shareholders. The group of companies simply needs to advise the shareholders of their proportion of the net asset balance and the apportionment ratio. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Taxpayer has more than one mixed-use asset Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, KPMG, Ernst & Young) The interest apportionment proposals do not work if a company has more than one mixed-use asset. They can result in the reversal of all interest expenditure, and even the creation of additional income. Comment Officials agree with the submission, and that an amendment is required. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Applying interest apportionment rules to group companies that are not wholly owned Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Chapman Tripp) An ordering rule is required to determine which group company is the first to have its interest apportioned. Issues will arise when group companies are not wholly owned. 62 Comment The proposals currently:  deem all group companies to be 100 percent commonly owned; and  allow the members of the group to determine amongst themselves in which order to apply the interest apportionment rule. This second rule in particular is designed to lower compliance costs. Rather than groups needing to apply the interest apportionment calculation in a prescribed order, they may be able to identify a single company which has sufficient debt and apply interest apportionment only to that company. Officials accept that concerns may arise when non-wholly owned companies are included within the group. The minority shareholders of those companies may be reluctant to have the interest deductions of “their” company apportioned. Accordingly, officials propose the following amendment. When a company is not a wholly owned member of the same group as the mixed-use asset company, it can be excluded from the interest apportionment rules entirely if:  no minority shareholder of the company, or person associated with them, has had private use of the asset; and  there has been no loss offset with, or no loss subvention payments from, the company. While these amendments do not create an ordering rule, officials consider that they deal with the bulk of the concerns around non-wholly owned group companies at source, while preserving the compliance cost benefits of groups to determine which companies should have interest allocated to them first. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but an amendment be made to clarify the legislation. Issue: Technical application of interest apportionment formula to group companies Submission (Ernst & Young) It is not clear that when a group company applies the interest apportionment formula, it should use the numbers generated by the mixed-use asset company’s application of the formula. 63 Comment Officials consider that the drafting is reasonably clear here, but it would be straightforward to add further clarification to avoid any possible confusion. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Interaction with depreciation rules Submission (Ernst & Young) The provision dealing with depreciation recovery on sale should be clarified to ensure that the reference to “deductions allowed” in the depreciation rules is to the net depreciation loss deductions actually allowed after taking account of any part-use or subpart DG apportionments. Comment The policy intention behind the relevant depreciation rule is that only a proportion of the depreciation recovered will be taxable, reflecting that only a proportion of the depreciation allowed was deductible. The relevant provision in the depreciation legislation refers to: all amounts of depreciation loss for which the person has been allowed a deduction for the item in each of the income years in which the person has owned the item. In officials’ view, this clearly means the amounts which are deductible after any apportionment – the amount prior to apportionment is not an amount “for which the person has been allowed a deduction”. Officials do not consider that any amendment is required. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 64 Issue: Cost should be used as the benchmark for the 2% deduction quarantining test Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, KPMG, Ernst & Young) Cost, rather than rateable value, should be the benchmark against which the 2% threshold for the application of deduction quarantining is assessed. It is unclear why the 2% threshold was selected, and it is too high. Comment The deduction quarantining rules prevent a person who owns a mixed-use asset from offsetting a loss from the mixed-use asset against other income. As set out earlier in this report, it is a “wait and see” rule designed to deal with the issue that the apportionment formula does not prevent an asset which has a low level of use and a high level of expenditure from producing perennial losses. Such losses cannot be genuine business losses, and arise because in these circumstances the apportionment formula essentially allows deductions for private expenditure. To reduce the number of instances where the deduction quarantining applies to genuine losses, the rules will only apply where the gross income derived from the asset is 2% or less of its value. With the Official Cash Rate at 2.5% and bank deposits returning around 4%, 2% was seen as a fairly low level that someone with a reasonable focus on earning income ought to be able to achieve. The ability of an asset to earn income is related to its current value, not its historic cost. To put it another way, two identical properties would have the same ability to earn income even if one was bought in 1960 and the other in 2007. However, this logic also means that the value for non-land assets should be their current tax book value, as a reasonable approximation of their market value, and officials recommend an amendment be made. This creates the same valuation rules as are used in the interest apportionment rules. Recommendation That the submissions of the external submitters be declined. That the officials’ recommendation be accepted. 65 Issue: 2% threshold is not realistic for many properties Submission (Bachcare) The 2% threshold is not realistic for many properties; those outside areas of key demand or basic baches on high-value land. A 1.75% would be a better level. Comment The 2% threshold has been set to reduce the likelihood of the deduction quarantining rules applying to asset owners who have a genuine short-term business loss, who under our tax system ought to be able to offset their loss in the year in which it arises, regardless of the level of income which generates it. Arguments can be made that the threshold should be set higher, or that quarantining should apply regardless of the income earned, because a loss on a mixed-use asset which is a perennial loss should always be denied, regardless of the level of income which generates it. The 2% threshold seeks to balance these two competing objectives, and on balance officials’ preference is that it remains where it is. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Potential disparity between rateable value and market value Submission (TradeMe) Rateable value may not always be the same as market value, so owners should be able to get a valuation from a registered valuer to use as an alternative. Comment As noted above, the 2% threshold has been chosen to strike a balance between those who make genuine short-term business losses and those who the apportionment formula allows to make perennial losses, but arguments can be made for a higher or no threshold at all. As the submitter implies, the rateable value of the property is used as a proxy for market value, and was chosen because it is already available to all property owners and can be obtained without incurring compliance costs. 66 Officials are reluctant to allow registered valuations to be used as an alternative to the valuation given for rating purposes because allowing these kinds of choices allows taxpayers to “game” the rules. Taxpayers will choose the rateable value if it is less than the market value, and have a registered valuer give a valuation if it is more. The only way this can be avoided (and even then only partially) is to require an asset which has been valued by a registered valuer to continue to be valued in this way each year. This would impose an undesirable level of compliance costs. Officials consider that using the rateable value at all times provides the best balance of even-handedness and compliance costs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Deduction quarantining rules exclude income from associated persons Submission (Ernst & Young) The exclusion of income from associated persons from the 2% gross income threshold below which deduction quarantining applies is confusing. Comment The proposals as introduced excluded income from associated persons from the test to determine whether the deduction quarantining rules should apply. This was to prevent asset owners from avoiding the application of the deduction quarantining rules by creating income from associated persons to exceed the 2% threshold. Officials recommend elsewhere in this report that income from associated persons be treated as excluded income and not subject to tax. An amendment will be required to make it clear that excluded income is not included in the 2% deduction quarantining threshold. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 67 Issue: Application of quarantined deductions to profits in future years Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposals should be amended to make it clear that quarantined deductions from one asset can only be offset against future profits from that same asset. Comment As noted earlier in this report, the policy intention is that quarantined deductions which arise from an asset can only be offset against future profits from that same asset. There is a slight ambiguity in the current drafting which can be read as allowing quarantined deductions from one asset to be offset against future profits from another asset. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarity of, and inconsistencies within, deduction quarantining rules Submission (Ernst & Young)  There seems to be an inherent inconsistency between the company which owns the asset having excess expenditure subject to quarantining and having an outstanding profit balance.  It is not clear what amounts need to be taken into account by group companies, and whether they involve amounts based on the group company’s own income and expenditure or those of the company which owns the asset.  If it is intended that the group company’s calculations should be based on the asset-owning company’s income and expenditure, there may be information and compliance issues. Comment When a mixed-use asset is held in a group of companies, the deduction quarantining rules require a group-wide approach to expenditure. This is because, to determine whether a loss has actually arisen to be quarantined, it is necessary to look at expenditure incurred not only by the company which owns the asset but also relevant expenditure incurred by other group companies. The legislation makes it clear that relevant expenditure is only interest which has already been identified under the apportionment rules. 68 This means that while the company which owns the asset may appear to be in profit – thereby having an outstanding profit balance – the mixed-use asset activity overall is in loss, once interest expenditure incurred by other group companies has also been deducted. An example of the operation of these provisions is included at the end of sections DG 18 and DG 19. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application of quarantining rules to group companies Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The same issues arise with the application of the quarantining rules to group companies as apply in the interest rules, which is that the rules do not set out the order of companies that the rules should be applied to. Comment As with the interest rules, groups of companies may choose which companies, and in which order, to apply the deduction quarantining rules to. This choice has been deliberately left to taxpayers so they can organise this in a way which gives rise to the least compliance costs, or meets whatever other objectives they might have. The main issue arises with group companies which are not wholly owned. The modification to the interest rules under which certain companies which are not wholly owned will be excluded from the rules and will flow through to the deduction quarantining rules. This will lessen, although not entirely eliminate, the concern the submitters have. Officials consider it preferable to continue to allow groups of companies to make their own decisions about these matters. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 69 Issue: No quarantining where income cannot be separately attributed Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The submitter supports the proposal that deduction quarantining should not apply where a person owns a mixed-use asset to which income cannot be separately attributed. Comment Most of the assets to which the mixed-use asset proposals apply will be assets which are rented out. It is then straightforward to apply the test of whether the gross income from the asset is 2% or more of its value. However, the rules can also apply when the asset is used in the person’s own business. In these instances, it will be difficult to apply the gross income test, because no income will be directly attributable to the use of the asset. Assets of this type are excluded, unless there is also a substantial proportion of rental use so that the 2% gross income test could be meaningfully applied. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Level at which opt-out threshold is set Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers) The threshold of $1,000 of gross income for opting out is too low and should be:  2% of the asset value. (KPMG)  The higher of $5,000 or 2% of the asset value. (PricewaterhouseCoopers)  $10,000. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants)  Net income without applying the mixed-use asset rules. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The proposals include two options under which a person who has a mixed-use asset can “opt out” of the tax system. The consequence of opting out is that the income from the asset is not taxable, and no deductions can be claimed. There are two grounds on which a person can opt out: 70  when the gross income from the asset for the income year is less than $1,000; and  when the result of the application of the mixed-use asset rules is that quarantined deductions arise. Elsewhere in this report are recommendations that income from associated persons, and income which is less than 80 percent of the market value of the use of the asset be treated as exempt income. These recommendations will exclude further mixed-use asset owners from the rules, and make it easier for others to qualify for the opt-out thresholds above (because only market value income from non-associates will be counted). The submissions focus on the first exemption set out above. The policy objective of this exemption is to reduce taxpayer compliance costs. If only a small amount of revenue will be produced from taxing the income from the asset, it is not worth taxpayers incurring compliance costs or Inland Revenue incurring administrative costs. The appropriate measure for this exemption is a dollar amount, because compliance costs do not vary directly in proportion with asset value. Other things being equal, the compliance costs of a $400,000 bach will be the same as those for an $800,000 bach. Officials therefore do not agree with submissions that a threshold based on asset value should be used. Nor do officials agree with a substantial increase in the dollar amount of the threshold, because to do so would be a disproportionate response to the compliance costs involved. NZICA suggests as an alternative a threshold based on the net income arising from an asset, without application of the mixed-use asset rules. Officials note that a similar provision does exist, which allows a taxpayer to opt out if a quarantined deduction arises – essentially if net income after applying the mixed-use asset rules is nil or less, and gross income is less than 2 percent of the asset’s value. However, officials consider that the threshold could be increased to further reduce compliance costs without raising any material issues of unfairness. This is especially the case as asset owners with low levels of income would be likely to be in loss after the application of the apportionment rules. Officials recommend that the gross income threshold be increased to $4,000. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, subject to officials’ comments above. 71 TECHNICAL ISSUES The following matters deal with technical issues. Issue: The word “active” is not required in the definition of “private days” Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The word “active” is not required in the definition of “private days” because section DG 3(3) already defines “use” as “active use” for the purposes of subpart DG. Comment Officials agree with this submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Apportionment of costs of borrowing Submission (Matter raised by officials) The mixed-use asset rules override the provision under which borrowing costs are deductible, but incorrectly refers to them as interest costs. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Assets acquired and disposed of in the same year Submission (Raised informally with officials) The proposals include rules which pro-rate thresholds where the asset is acquired or disposed of during the year. These rules need to be amended to deal with situations when the asset is acquired and disposed of in the same year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 72 Issue: Early reference to “outstanding profit balance” unnecessary in the deduction quarantining rules Submission (Ernst & Young) Given the expression “outstanding profit balance” is used in section DG 18, why is it necessary to refer to it in section DG 16? Comment “Outstanding profit balance” is a term used to refer to an excess of income over expenditure under the deduction quarantining rules. It is calculated under section DG 16 and subsequently referred to in section DG 18. Officials consider this to be a logical form of drafting these provisions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Use of outstanding profit balance Submission (Ernst & Young) The reference in section DG 16 to the outstanding profit balance being used under section DG 18 should be a reference to it being used under section DG 19. Comment “Outstanding profit balance” is used in a formula in section DG 18, so officials prefer the cross-reference to remain as currently drafted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 73 Issue: “Company A” and “Company B” concepts undefined Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Section DG 18 uses the concepts of “Company A” and “Company B”, but they are not defined for the purposes of this section. Comment Company A and Company B are introduced in the interest apportionment rules to refer to the company which owns the mixed-use asset and other companies which are in the same group as the company which owns the mixed-use asset respectively. Officials agree that they are not defined for the purpose of their subsequent use, but they should be. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Cross-reference in deduction quarantining provisions Submission (Ernst & Young) Section DG 19(1) should include a cross-reference to section DG 16. Comment Section DG 16 deals with the deduction quarantining of the person who has the mixed- use asset. Section DG 17 provides rules for using that quarantined deduction in a subsequent year. Section DG 19 deals with the subsequent use of quarantined deductions of group companies and shareholders. These quarantined deductions arise under section DG 18, not section DG 16. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 74 ASSET EXPENDITURE – GOODS AND SERVICES TAX Clauses 84–87 Issue: The changes should not go ahead Submission (Ernst & Young) The GST changes should not go ahead. Instead, the general apportionment rules should apply. If they do go ahead, they should be deferred to allow people the chance to exclude the assets from the GST base, as proposed by an officials’ issues paper released in December 2012. Comments Officials note that there are differing views on how the existing rules should apply to mixed-use assets. One view is that input tax in respect of non-use time should be claimable on the basis that the asset is, at such times, available for use. Another view is that no claims should be able to be made in respect of this non-use time because the apportionment rules (section 21G(1)(a)) refer to the extent to which the goods and services “are actually used for making taxable supplies”. Bringing some clarity to this area by providing a specific formula is considered desirable. With respect to the submission that some registered persons should be able to exclude their assets from the tax base (as outlined in the December 2012 issues paper), this is a narrow proposal that would only affect people that hold assets in the same vehicle that also carries out some other taxable activity. This proposal was put forward as a concession to people that may inadvertently be caught in the GST net, not those that voluntarily registered in respect of entities that hold mixed-use assets. Officials consider it would be unnecessary to delay these changes, which potentially have a broad application, to cater for a remedial amendment designed to relieve a GST burden on a small group. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 75 Issue: Transitional provisions and effective date of the new rules Submissions (New Zealand Law Society, Bell Gully, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers) There should be a transitional rule to clarify the interaction between the existing apportionment rules and the proposed rules. (New Zealand Law Society) There should be a new transitional rule for assets acquired between 1 April 2011 and 1 April 2013. (Bell Gully) Guidance should be provided as to what happens to assets already subject to apportionment. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed GST rules should apply from 1 April 2014. (Bell Gully) Changes should only apply to assets acquired after 1 April 2013. (PricewaterhosueCoopers) Comment Submitters are concerned that the overlay of the proposed apportionment rules for mixed-use assets will cause confusion and additional compliance costs for registered persons with assets currently in the tax base. Of particular concern is that the proposed GST rules could result in output tax liabilities for some people who would be forced to adjust input tax claimed under the current rules. Officials accept that overlap is undesirable. This is why transitional provisions were introduced when the new apportionment rules were introduced in 2011. However, rather than having another transitional provision for mixed-use assets, officials consider it would be simpler to have the proposed rules for mixed-use assets only apply to relevant goods and services acquired after the date of Royal assent of this bill. This means if a person purchased a bach in 2012 and has apportioned their input tax claims under the existing rules, the mixed-use asset rules would not apply to that bach, but would apply to goods and services (such as rates, insurance and furnishings) acquired after the bill is enacted. This will provide certainty to effected taxpayers, while still ensuring the new rules will apply appropriately. Recommendation That the submission regarding the changes only applying to assets acquired after the bill is enacted be accepted. This will address the concerns of other submitters. 76 Issue: When the rules apply Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The GST apportionment rules should not apply when a person takes advantage of the exemption option for income tax purposes. Comments The exemption for income tax purposes is only available in a limited set of circumstances, and is generally related to assets that earn under a certain level of income. Although one of these criteria is linked to the value of the asset, it is anticipated that most people that qualify for the income tax exemption will do so because they derive significantly less than $60,000 a year in income from the asset. If GST has to be charged on a supply when the turnover from the asset is less than $60,000 per annum, the person is either voluntarily registered, has deliberately included the asset in the same structure as a larger taxable activity, or is self-employed and owns the asset in their personal name. In any case, their involvement with the GST system, or their inclusion of the asset in the tax base will, in many cases, have been based on a conscious decision. Officials consider that, as the mixed-use asset rules are now recommended to apply only to assets acquired after the date of Royal assent of this bill, most will make this decision on the understanding that these rules will apply to them. Further, GST returns are filed more regularly that income tax returns. It would be unusual to create rules that required people to return amounts of output tax for a mid- year return but then exempt the same supply once the end-of-year calculations had been performed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Private use days and output tax Submissions (Bell Gully, New Zealand Law Society) An asset owner should be:  relieved from accounting for output tax on below market rental days; or  allowed a scaled-back input claim for such days based on discount to market rates. (Bell Gully) The definition of private use should exclude use where market value is paid, or the output tax liability of the owner should be reduced to the extent of the consideration provided for the use. (New Zealand Law Society) 77 Comment Officials agree that it is not optimal to have output tax charged on a supply while simultaneously denying input tax for that supply. The proposal that input tax should be able to be apportioned on the basis of the proportion that the rent actually charged relates to the market rent would be problematic. Given submissions that the assets rules more generally are too complicated, to require a registered person to work out percentages of claims for individual days could add significant compliance costs for very little difference in the overall figures produced. On balance, officials consider that, for the purposes of the GST mixed-use asset rules, any day (or other period) where the asset in question is supplied for consideration should be treated as a business day. In practice, this would mean:  A period when the asset is leased to an associated person should be subject to the rules that treat supplies between associated persons as taking place at market value. This would mean the owner would have to return output tax on a market value rate even if some lesser consideration (or no consideration) was paid.  On a day the asset is leased to a non-associate for less than market value (but more than zero), the owner should return output tax on that lesser value. Although this allows supplies to be made to people for lower rates while still claiming input deductions, this is an existing feature of the GST system that registered persons and Inland Revenue will be familiar with. Officials accept that this will cause the formula for GST purposes to diverge from that used for income tax in some cases. Although this is not necessarily desirable, it is anticipated that this will not be a problem for most taxpayers. The alternative would be to introduce exemptions into the GST system or otherwise change relatively fundamental aspects of the GST system – such as the ability of the supplier to set their own consideration for supplies to non-associates. Officials therefore consider having differences in the formula for the two tax types simply reflects the nature of the two taxes and the reality that what is a desirable outcome for one tax type (in this case exempt income being derived) will not always be suitable for another. Recommendation That the submissions be declined, but the proposed rules be amended in line with officials’ comments. 78 Issue: Guidance on specific terms Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers) Inland Revenue should provide guidance on the following matters:  What a “fair and reasonable result” is for an alternative time measurement under proposed section 20G(3). In particular, is no adjustment for GST when an income tax adjustment is made “fair and reasonable”? (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants)  Whether the exclusion for motor vehicles and apportioned assets applies for GST.  Whether section 20G applies to all GST-registered companies or just close companies.  Does “input tax” cover secondhand goods or GST under section 20(3J). (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment Officials confirm that the policy intentions behind the issues raised are, respectively:  Matters such as “fair and reasonable” do not lend themselves to prescriptive and exhaustive definition and are generally determined on a case-by-case basis. However, given there are minimum thresholds built into the GST rules and the changes to the GST formula recommended above, perfect tracking with the income tax rules is not anticipated in every instance.  GST has a set of “standard” apportionment rules that apply to assets that are not described in proposed section BG 3. It is expected that those apportionment rules will apply to most assets, with only assets described in section DG 3 having to be apportioned using proposed section 20G.  Officials agree that the wording in proposed section 20G is not very clear on this point. Given the intention is to align the GST rules as closely as possible to the income tax rules, to reduce compliance costs, it is arguable that widely held companies should be excluded from the ambit of section 20G.  The definition of “input tax” in section 3A of the GST Act should apply to proposed section 20G. This would include secondhand goods input credits. Officials agree that the relationship between the proposed section 20G and section 20(3J) should be clarified so that output tax calculated under that section is referable to the inputs that would be able to be claimed under section 20G. Recommendation That the submissions be noted, but also that the bill be clarified to confirm that:  the GST apportionment rules do not apply to widely held companies; and  the relationship between proposed section 20G and current section 20(3J) be clarified. 79 Salary trade-offs 80 81 OVERVIEW The bill proposes various changes to bring a wider range of salary substitutes into the definition of “income” for tax and social assistance purposes. In the bill as introduced, these changes included proposals to tax a wider set of car parks through the FBT rules, largely applying to car parks provided to employees in the central business districts of Auckland and Wellington. The Minister of Revenue has invited the Committee to withdraw the proposals relating to car parks from the bill. 82 CLARIFYING THAT VOUCHERS ARE A “SHORT-TERM CHARGE FACILITY” Issue: Vouchers should not be included in the definition of “short-term charge facility” Submission (Maxxia, KPMG, Wilson Parking) Vouchers simply enable employers to provide employees with goods and services in a more cost-effective manner. If the provision of the underlying good is not subject to fringe benefit tax, there is no policy reason for provision of a voucher to be either. The removal of an efficient mechanism to administer the fringe benefit tax exemption is counterproductive and harmful to the charitable sector. (Maxxia) Officials should look at the Australian model where not-for-profit organisations enjoy the continued support of the Government through a fringe benefit tax exemption, with “per-employee” limits. (Maxxia) While we understand the tax and social policy rationales for the inclusion of vouchers in family scheme income, this may impose an additional cost on a charity from having to fund the tax on behalf of employees. This appears inconsistent with the Government’s other public policy objectives. (KPMG) Charitable organisations should not have to pay FBT on the value of vouchers provided to employees. Vouchers given to employees of charitable organisations recognise the efforts of individuals helping the less well off. The new rules also impose significant administrative burdens on charitable organisations. (Wilson Parking) Comment Although the exemption from fringe benefit tax afforded to charitable organisations means that charitable organisations are not generally required to pay fringe benefit tax on goods and services provided to employees, there is a long-standing exclusion for benefits provided by way of short-term charge facilities when those benefits exceed 5 percent of an employee’s salary or wages for the tax year. The bill proposes that this cap be amended to the lower of $1,200 or 5 percent of salary or wages. In recent years, various arrangements which aim to expand the intended scope of the FBT exemption for non-cash benefits provided to employees of charitable organisations have been marketed to some charitable organisations. The arrangements, such as the provision of vouchers, have aimed to cover an employee’s normal everyday living expenses such as groceries and petrol. In these circumstances, vouchers can provide a readily substitutable alternative to salary and wages. 83 A key principle of tax policy is horizontal equity – ideally a tax should apply equally to people on the same effective income. Not requiring charitable organisations to pay FBT on vouchers (or other short-term charge facilities) provided to employees, could encourage structuring such that employees received minimal monetary remuneration, and received a large portion of their salary package as non-monetary remuneration, including by way of vouchers. Officials note that these arrangements could be avoidance in some situations. Officials are of the view that it is appropriate to clarify the definition of “short-term charge facility” to express that vouchers are a form of short-term charge facility, and so are subject to the modified cap. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: The current cap on FBT-exempt short term charge facility benefits of up to 5 percent of salary or wages should not be amended Submission (Simpson Grierson) We oppose the proposal to change the cap on the FBT exemption in respect of the provision of short-term charge facilities to the lesser of $1,200 or 5 percent of the employee’s salary or wages. The proposed $1,200 cap is very low. It does not give sufficient weight to the positive assistance that the more generous, existing cap gives to charitable organisations, in terms of enabling them to attract and retain staff by providing a mixture of monetary and non-monetary remuneration to employees. Alternatively, if it is considered necessary to supplement the cap with a specific value threshold, that threshold should be more generous, for example $3,000 rather than $1,200. Comment As noted earlier, a key principle of tax policy is horizontal equity – ideally a tax should apply equally to people on the same effective income. By allowing employees of charitable organisations to receive valuable salary substitutes, such as vouchers, without their being taxed, employees would receive a tax saving over employees of other entities. This would create inequity between employees of different types of entities. A $1,200 cap is equivalent to 5 percent of income at $24,000, which officials consider provides charitable organisations with sufficient flexibility while precluding salary substitution. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 84 Issue: The wording of section CX 25 should be clarified Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Ernst & Young, Simpson Grierson, Deloitte) These submissions consider it is unclear how vouchers are included in the definition of “short-term charge facility” by the proposed wording changes to section CX 25. It’s not intuitive that there is a “liability” on the employer when they have provided a voucher, as required by the wording of the section. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) It should be clarified whether this definition includes electronic cards which are given to employees with money pre-loaded onto them, as the employer will have provided payment before the liability to pay for goods and services obtained by an employee arises. (Ernst & Young) Instead, a separate limb should be included in the definition of “short-term charge facility” specifically referencing the provision of vouchers (or equivalent benefit) to an employee that can be redeemed by the employee to acquire any goods or services. (Simpson Grierson) Comment The issue hinges on whether the employer has a liability to pay for the goods or services at the same time as the voucher or other short-term charge facility is used by the employee. The policy intent is that these two events need not happen concurrently. For example, the liability could occur beforehand, which would cover electronic cards with money preloaded onto them. Officials will instruct the drafter to consider if the wording could be clearer in this area. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 85 REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE A STATEMENT ABOUT SHORT-TERM CHARGE FACILITIES Submissions (BusinessNZ, Deloitte, Simpson Grierson, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Westpac, KPMG) Employers should not be required to provide a statement to employees – this requirement would create an excessive amount of paperwork that would serve little to no purpose and would impose significant compliance costs on employers. (BusinessNZ, Deloitte, Simpson Grierson) The requirement to provide this statement should be limited to employers in the charitable sector. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, BusinessNZ, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) We do not believe that employers would typically enter salary trade-off arrangements involving short-term charge facilities outside of the charitable sector. (BusinessNZ) The requirement to provide a statement should be limited to employers that provide vouchers as salary substitutes. (Westpac) This requirement will impose significant compliance costs on employers who will need to track every single voucher provided during the year. This will not be practical. There should be a minimum amount, under which statements do not need to be provided. This could be $100 per voucher. (KPMG) Employers should only need to provide a statement to employees who receive a significant amount of remuneration through short-term charge facilities. This amount could be $1,200, or the lesser of $1,200 or 5 percent of income. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The $300 per quarter FBT threshold should apply to the requirement to disclose information on short-term charge facilities. (Wilson Parking) Comment Clause 67B proposes that all employers who have provided short-term charge facilities, such as vouchers, will be required to provide a statement to each employee who received the short-term charge facility setting out the total value of facilities they received during the income year. The reason for this requirement is to assist employees in calculating their income for social assistance purposes. Employees are unlikely to keep a record of all short-term charge facilities they receive from their employer. When an employee receives short-term charge facilities from multiple employers, it will be difficult for them to calculate their income for social assistance purposes if they do not have information about the benefits they received during the year from all their employers. The amount a person receives from each employer may be below the threshold, but when combined may exceed the threshold for including this amount in their social assistance calculations. 86 Officials accept that this disclosure requirement would increase compliance costs for businesses which provide benefits to employees by way of short-term charge facilities. Officials also accept that many businesses which provide these types of benefits to employees do not provide substantial sums under these short-term charge facilities. Accordingly, on balance, officials recommend the removal of this requirement from the bill. Businesses which provide short-term charge facility benefits could still provide information about these benefits to employees if employees request this information. However, this is contingent on their keeping sufficiently detailed records. Recommendation That the submissions to remove from the bill the requirement for an employer statement be accepted. 87 INCLUDING CERTAIN BENEFITS IN FAMILY SCHEME INCOME Issue: Appropriate year for recognising benefits in income Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amount included in “family scheme income” for the income year should be the value of the benefits received in the previous income year. This will reduce compliance costs and the likelihood of unrecoverable debts arising if the employee is remiss in advising Inland Revenue about the receipt of those benefits. The timing of receipt of benefits may not always coincide with the time when the person must inform Inland Revenue of their family scheme income. Comment The bill requires employees to include short-term charge facility benefits (above the cap) and explicit salary trade-offs involving cars in “family scheme income”. “Family scheme income” is the definition of income used for Working for Families (WFF) tax credits. It is basically taxable income with a range of adjustments, such as the inclusion of trust income and the adding back of rental property losses. WFF tax credits are calculated at the end of the tax year using the person’s family scheme income for that income year. While claimants who apply for interim instalments of WFF tax credits during the year, based on their estimated income, may have trouble estimating the proposed additional benefits likely to be received during the year, this process is subject to a square-up at the end of the tax year. Furthermore, similar estimation difficulties already exist in respect of other types of family scheme income, such as the fringe benefits for shareholder-employees who control 50 percent or more of a company, and extra pays. Claimants are encouraged to update estimated income amounts when changes occur during the year, to minimise any difference at square-up. In these circumstances, officials see no reason why using the income year in which the benefit was received would not work when including short-term charge facilities and explicit salary trade-offs involving cars in family scheme income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 88 Issue: The inclusion of short-term charge facilities in family scheme income should be limited to benefits provided by charitable organisations Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Wilson Parking) The proposal will require all employers to keep records of short-term charge facilities provided to employees. This is not currently required of employers who are not charitable organisations, and it will impose excessive compliance costs. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Note that they currently do not keep records of vouchers provided given the $300 per quarter FBT threshold. (Wilson Parking) Comment Officials consider that this requirement should not apply solely to employees of charitable organisations as this would create inequity between employees of different types of entities. The WFF entitlement of an employee of a non-charitable organisation should be the same as that of an employee of a charitable organisation on an equivalent remuneration package. To reduce employer compliance costs, officials have recommended removing the requirement that employers provide a statement to each employee who has received a short-term charge facility benefit during the year. Instead, it will be left up to employees to ask their employer for this information if they need it. It does not seem unreasonable to expect that employers will have some record, as part of their normal accounting records, of who they are providing vouchers to. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 89 Policy matters 90 91 LEASE INDUCEMENT AND LEASE SURRENDER PAYMENTS Clauses 4B, 17B, 25B, 32B and 57(19B) Issue: Policy considerations Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Tax asymmetry is inherent and inevitable in a tax system that distinguishes between capital and revenue items. If the proposed amendments do proceed, it is important that the intended symmetry relied on to justify the proposed amendments is in fact achieved, and that the proposed amendments, once enacted, have a logical and reasonably certain application. Comment The current tax treatment of generally deductible but non-taxable lease inducement payments poses a risk to the tax base because it creates an opportunity for taxpayers to substitute tax-deductible rent payments with non-taxable cash lease inducement payments. Also, compared with other forms of lease inducements such as a rent-free holiday or a contribution for fit-out costs, these payments provide a tax advantage which distorts business decisions on leases. To remove this distortion, it is necessary to modify the capital-revenue boundary for lease inducement payments to make them taxable to the recipient. This is in line with several measures in tax legislation where the judicially delineated capital/revenue boundary has been modified to counter arrangements based on converting revenue receipts into capital receipts. Past examples include redundancy payments, payments received for restrictive covenants and exit inducements. The reforms included in this bill are limited to lease inducement and lease surrender payments, and are the result of the lease inducement payments review undertaken in July 2012. The proposed changes address the revenue risk associated with lease inducement payments and the “black hole” expenditure problem associated with lease surrender payments. They provide a consistent tax treatment of lease inducement and lease surrender payments by treating them as taxable to the recipient and deductible to the payer. As announced by the Minister of Revenue on 11 December 2012, a wider review of the tax treatment of land-related lease payments is currently underway to rationalise the rules into a coherent regime. It is expected that an officials’ issues paper will be released for public consultation this year seeking feedback on the review. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 92 Submission (KPMG, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The submitters generally support the reforms. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application date Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The application date should reflect the Minister of Revenue’s media statement. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The application date should be made clearer, in particular the words “an amount that is...not derived as consideration for the agreement, before 1 April 2013, to a lease of land or a licence to use land”. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The term “agreement” should be clarified as to what level of completion is necessary for the relevant lease agreement to be considered in existence before 1 April 2013. (Ernst & Young, Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment The proposed wording of the application date is intended to reflect the Minister of Revenue’s media statement of 27 September 2012. It stated that the reforms will apply to lease inducement payments on commercial leases entered into on or after 1 April 2013. This is a form of “savings” provision for taxpayers. It is intended to provide more business certainty for those who have entered into a lease (i.e. completed a binding lease agreement) before 1 April 2013, but who derive or incur lease inducement payments on or after 1 April 2013. An alternative wording for the application date including the term “agreement” will be considered to better reflect the policy intent. Additional guidance on the application date will also be provided in a Tax Information Bulletin article following enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 93 Submission (Ernst & Young) That the application date for an amount derived or incurred for an agreement to a lease or licence to use land seems redundant for the lease surrender payments amendments in proposed sections CC 1C and DB 20C. Comment Officials recommend that the application date for lease inducement payment and lease surrender payment amendments be separated. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Deductions for lease inducement payments Submission (KPMG) Consideration should be given to allowing an immediate deduction for lease inducement payments. Comment The proposed timing rules spread income and deductions over the term of a lease. This approach, which is consistent with the method used for accounting purposes, recognises that lease inducement payments are all part of the price paid for the lease. Moreover, these payments relate to the securing of an asset – the lease with the tenant – and, in principle, the expenditure on an asset should be spread over its income-producing life. For these reasons, allowing an immediate deduction of these payments is not supported. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 94 Issue: Timing of income and deductions for lease inducement payments Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, Chapman Tripp, Ernst & Young) The term “spreading period” in proposed section EI 4B(1) should clarify the beginning and end of the spreading period. (Ernst & Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Chapman Tripp, Deloitte) Express definition should be included as to the relevant period over which income and deductions should be allocated for situations such as those when there is an initial fixed term but the land right contains rights to renew or extend which may, or may not, be exercised in due course. (Ernst & Young) Comment The timing rule spreads income or deductions for lease inducement payments evenly over the term of a land right (for example, a lease). The “spreading period” in the rule determines the term of the relevant land right over which income or deductions are allocated. The spreading period is intended to recognise a fixed period set either at the grant, renewal or extension of the land right. This approach is taken to avoid complexities around modifying the spreading period (and relevant income and deduction allocations) when the initial fixed period is later renewed or extended. Under the proposed rule, if there is a payment for a renewal or extension of the land right, the fixed period of the renewal or extension would be regarded as a separate spreading period. Officials will consider an alternative wording for the timing rule, in particular, the term “spreading period” to better reflect the policy intent. Additional guidance on the timing rule will also be provided in a Tax Information Bulletin article following enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 95 Submission (Ernst & Young) A straight-line allocation method (similar to the approach applied for depreciation purposes for fixed life intangible property) for spreading income or deductions seems more straightforward and appropriate compared with the proposed spreading rule, which allocates income or deductions in equal portions to each income year. Comment Under the current approach, the amount of income or deductions may not be allocated consistently for taxpayers with the same duration of lease. This is because the allocation of income or deductions depends on the number of income years in the spreading period for a lease. For example, a lesser amount of income or deductions would be spread in each income year for a lease that begins half-way through an income year compared with a lease that begins at the start of the income year. Example A tenant receives a lease inducement payment of $100,000 from a landlord on 1 April 2013 for a 10-year lease (the lease ends on 31 March 2023). The lease begins on the same day. The tenant has a 31 March balance date. Under the proposed timing rule, $10,000 of income ($100,000/10) would be allocated over 10 income years. However, if a tenant receives the payment on 1 July 2013 for a 10-year lease that begins on the same day and ends on 30 June 2023, $9,091 of income ($100,000/11) would be allocated over 11 income years. Officials accept that allocating income or deductions in equal portions to each income year may not allocate income or deductions proportionately to the actual number of months or days of the spreading period in an income year. To better allocate income or deductions without requiring a complex set of rules, officials prefer the amount to be allocated proportionately to the number of months rather than the number of days. Officials consider this is a balanced approach of providing a simple, yet reasonably accurate allocation rule. This approach is also consistent with the suggested straight-line method in the depreciation rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 96 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Transfers to associated persons should be treated consistently for income and deductions purposes to ensure that related entities are able to restructure their holdings of land rights or estates in land without adverse income tax consequences. Comment Under the proposed timing rule, a “wash-up” calculation of income or deductions is generally required in certain situations – for example, when a landlord transfers the reversion (i.e. the estate in land from which the land right is granted) or a tenant transfers their lease to a third party before the lease expires. However, the “wash-up” calculation for deductions is not allowed if the landlord transfers the reversion to an associated person. In this case, the remaining deductions would continue to be spread over the remaining term of the lease. This is intended as a specific anti-avoidance measure to target situations when a lease inducement payment is made by a landlord who subsequently transfers the reversion to an associated person (a new landlord) to accelerate their deductions. Officials do not agree that the tenant should continue to spread income over the remaining term of the lease if the transfer is between associates. Officials do not consider there is a need to treat transfers between associates differently from transfers between non-associates in relation to the timing of income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Timing mismatch Submissions (New Zealand Law Society, Corporate Taxpayers Group) There is a possible mismatch with the timing of capital contribution income (10 years) and deductions (spread over the term of a land right under the proposed timing rule). (New Zealand Law Society) Income from lease premiums that is subject to section EI 7 (which spreads income over six years) should be subject to the proposed timing rule to ensure symmetry. (New Zealand Law Society) Spreading of income and deductions for lease premiums should be consistent. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) 97 Comment Officials accept there are some inconsistencies between the existing timing rule for lease premiums and capital contributions, and the proposed timing rule for lease inducement payments. These inconsistencies can be partly explained by the fact that the timing rules have been developed separately for particular payments over a long period of time. As announced by the Minister of Revenue on 11 December 2012, the tax treatment of land-related lease payments is currently being looked at, with a view to providing a coherent and consistent tax treatment of these payments. The timing rules for these payments will be part of the review. It is expected that an officials’ issues paper will be released for public consultation this year seeking feedback on the review. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Lease surrender payments Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Drafting proposed income and deduction provisions for lease surrender payments (sections CC 1C and DB 20C) in the same way seems desirable. Comment Officials do not consider the same drafting format for income and deductions provisions for lease surrender payments is necessary or desirable. There is no general requirement that income and deductions provisions be structured in the same way. The current drafting achieves the policy intent of treating lease surrender payments as income to the recipient and deductible to the payer whether they are a landlord or tenant. The income provision is drafted differently from the deductions provision – for example, the income provision specifies the recipient only, whereas the deductions provision specifies both the recipient and the payer. This is intended to sufficiently protect the tax base. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 98 Submission (KPMG) Proposed section DB 20C needs to be corrected because for lease surrender payments, the payer is the tenant, not the owner of a lease. Comment Lease surrender payments are generally made by a tenant to a landlord to surrender an existing lease before its expiry date. However, these payments can also be made by a landlord to a tenant. Hence, provisions relating to lease surrender payments are intended to cover both situations: proposed section DB 20C confirms deductibility of lease surrender payments for both landlords and tenants. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definitions of “residential premises” and “tenant” Submissions (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The policy intent and drafting of the term “residential premises” should be clarified. (Ernst & Young) The term “residential premises” should be defined. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The term “tenant” should be defined. (Ernst & Young) Comment Under the proposal, lease inducement and lease surrender payments derived by a tenant of residential premises are not income of the tenant. The policy rationale for this exclusion is to provide symmetry of income and deductions for a tenant of residential premises. The tenant would not able to deduct these payments or rent because they do not meet the general permission in section DA 1 and the private limitation in section DA 2(2) would also apply. Officials accept that some uncertainty may arise over what “residential premises” or “tenant” refer to. Having considered a number of Acts that define these terms, officials are not convinced that providing a specific definition for these terms would be helpful. Alternative wording will be considered to better reflect the policy intent. It is expected that the exclusion would apply in a very limited circumstance because lease inducement and lease surrender payments are generally incurred or derived in a commercial context (i.e. between landlords and commercial tenants). 99 Recommendation That the submissions to clarify the residential tenant exclusion in proposed sections CC 1B(4) and CC 1C(3) be accepted. Issue: Deductions for landlords of residential premises Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The bill should be amended to allow deductions for lease inducement and lease surrender payments by landlords of residential premises. Comment Proposed sections DB 20B and DB 20C already allow deductions to a landlord of residential premises who makes lease inducement and lease surrender payments. The exception for tenants of residential premises is relevant for income purposes only. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Lease premiums and lease inducement payments Submission (Chapman Tripp) The definition of “lease inducement payments” should be clarified as provisions relating to lease inducement payments are drafted very broadly and are not clear how these provisions interact with existing provisions. Comment Officials do not consider clarifying the term “lease inducement payments” is necessary. The current provisions sufficiently identify the type of lease inducement payments that are currently not taxable under the Income Tax Act 2007. The income provision (proposed section CC 1B) is broadly drafted so that it includes both lease premiums (such as “key money” paid by incoming tenants to landlords) and lease inducement payments (paid by landlords to incoming tenants). Although lease premiums are already covered under section CC 1, the amount of income would be allocated to a person once because of the existing single income allocation rule in section BD 3(6). 100 The deduction provision (proposed section DB 20B) allows deductions for landlords who make lease inducement payments to an incoming tenant. The existing depreciation rules allow deductions for tenants who make lease premium payments to landlords. Officials accept that these similar payments are covered under various regimes. The scheduled review of the tax treatment of land-related lease payments will seek to rationalise the various rules relating to lease payments. An officials’ issues paper is expected to be released for public consultation this year. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Proposed section DB 20B should be amended to allow deductions for “key money” paid by tenants to landlords. This would ensure that the existing asymmetry does not arise. Comment Proposed section DB 20B covers deductions for lease inducement payments only – deductions are allowed to landlords who make lease inducement payments to incoming tenants. Deductions for lease premium payments or “key money” made by incoming tenants to landlords are already covered under the existing depreciation rules. Having two different deductions mechanisms for lease premiums and lease inducement payments that are similar in substance (i.e. payments to enter into a lease) is undesirable. In practice, it may create some inconsistencies and confusions over which mechanism applies to these payments. The scheduled review of the tax treatment of land-related lease payments will seek to rationalise the various rules relating to lease payments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 101 Issue: Rationalisation of provisions relating to lease payments Submission (New Zealand Law Society) When a further review of lease payments is being contemplated, consideration should be given to how all provisions should fit together. Comment Officials agree there is a need to rationalise existing provisions and new provisions relating to lease inducement and lease surrender payments. The scheduled review of the tax treatment of land-related lease payments will seek to rationalise the various rules relating to lease payments. An officials’ issues paper is expected to be released for public consultation this year. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: GST treatment Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The GST treatment of lease inducement and lease surrender payments should be clarified. Comment The reforms included in this bill are intended to cover the income tax aspects only of lease inducement and lease surrender payments only. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 102 Issue: Minor technical drafting issues Submissions (Deloitte, New Zealand Law Society, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Submitters have made a number of technical suggestions to improve the provisions that are consistent with the policy intent. Officials agree with these submissions. These are outlined below:  Certain amendments should be made to exclude capital contribution payments (such as contribution for fit-out costs) being subject to the proposed rules, in line with the policy intent. (Deloitte, New Zealand Law Society, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Corporate Taxpayers Group)  Proposed sections CC 1B(4) and CC 1C(3) should be amended to refer to a tenant or licensee of residential premises because these provisions would apply to both a leasehold estate and a licence to use land. (New Zealand Law Society, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 103 GST: CROSS-BORDER BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS NEUTRALITY Clauses 91 and 92 Issue: Grouping Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, CTC Aviation, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposal to prevent residents from forming GST groups with non-residents should not go ahead. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, CTC Aviation, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers) As an alternative, non-residents that are required to be registered should be allowed to group. (CTC Aviation) The proposed rule that allows the disbanding of current groups should be clarified so that it only applies to groups formed after introduction. (CTC Aviation) Comment The bill proposes to prevent the establishment of cross-border groups to allow Inland Revenue to accurately assess the level of refunds paid to non-residents. If cross-border groups were allowed, when a representative member filed a GST return on behalf of the group, it would be possible for what are effectively GST refunds to non-residents to be “masked” by the activities of a broader group that included New Zealand residents. Grouping with a New Zealand resident could also be used by non-residents as a method of accounting for GST on an invoice basis – a basis that is more susceptible to fraud because GST refunds are provided on invoices issued, rather than cash paid. However, there are sometimes legitimate reasons for forming cross-border groups and officials accept that the changes should not impose undue barriers in the way of standard business arrangements. Officials consider there is a solution that will allow for the formation of cross-border groups but still provide an adequate degree of protection to the revenue base. The suggested changes should affect not only cross-border grouping, but provide more clarity around the scope of the rules more generally. Officials therefore recommend that clauses 91 and 92 be amended so that:  Only non-residents that make no taxable supplies in New Zealand can register for GST under proposed section 54B.  Non-residents that make taxable supplies in New Zealand under the compulsory registration threshold would not be able to use section 54B but would be able to voluntarily register under the existing registration provisions. This voluntary registration option would also apply to a non-resident that either did or did not make taxable supplies and wished to form a group with companies that made taxable supplies. 104  If a non-resident registered under section 54B starts making taxable supplies, they will be treated as being registered under the existing “domestic” rules. This would give a non-resident the option of either registering under section 54B or joining a group with a New Zealand resident and that group would be subject to the “standard” rules. The advantage of this solution is that non-residents that chose to group- register with a New Zealand company would have to show that any input deductions claimed were linked to taxable supplies made in New Zealand (rather than their worldwide business) in order to access refunds. This is consistent with the current situation and officials do not consider there is a significant revenue risk attached to it. On the flip side, the solution still allows non-residents in a “pure” refund position to register under the proposed rules and claim input deductions based on their worldwide supplies. Non-residents registered under proposed section 54B would still only be able to group- register with other companies registered under that section (in other words, form wholly non-resident groups). This solution has been discussed with representatives of Deloitte and the Corporate Taxpayers Group. Both agree it strikes a reasonable balance. By recommending the main submission be accepted, the concerns raised by the secondary submissions are also addressed. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Registration rules as a code Submission (Ernst & Young) The word “only” in proposed section 54B(1) should be deleted because it reads as a code for all voluntary registrations of non-residents. Comment Officials consider the registration criteria rules should be a code, subject to officials’ recommendation on the previous issue. The consequence of the recommendation is that a non-resident that makes no taxable supplies in New Zealand should only be able to register under the proposed rules. Non-residents making taxable supplies will be able to continue to voluntarily register. Recommendation That the submission be declined on the basis that, if previous officials’ recommendations are accepted, having the rules act as a code provides the right outcome. 105 Issue: Relationship with current rules Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Further consideration should be given to how the existing GST rules and proposed registration rules should work in tandem. In particular, an exclusion similar to that in proposed section 54B(1)(c) should be introduced in relation to goods. Comment If the Committee accepts the recommendation to clarify the scope of the proposed rules, those changes would address the concerns in this submission. By applying different rules to non-residents making taxable supplies in New Zealand and those not making taxable supplies, it should be apparent where the dividing line between the two sets of rules is drawn. That being the case, no exclusion such as that suggested in the submission would be necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined on the basis that, if officials’ previous recommendations are accepted, the right outcome should be achieved. Issue: Cessation of registration Clause 75 Submission (Ernst & Young) 1. Proposed section 5(3B) should not go ahead. 2. Proposed paragraph 5(3B)(b) should be revised to apply only to services “forming part of the assets” or deleted. 3. Section 10(7A) should refer to section 5(3B) so that market value rules apply. Comment Proposed section 5(3B) is intended to be concessionary. Without it, officials consider there is an argument that a non-resident that registered for GST and then deregistered would need to account for output tax on the value of all its worldwide assets. Clearly this would be an inequitable outcome. The purpose of proposed section 5(3B) is therefore to limit New Zealand’s taxing right to goods and services that logically form part of the non-resident’s New Zealand activities (if there are any). 106 However, officials agree there is scope for uncertainty regarding the proposed wording of paragraph (b). Output tax on services that have already been supplied in accordance with the time of supply rules should be returned, even though the non-resident will only be registered on a payments basis. We therefore consider that the services caught by this provision should be the services performed in New Zealand prior to deregistration. Officials also agree that applying the market value rule in section 10(7A) to supplies treated as being made under proposed section 5(3B) is appropriate. Recommendation That submission 1 be declined, submission 2 be accepted in part, subject to officials’ comments, and submission 3 be accepted. Issue: On-supply of services Clause 91 Submission (Ernst & Young) Proposed section 54B(1)(c) should be clarified in its scope so that it refers to “the performance of services”, rather that the “a supply of services”. This would make it consistent with section 11A(2). Comment Officials agree that consistency between proposed section 54B(1)(c) and current section 11A(2) is desirable. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Input tax ratio Clause 83 Submissions (PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Allowing input claims only to the extent of its taxable supplies is not practical in the case of larger businesses. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) 107 Either the restriction should not be introduced or the bill should include a safe-harbour recovery ratio of, say, 25%, which would apply unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that a higher ratio is appropriate. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) GST deductions should be calculated under the existing rules for GST recovery and based on actual supplies made by the non-resident business in New Zealand. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment Claiming input deductions on the basis of worldwide supplies, as if all supplies were made and received in New Zealand, provides an appropriate outcome. Given the broad base of New Zealand’s GST system, it is anticipated that almost all industries outside the financial services sector would be entitled to claim on a near 100 percent basis. For those within the financial services sector, officials accept that compliance costs will be incurred. However, it is considered preferable to require estimates to be made, given any alternative may result in a non-resident financial services provider being in a more favourable position than a comparable New Zealand-resident business. One way of providing some parity between resident and non-resident financial services providers would be to allow a rule that permitted a non-resident to agree a fair and reasonable apportionment method with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Resident financial service providers can make the type of arrangement under section 20(3E) of the GST Act, and officials consider that compliance costs for a non-resident financial service provider could be lowered by allowing a similar rule to be made available to them. Although officials can see the attraction of a safe-harbour recover ratio, as suggested by NZICA, this has the potential to impose compliance costs on the vast majority of businesses that would have to displace the onus of proof to claim a higher ratio. Basing input claims on the actual New Zealand supplies made would, in officials’ view, defeat the purpose of these rules. If claims could only be made on the basis of New Zealand supplies, a non-resident that made no supplies in New Zealand would not be able to access GST refunds. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted to the extent that a rule be introduced allowing non- resident financial service providers to agree an input ratio with the Commissioner. Issue: Time period for refunds Clause 89 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The time period under proposed section 46(1B) should be reduced to 63 working days. 108 Comment Officials consider the 90-day period to be appropriate. There is an increased fraud risk associated with providing refunds to non-residents. This risk exists because, unlike residents, Inland Revenue has limited ability to accurately track down and recover money from non-residents when a refund is released in error. Having a longer timeframe for releasing refunds is considered preferable to having a shorter timeframe that the Commissioner may be more inclined to extend if doubts exist over the legitimacy of a claim. Officials consider that 90 days is a more realistic timeframe to allow the Commissioner to adopt a considered opinion on whether a refund will be released. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Registration criteria Clause 91 Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh) There is a potential unintended gap in the registration criteria because it assumes all consumption taxes are as broad based as our GST. The words “if the country or territory in which the person is resident does not have a consumption tax”, should be removed from proposed subparagraph 54B(1)(ii) so the registration criteria in paragraph (1) operate on an either/or basis. Comment Officials do not agree that the two alternatives set out in proposed section 54B(1) should be on an either/or basis. The purpose behind the registration criteria more generally is that only legitimate businesses should be able to register for GST in New Zealand. Officials consider that a good proxy for “legitimacy” in this instance is the fact that the person has satisfied their “home” government that they should be registered for a comparable tax in that jurisdiction. However, officials agree with the submission to the extent that there is a potential unintended gap in the wording. The issue is that the person may live in a jurisdiction that has a consumption tax, but not be required to register for that tax because their activities are outside the tax base. On this basis, officials consider the wording should be amended so that paragraph (ii) applies to a person that is resident in a jurisdiction that does not have a consumption tax, or has a consumption tax that does not apply to the activities of the person. Recommendation That the submission be accepted to the extent it refers to “an unintended gap between proposed paragraphs (i) and (ii)”, but otherwise declined. 109 Issue: Cancellation of registration Clause 91 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Proposed section 54C(3)(b) is too inflexible. It should either not proceed or, in the alternative, should provide for some flexibility by incorporating an Inland Revenue discretion. Comment Proposed section 54C is included to provide a disincentive for non-residents that fail to comply with their filing obligations. It does this by providing that a person who fails to file or files late returns for three consecutive periods is deregistered and cannot re- register for a period of five years. This five-year period also applies to non-resident associates of the person to prevent the rules being easily circumvented. The submitter considers this would be inequitable in situations such as when the non- resident company is bought by another non-resident (the prohibition on registration would attach to the new owner), or if the management of the affected non-resident changed. Officials consider that providing a Commissioner discretion on these matters could lead to uncertainty over how and if that discretion will be exercised, and requests for detailed guidance. Officials do not consider the potential inequities raised outweigh the desirability of having clear rules in this area that are difficult to avoid. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Direct refund scheme Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed system to allow non-resident businesses to register for GST should be replaced with a direct refund scheme. 110 Comment The options for enhancing cross-border business-to-business neutrality were canvassed in a Government discussion document released in August 2011: GST: Business-to- business neutrality across borders. In that document, one of the options discussed was a direct refund model. However, one clear disadvantage of that approach was the need for a new electronic system to manage the refunds. The Government therefore stated a preference for the system this bill seeks to implement – whereby non-resident businesses can register for New Zealand GST and claim input tax deductions in a way broadly comparable with a similar New Zealand-resident business. Submissions on the discussion document overwhelmingly agreed with the Government’s preference. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: GST on “tooling costs” Clause 78 Submissions (BusinessNZ, Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Corporate Taxpayers Group) 1. This initiative should proceed. (BusinessNZ, Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Corporate Taxpayers Group) 2. The rule should be effective from date of enactment, rather than 1 April 2014. (Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Officials consider these changes form a “package” of cross-border initiatives with the proposed registration system for non-residents mentioned above. For that reason, it is considered desirable for both rules to be effective from the same date. Recommendation That submission 1 be noted and submission 2 be declined. 111 TREATMENT OF EXCEPTED FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS UNDER THE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS RULES Clause 33B The bill introduces an amendment to the tax rules that allows a taxpayer to elect to treat excepted financial arrangements as financial arrangements. The change will remove an overreach problem caused by the election rule, while still preserving the original policy intent behind the rule. The policy behind the rule is to reduce compliance costs to taxpayers who have debts outstanding relating to goods or services supplied in the ordinary course of their business, valued in a foreign currency. Issue: Amendment to treatment of short-term agreements for sale and purchase Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The submitter supports the rationale behind the amendment, ensuring the financial arrangements rules work as intended. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Clarification of drafting Submission (Ernst & Young, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The drafting should be clarified to better reflect the policy intent. It is not clear whether the modification applies to the underlying short-term agreement that is transferred or to the transfer agreement itself. (Ernst & Young) Comment Officials agree that the drafting could be clarified to better reflect the policy intent. The policy intent behind allowing taxpayers to elect to treat certain excepted financial arrangements as financial arrangements was to reduce compliance costs when short- term trade credits denominated in a foreign currency were valued at balance date spot rates for financial reporting purposes, and at transaction date spot rates for tax purposes. Further, when the short-term trade credit was hedged, there was a mismatch. 112 The excepted financial arrangements that can be treated as financial arrangements are:  agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services;  short-term agreements for sale and purchase;  short-term options;  travellers’ cheques; and  certain variable principal debt instruments. Officials consider that removing the ability to elect to treat these excepted financial arrangements as financial arrangements will reduce the potential “overreach” of the current election rule. However, it is still necessary to address the issue of the mismatch between the tax valuation of excepted financial arrangements denominated in a foreign currency (the tax rules require taxpayers to value these excepted financial arrangements at the spot rate applicable at the date of sale or purchase) and the accounting valuation. Therefore, officials recommend that a provision in the bill (clause 33B) be re-drafted to address this mismatch. Accordingly, the bill proposes that, for the five excepted financial arrangements listed above, taxpayers be allowed to use the valuations they use for their financial statements for tax purposes, if they are denominated in a foreign currency. More specifically, taxpayers who, for their financial statements, determine foreign exchange values at balance date for such debts (that are excepted financial arrangements) would be allowed to use this balance date foreign exchange value for tax purposes. This should address the compliance cost concern that underpinned the introduction of the election rule (section EW 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007). The rule is optional. However, once a taxpayer elects into the rule for an excepted financial arrangement, they will not be allowed to revoke the election. A taxpayer’s decision to elect into the rule will be reflected in the tax position they take in their return of income for each tax year – no prior notice of election is required. The new approach therefore means that taxpayers will no longer be able to elect to treat the five excepted financial arrangements outlined above as financial arrangements. The bill proposes a transitional rule that will operate for taxpayers who have previously elected to treat an excepted financial arrangement as a financial arrangement under section EW 8. These taxpayers will be treated as having valued their foreign currency- denominated excepted financial arrangements at the spot date used for their financial statements, on the date that the new rules come into force. There will be no change to the application date for the amendment (see next submission). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 113 Issue: Amendment should be limited in scope or, alternatively, addressed as part of a wider review of the financial arrangements rules Submission (Ernst & Young) The submitter states that the proposed amendment should be deleted or alternatively re- worded to limit its scope. The submitter is concerned that the amendment may have broader application than intended. Taxpayers may elect to treat short-term agreements for sale and purchase, such as their trade receivables or payables as financial arrangements in the ordinary course of business (for example, if they are denominated in a foreign currency). On a literal reading of the proposed new section EW 32B, it is possible that it might apply to such taxpayers. It is further submitted that any changes to the financial arrangements rules should be addressed as part of a comprehensive review of the rules, rather than on an ad hoc basis. Comment The amendment addresses a specific concern with the election to treat excepted financial arrangements as financial arrangements in a targeted manner. The rationale behind allowing a taxpayer to elect to treat a short-term agreement for sale and purchase as a financial arrangement was to reduce compliance costs by allowing any short-term debt under the agreement to be treated for tax purposes as it is for accounting purposes – for example, in the situation outlined by the submitter. However, the rule has unanticipated overreach – for example, taxpayers being able to convert what would otherwise be capital sums into deductible amounts. The change proposed above addresses the compliance cost issue raised by the submitter by allowing taxpayers with trade receivables or payable denominated in a foreign currency to use their financial reporting valuations for tax purposes. The issue required addressing as soon as practicable because it presented a potential fiscal risk. Accordingly, officials did not consider it appropriate to wait for a review of the overall financial arrangements rules before amending the rules. No review is planned. In proposing the change, officials have taken into consideration the overall scheme of the financial arrangements rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 114 Issue: Application date Submission (Ernst & Young) The application date should be changed so that the amendment only applies to transactions occurring after the date the bill is enacted. Comment The revised amendment outlined above applies to all excepted financial arrangements that a taxpayer elects to treat as a financial arrangement from 27 September 2012. However, there is a “savings” provision for short-term agreements when the taxpayer has taken a tax position or obtained a binding ruling before 27 September 2012 (the date the proposed change was announced by the Minister of Revenue). Officials consider the application date is justifiable because of the potential fiscal risk from the loophole in the existing rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 115 TIME PERIOD FOR REFUNDS UNDER THE INCOME TAX ACT 2007 Issue: Agree with proposal in principle Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Subject to our submissions on the application date and section 113, set out below, we accept the broad principle underlying the proposed change to limit the time period for claiming tax refunds and charitable tax credits, being to align the refund period with the time bar for reassessment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application date Submissions (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The repeal of section RM 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be clarified to apply in relation to refunds of income tax for a person’s 2013–14 or later income year. (Ernst & Young) The wording of proposed new section 41A(6) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be revised to clarify when the refund application must be made and definition of the four-year period. Clarification should also be provided on how the amendment to section 41A may apply in relation to any delayed claims for housekeeping payment credits up to the 2011–12 income year. (Ernst & Young) The application date of the amendment should be delayed so that it applies from the 2016–17 and later tax years. This would align the proposed amendment with the changes to the tax return filing rules enacted in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Act 2012. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The proposal means that from the 2013–14 tax year the time period for refunds under the Income Tax Act is reduced to four years from the end of the year in which the assessment is made. The amendment applies to all refunds including those where the refund is for a tax year before 2013–14. A submission suggests that the proposal should apply to assessments only to refunds for a person’s 2013–14 or later tax year. Officials disagree and consider that it would be much simpler for only one refund time period to 116 apply in all cases. To have different time periods apply depending on when tax was assessed would create confusion. For donations tax credits the bill proposes that the refund must be made within four years from the end of the tax year in which the donation is made. A submission suggests that the proposal apply to gifts made after 1 April 2013. Currently for the many individual taxpayers who are not required to file returns, there is no assessment of tax, the time period in section 108 does not start and therefore there is no time limit for claiming tax credits. As with the submission on the application date for the refund time period under the Income Tax Act above, officials consider it would be much simpler for only one rule to apply in all cases. To have different time periods in perpetuity depending on when the gift was made would create confusion. One submission suggested that the proposal be delayed to align with the recent amendment to the return filing rules. The proposal to amend the time period for refunds under the Income Tax Act applies more widely than the recent amendments to the return filing rules. Officials consider that these proposals, which affect all taxpayers, should not be delayed. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Commissioner amending assessments Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The four-year time limit should also apply to amended assessments issued by the Commissioner under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section 113 should specifically proscribe the Commissioner’s practice of refusing to amend an assessment under section 113 when the taxpayer wishes to change from one valid treatment available under the Revenue Acts to another valid treatment (the so called “regretted choice” approach). Comment Section 113 gives the Commissioner the discretion to amend assessments in order to ensure their correctness. While there is specifically no time limit in section 113 on the Commissioner amending an assessment, there are time limits on the Commissioner increasing the amount of an assessment and refunding overpaid tax. Standard practice statement 07/03 Requests to amend assessments sets out the Commissioner’s practice for exercising the section 113 discretion. It clearly refers to the time limits on increasing assessments (paragraph 55) and the time limits on income tax refunds (paragraph 56). 117 The application of the time bar to the Commissioner’s power to amend assessments was confirmed in Miller v Commissioner of Inland Revenue, (1998) 18 NZTC 13,961 (CA): The Act confers on the Commissioner the power to make tax assessments (s 19) \[of the Income Tax Act 1976 which became section 92 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, since amended\] and from time to time to make alterations or amendments to an assessment in order to ensure its correctness (s 23)\[now section 113\]. But the Commissioner may not exercise that power of amendment after four years from the end of the year in which the original assessment was made except where the taxpayer's return was fraudulent or wilfully misleading or omitted all mention of the income in question or all mention of income from a particular source (s 25)\[now section 108\]. Except in objection proceedings, an assessment may not be disputed and is conclusively deemed and taken to be correct (s 27) \[now section 109\]. ... When a taxpayer has two or more options available to them, takes one option and at a later date requests a change to another valid option, there is no error to correct – the position taken is correct. The Commissioner does not have unlimited resources and as noted in the standard practice statement 07/03 Requests to amend assessments: ... the Commissioner does not consider it appropriate to devote resources to correcting optional positions if the preferred positions could have been taken when the taxpayers made the original self-assessments by filing the tax returns. Arguably, to do so would not promote the integrity of the tax system pursuant to section 6(1). Amending section 113 to proscribe the Commissioner’s practice of “regretted choice” would involve a major change to tax administration. The proposal in the bill concerns the time limit for refunds and is not concerned with amending a long standing core provision such as section 113. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The amendment does not lead to symmetry Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society) The time period for refunds should remain at eight years. While it is correct to say that assessments cannot generally be increased after four years, there is actually a long list of exceptions to this rule which are not mentioned in the commentary to the bill or the associated regulatory impact statement. For example, there is no time limit on the Commissioner if there is a view that a return is fraudulent or wilfully misleading or does not mention income of a particular nature or derived from a particular source. This means there is the potential to nullify the time bar in situations when there is no intended mischief by a taxpayer and therefore can potentially apply to a taxpayer who has made what is essentially a simple mistake or oversight. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) 118 While this change seems reasonable, we note that the statute bar period can be waived in some circumstances. (KPMG) The proposal to limit a taxpayer’s right to a refund after the four-year period should not proceed. The playing field is already substantially tilted in the Commissioner’s favour. Whereas the Commissioner can amend a assessment at any time during the four-year period in section 108 of the Tax Administration Act, taxpayers have no right to have an assessment amended once four months have passed since the date they made their assessment (note that in the case of a Commissioner assessment, the period is two months). There are many situations when the Commissioner is able to amend an assessment beyond the four-year period. If the proposal does proceed, it should be subject to appropriate exceptions – for example, relatively large claims. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Officials agree with the comments in submissions that in particular circumstances there is no time limit on the Commissioner for increasing an assessment – for example, when a return is fraudulent or omits income from a particular source. The limited exceptions to the four-year time bar rule should be seen in the context that the Commissioner is responsible for administering the entire tax system. Matters concerning tax positions taken by a taxpayer are primarily within the knowledge of the taxpayer. One of the principles underlying self-assessment is that taxpayers have more information about their tax liabilities and are therefore in a better position to assess their own tax liability than the Commissioner. The Commissioner audits taxpayers to determine whether their self-assessments are correct or incorrect. As noted earlier, taxpayers can request that adjustments be made to assessments under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act to ensure their correctness. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Specific loss offset and refund rules Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The loss offset and refund rules need to be revised to ensure that their operation is consistent with the operative provisions in the Act, particularly the petroleum mining rules. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) There are also a number of circumstances where amended assessments are possible outside the general four-year rule and therefore amending the rules to prevent refunds after a four-year period would not result in symmetry of outcomes for taxpayers and Inland Revenue. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) 119 Comment This proposal generally aligns the time period for taxpayers requesting refunds with the time period for the Commissioner increasing an assessment. As noted in one of the submissions: Regardless of whether this proposal proceeds, arguably sections RM 2, 4 and 6 do not currently work with a large number of provisions in the Act that can require tax adjustments to be made outside of the time bar. Officials note that this submission raises issues that would require further analysis as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Double taxation example Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG) Inland Revenue could amend a taxpayer’s assessment to correct an underpayment of tax but not allow the overpayment of tax in an earlier year to be corrected to offset the underpayment. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) It is important that a timing mismatch does not arise. For example, a timing difference that is amended on audit, if Inland Revenue increases the income in a tax year that is inside the four-year limit, and there is a corresponding decrease in income in a tax year that is outside the four-year limit, the refund resulting from the reduced income should not be disallowed. (KPMG) Comment One of the submissions contained an example where a taxpayer returned income early in year 1 – the income should have been returned in year 3. When Inland Revenue audited the taxpayer in year 7 the assessment for year 3 was amended but a corresponding adjustment was not made to the year 1 assessment, resulting in the taxpayer being taxed twice on the same income. Officials consider that such an outcome is inconsistent with the Commissioner’s duty under section 6 of the Tax Administration Act to maintain the integrity of the tax system. In exercising her powers the Commissioner should seek to avoid this outcome by, for example, making appropriate consequential amendments. The Commissioner has issued an internal instruction to this effect. This internal instruction will be noted in the Tax Information Bulletin article for this reform. 120 Officials have discussed the issue with the Committee’s independent advisor. Officials will monitor this issue and if such double taxation cases occur will propose an amendment in a future bill. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Extend the time period to claim input tax credits Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The time period for claiming input tax credits should be lengthened to four years. Comment For GST purposes, the current time period to claim input tax credits is two years as set out in the proviso to section 20(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The issue of the time period for claiming input tax credits raises considerations which are particular and special to GST. These would require quite separate analysis to the proposal in the bill to reduce the time period for refunds under the Income Tax Act to four years. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application to foreign tax credits Submission (BDO Wellington Limited) It is unclear how the amendments will affect the application of section 78B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Comment Under section 78B(1) of the Tax Administration 1994, a taxpayer who has a tax credit under section LJ 2 (tax credits for foreign income tax) or section LK 1 (tax credits relating to attributed CFC income) of the Income Tax Act must apply for the credit within four years after the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer would have the credit. The Commissioner has a discretion to extend this period by another two years. 121 Officials agree with the submission and recommend that the time period for the refund be extended if the Commissioner has exercised her discretion under section 78B and the taxpayer would not otherwise be within the refund period. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Overpayment of tax Submission (New Zealand Law Society) When a taxpayer has paid more tax than they were procedurally required to do so, there should be no time limit on the right to a refund. The time limitation in section 108 of the Tax Administration Act on the Commissioner’s power to amend an assessment does not prevent the Commissioner from collecting tax which the taxpayer has admitted it owes, but which it has not paid. Accordingly, there should be no limit on refunds which arise without the need for an amended assessment. Comment This proposal in the bill generally aligns the time period for taxpayers requesting refunds with the time period for the Commissioner increasing an assessment. It means that all taxpayers requesting refunds would be treated similarly, as the refund period for personal tax summary taxpayers is currently four years. The submission is correct in that there is no time limit on the Commissioner collecting tax which the taxpayer has been assessed for but which has not been paid. The time limit is on the Commissioner amending an assessment so as to increase the amount assessed. This submission raises an existing issue which the proposed amendment does not affect. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 122 Issue: Time bar and extension of time Submission (Deloitte) For taxpayers with an extension of time, tax returns are due by 31 March following the end of the tax year. However, 31 March 2013 falls on Easter Sunday. An Inland Revenue publication has noted that returns can be filed on 2 April 2013. However, it does not mention the impact of doing so, which is that returns filed on 2 April 2013 would be filed in the 2014 tax year and remain open for the Commissioner to amend the assessment for an additional year beyond what the taxpayer may have expected. Comment This issue concerns the current application of the time bar and is therefore separate to the proposed amendments which would reduce the time period for income tax refunds to four years. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Clarification of the application of the time bar to some taxes Submission (Deloitte) There are a number of issues with the application of section 108 of the Tax Administration Act which prevent its clear application to some taxes – for example, an incorrect reference in section 99(2) to the wording in section 108 and the assessment provisions for FBT, ESCT and NRWT not referring to section 108. Comment Officials note that this submission raises issues that would require further analysis as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 123 Issue: Refund period under the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The time period for refunds in the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 should also be amended to be consistent with the proposed four-year period in the Income Tax Act 2007. Comment Section 86L of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 sets out the time period for refunds of overpaid levies or levies paid in error. Currently a person can apply for the refund within eight years of the date of payment. The time period should be reduced to four years consistent with the proposals in the bill to reduce the time period for refunds under the Income Tax Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Remedial amendment to section RM 4(1)(c) Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section RM 4(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to refer to “tax year” rather than “income year”. Comment Section RM 4(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 refers to the four-year period “under section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 beginning at the end of the income year in which the assessment was amended has not ended”. Section 108(1)(b) refers to four years that “have passed from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provides the tax return”. Section RM 4(1)(c) should be amended to refer to “tax year” rather than “income year”, consistent with section 108. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 124 FAIR DIVIDEND RATE (FDR) FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES Issue: Create a FDR hedging fund Submission (Financial Services Council, AMP Capital) A “FDR hedging fund” should be introduced that would have all its hedges taxed on the same basis as the fair dividend rate (FDR) method. Many funds are single-sector funds, investing in only one type of asset (such as international equities taxed under FDR). A FDR hedging fund approach would be easier for such funds. Comment In developing these rules, officials were concerned about the possible revenue risk if they could be misused. As such, the rules require certain calculations to ensure that they can only be used as intended. These rules were developed with significant consultation with the industry and officials are confident they are workable. Nevertheless, this submission suggests that, for certain types of funds (those that invest only into FDR assets and that only enter into foreign exchange derivatives for the purpose of hedging) the rules could be redesigned to be simpler yet still provide the necessary comfort that they cannot be misused. Officials understand the submitters’ point. However, this would require a redesign of aspects of the rules and development of technical details, such as how to define a fund that only enters into foreign exchange derivatives for the purpose of hedging. As noted above, there is a risk that these rules could potentially be misused, so a cautious approach is justified. Such a change could, however, potentially be considered for inclusion in the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Out of fund hedging Submission (Financial Services Council, AMP Capital, Ernst & Young) The rules should be modified to also cater for funds that do not invest directly, but rather invest through other managed funds. 125 Comment In theory, funds that do not invest directly into FDR assets should be able to “look through” wholesale funds they invest into and access the rules on the basis of those wholesale funds’ investments. However, in order to prevent misuse, there are a number of detailed factors that officials consider would need to be worked through before such a change is considered. For example, a restriction would need to be put in place to ensure that if a wholesale fund were to use this look-through rule it would not be able to arbitrarily start and stop doing so. Questions also arise over which types of funds would be able to benefit from such a modification, in what specific circumstances, and where the onus of proof would lie. As with the issue of creating an FDR hedging fund noted above, this is a complex area and there are risks that the rules could potentially be misused, so a cautious approach is justified. For these reasons, officials’ preference is that the issue of out of fund hedging instead be potentially considered for the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Associated persons and fair value requirements Submission (Financial Services Council, Ernst & Young) For a hedge to be eligible for the new rules, it must not be entered into with an associated person and the hedge must have a fair value of zero when it is first entered into. These two criteria should be replaced with a requirement that a hedge must be entered into on arm’s-length terms. Comment Officials’ concerns with an “arm’s-length” test is that they are difficult to apply in practice. It can be very hard to prove that a transaction was not carried out at arm’s length. Officials do not agree that the rules should apply to hedges that have a fair value not equal to zero, even if that hedge was entered into on commercial terms. It would then be possible for taxpayers to select when to use these new rules in order to minimise their tax liability. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 126 Issue: Closing hedges out early Submission (Financial Services Council) The rules should be amended to allow hedges to be closed out early by entering into an equal and opposite hedge transaction. Comment Officials agree, provided that the foreign currency contract used for this also meets the definition of a “hedge” under section EM 3. For example, it must begin with a fair value of zero. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Ability to make generic elections Submission (Financial Services Council, KPMG, AMP Capital) Elections for the FDR hedging rules to apply to a hedge should be able to be done on a generic or portfolio basis. Comment Officials agree. It is noted, however, that an election for a hedge to be covered under the FDR hedging rules includes an election of a “FDR hedge portion” – that is, the extent to which the hedge should be covered by the rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 127 Issue: Treatment of mistaken elections Submission (Financial Services Council, KPMG) An election for the FDR hedging rules to apply is currently irrevocable. An exception should be made for genuine errors. Comment Officials disagree. The rationale for the up-front election is to ensure that taxpayers cannot choose which tax treatment to apply to a hedge based on what would give the most favourable tax treatment. It would be difficult to legislate a sufficiently strong definition of what constitutes a “genuine error”, as taxpayers may have incentives to characterise some elections as an “error” for tax reasons. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Apply calculations on a portfolio basis Submission (Financial Services Council) The calculations in section EM 5 should be able to be performed on a portfolio of hedges, as opposed to a hedge-by-hedge basis. Comment Officials agree, subject to being able to adequately establish a reasonable and workable method of measuring assets at the time a hedge is entered into. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 128 Issue: Proxy hedge rules Submission (Financial Services Council) It is impractical for a fund to hedge every currency it is exposed to. Funds therefore enter into “proxy hedges”, hedging exposure to less common currencies (such as the Brazilian Real) with hedges for more common currencies (such as the US dollar). The current FDR hedging rules allow this but the following minor changes are required:  In the calculation, the value of “proxied currency asset” must be zero if the fund has a hedge denominated in the “proxy currency”. This restriction should be removed.  Some funds will hedge an uncommon currency with hedges in multiple common currencies (for example, hedge an exposure to the Brazilian Real with hedges in both the US dollar and British pound). The rules should be amended to allow this. Comment On the first matter, this restriction is not intended. Officials recommend that, to the extent possible, the legislation be amended to reflect this. On the second matter, the use of proxy hedges is complex. Nevertheless, the rules do allow some amount of proxy hedging. Officials accept that some funds will attempt to “proxy hedge” with a portfolio of currencies. However, given the complexity of the area, the difficulty in amending the legislation, and the fiscal risks associated with misuse, this issue should potentially be considered further. Officials’ preference, therefore, is that this issue is potentially considered for the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments on the second matter. Issue: New Zealand shares listed on AUX Submission (Financial Services Council, AMP Capital) The FDR hedging regime should extend to New Zealand shares that are acquired on the Australian stock exchange (AUX) and denominated in Australian dollars. Comment Officials disagree. It is considered that a New Zealand company listed on the AUX and denominated in Australian dollars (AUD) will largely be “naturally hedged” back to New Zealand dollars (NZD) because the assets and profits of the New Zealand company 129 will largely be denominated in NZD. As an example, say the AUD strengthens. The value of the company to Australians should fall, as its NZD-denominated assets and profits are now worth less when converted to AUD. However, the strengthening AUD also means the NZD-value of the shares on the AUX will be higher than they were before. These two effects should largely cancel out. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Time limit for adjustment Submission (Financial Services Council, AMP Capital) The reference to days in section EM 7(4) should be changed to “working days”. Comment Officials agree. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Allow profit participation policies (PPPs) Submission (Financial Services Council) For a life insurer, the current rules will only apply to separately identifiable funds where the benefits are directly linked to the value of investments held in the fund. For insurers who hold their investment assets within the life insurer, this will mean that the new rules will apply only to their unit linked savings products. It will not apply to profit participation policies (PPPs). Comment It is not clear to officials at this stage whether PPPs are, in fact, consistent with the underlying approach taken in respect of life insurers or, if so, whether the proposed rule under section EM 2 adequately deals with such a situation already. Further work would need to be undertaken to establish this. Officials’ preference, therefore, is that this issue is instead potentially considered for the Government’ tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 130 Issue: Allow longer unit valuation periods Submission (Financial Services Council, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG) The FDR hedging rules are currently restricted to taxpayers that perform daily unit valuations. This should be extended to taxpayers that calculate unit prices less frequently. Comment Officials agree, provided every hedge is subjected to the tax calculation in section EM 6 at least once. In practice, this means that a fund’s unit valuation period must be shorter than the contract period of the hedges the fund enters into. Hedge contracts can also be cancelled before they are due to expire. This means if a fund has a unit valuation period of greater than a day, a tax calculation under EM 6 will also need to be performed when a hedge contract is cancelled. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Rolling hedges Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The FDR hedge portions should be set when a hedge is taken out but not re-set when hedges are rolled. Comment Officials disagree. The purpose of calculating FDR hedge portions is to ensure that foreign currency derivative contracts are, in fact, hedges for FDR assets – that is, they must protect against currency risk a person is exposed to. The purpose of the required calculations is to ensure that this is the case. When a hedge is rolled, how much currency risk a person is exposed to may be different from when they first entered into the hedge. For example, they may have purchased new FDR assets (or sold old ones), or the values of their assets may have changed. It is therefore important for FDR hedge portions to be set when hedges are rolled. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 131 Issue: Extension to other portfolio investors Submission (Law Society, KPMG) The FDR hedging regime as currently drafted is available only to managed funds and other widely held investment vehicles. However, the problem that the regime is designed to resolve – the mismatch in tax treatment between certain offshore assets and hedges for those assets – is not unique to managed funds. The regime should be extended to other portfolio investors. Comment Officials disagree. In developing these rules, officials were concerned about the possible revenue risk if they could be misused. It is believed that a restriction to widely held investment vehicles would help mitigate this risk. Such funds are not controlled by any investor, disclose their hedging strategy, and should have systems in place to comply with the requirements of these new rules (such as the need to make an up-front election). It is also generally difficult for a managed fund to take an aggressive tax position due to investor equity issues. Investors can leave and join funds, so the investors who benefit from the tax position may be different to the investors who would have to bear the consequences of any subsequent audit. It is also noted that other portfolio investors have a method, albeit an imperfect one, of solving the tax mismatch between hedges and FDR assets (grossing up the amount hedged). This method is much less effective for managed funds. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarify interaction with the financial arrangement rules Submission (KPMG, Ernst & Young) The interaction between the FDR hedging rules and the financial arrangement rules needs clarification. Comment Officials agree. The intention is that, to the extent the FDR hedging rules apply to a hedge, the financial rules should not apply. Conversely, to the extent the FDR hedging rules do not apply to a hedge the financial arrangement rules do apply. 132 This means that if a fund is required to adjust its FDR hedge portions under the quarterly test of section EM 7, the adjusted portion should be taxed under the financial arrangement rules from the date of the quarterly test. Officials recommend clarifying these points in the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Consequences of breach/quarterly calculation Submission (KPMG, Ernst & Young) Given the volatility of international capital markets and foreign currency fluctuations, it is quite possible that a taxpayer will inadvertently breach the quarterly test in two consecutive quarters. As currently drafted, this will result in the taxpayer being excluded from the FDR hedging regime for up to 18 months. This is too penal. The taxpayer should only be excluded from the regime in the following two quarters. Comment Officials agree. The taxpayer should only be excluded from the regime for the following two quarters. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Overhedging rule in section EM 5(9) Submission (KPMG) Section EM 5(9) provides an unfair result in certain circumstances. If a new hedge pushes the result of the formula to above 1.05 the FDR hedging regime cannot be used for that hedge. This would be particularly unfair if a taxpayer was previously well below the 1.05 threshold and entered into a single large hedge that only subsequently pushed them over the limit. Instead, the extent to which the FDR hedging rules can apply to the new hedge should be reduced so that the result of the formula in section EM 5(9) is 1.05. 133 Comment Officials agree. It is noted that the same result to what is requested could in fact be achieved by entering into two separate hedges: one that results in the formula in section EM 5(9) being equal to 1.05 (which would be eligible for the rules). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Minor drafting amendments Submission (KPMG) There are two minor drafting errors that should be fixed:  section EM 1(1)(a)(i) should refer to “excluded income” rather than “exempt income”; and  the formula in section EM 5(9) is inverted. Comment Officials agree. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application to existing hedges Submission (Ernst & Young) The new rules should be able to be applied to hedges that were entered into before the application of the regime. Comment Officials disagree. There needs to be an election in place when hedges are entered into – this prevents selective election to minimise tax payments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 134 Issue: Application date Submission (Matter raised by officials) The application date of the FDR hedging regime should be changed to the date of Royal assent. Comment Due to delays in the planned timeframes of this bill, the planned date of application for these rules (the beginning of the 2013–14 income year) has already passed. Officials therefore recommend the application date be changed to the date the bill receives Royal assent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 135 Remedial matters 136 137 CLARIFICATION OF THE “DIVIDEND” DEFINITION Issue: General support for changes Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh, Deloitte, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society) The submitters support the proposal to clarify the dividend definition so that share splits involving subdivisions, rights issues 1 and premiums paid under bookbuild arrangements 2 do not constitute dividends. The submitter agrees that share splits should be included in the definition of “bonus issue” rather than being explicitly excluded from being a dividend. This approach preserves a company’s ability to elect to treat a share split as a dividend, by virtue of it being a taxable bonus issue. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Support for clarification noted. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Change to wider dividend definition Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh, Deloitte) Rather than making ad hoc changes to the dividend definition, the current problem can be overcome by amending section CD 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the section entitled “What is a transfer of value?”) by replacing the word “provides” with “transfers” or “distributes”. 1 A rights issue is where a company offers its shareholders rights either to buy new shares at a discount to the market value, or sell existing shares at a premium. 2 Following a rights issue, a bookbuild can take place. A bookbuild involves the rights of non- participating shareholders (who chose not to participate or were not entitled to participate) being offered to other investors who pay a premium for them. The original shareholder is paid all or part of this premium for giving up their rights. 138 Comment As noted in the regulatory impact statement, Clarification of dividend definition, to deal with the current uncertainty officials considered amending the general dividend definition in section CD 5. The key issue with amending the general dividend definition is that there may be unintended effects (for instance, arrangements that should be taxed as a dividend may be unintentionally excluded). Replacing the word “provides” with “transfers” or “distributes” as suggested by submitters does not necessarily address the current uncertainty relating to the issue of shares. While it is arguable that the issue of a share by a company is not a transfer or distribution (and therefore in line with policy) the opposite is also arguable. This is because the company creates the share and then transfers or distributes it to the new owner. It is this uncertainty which is the source of the problem that officials are trying to deal with. Overall, we consider it is unlikely that replacing “provide” with “transfer” or “distribute” will be decisive. It will merely draw attention to the problem without solving it. In addition, the term “provide” may, in some situations not involving an issue of shares, be more appropriate than “transfer” or “distribute”. For instance, the use by a shareholder of the company’s property is also intended to be a dividend. If the ordinary meaning of the word “transfer” or “distribute” is adopted there is an argument that the company does not transfer or distribute the property, or the use of the property, to the shareholder. Therefore in this case “provide” may be a more appropriate term (because the use of the property is provided to the shareholder). It is important not to risk excluding from the general definition of “dividend” these situations in which a shareholder receives a private benefit from the use of a company’s resources. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Confirmation that changes are for clarification only Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) If the overarching definition is not amended, it should be made clear that the exclusions are being enacted for clarification only and not because these arrangements or similar arrangements necessarily involve a transfer of value. Comment Officials confirm by way of this officials’ report, that the changes to the dividend definition are to clarify that rights issues, premiums paid under bookbuild arrangements and share splits are not dividends. This is not a change in policy and the change, in itself, does not imply that other arrangements fall within the dividend definition. A similar statement confirming the clarifying nature of these changes will be made in the Tax Information Bulletin article that is published after the tax bill is enacted. 139 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Income under ordinary concepts Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh, Deloitte, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Ernst & Young) The bill should clarify that no income arises under ordinary concepts in respect of the particular transactions. The main area of taxpayer uncertainty in the case of rights issues is not whether a dividend arises but whether income arises under ordinary concepts, as was held to be so by the High Court of Australia, Commissioner of Taxation v McNeil. If this clarification is not made, there is a potential to create greater uncertainty than currently exists. Comment The proposed amendments to clarify the dividend definition so that certain transactions are not dividends arose because the rewritten definition of “dividend” (from the Income Tax Act 1994 to the Income Tax Act 2004) unintentionally broadened the dividend definition. The amendment was not made in response to the McNeil decision in Australia. Therefore officials do not consider the proposed changes infer that the particular transactions would be income under ordinary concepts. That is, the proposed amendments are not relevant to the scope of section CA 1(2) (the provision which states that an amount is income for a person if it is income under ordinary concepts). In general, whether something is income under ordinary concepts is, and should continue to be, a matter of interpretation dependent on the facts of any particular case. “Income under ordinary concepts” has been a feature of the law since income tax was introduced and officials do not consider it is necessary to amend this longstanding core feature of income tax law. Furthermore, there are considerable differences between the Australian and New Zealand tax legislation (such as the existence of a comprehensive capital gains tax in Australia). It is important to note that Australian case law is not binding on New Zealand courts, and there have been tax cases when the two jurisdictions have reached different conclusions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 140 Issue: Clarification of the transactions to which subsection CD 29B(2) applies Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh) Proposed subsection CD 29B(2) should be clarified, as it could be read as being limited to rights issues where the rights relate to shares in the same class as those held by the shareholder to whom the right was issued. If this is intended, there is no clear rationale provided for this limitation. Comment It is not intended that the scope of proposed subsection CD 29B(2) be limited by the class of the share being issued. Officials agree that the drafting should be amended to ensure the intended result is achieved. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Scope of proposed subsection CD 29B(2) Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Where a person subscribes for shares for less than their market value, there is no loss to the company. There is only a loss to the other shareholders. Accordingly, this transaction should not give rise to a dividend in any circumstance. To address this, paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed subsection CD 29B(2) should be deleted. Currently section CD 29B(2) reads: “Issue of shares under rights to subscribe for shares “(2) The issue by a company of a share to a person for consideration less than the market value, immediately before the issue, of a share in the same class of shares, is not a dividend if— “(a) the person subscribes for the share under a right (a subscription right) issued by the company to a shareholder holding shares in the share class before the issue of the right; and “(b) the company does not, as part of the issue of the subscription right, give the person a right to dispose of the share to the company. Comment Deleting paragraphs (a) and (b) would mean subsection CD 29B(2) reads “The issue by a company of a share to a person for consideration less than the market value, immediately before the issue, of a share in the same class of shares, is not a dividend”. 141 Paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed subsection CD 29B(2) are necessary because they ensure that the dividend exclusion only applies to particular rights issues and deleting these paragraphs could lead to the wrong result. For example, under current policy settings bonus shares issued under an arrangement where shareholders can elect whether to receive bonus shares or money or money’s worth (bonus issues in lieu), are taxable. There are good policy reasons for treating a bonus issue in lieu as taxable and as part of the current changes we do not propose to review this treatment. If this submission was accepted, a bonus issue in lieu may fall within the section CD 29B dividend exclusion and not be taxable. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Premiums paid under bookbuild arrangements can be a payment for the right Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) As drafted, proposed subsection CD 29B(3) applies to situations when the premium under a bookbuild directly relates to the share (that is, the premium is paid as an additional amount to subscribe for the share). When a person participates in a bookbuild of unexercised rights, the person will generally pay the same amount to subscribe for the share but the “premium” component will generally be attributable to the right itself rather than the share (that is, the right to subscribe for the share). Subsection CD 29B(3) should be amended so that when the premium relates to the right to subscribe for shares, this is also excluded from being a dividend. Comment Officials agree that where a premium is paid for the right to purchase a share or to dispose of a share, the premium should not be treated as a dividend. In this case the premium should not be treated as part of the subscription price. This aligns with the policy intent and is consistent with the proposed change for rights issues. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 142 Issue: Premiums paid in relation to unexercised rights to dispose of shares Submission (Russell McVeagh, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Proposed subsection CD 29B(3) should be expanded to cover premiums paid in relation to unexercised rights to dispose of shares. If premiums paid in relation to unexercised rights to dispose of shares are not excluded from the dividend definition, this could potentially imply that they are considered dividends. Comment The bookbuild arrangements officials have come across involve rights to subscribe for shares because bookbuilds are, in nature, equity-raising schemes. However, from a policy perspective, officials agree that when there is an arrangement involving rights to dispose of shares, premiums paid for these under such an arrangement should be excluded from the dividend definition if the company does not give up anything of value and the premium is effectively paid by other shareholders who purchase the rights. Officials also agree that not including such premiums in subsection CD 29B(3) may create uncertainty. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Limitation of subsection CD 29B(3) where premium gives rise to available subscribed capital Submission (New Zealand Law Society) In some cases, the excess of the “clearing price” over the “subscription price” may be paid to the company in its own right (rather than to the shareholder who did not subscribe). In that case, it might give rise to available subscribed capital, and should not be excluded from the dividend definition. Comment Officials agree that proposed subsection CD 29B(3) should not apply if the premium amount gives rise to available subscribed capital. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 143 Issue: Retrospective application Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The submitter supports the retrospective nature of the proposed amendments, given that the amendments are intended to remedy particular uncertainty created by what appears to be an unintended broadening of the dividend definition as a result of the rewrite process. However, it is worth emphasising the basis on which the proposed changes are being made retrospective. Comment The changes to clarify the dividend definition, so that share splits involving subdivisions, rights issues and premiums paid under bookbuild arrangements do not constitute dividends, apply from the 2005–06 year. This was the commencement date of the rewritten legislation (Income Tax Act 2004) which contained the new (rewritten) dividend definition. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Change application dates to a fixed date rather than a tax year Submission (Ernst & Young) The amendments should be expressed as applying from 1 April 2005 (for the Income Tax Act 2004 amendments) and from 1 April 2008 (for the Income Tax Act 2007 amendments), rather than for specified tax years. References to “tax years” could cause confusion for shareholders with non-standard balance dates. Comment The proposed changes apply to both the Income Tax Act 2007, and its predecessor, the Income Tax Act 2004. The application date of these changes is intended to mirror the application date of both these statutes so that, in effect, the changes apply from the date that the Income Tax Act 2004 (which first contained the rewritten dividend definition) applied from. We do not expect this to cause problems for taxpayers with non-standard balance dates. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 144 FARMERS’ RIPARIAN PLANTING Clauses 20 and 21 The bill proposes that the present practice, farmers’ riparian planting for conservation planting, should be immediately deductible. Submission (WHK) The submitter supports the bill’s proposal. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 145 CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO AMORTISABLE PRIMARY SECTOR EXPENDITURE Clauses 18, and 57(7) The bill contains a proposal that the rules concerning third-party contributions to capital expenditure should be extended to cover primary sector amortisable expenditure of the sort dealt with in subpart DO. Submission (Ernst & Young) It is arguable that the definition of “capital contribution property” and the use of that definition in clause 18 could restrict the application of the proposed capital contribution rule to revenue account property. Comment Officials believe that the drafting as it is presently stated is clear and unambiguous. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (Ernst & Young) That the definition of “capital account property” be further clarified by referencing it to “capital contribution”. Comment Officials suggest that this could make the definition circular and therefore it would not add anything. Recommendation That the submission be declined 146 PRIMARY SECTOR ASSET AMORTISATION – SUBPART DO Clauses 18, 23 The bill contains specific generic proposals to better align the primary sector amortisation rules in subpart DO of the Income Tax Act 2007 with the ordinary depreciation rules. The amendments are a result of a more detailed analysis of this subpart as a result of the kiwifruit PSA virus outbreak that has decimated the main Kiwifruit Gold variety and has potentially affected other kiwifruit. Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Ernst & Young) To remove doubt, the proposed amendment should explicitly state that the rendering useless of the kiwifruit as a consequence of the kiwifruit PSA virus is not an action of the taxpayer. Comment The submission concerns the scope of the proposed amendment. As introduced, the amendment is prescriptive and may be interpreted as not allowing a deduction when the orchardist has removed the kiwifruit as a precautionary measure. In the circumstances this is not intended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to the matter being able to be explicitly drafted. Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The tenor of the amendments should be extended into subpart DO generally, to even better replicate the depreciation rules. Comment Officials understand the direction of this submission. However, it potentially has wider implications and in the context of this bill officials have not had time to fully analyse it. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but when the Government’s tax policy work programme allows, it should be further considered. 147 GENERAL INSURANCE CLAIMS RESERVES AND EVENTS THAT OCCURRED BEFORE JULY 1993 Clauses 2(3) and (4), 8, 25, 101 and 104 Issue: Support for proposed amendment Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The technical amendment is logical. Comment Before July 1993, general insurance business carried on outside New Zealand was not subject to New Zealand income tax. As a result, New Zealand insurers were unable to claim deductions in relation to claims that were connected with this offshore business. From 1 July 1993 insurance business carried on outside New Zealand by New Zealand residents became taxable. Specific transitional rules were included in the Income Tax Act 1976 to deal with the change. Transitional rules deny insurers a deduction for any pre-1993 claims under section DZ 10. The rules for calculating the outstanding claims reserve under the Income Tax Act 2007 do not explicitly exclude amounts relating to pre-1993 events and arguably tracks claims when an entitlement to a tax deduction for the claim does not exist under section DZ 10. This outcome was not envisaged and appears to impose an unnecessary requirement on taxpayers to track insurance events when under the transitional rules no deduction would be allowed for a claim that is connected with a pre-July 1993 event. The proposed amendment explicitly excludes from the calculation of a general insurer’s outstanding claims reserve – sections CR 4 and DW 4 – certain insurance events that occurred before 1 July 1993. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 148 TRANSITIONAL IMPUTATION PENALTY TAX Clause 71 The bill proposes that the transitional imputation penalty tax, which ensures that dividends are not over-imputed following the company tax rate change from 30% to 28%, should not apply to dividends paid out before the earlier of the 2010–11 tax return being filed or 31 March 2012 (the deadline for filing 2010–11 tax returns). Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers) 1. The 10% (of 30%) penalty should be reduced as it is unnecessary and gives arise to punitive and unintended results. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers) 2. Where a dividend for a listed company was declared in the period of the earlier of the 2010–11 tax return being filed or 31 March 2012, the penalty should not apply. This is on the basis that once dividends are declared under the stock exchange rules, a listed company is committed. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) 3. The penalty, which was always intended to prevent deliberate over-imputing of dividends, can now be repealed because its usefulness is at an end as from 1 April 2013 dividends cannot be over-imputed. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment After the recent company tax rate change from 30% to 28%, taxpayers may have paid out dividends at the old ratio of 30/70 (instead of the new ratio of 28/72) before they filed their 2010–11 tax return without fully appreciating the details of that tax return. The return may not have yielded sufficient 30% tax to cover the 30/70 imputation credits attached to the dividends. A one-off penalty tax at 10% (of 30%) would then apply on 31 March 2013. We agree with submitters that the penalty at 10% is currently overstated, especially when the core imputation penalty ensures that companies do not overdraw their imputation accounts. The penalty was intended to be a preventative device, to ensure that companies do not deliberately over-impute dividends at 30% during the transitional period (from the 2011–12 income year to 31 March 2013) when they had not paid underlying tax at 30% or more. In the previous transitional period, when the company tax rate decreased from 33% to 30%, the same penalty applied. Around 65 taxpayers were penalised, resulting in $550,000 of penalties being imposed. 149 Officials considered the option of reducing the penalty to better reflect the potential loss to the tax base. However, this option is not desirable as adjusting the penalty at this late stage will not be easy, particularly given that it will be due before this tax bill is enacted. A better option at this stage is repealing the penalty. The administrative implications to correct the penalty are significant when compared with the potential loss to the tax base in this situation. The potential revenue risk reflected in the previous transitional period is immaterial. Also, the core imputation penalty is already in place to ensure that companies do not overdraw their imputation accounts. Recommendation That submission 3 be accepted, which will also deal with submissions 1 and 2. 150 DEDUCTIBILITY OF REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE FOR COMMERCIAL FIT-OUT Clause 14 Issue: Clarifying the application of proposed section DA 5 Submissions (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, KPMG, Argosy Property Limited) The application of section DA 5 should be clarified to ensure that it only applies to previously separately depreciated items of commercial fit-out. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, KPMG) The drafting of the proposed section is inconsistent with, and overrides, existing case law because it addresses what asset (the commercial fit-out item) the repairs and maintenance expenditure relates to. Instead, it should state that the expenditure does not relate to the building. (Argosy Property Limited) The drafting of the proposed section creates ambiguity by referring to “a building’s commercial fit-out” as the “item”. It could be interpreted as relating to the whole of the building’s commercial fit-out rather than each separate item of commercial fit-out. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Argosy Property Limited) Comment The policy intent behind this change is to prevent taxpayers from claiming that capital expenditure is immediately deductible because it is repairs and maintenance on the building. Officials agree that clarifying the wording of proposed section DA 5 would better align the legislation with the intended policy outcome. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 151 Issue: Application date of proposed amendment Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The application date of the proposed section DA 5 should be changed from 1 April 2011 to the commencement of the 2012 income year in order to be consistent with recent changes to depreciation settings. Comment Officials agree that it would be desirable for this amendment to be consistent with previous changes to depreciation settings and to take effect from the start of the 2011–12 income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Request for Inland Revenue guidance Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Guidance on the interaction of proposed sections DA 5 and DB 65 would be of assistance to taxpayers. Section DB 65 provides an allowance to taxpayers who previously depreciated commercial fit-out items as part of the building, rather than separately. Specifically, guidance on whether or not section DA 5 will apply when a taxpayer is already utilising section DB 65 is requested. Comment If practical difficulties arise on the interaction of proposed section DA 5 and section DB 65, Inland Revenue would assist taxpayers through the usual channels for interpretive issues. Policy officials will alert the relevant unit that this is an area of interpretation taxpayers are interested in. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 152 Issue: Review of changes to building depreciation settings Submission (Deloitte) The removal of depreciation on buildings fundamentally changed the depreciation environment for building owners. It would be worthwhile to carry out a post- implementation review of a number of prominent boundary issues that have been identified since the removal of depreciation on buildings. Comment The final stage of the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP), which governs the tax policy development process in New Zealand, involves a post-implementation review of new legislation, and identification of remedial issues required for the legislation to have its intended effect. Officials will continue to consider issues associated with the removal of depreciation on buildings as and when they arise. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 153 LOCAL AUTHORITIES’ CHANGE OF ACCOUNTING BASIS Issue: Support for the transitional provisions for local authorities Submission (TaxTeam) The submission supports the introduction of the transitional provision which mitigates the effects of the local authorities’ change to an invoice basis of accounting for GST. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Bad debt write-offs Submission (Far North District Council, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Inland Revenue should alter the current policy for bad debt write-offs in relation to the eight local authorities referred to in the Goods and Services Tax (Local Authorities Accounting on Payments Basis) Order 2009. A full provision for the purpose of the bad debt recognition should be sufficient, in place of a bad debt write-off. (Far North District Council) Local authorities should be able to write off rates related to Māori freehold land when there is a history of non-payment. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Officials have concerns about changing the bad debt write-off rules for a very small group of taxpayers and the possible precedent it would create. The bad debt rules for tax purposes need a relatively high threshold for write-off to ensure that deductions can only be taken once all appropriate avenues have been explored. The issue of a local authority’s inability to write off unpaid rates as a bad debt for six years would, in our view, be better addressed through consultation with the Department of Internal Affairs, or Te Puni Kokiri who have the expertise in the areas of rating and Māori land. Officials are happy to refer the submissions to those departments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 154 AGENTS’ “OPT-OUT” PROVISION Issue: Support the provision to allow principals and agents to “opt out” of the current rules Submissions (Ernst & Young, Farmlands, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG) The proposal is welcomed. (Ernst & Young) The proposal to allow principals and agents to opt out of the agency rules in the GST Act is supported. (Farmlands) This proposal is welcomed as it is business-friendly and reflects common commercial practice in relation to agency arrangements. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) We agree with the changes to the agency rules as this will alleviate the compliance costs of the principal and agent and align the GST Act with current commercial practices. (KPMG) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Extra requirements for people who use the opt-out provisions Submissions (Ernst & Young, Chapman Tripp, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers) Use of the provision should not be restricted to registered persons. (Ernst & Young) The provision should be clarified as to determine whether there needs to be an express written agreement per supply, or whether an identification of the types or kinds of supplies subject to the provision is sufficient. The Commissioner should be able to make determinations that the provision should apply to supplies of a specified kind. (Chapman Tripp) The requirement that the principal account on an invoice basis for this supply should not be retained. It does not seem like a practical solution to a practical problem. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The principal should be allowed to claim a bad debt deduction if the agent does not pay them. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) 155 Comment Although the GST Act does not allow a principal to issue a tax invoice in relation to a supply if the agent has issued a tax invoice in relation to that supply, officials now understand that in practice, multiple invoices are commonly issued in agency situations. This is wider than the problem which prompted this amendment, namely large computer systems automatically issuing invoices when goods are sent out, and therefore technically being in breach of the one-invoice requirement. This situation could equally also arise where smaller taxpayers use agents to sell items for them. In light of submission received on this amendment, officials are of the view that some of these additional requirements could be impractical for some principals and agents. The requirement for the principal to account for the supply on an invoice basis, and the inability of the principal to claim a bad debt deduction if the customer paid the agent were included in the bill as a GST protection measure. Otherwise a GST liability could be avoided by interposing an agent into a transaction, and then having the agent disappear before meeting their GST obligation. Officials do not, however, recommend removing the amendment which limits the principal’s ability to claim a bad debt deduction. This requirement is an important protection against taxpayers creating agency relationships in order to take advantage of this section. Recommendation That the first three submissions be accepted. That the submission relating to bad debt deductions be declined. Issue: Application of the section to an “agent” Submission (KPMG, Chapman Tripp) There is currently no definition of an “agent” in the GST Act. It is uncertain whether this provision will only apply to persons acting as agents in supplying goods and services, or also to those merely acting in the capacity of a paying or collecting agent. (KPMG) The GST Act should follow the Australian GST legislation and define the role of an intermediary. (KPMG) As currently drafted, the section only applies to parties in a full agency relationship. The provision should be extended to apply to situations where an intermediary facilitates supplies to a third party on behalf of a principal. (Chapman Tripp) 156 Comment This matter was not raised during the policy development process, and would need further research and analysis before being implemented. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Purchases by agents Submission (KPMG) The section should be amended to also include any purchases by the agent to be treated in the same manner for GST purposes. Comment This matter was not raised during the policy development process, and would need further research and analysis before being implemented. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Treatment of a commission paid to an agent Submission (KPMG, Farmlands, Chapman Tripp) As currently drafted, the legislation does not refer to the treatment of a commission derived by the agent. It should be considered whether this provision should include wording to deal with the GST treatment of a commission paid to an agent. (Chapman Tripp) The consideration for the commission services should be overlooked for GST purposes, which would allow the principal to account for GST on its supply on a net of commission basis. (Farmlands) 157 Comment Officials would generally expect commission derived by a New Zealand-resident agent to be subject to GST. There is not, in our view, a sufficient case for further clarification. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Scope of the amendment Submission (Ernst & Young) Existing subsection 60(7) should be extended to allow agents to return GST in respect of services provided by non-registered non-residents. Comment This submission is outside the scope of the current proposals in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 158 PRIZE COMPETITIONS Issue: Definition of “prize competition” Submission (KPMG) The definition of “prize competition” should be amended to read “for which direct or indirect consideration is paid to the person for conducting the prize competition”. Comment Changing the wording of the amendment as suggested above would slightly widen the definition of a “prize competition”. It would mean that a competition whose organiser receives funding to run that competition from a person other than a participant could meet the definition of a prize competition. This could, for example, happen if funding for the competition was received from advertisers, or sponsors. Officials see no policy reason to deny people in this situation of the benefit of the proposed change. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 159 GST RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENTS Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers) 1. The proposed amendment is supported. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers) 2. The amendment should be accompanied by commentary that clarifies:  The Commissioner’s position on what “reasonable conditions” may be imposed. (Corporate Taxpayers Group)  What constitutes “reasonable notice” for withdrawing of an authorisation to keep records offshore. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) 3. The GST registration form for non-residents should incorporate an option to apply for approval to store records offshore. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) 4. The legislation should state that Guidelines released by the Commissioner should contain terms that are no more stringent than would be expected from a New Zealand-based server, except where those terms are needed to combat identified flight risks. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The first three submissions all raise points related to the administration and implementation of the proposed rule. Policy officials will pass the submissions onto the relevant units within Inland Revenue for their consideration. Officials consider that the NZICA submission on guidelines not being stricter than that expected of New Zealand-based server is a matter for the guidelines themselves, rather than being set down in legislation. The proposed GST rule is designed to mirror a provision that applies to income tax records, which was recently inserted into the Tax Administration Act 1994. To avoid confusion, it is important to keep the two provisions consistent to the greatest extent possible. That way, when guidance is provided for one provision, it should be equally applicable to the other. Recommendation That the NZICA submission on legislation imposing conditions on the guidelines should be declined, and that all other submissions be noted. 160 REMOVAL OF THE REMNANTS OF DEPRECIATION LOADING Clauses 22, 60 As part of Budget 2010 the general 20% depreciation loading was removed. However, for subpart DO, which deals with primary sector amortisable assets, this was not removed as a result of oversight. The bill proposes to correct this with, in general, application from 13 September 2012, the date of the announcement. Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The measure should apply from the commencement of taxpayers’ 2013–14 income year. Comment The concern is that if given advance notice, taxpayers might accelerate their expenditure in order to gain larger deductions. NZICA submits that this concern is overstated and that it would be cleaner from a compliance perspective to make this amendment on an “income year” basis. There is a risk that late balance-date farmers (and for sheep and beef farmers, typically balance at 30 June) will have a window between when this bill is reported back to the House (and therefore this amendment would become public) and their balance date to accelerate some development expenditure to attract the loading. Officials judge this risk as being immaterial and accept the compliance point. We note that because of the particular way this measure has been forecast, there are no fiscal implications. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 161 TAX CONCESSIONS FOR CERTAIN NON-RESIDENT COMPANIES Clauses 38, 57 (13) (23) and 109 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The submitter supports the reform unless affected taxpayers raise concerns. Comment As part of the policy development process, officials have consulted with affected taxpayers. No particular concerns were raised during the policy development process or at the Committee stage. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 162 TECHNICAL CHANGES: TAX TREATMENT OF PAYMENTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED TO MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT Clauses 12, 13, 102 and 103 Issue: Expiry date for the application of the Income Tax Act 2007 amendments Submissions (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Parliamentary Service) There should be no expiry date for the application of the Income Tax Act 2007 amendments. (Ernst & Young) We support the amendment. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The period of application of the amendments should be extended. (Parliamentary Service) Comment A retrospective amendment is being made to correct an anomaly that has arisen in the tax legislation following the rewrite of the fringe benefit tax provisions. The amendment will ensure that only the private element of any payments provided to MPs under the Civil List Act 1979 is taxed, as was always the intention. The expiry date for the application of these amendments needs to tie in with the commencement date for the prospective correction which is being made through the Members of Parliament (Remuneration and Services) Bill. The commencement date for the measure in that bill is currently uncertain and it is likely that the expiry date for the retrospective amendments will have to change in order to tie in. Recommendation That Inland Revenue continue to liaise with officials working on the Members of Parliament (Remuneration and Service) Bill over the appropriate date for expiry of the amendments. 163 Issue: Taxation of the value of accommodation provided to members of Parliament Submissions (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Parliamentary Service) The proposed amendments may not achieve the stated objective where accommodation is provided, as distinct from a monetary accommodation allowance. (Ernst & Young) An amendment should be made to section CE 1(1B) to clarify that only the private element of accommodation allowances or an accommodation benefit is taxable to an employee. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The anomaly which taxes the full value of accommodation provided to members of Parliament should be corrected. (Parliamentary Service) Comment The proposed amendment is a technical change to correct an anomaly that has arisen in the tax legislation. The submissions go beyond that and would make changes to the tax treatment of provided accommodation and accommodation allowances. The tax treatment of accommodation allowances and accommodation provided to employees is being considered as part of a more general review of employee allowances and other employee expenditure payments. Consultation on an officials’ paper, Reviewing the tax treatment of employee allowances and other expenditure payments, closed in February and submissions are currently being considered. That would be the appropriate arena for considering any matters relating to the taxation of the valuation of accommodation or accommodation allowances provided to members of Parliament. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 164 Issue: The taxation of the private element of services provided to members of Parliament Submission (Parliamentary Service) The legislation should be amended to allow for reasonable estimates of any private element of services provided to members of Parliament. Comment The proposed amendment would correct a further anomaly in the tax legislation affecting the fringe benefit tax treatment of services provided under the Civil List Act 1979. The administrative practice to date has been to make an apportionment of services between private and work-related services based upon a reasonable estimate. It has recently become apparent that this practice is not supported in law. The proposed amendment would allow this apportionment method to continue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 165 “ASSOCIATED PERSONS” DEFINITION Issue: Power of appointment or removal Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Section YB 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to ensure that a person who receives a power of appointment or removal of a trustee in their professional capacity (for example, a lawyer) is not associated with that trustee. Comment Section YB 11 treats a trustee of a trust and a person who has a power of appointment or of removal of that trustee as associated persons. This section is intended to supplement the trustee-settlor associated persons test in section YB 8 – that is, to treat a person who has the power to appoint or remove trustees similar to a settlor of a trust who usually retains the power. However, section YB 11 currently includes the relationship between professional advisors and their clients. This outcome is not intended as professional advisors generally do not benefit under the trust. The rule associating the settlor of a trust with its trustee also does not apply to persons acting in their professional capacity only. Officials agree with the submission that section YB 11 should be amended to ensure that a trustee is not associated with a person who holds the power of appointment or removal in their professional capacity only and who is not eligible to benefit under the trust. A person who is acting in their professional capacity would be defined as a person who is a member of an “approved organisation” defined in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The proposed remedial amendment should apply from the 2010–11 income year, which is the date when the current associated persons definition came into force. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 166 Issue: Limited partnerships and tripartite test Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Section YB 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended so that a company is not associated with another company in which it has an effective 6.25 percent interest – where a company holds 25 percent of a limited partnership which holds 25 percent of the second company. Comment Officials agree with the New Zealand Law Society that there is currently overreach of the tripartite test in section YB 14 when a limited partnership is interposed between two companies. A company that has an effective 6.25 percent interest in another company should not be associated with the second company. Officials consider that the overreach involving limited partnerships is not limited to the case raised by the submission. When a person other than a company holds 25 percent of a company and 25 percent of a limited partnership, the company and the limited partnership are associated under the tripartite test. If the limited partnership was a company, the two companies would not be associated under section YB 14 because the two companies are associated with the person under the same associated persons test. Therefore, they do not meet the different associated persons test requirement in the tripartite test (that is, the requirement that two persons have to be associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests). Officials consider the tripartite test applies more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base in such situations. This is because the different associated persons requirement in the tripartite test – designed to prevent overreach – does not work effectively if a taxpayer’s structure involves a limited partnership. In particular, a limited partner and a limited partnership are associated under a different test (section YB 12(2)) to the company-related tests in sections YB 2 and YB 3. To prevent this unintended overreach, officials recommend a generic amendment to treat a limited partnership as a company for the purposes of applying the tripartite test. The proposed remedial amendment should apply from the 2010–11 income year, which is the date when the current associated persons definition came into force. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 167 PIE REMEDIALS Issue: Changing the notified investor rate Submission (KPMG) The rules should be amended to clarify that a portfolio investment entity (PIE) can apply a change to an investor’s notified investor rate either from the first day of that year (retrospectively) or from the day the new tax rate is provided (prospectively). Comment The prescribed investor rate (PIR) is the tax rate for an investor in a PIE which the PIE uses to calculate the tax on that investor’s income. When an investor provides the PIE with an updated PIR, the PIE should have the flexibility to apply the correct PIR either from the beginning of that year/quarter/calculation period or as soon as practicable after receipt. This accommodates differences in PIEs’ systems and PIE return filing options. This amendment would clarify the legislation to be in line with current practices. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. As the change clarifies the original intent of the legislation, it should apply from 1 October 2007. This will provide certainty for transactions that have occurred during this period. Issue: Allocation of expenses to a PIE Submission (KPMG) The rules should be amended to clarify that expenses incurred in deriving income in which no investor has an interest are also not attributable. Comment A PIE is able to treat income in which no investor has a beneficial interest as relating to a separate investor class (in which the PIE is the sole investor). The net income (or loss) is then taxable at the PIE rate of 28%. The submitter proposes that the legislation be amended to make it clear that expenses relating to this unattributed income are also not attributable. 168 This is in line with current policy. When clarifying the law, however, it should also be made clear that expenses are not attributable for resident investors only and not to non- resident investors. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to the comment above and that this change apply from the 2012–2013 income year to provide certainty for transactions that have occurred in that year. Issue: Refundability of PIE tax credits Submission (BDO Wellington Limited) The rules should be amended to make it clear when PIE tax credits are refundable to investors. Comment In situations when an investor has to square up their PIE tax obligations at the end of the year, the investor gets a tax credit for the amount of tax that has already been paid on their behalf by the PIE. For most types of investors, these PIE tax credits should be refundable. However, they should be non-refundable for natural (individual) investors that are not trusts. This would ensure that these investors are not incentivised to elect PIRs that are too low for them, as this is the only instance when PIE tax is not a final tax for individuals. The submission is consistent with current policy settings. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 169 Issue: Disposal of certain shares by PIEs Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section CB 26 should be “turned off” for investors who issue dividends as long as they are received by the same investors. Comment A taxable dividend is deemed to arise to the seller of certain shares for which a dividend has been declared but not yet paid. The actual dividend is also taxable to its recipient. This is an anti-avoidance provision to ensure that the otherwise taxable dividends are not converted into a non-taxable disposal of shares. This double taxation should be removed where the seller and the recipient of the shares comprise the same investors. In practice, this can arise as a result of the restructuring. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that this change apply from the 2012–13 income year to provide certainty for transactions that occurred in that year. Issue: Management fee rebates Submission (Matter raised by officials) Management fee rebates should be included in the types of income a PIE can derive. Comment At least 90 percent of a PIE’s income must be passive income, such as dividends, interest and rent. A PIE can receive management fee rebates in situations when a retail PIE pays a wholesale PIE for the wholesale PIE’s expenses but the wholesale PIE partially refunds these fees. Particularly in periods of a market downturn, a PIE could be either in a loss situation, or its income could be reduced, so that the percentage of income from the fee rebate causes it to breach the PIE eligibility criteria. This would cause the entity to lose its PIE status. This breach of the PIE rules was not intended. 170 Fee rebates are not active income of the PIE and should be added to the types of income a PIE can earn. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that this change apply from 2012–13 income year. This would provide certainty for transactions that occurred in that year. Issue: Notification requirements Submission (Matter raised by officials) PIEs should be allowed to provide notices to their investors electronically, provided either the investor or an authorised person has consented to this. Comment Section 31C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires PIEs to provide their investors with notices setting out certain information relating to their investment. Officials recommend that the language of the section should be amended to allow these notices to be provided electronically, provided the investor or their authorised person has consented to this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Heading of a section Submission (Matter raised by officials) The heading of section DB 54 should be changed from “Treatment of credits for investment fees” to “Treatment of certain fees charged by multi-rate PIEs”. Comment The proposed heading would more accurately reflect the content of the section. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 171 EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME: TAX TREATMENT OF SURRENDERED UNITS Submission (KPMG) The provisions which deal with the tax consequences of transactions under the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) should be amended. It would be desirable for the surrender of emissions units by a post-1989 forester who wishes to leave the ETS to have the same tax treatment as the surrender of units on harvest. Comment Current income tax legislation sets out the tax consequences of the acquisition and disposal of emissions units under the emissions trading scheme. Included in those rules are specific rules which deal with foresters who elect to participate in the ETS – under which they will receive units for the capture of carbon in their growing forests, and be required to surrender units when they harvest their timber. The tax rules provide that income arises when emissions units received are sold, and a deduction arises when emissions units are surrendered. However, a forest owner who has participated in the ETS and received emissions units may choose to exit from the ETS. A forester who does this will be required to surrender to the Government a number of emissions units equivalent to the number previously received. This transaction was not envisaged when the current tax provisions were drafted. The correct outcome is that these surrenders ought to give rise to a deduction. This submission addresses a matter in legislation which does not appear in the current bill. However, officials’ view is that the requested amendment should be made promptly, so they recommend it be added to the current bill. The amendment is taxpayer-friendly, so officials recommend it take effect from 1 July 2010, the date the original legislation took effect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 172 TAXATION OF EMPLOYER-PROVIDED ACCOMMODATION/ACCOMMODATION ALLOWANCES New clause Issue: Remedial amendment – taxation of employer-provided accommodation and accommodation allowances Submissions (KPMG) There should be an urgent remedial amendment to section CE 1(1B) of the Income Tax Act 2007, to ensure that accommodation provided by an employer to an employee (or accommodation allowance) is only taxable when there is a private benefit to the employee. Where an employee is temporarily relocated to a different city or country, but incurs costs maintaining their regular home, there is no private benefit from accommodation provided by their employer in the other country or city. Comment The tax treatment of accommodation allowances and accommodation provided to employees is being considered as part of a more general review of employee allowances and other employee expenditure payments. Consultation on an officials’ paper, Reviewing the tax treatment of employee allowances and other expenditure payments, closed in February and submissions are currently being considered. That would be the appropriate arena for considering any issues relating to the taxation of accommodation or accommodation allowances provided to employees. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 173 Matters raised by officials 174 175 INTERNATIONAL TAX REMEDIAL MATTERS In 2012 new rules were introduced for taxpayers with significant (but non-controlling) shareholdings in foreign companies as part of the Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012. As taxpayers have begun to apply the new rules some minor problems have been identified through correspondence with tax practitioners. The proposed amendments are intended to correct these problems. The first two amendments are taxpayer-friendly. The third addresses a potentially problematic interpretation but is likely to be consistent with how most taxpayers would apply the rules. It is therefore recommended that all three remedial amendments apply retrospectively, to the date of the relevant reforms. Issue: Allowing taxpayers to continue to use certain foreign losses Submission (Matter raised by officials) A small number of taxpayers have losses under the branch equivalent method that they are not able to access under the new foreign investment fund (FIF) rules (as the branch equivalent method has been replaced by another method which they cannot use). A transitional rule is required to enable such losses to be used to offset future income derived from these foreign companies. Comment The problem has arisen because the Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012 replaced the branch equivalent method for calculating FIF income with the attributable FIF income method (which exempts active income earned through foreign companies). Under the branch equivalent method, if a taxpayer invests in a foreign company which made losses, the losses could be carried forward to offset income from the foreign company in future years. These losses are not extinguished by the new rules, but can only be used when the taxpayer is able to apply the new attributable FIF income method. A small number of taxpayers who were previously using the branch equivalent method are unable to use the new attributable FIF income method (as they hold a less than 10% shareholding), and so cannot effectively access their losses. The amendment seeks to address this problem. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 176 Issue: Ensuring the inter-group payment exemption is available when the Australian exemption also applies Submission (Matter raised by officials) A remedial amendment is required to allow an inter-group payment exemption to apply when the paying company would have satisfied the requirements for the inter-group payment exemption, in the absence of the exemption for companies based in Australia. Comment Under the new rules introduced by the Taxation (International Investment, and Remedial Matters) Act 2012, an exemption is provided for companies that are resident and subject to tax in Australia. Payments of interest, rent and royalties from an “active” foreign company to a related foreign company are also exempt if both of the foreign companies are located in the same country. These exemptions can disrupt each other in one case. That is, the exemption for certain payments between related companies does not work if the paying company qualifies for the Australian exemption. This is because the Australian exemption prevents the paying company from qualifying as an “active” business, even though it could qualify if the Australian exemption was ignored. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarifying that taxpayers who switch to the FDR method have FIF income in the first year that they use FDR Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment is needed to clarify that there is an opening market value in the year that a taxpayer first uses the fair dividend rate (FDR) for a FIF, if they used a different method for that FIF in the preceding year. This amendment is likely to be consistent with how most taxpayers would apply the rules. Comment The new rules removed the branch equivalent and accounting profits methods. As a result, some taxpayers will switch to the FDR method. In such cases the rules require the taxpayer to calculate an opening market value by treating their shares to be sold and reacquired “immediately after the start” of the new income year. 177 The phrasing of this sale and reacquisition provision could possibly be interpreted as meaning the person does not have an opening market value for the purpose of the FDR at the beginning of the year. If this interpretation was correct, it would be contrary to the policy intent and would mean that the taxpayer would not have FIF income in the first year that they used the FDR method (although they would still have FIF income in subsequent years). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 178 REMEDIAL AMENDMENT TO TAX EXEMPTION Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section CW 55BB of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended so that the limited tax exemption for children effectively covers children’s income that is not taxed at source. Comment As part of Budget 2012, a limited tax exemption for children replaced an out-dated tax credit for the active income of children. Section CW 55BB exempts up to $2,340 of income earned by a school child from tax if the income is not taxed at source. Income from casual domestic work that is not taxed at source may not be exempt. This is because such income is covered by the PAYE income payment definition that is used in current section CW 55BB to identify income that is not tax-exempt. It means that a child who earns income from their casual domestic work (such as babysitting or mowing lawns) does not get the benefit of the exemption. This is inconsistent with the policy of introducing the limited tax exemption. To correct this error, section CW 55BB should be amended to refer to an amount for which there is a withholding requirement by the payer under the PAYE rules. This would ensure that a child’s casual domestic work is covered by the limited exemption. The proposed change should apply from the 2012–13 tax year, which is the date when the limited tax exemption came into force. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 179 UPDATE TO CROSS-REFERENCES Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials have identified two out-of-date references in existing legislation. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Section 291 of the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 amended section 15 of the Goods and Services Tax Act, by removing the classification of registered persons into specified categories. A consequential amendment is required to remove the reference to a “category C” registered person in section 53(1)(c) of that same Act. KiwiSaver Act 2006 Section 11 of the Taxation (Canterbury Earthquake Measures) Act 2011 removed the definition of “redundancy payment” from section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. A consequential amendment is required to the term “redundancy payment” in section 4 of the KiwiSaver Act, to remove the cross-reference to the definition at section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Comment These out-dated references should be amended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.

The amendments contained in the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill (No 2), announced as part of Budget 2012, focus on improving the value of the student loan scheme and encouraging personal responsibility for loan repayments. The bill introduces measures to:  broaden the definition of “income” for student loan repayment purposes to broadly align with that used for Working for Families tax credits;  implement an information-match with the New Zealand Customs Service to identify borrowers in serious default when they enter the country; and  amend the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 to ensure the delivery of the remaining core policy changes in the 2011 Act. Broadening the definition of “income” The bill proposes to broaden the definition of “income” for student loan repayment purposes to broadly align with the definition of “income” used for determining entitlement to Working for Families tax credits. The definition of “income” for student loan repayment purposes is important in terms of meeting the policy objective of ensuring a borrower’s repayment obligation accurately reflects their ability to repay. Information-match with New Zealand Customs Service Consistent with the Government’s focus on encouraging personal responsibility for loan repayments, the bill proposes to extend the existing information match with the New Zealand Customs Service for child support to also include contact information for student loan borrowers who are in serious default when they enter or leave New Zealand. The key impediment to collecting repayments from overseas-based borrowers is a lack of contact details which prevents Inland Revenue from engaging with this group. This information-match will mean that Inland Revenue can initiate contact with a borrower to discuss their situation and outstanding arrears. System reprioritisation and technical amendments The bill includes a number of amendments needed to ensure the delivery of the remaining core policy changes enacted in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. In 2009 Cabinet agreed to a new student loan management system as part of a shift from Inland Revenue’s existing computer system. The new system provided an opportunity to make the administration of the scheme more efficient and make compliance easier. 2 New student loan policy and rules were introduced into legislation and subsequently enacted in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. Some of the key policy changes included:  providing a consolidated loan balance so borrowers could see all their loan draw-downs;  moving from an end-of-year square-up of deductions to deductions each pay period for salary and wage earners; and  changing the penalty regime, including a significant reduction in the penalty rate. Implementation of the new loan management system proved to be more complicated than expected, and would have put at risk the ability to deliver on key student loan policy changes. In May 2011 Cabinet therefore agreed that the new rules in the 2011 Act should be implemented within Inland Revenue’s current computer system. The new rules would be implemented using a phased approach, from 2012 through to 2013. Because of the complexity of the student loan system, the detailed analysis has identified that the systems design, development and testing required to implement some of the 1 April 2013 changes is significantly greater than originally expected. To ensure timely delivery of the core Government policies contained in the 2011 Act, and the policies that have the greatest benefit for borrowers, it is proposed to not proceed with some of the measures in the 2011 Act. The measures were selected on the basis that they met most or all the following criteria:  They had a minimal impact on the repayments of borrowers.  They had an impact on only a small number of borrowers.  They reduced the pressure on Inland Revenue’s student loan system changes.  They were consistent with the policy intent of previous Cabinet decisions. Four further measures are proposed not to proceed, see (“Matters raised by officials”), described in this report. The bill also includes technical remedial amendments to ensure the Act works as intended. Matters raised in submissions Ten submissions were made in relation to the bill of which only a small proportion related to matters contained in the bill. 3 Whitireia Community Law Centre supported the broadening the definition of “income”, and raised concerns about the use and privacy of borrower information received through the proposed information-sharing between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service. Other submissions also raised concerns about the use of borrowers’ information and the privacy of information received via the proposed information-sharing between Inland Revenue and New Zealand Customs Service. The Legislation Advisory Committee commented on the information-sharing provisions of the bill proceeding before the Privacy (Information Sharing) Bill is enacted and implemented, and the desirability of consulting with the Privacy Commissioner. The Legislation Advisory Committee also stated that the definition of “serious default” for the purpose of the information-sharing does not provide sufficient guidance and that more detailed criteria should be provided in the legislation. The majority of submissions referred to matters not covered by the bill, mainly previous policy changes and the student support package as a whole. The New Zealand Union of Students’ Association and other submitters called for a complete review of the student support system, including its costing methodology, the adequacy of student support assistance, and the cumulative impact of Budget 2010, 2011, and 2012 changes on students and on the country. Matters raised by officials Since the introduction of the bill, officials have identified further changes needed to ensure the remaining core policy changes can be delivered and to address an unintended consequence of the recently implemented near real-time transfer of loan advances from StudyLink to Inland Revenue. As mentioned above, the four further reprioritisation measures mentioned are:  retaining the existing loan interest calculation method of accruing daily and charging and compounding annually;  retaining the existing process of calculating loan interest for all borrowers and subsequently writing off the interest for New Zealand-based borrowers;  reverting to the previous write-off rules for obligations less than $20; and  retaining the existing way in which payments are allocated to repayment obligations and debt. In addition to these matters officials propose an amendment to correct an unintended consequence of the recently implemented near real-time transfer. 4 Before 1 January 2012, the annual loan transfer occurred in February each year. This was replaced with a near real-time transfer, which allowed StudyLink to transfer loan information to Inland Revenue daily. This near real-time transfer has had an unintended consequence, resulting in borrowers receiving end-of-year student loan assessments that would not have been issued were it not for the near real-time transfer. In effect, borrowers who had student loans for as little as two or three weeks would have assessments relating to the entirety of their previous year’s income (salary and wages, and other income such as business income). Officials consider that under the new loan-transfer process, borrowers’ repayment obligations in the first tax year of becoming a borrower should be similar to what they were under the previous annual loan-transfer process. Officials also propose to update the definition of “adjusted net income” for the student loan scheme in line with recent amendments to the definition of “family scheme income” for the Working for Families tax credit rules. These amendments relate to the exemption of withdrawals from KiwiSaver after a member has reached the date of entitlement or for early withdrawals, and also correct and rationalise cross-references for the exemption of parts of overseas pensions. Officials’ recommendations are detailed in this report, along with technical amendments and minor remedial items. 5 Matters raised in submissions 6 7 BROADENING THE DEFINITION OF “INCOME” Schedule 3, clause 9 Submission (Whitireia Community Law Centre) The submitter supports the changes to the definition of “income” for student loan purposes and is supportive of the main purpose of the bill to “improve the value of the student loan scheme and ensure that repayment obligations are determined on a fair and equitable basis for all borrowers regardless of the types of income they earn”. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 8 INFORMATION-SHARING Clauses 34 and 43 to 47 Submissions (Legislation Advisory Committee, Te Mana Akonga – National Māori Tertiary Students’ Associations, New Zealand Union of Students’ Association, Massey University Extramural Students’ Society, Lincoln University Students’ Association, Student Association of Waikato Institute of Technology, Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association, Waiariki Institute of Technology Student Association) Submitters have raised general concerns regarding the privacy of information shared between Inland Revenue and Customs. Whitireia Community Law Centre compares the proposed information-match with examples of information-sharing for the enforcing of other types of “wrongdoing” such as recovering child support debt or Ministry of Justice fines enforcement. It states that the Government does not view education as an investment, but rather views these individuals as criminals by placing restrictions on their ability to freely leave and enter New Zealand. The submitter also comments that many individuals will automatically fall within the definition of “serious default” due to having a substantial student loan on completion of their education. Te Mana Akonga, Massey University Extramural Students’ Society, Lincoln University Students’ Association, Student Association of Waikato Institute of Technology, Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association and Waiariki Institute of Technology Student Association have asked the committee to consider an investigation that will better profile the composition of the 91,000 borrowers living or travelling overseas to ensure the targeting under the information-sharing provisions of the bill are as non-prejudicial and free from discrimination as possible. Te Mana Akonga submits that an investigation would be prudent for the many Māori who now reside in Australia and the impact of proposed changes in the bill would have on them as well as the many people who left Canterbury for Australia as a result of the earthquakes. Massey University Extramural Students’ Society, Lincoln University Students’ Association, Student Association of Waikato Institute of Technology, Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association and Waiariki Institute of Technology Student Association have asked if the committee will be seeking a full briefing by officials and the Privacy Commissioner on the impact of any information-sharing proposed under the bill, and will information from that briefing be shared with all interested or affected parties. The Legislation Advisory Committee submits it is undesirable for the information- sharing provisions in this bill to proceed before the Privacy (Information Sharing) Bill is enacted and implemented. It suggests that officials should be requested to explain why this bill should proceed before the Privacy (Information Sharing) Bill is enacted and implemented. The submitter also emphasises the desirability of consulting with the Privacy Commissioner over the implementation of the information-sharing provisions in the bill. 9 Comment The proposed information-sharing is based on the existing child support alerts match used by Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs). The proposed information-sharing will:  only affect borrowers in serious default of their repayment obligations. It will not affect borrowers who simply have a large student loan;  only be used to contact borrowers, not prevent borrowers from entering or leaving New Zealand; and  be used to obtain information that the affected borrowers agreed to provide when they took out a loan (that is, contact details). Inland Revenue will send Customs the names, birthdates and IRD numbers of selected borrowers who are in serious default in relation to previously assessed repayment obligations. Customs will match this list against the names and birthdates of people upon their arrival and will transfer any contact details obtained for successful matches to Inland Revenue. The selection of cases is based on borrowers meeting the definition of serious default, no ethnic or demographic information is taken into account. This information will be used by Inland Revenue to initiate contact with the borrower to discuss their situation and outstanding arrears. Inland Revenue will not be preventing borrowers from entering or leaving New Zealand. The Privacy Commissioner has been consulted on the information-sharing provision. An Information Match Privacy Impact Assessment has been prepared by Inland Revenue in consultation with Customs and the Privacy Commissioner. The privacy assessment identifies the potential impacts on personal privacy and security of data and ways to mitigate those impacts without compromising the intent of the programme. The solution to implement the proposed changes builds on an existing data-match which has been operating effectively since 2007. In relation to the Privacy (Information Sharing) Bill, the proposed information-sharing contained in the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill (No 2) simply extends the existing information-sharing between Inland Revenue and Customs to include student loan borrowers in serious default. At the time of writing this report, the Privacy (Information Sharing) Bill is awaiting its second reading after being introduced in August 2011. Officials consider that extending the existing information-sharing to student loans should not be delayed due to the uncertainty of the timing of enactment of the Privacy (Information Sharing) Bill. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 10 DEFINITION OF “SERIOUS DEFAULT” Clauses 34 and 43 to 47 Submission (Legislation Advisory Committee) The definition of “serious default” for the purpose of information-sharing between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service provides insufficient guidance. It would be desirable to have more detailed criteria in the legislation to provide more certain limits as to who may be caught by the definition. Comment Clause 44 inserts a definition of “serious default” in section 280G of the Customs and Excise Act 1996 for the purpose of information-sharing between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service to locate borrowers who have a significant level of overdue student loan obligations when they enter or leave New Zealand. The definition of “serious default” specifies that it is the state of having an unpaid amount due and owing under the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 and satisfying criteria established in a manner to be determined by the Commissioner. The criteria determined for the definition of “serious default” will include:  the amount of default; and  the length of time in default. The definition of “serious default” will be used as a mechanism to prioritise cases and manage the workload between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service. In terms of scale, the average overseas-based borrower default amount is approximately $7,780, with over 14,000 borrowers having a default balance of over $10,000. Borrowers in default to any degree undermine the student loan scheme and place an additional burden on compliant borrowers. However, making the definition publicly available would undermine the effectiveness of the information-sharing. If the criteria were publically available, borrowers may be able to circumvent the information-sharing process and avoid identification. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 11 STUDENT SUPPORT SYSTEM AND VALUATION OF THE STUDENT LOAN SCHEME Submissions (New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations, Massey University Extramural Students’ Society, Lincoln University Students’ Association, Student Association of Waikato Institute of Technology, Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association, Waiariki Institute of Technology Student Association) The submitters have called for an overall review of the student support system, including the adequacy of student support assistance, and the cumulative impact of Budget 2010, 2011 and 2012 changes on students and on the country. The New Zealand Union of Students’ Association submitted that the Government overstated the cost of lending and that the “true” cost of lending is around about 8 cents in the dollar for the average graduate. It argues:  The Crown’s discount rate is too high and this overstates the cost (it suggested a discount rate of 3.5% is more appropriate for new lending).  The cost of lending, that is the initial fair value write-down, neglects the positive impact of the interest unwind (the partial reversal of the loss in value that occurs as repayments are received); that is, the Crown books the cost of the policy changes at its upfront value and does not account for the positive financial flow from the interest unwind. This submitter also states it believes further changes in relation to the collection of student loans from overseas-based borrowers may keep people overseas because of what they see as a “pernicious loans scheme”. Additionally, the submitter believes that policy formation for tertiary education is often hampered by the limitation of current data and that the bill cannot be viewed solely as a technical bill in isolation from the changes made over the preceding years. Massey University Extramural Students’ Society, Lincoln University Students’ Association, Student Association of Waikato Institute of Technology, Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association and Waiariki Institute of Technology Student Association have asked the committee “if it is a reasonable expectation for new graduates to have the opportunity to gain employment as part the social contract they enter into given the indebtedness that is created by the student loan scheme”. Comment The submissions refer to matters that are not part of the bill and are therefore outside the scope for consideration. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 12 CONSIDERATION OF PREVIOUS STUDENT SUPPORT CHANGES Submissions (Te Mana Akonga – National Māori Tertiary Students’ Association, New Zealand Union of Students’ Association, New Zealand Medical Students’ Association, Whitireia Community Law Centre, Massey University Extramural Students’ Society, Lincoln University Students’ Association, Student Association of Waikato Institute of Technology, Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association, Waiariki Institute of Technology Student Association) The submitters have asked that the committee consider the cumulative and flow-on effects of successive changes to the student loan scheme and student support over the years, including but not limited to:  the withdrawal of eligibility of the student allowance from postgraduate students (except for those studying for Bachelor degrees with honours);  increasing the student loan repayment rate from 10% to 12%;  excluding from access to the student loan scheme those aged 55 year or more;  reducing the repayment holiday to one year and requiring overseas-based borrowers to apply for the repayment holiday;  freezing the student allowance parental income threshold without CPI adjustment until 31 March 2016; and  removing the payment incentive following the repeal of the excess repayment bonus. The New Zealand Medical Students’ Association states the bill does not meet its stated objective “to improve the value of the student loan scheme” for New Zealand’s medical students and the New Zealand health system. It does not meet this objective for New Zealand’s medical students and the New Zealand health system because it does not address the inefficient and inequitable impact of the seven-year equivalent full-time student (EFTS) cap on access to the student loan scheme on medical graduate retention and vocational choice, and New Zealand. The submitter has therefore asked that the committee consider introducing in this bill either an exemption or an extension to the cap for medical students. Te Mana Akonga has asked that the committee consider in particular the effects of the changes on Māori. Te Mana Akonga also comments that the reduction of the repayment holiday would have a great effect on those who have moved overseas to find work as a result of the Canterbury earthquakes. 13 Whitireia Community Law Centre submits that the three-year repayment holiday should be reinstated as it would provide graduates with some “room to breathe, establish themselves in a career and firmly stand on their own feet”. The submitter also states that many individuals tend to leave New Zealand for their “OE” which is part of the New Zealand culture and are away for two to three years obtaining valuable skills and experience which will have a positive gain for New Zealand and imposing penalties while overseas will only deter individuals from returning. Massey University Extramural Students’ Society, Lincoln University Students’ Association, Student Association of Waikato Institute of Technology, Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association and Waiariki Institute of Technology Student Association have asked the committee if it will be forming a view on whether the recent reduction of the repayment holiday is “instilling greater fairness and accountability”. They also ask that, as a period free from repayments is an automatic feature of the equivalent student loan scheme in the United Kingdom, should the committee investigate treating all borrowers the same way. Comment The submissions refer to matters that are not part of the bill and are therefore outside the scope for consideration. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 14 STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENTS AND SOCIAL ASSISTANCE Submissions (New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations, Massey University Extramural Students’ Society, Lincoln University Students’ Association, Student Association of Waikato Institute of Technology, Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association, Waiariki Institute of Technology Student Association) Student Loan repayments should be considered a reduction in income for calculating eligibility for social assistance (for example, Working for Families tax credits, income-tested benefits). In particular submitters ask if the committee will be addressing the situation of Working for Families tax credits being calculated based on income before student loan repayments are taken into account. Submitters also ask the committee if it is correct to state that the student loan collection system “works as a tax”. Comment The submissions refer to matters that are not part of the bill and therefore are outside the scope for consideration. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 15 LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND COMMUNICATION OF CHANGES Submission (New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) Many student support changes receive insufficient public and Parliamentary scrutiny as they are authorised outside the legislative process (that is, through Budget or Cabinet decision, loan contracts, and regulations). Those types of changes should also go through the public oversight provided by the Select Committee. The submitter also raises issues relating to time lags between Budget announcements and steps to respond to students’ questions. The submitter has raised those issues with StudyLink. Comment The submission refers to matters that are not part of the bill and therefore are outside the scope for consideration. However, officials note that changes announced as part of Budget are communicated to students, borrowers and other stakeholders through a range of mechanism, such as:  information available on departments’ websites immediately following Budget announcements;  emails to affected students alerting them to the changes;  fact sheets detailing the changes sent to student associations and education providers; and  stakeholder meetings in main centres. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 16 REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT Submissions (Te Mana Akonga – National Māori Students’ Association, New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) The submitters comment on the Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) on the bill. Te Mana Akonga submits that the RIS is devoid of any comments on the impact of the proposed changes on Māori and as Māori are not only stakeholders but also Treaty partners, the submitter believes this is an oversight of the RIS and would like more information on this. The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations comment that they found the RIS deficient, especially in terms of the analysis applied to affected borrowers, impacts on the investment in tertiary education as a whole, and the context of the Tertiary Education Strategy. Comment The information presented in the RIS is limited by the data collected by agencies. For example, Inland Revenue does not collect income data broken down by ethnicity or other demographic factors. However, the proposed changes are not thought to have a differential effect on ethnic or other demographic groups of borrowers. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 17 Matters raised by officials 18 19 REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR FIRST-TIME BORROWERS Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials recommend that the bill amend the end-of-year assessment legislation to provide that when a person becomes a new borrower after 31 December in a tax year, they are not subject to the end-of-year assessment for that tax year. This corrects an unintended consequence of the change from an annual loan transfer to a near real-time transfer of loan advances from the loan manager (StudyLink) to Inland Revenue, Repayment deductions from the salary or wages of borrowers should continue to be made from the date that borrowers first draw down a loan. The amendment should apply from 1 April 2012 for the 2013 and future tax years. Officials also recommend including the relief provided through the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 (Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2012 in the current bill. Comment The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 changed the law relating to when and how student loan information is transferred from StudyLink to Inland Revenue. Previously, borrowers’ loan balances only transferred to Inland Revenue annually in February. This transfer included all of the loan advances relating to courses of study that had finished in the previous calendar year. For example, a borrower who took out a loan in February 2011 to cover their fees, and then received living costs payments throughout the 2011 year, would have all of this lending information transferred to Inland Revenue in February 2012. From 1 January 2012 Inland Revenue has received information about every loan advance in near real-time. A borrower who took out a loan in February 2012 to cover their fees would have that loan transferred to Inland Revenue immediately. This near real-time transfer of information between agencies gives borrowers a single view of their consolidated loan balance, rather than having amounts held by both agencies. However this earlier transfer has had the unintended consequence that new borrowers’ repayment obligations will be calculated on the borrower’s income for the entire tax year, even when they have had the loan for a short time. Officials consider that under the new loan transfer process, borrowers’ repayment obligations in the first tax year of becoming a borrower should be similar to what they were under the previous annual loan-transfer process. Under the annual loan transfer process, a person who became a new borrower after 31 December in a tax year would not have an end-of-year assessment for that tax year. New borrowers were still required to have repayment deductions from their salary and wages earned after they become a borrower. 20 The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 (Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2012 provided relief from repayment obligations for borrowers affected by this situation for the 2012 tax year. The regulation will expire on 1 April 2015. However, the relief provided under the regulations should continue to be available after 1 April 2015 if necessary in relation to assessments for the 2012 tax year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 21 DEFINITION OF “ADJUSTED NET INCOME” Clause 66 and schedule 3 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Recent clarifications to the definition of “family scheme income” under the Working for Families tax credit rules were not reflected in the proposed changes to the definition of “adjusted net income” for student loan purposes. Officials recommend that these amendments to the definition of “family scheme income” also apply to the definition of “adjusted net income” for calculating student loan repayment obligations. The amendments should apply from 1 April 2014 for the 2014–15 and later tax years. Comment The changes to the definition of “adjusted net income” in the bill are broadly aligned with the definition of “income” used for determining entitlement to Working for Families tax credits. Therefore it is appropriate that amendments made to the definition of “family scheme income” are reflected in the definition of “adjusted net income” for student loan purposes in the bill. The definition of “family scheme income” has recently been amended by the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Act 2012. The amendment ensures that a withdrawal made from KiwiSaver after a member has reached the date of entitlement to withdraw is not regarded as family scheme income. The amendment also ensures that early withdrawals made from KiwiSaver for a first home purchase, significant financial hardship or serious illness are also disregarded. The amendment also applies to withdrawals from complying superannuation funds. The Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill also corrects and rationalises cross-references for the exemption of parts of overseas pensions for which the definition of family scheme income refers to. These exemptions are still relevant but their interaction with other legislation is complex and it is proposed that these are simplified. As a result, minor technical amendments to the definition of “adjusted net income” for student loan purposes are required to ensure the cross-references are correct. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 22 SYSTEM REPRIORITISATION MEASURES To ensure the delivery of the core policy changes in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, officials recommend the following changes. Issue: Retain the existing loan interest calculation method Submission As the student loan scheme will continue to be administered in Inland Revenue’s existing computer system, loan interest should continue to be accrued daily and charged and compounded annually. Therefore the changes due to come into force from 1 April 2013 should be repealed. Borrowers will see no change from the current practice. The 2011 Act introduces changes from 1 April 2013 under which loan interest will be calculated daily and charged and compounded monthly. These changes were based on officials’ expectations of how a loan management system would impose loan interest, and more closely resembles treatment of a commercial loan. The amendment should apply from 1 April 2013. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Retain the existing interest-free loan process Submission As the student loan scheme will continue to be administered in Inland Revenue’s existing computer system, the current application of the interest-free loan policy by calculating interest on the loans of all borrowers and applying the interest-free write- off to the loans of New Zealand-based borrowers should continue. Therefore the changes due to come into force from 1 April 2013 should be repealed. Retaining the current regime does not financially affect borrowers, as they will continue to be charged interest if they are overseas-based and will continue to have an interest-free loan if they are New Zealand-based. Since the introduction of the student loan scheme, interest has been calculated for all borrowers. Since 2006 the interest-free policy has been implemented by charging interest to all borrowers and writing off interest for New Zealand-based borrowers. 23 In anticipation of the move to a new loan management system, the 2011 Act introduced a change from 1 April 2013 under which interest would not be calculated for New Zealand-based borrowers at all. The amendment should apply from 1 April 2013. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Re-instate the under $20 obligation write-off Submission As the student loan scheme will continue to be administered in Inland Revenue’s existing computer system, the discretion to write off small obligation amounts of less than $20 should continue. Borrowers will see no change from the current practice. Under the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992, repayment obligations under $20 were not collected and were written off. For example, if a borrower had a repayment obligation of $1,000 for the tax year but Inland Revenue received only $983 during the year, the $17 was written off the loan, rather than remaining to be collected in the future. When the loan scheme was proposed to be administered in a new loan management system, the provision regarding not collecting small amounts was revised when included in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. Under the 2011 Act, small amounts are not written off and remain part of a borrower’s loan balance. These amounts would be collected through future repayment obligations. The amendment to reinstate the $20 obligation write-off should apply from 1 April 2012 for the 2012–13 and later tax years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 24 Issue: Payment allocation Submission As the student loan scheme will continue to be administered in Inland Revenue’s existing computer system, the existing payment-priority rules should apply. Therefore the new payment-allocation rules due to come into force from 1 April 2013 should be repealed. Borrowers will see no change from the current practice. The current payment-priority provision offsets payments and deductions first against any interest charged, and then any remainder is used for any principal outstanding. From 1 April 2013 the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 introduces new payment- allocation rules based on officials’ expectations of the new loan management system. The amendment should apply from 1 April 2013. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 25 TECHNICAL ISSUES The following matters are proposed by officials to address technical issues that arose during the detailed analysis and design process to implement the changes in the student loan scheme legislation. Issue: Notification of student loan shortfall penalty Submission Officials recommend that the notification of a student loan shortfall be considered separate from the notification of the student loan shortfall penalty. The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 requires Inland Revenue to notify a borrower of a student loan shortfall penalty, including details of the shortfall in the borrower repayment obligation. This requirement was based on the earlier proposal to move the administration of the loan scheme into a new loan management system. As the administration of the loan scheme will remain in Inland Revenue’s FIRST system, the implementation of the new student loan shortfall penalty will need to follow the tax rules. This means notifying borrowers separately of their student loan shortfall and shortfall penalty. The amendment should apply from the day after Royal assent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Calculation of loan interest during a leap year Submission Leap years are currently not accounted for in the calculation of loan interest. Officials consider it appropriate that for the purposes of calculating loan interest in a leap year, the additional day is taken into account. We therefore recommend that the legislation be amended. The amendment should apply from the day after Royal assent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 26 Issue: Definition of “due date” for unpaid instalments of overseas-based obligations Submission There is a minor technical error in the current definition of “due date” in relation to an overseas-based instalment default. The definition incorrectly refers to “the dates determined” whereas it should refer to “the final date determined”. The amendment should apply from the day after Royal assent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Relief from penalties Submission The student loan penalties in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 (late filing penalty and student loan shortfall penalty) are modelled on penalties imposed for income tax. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue can grant taxpayers relief from penalties imposed under the income tax rules, however there is currently no such relief provided for penalties imposed for student loan purposes. Officials consider that as relief from penalties is provided under the income tax rules, similar relief should be provided for student loan penalties. The ability to provide relief from penalties should also apply to the under-estimation penalty that is reintroduced by the bill. As relief from this penalty was provided under the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992, the 2011 Act should reflect this for consistency. The amendment should apply from 1 April 2013. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 27 Issue: Calculation of excess repayments from 1 April 2013 Submission The definition of “excess repayment” should be amended to include any payments and voluntary borrower deductions received and applied to a tax year regardless of when the payments were received. The current definition of “excess repayment” is used to determine borrowers’ excess repayment bonus and any amount overpaid for a tax year that may be refunded. The calculation of an excess repayment is currently limited to payments and deductions made up to either the end of the tax year or the final interim payment or overseas-based instalment due date for a tax year, which can be due after the end of the tax year. Because of the repeal of the excess repayment bonus from 1 April 2013, this limitation is no longer required. Additionally, borrowers may pay an amount after the final interim payment or overseas-based instalment due date for a tax year that exceeds their repayment obligation or penalties for that tax year and these amounts should be considered excess repayments. The amendment should apply from 1 April 2013 for the 2013–14 and later tax years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Limiting repayment obligation and interim payments by excluding amounts due in future Submission The amount a borrower is required to repay, which is limited to the amount of the loan balance, should also exclude any amounts already assessed or required to be paid with a due date in the future. There are situations when the amount a borrower is required to pay for a tax year is limited to the loan balance, but the borrower also has an amount owing for a previous tax year due in the future. As the amount owing for the previous tax year is not overdue it is still part of the loan balance. This means that a borrower’s repayment obligation will include an amount that is already required to be paid in the future and the borrower would be billed twice for that amount. This is not the correct outcome. The amendment should apply from 1 April 2012 for the 2012–13 and later tax years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 28 Issue: Providing assessments in certain situations Submission The bill currently limits notifying a borrower of their end-of-year repayment obligation to those borrowers who exceed the $1,500 adjusted net income thresholds. Due to an oversight, this precludes notifying a borrower that they have no end-of-year repayment obligation. This can occur when a borrower is initially required to make payments for the tax year but upon confirmation of their actual income for the tax year, it exceeds the $1,500 threshold. Officials recommend that these oversights are corrected and that borrowers in these situations are notified they have no end-of-year repayment obligation. The amendment should apply from 1 April 2012 for the 2012–13 and later tax years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Cross-referencing and other minor issues Submission A number of cross-references in the bill either need updating or have been omitted, and minor wording changes are needed to ensure consistency throughout the bill and to give effect to the original intent. These changes will not change the policy intent and officials propose these changes be made. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.

The bill introduces two major changes:  Proposals to enable Inland Revenue to request an arrest warrant for borrowers who persistently default on their student loan obligations and attempt to leave the country. This power will send a strong signal to borrowers that non- compliance is unacceptable and create a strong sanction for persistent defaulters.  Amendments to speed up repayments from compliant overseas-based borrowers. It achieves this through fixed repayment obligations for overseas- based borrowers and by adding two new thresholds to the overseas-based borrower repayment rules. Matters raised in submissions Five submissions were made on the bill. Four of the submitters objected to the arrest at border provision. As reasons for opposing the provision, submitters generally cited the severity of the power, saying that it would reduce the incentives for borrowers to return to New Zealand and how resources could be better used. The New Zealand Law Society submission proposed technical amendments to the arrest at border provision but made no comment on the provision generally. The National Council of Women said there should be a gender impact analysis of the proposed amendments. It also raised privacy concerns with clause 11 of the bill relating to sharing contact information, saying that sharing information about borrowers not in default is undeserved. The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) submitted that the overseas-based borrower repayment rules should be income-based. It also submitted that there should be broader powers for Inland Revenue to write off interest and that provisions relating to a borrower’s contact person should be tightened to avoid harassment. Three submissions referred to matters not covered by the bill, mainly about the valuation of the student loan scheme, parental responsibility for tertiary education and the student support package as a whole. 2 Matters raised by officials The bill contains clauses that align the definition of “income” for student loans with that used for Working for Families. Recent tax bills have proposed changes to the definition of “income” for Working for Families. To provide consistency in the definition for social policy purposes, officials recommend amending the bill to align the definition of “income” in student loans with changes proposed for Working for Families. Since introduction of the bill, officials have identified a small error in the drafting of the definition of “relevant loan balance” in clause 6 of the bill that would result in the provision not working as intended. Officials propose that an amendment be made to correct this error. Matters raised by the Finance and Expenditure Committee Clause 162B(2D) of the bill sets out that the courts may make “any other order the court thinks fit” in relation to an arrested student loan borrower. The Committee submitted that the provision had wide scope and that there was a lack of clarity around what orders could potentially be made. As a result, officials propose this order be replaced with two provisions allowing the court to make orders that the borrower provide information or enter a payment arrangement with Inland Revenue. The Committee also asked officials for the specific criteria that would be used by Inland Revenue to request an arrest warrant for a borrower in default. 3 Matters raised in submissions 4 5 ARREST AT BORDER Issue: Arrest of liable person Submissions (National Council of Women, Kevin Broughan, Tim Lamusse, NZUSA) Submitters opposed the arrest at border provision and submitted that it be removed from the bill. Concerns raised by these submitters were that the arrest at border provision was overly punitive, would criminalise poor students and reduce the incentive for overseas-based borrowers to return to New Zealand. They also believed that resources should be directed towards positive measures to ensure compliance and reduce financial hardship for students rather than punishing those who do not comply. Comment The arrest at border power is a targeted measure aimed at borrowers who consistently refuse to meet their responsibility to repay their loans despite having the ability to do so. The overwhelming majority of borrowers do the right thing and take their repayments seriously. However, there remains a small group of borrowers who consistently renege on their loan repayments. This lack of personal responsibility is unfair to borrowers who do honour their repayment obligations. The arrest at border provision will send a clear message to all borrowers that non- compliance with their responsibilities is unacceptable and send a strong sanction for persistent defaulters. If a borrower in default is concerned that they may face arrest, they should contact Inland Revenue to discuss their situation. The power is targeted towards borrowers who have the ability to pay their loans but refuse to do so. Before an arrest warrant is requested borrowers will be given multiple opportunities to discuss their situation. If a borrower genuinely cannot afford to repay, hardship relief is available for that borrower. Before a borrower would receive a criminal record they would need to be charged and convicted of the offence. If convicted the offence is a comparatively minor one. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 6 Issue: Paying amount in default Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Section 162A(1) provides that : Every person commits an offence who is in default of his or her overseas-based repayment obligation and who, having been notified by the Commissioner that he or she is in default, knowingly fails, or refuses, to make reasonable efforts to pay the amount in default or to make arrangements with the Inland Revenue Department to pay the amount in default by the due date specified in the notification. On a literal reading of this section a borrower could commit an offence if they have not paid the amount in default by the due date, even if they have entered an arrangement to pay the amount in default. This is because the phrase “make arrangements with Inland Revenue to pay the amount in default by the due date” could be read as requiring payment of the full amount in default by the due date. The New Zealand Law Society recommends this section be amended to remove the ambiguity. Comment The situation outlined by the New Zealand Law Society where a borrower who had entered an instalment arrangement but had still committed an offence would be unintentional. If a borrower does not pay the full amount in default by the due date but has entered an arrangement to pay, the section should not apply. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Notification of default Submission (New Zealand Law Society) A component of the definition of the offence is that the person in default has been “notified” by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. “Notified” has the meaning ascribed to it by section 211 of the Student Loan Scheme Act. This section does not require communication to have been actually received by the borrower. The New Zealand Law Society submits that, notification should be required to be provided to an address provided by the borrower, at the time of borrowing or later, as the address at which communications about the loan may be addressed. 7 Comment The offence definition in section 162A of the bill requires that a borrower “knowingly fails, or refuses, to make reasonable efforts to pay the amount in default or to make arrangements with the Inland Revenue Department to pay the amount in default”. To prove that a borrower has knowingly defaulted, Inland Revenue will be required to demonstrate that the borrower has received notification that they are in default. As a result, we consider the proposed amendment would be unnecessary. The New Zealand Law Society also submitted that it should be required that notification be to the borrower’s address. Inland Revenue communicates with borrowers by more means than just through direct mail and sometimes due to not having their address but having other contact details. Officials are of the view that to require notification by mail would unnecessarily limit the different ways Inland Revenue could contact borrowers (for example, by e-mail or telephone). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Timing of discharge of order Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Section 162B(5) of the bill makes it an offence for a person to breach the court orders provided in section 162B(2)(b) or (c). As it currently stands, section 162B(5) will apply to a person subject to an order under subsection 162B(2)(b) or (c) who has paid the entire sum due, but has not yet obtained discharge of the order. For example, a person who pays the entire sum due on a Friday intending to have their lawyer seek a discharge on the Monday would commit an offence by leaving New Zealand over the weekend. Imprisonment would not be justified in this situation. An amendment is recommended, to make it clear that the offence is not committed if the person has not had an order discharged but has paid the entire amount in default before leaving New Zealand. Comment Borrowers who leave the country having paid the amount in default but not having discharged the court order are in breach of a court order. However, given that they have repaid the loan, their behaviour is not culpable enough to justify having the offence outlined in subsection (5) apply to them. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 8 Issue: Returning surrendered documents Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Section 162B(6) should also provide that when an order under section 162B(2)(C) is discharged, any travel documents which have been surrendered to the court should be returned. Comment When a court discharges an order that required a surrender of documents, the court will ordinarily return the documents that have been surrendered. The proposed amendment would clarify this position. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Arrest at border criteria Submission (New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) NZUSA was concerned that Inland Revenue has not made public the criteria for requesting an arrest warrant. Comment This submission was also made by the Finance and Expenditure Committee and is addressed later in this report. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 9 REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF OVERSEAS-BASED BORROWERS Issue: Gender impact of changes Submission (National Council of Women of New Zealand) A gender impact analysis would be useful as gender pay equity gap affects women’s ability to repay loans. It would be useful to consider the gender impact of the proposed amendments to the repayment obligations for overseas-based borrowers. Comment Analysis of the impact of repayment rates is limited by the data collected by agencies. Inland Revenue does not hold information about the income of overseas-based borrowers and therefore does not collect income data broken down by gender, age or ethnicity for overseas-based borrowers. As a result, Inland Revenue is limited in its ability to do a gender impact analysis. Hardship relief is available for those borrowers who cannot afford to pay. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Move to income-based repayment regime Submission (New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) The repayment obligations for overseas-based borrowers should be income-contingent. For many overseas-based borrowers the repayment obligation is out of proportion with their current earning capacity. Repayment obligations are the same for all overseas- based borrowers without regard to individual income and circumstances. Comment An income-contingent repayment regime is only possible if Inland Revenue knows the income of overseas-based borrowers. Inland Revenue does not have a reliable means of obtaining the income information of overseas-based borrowers. As a result, the repayment obligations of overseas-based borrowers are based on the borrower’s loan balance rather than income, with hardship available for borrowers who cannot afford to pay. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 10 SHARING A BORROWER’S CONTACT DETAILS Issue: Protecting privacy of individuals Submission (National Council of Women of New Zealand) The stated goal of the bill is to target the small group of overseas-based borrowers who continue to ignore their responsibilities. We see no reason that information on all borrowers should be shared and this is an undeserved breach of the privacy of compliant borrowers. Comment Obtaining accurate contact details is crucial for increasing the compliance of overseas-based borrowers. For borrowers who are not in default, obtaining accurate contact details will help Inland Revenue to prevent these borrowers from falling into default. With accurate contact details, Inland Revenue can educate borrowers about their obligations and put early interventions in place. Borrowers have an obligation under section 193C of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 to keep up-to-date contact details. Borrowers are also made aware of this obligation in the student loan contract. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner was consulted for the information-sharing agreement with the Department of Internal Affairs and for the proposed amendment in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Contact person assistance Submission (New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) The requirements of the overseas-based borrower’s “contact person” could lead to harassment of the contact person. Section 193A of the Act (Contact person may be requested to assist) should be amended to require that the contact person be advised that they are not required to assist and that they may say they are unwilling to act as the borrower’s contact person. 11 Comment A borrower may nominate a person for Inland Revenue to contact in order to obtain the borrower’s address details. Section 193A(4) requires that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue not request assistance from the contact person unless the contact person first confirms that they are willing to act as the borrower’s contact person. This section addresses NZUSA’s concerns. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 12 LATE PAYMENT INTEREST AND AMNESTY Issue: Reduced late payment interest when under an instalment arrangement Submission (New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) Late payment interest should be reduced when a borrower enters into a voluntary arrangement with Inland Revenue for clearing their outstanding obligations. Comment Section 141 of the Student Loan Scheme Act provides reduced late payment interest for borrowers who comply with an instalment arrangement. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Discretion to write off interest Submission (New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) Inland Revenue should have the capacity to write off all interest that occurred before the introduction of the interest-free scheme as well as all penalties and fines accumulated for borrowers who comply with an instalment arrangement. A one-off amnesty using this discretion would have great impact. Comment The submission refers to matters that are not part of the bill and are therefore outside the scope for consideration. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 13 GENERAL STUDENT LOAN SCHEME MATTERS Issue: Student support Submissions (Kevin Broughan, Tim Lamusse, New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) Submissions stated concerns with the student support system, including the partial funding of tertiary education by students, inter-generational fairness, the funding of universities and the effect of previous budget changes. The Student Loan Scheme should instead be referred to as a system of grants and targeted taxation. (New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) Comment The submissions refer to matters that are not part of the bill and are therefore outside the scope for consideration. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Valuation of the student loan scheme Submissions (Kevin Broughan, New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) There should be a different approach to the valuation of the student loan scheme. (Kevin Broughan, New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) The cost of lending, that is the initial fair value write-down, neglects the positive impact of the interest unwind (the partial reversal of the loss in value that occurs as repayments are received); that is, the Crown books the cost of the policy changes at its upfront value and does not account for the positive financial flow from the interest unwind. (New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) The cost of lending should be regarded, not as something to motivate punishment but as a dollar badly placed. (Kevin Broughan) 14 Comment The submissions refer to matters that are not part of the bill and are therefore outside the scope for consideration. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Parental responsibility for repayment Submission (Kevin Broughan) Parents should have a greater explicit responsibility for their children’s tertiary education. The expectation should be that parents should save for their children’s tertiary education and be required to guarantee their children’s student loan. Comment The submission refers to matters that are not part of the bill and are therefore outside the scope for consideration. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Remedial amendments Submission (New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) The current practice of changing the student loan scheme on a piecemeal and annual basis is bound to lead to problems. (Clauses 2, 4 and 5) Comment Remedial amendments are sometimes needed to ensure the student loan legislation works as intended. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 15 Matters raised by officials 16 17 DEFINITION OF “RELEVANT LOAN BALANCE” Issue: Calculation of relevant loan balances Submission (Matter raised by officials) Clause 6 of the bill sets fixed repayment obligations for overseas-based borrowers so that their repayment obligation does not decrease as their loan balance decreases. Due to an oversight, the definition of “relevant loan balance” does not work as intended. To correct this problem, officials recommend amending the definition of “relevant loan balance” so that it only applies to loan balances before the date that the repayment obligation is assessed. Comment The proposed amendment would correct the calculation of a borrower’s relevant loan balance for the purpose of assessing an overseas-based borrower’s repayment obligation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 18 DEFINITION OF “INCOME” Issue: Further amendments to “adjusted net income” Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill includes an amendment to the definition of “income” for student loan repayment purposes to align it with that used for Working for Families. Further simplifications to the definition of “family scheme income” under the Working for Families tax credit rules have been proposed as part of the Committee’s consideration of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Officials recommend that, if the Committee accepts the proposed amendments to the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill, these amendments are also made to the definition of “adjusted net income” for student loan repayment purposes. The definition of “income” used for student loan repayment purposes ensures there is consistency across all social policy initiatives to improve the integrity of the social assistance system. The amendments should apply from 1 April 2014 for the 2014–15 and later tax years. Comment The definition of “adjusted net income” for student loan purposes is largely based on the definition used for Working for Families tax credits. The amendment proposed in this bill aligns the definition of “income” for student loans with proposed changes for the definition of income for “Working for Families”. A submission made on The Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill suggested that Working for Families tax credit legislation could be made simpler and more coherent. If the Committee accepts the proposed amendments to the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill, officials recommend that these simplification measures also be made to the definition of “income” for student loan repayment purposes. The proposed amendments ensure the wording and formulas used in the calculation of a borrower’s interest in a company are consistent with the wording and formulas used to calculate a borrower’s interest in a trust and trust-owned companies. In particular, the amendments provide that:  The method to determine a person’s interest in a company is based on the voting interest being held by the major shareholder, rather than the proportion of total shares they earn (consistent with the method used to determine a borrower’s interest in a trust and trust-owned company).  The dates that these interests are measured is calculated on the last day of the income year. 19  The references to “market value interests if there is a market value circumstance” are removed, as they seldom occur.  Ensure formulas that determine income from companies, and trusts or trust- owned companies are aligned. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: “Adjusted net income” to include income from employment benefits Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013 included an amendment to require employees who receive certain non-cash benefits to include them in their family scheme income calculations. The availability of an employer-provided motor vehicle is included as income for Working for Families purposes if it is part of an explicit salary trade-off. That is, if the employee would be entitled to a greater amount of employment income if they chose not to receive the non-cash benefit. An employee who receives short-term charge facilities will also be required to include these if the value of benefits received in a year is more than the specified threshold. Officials recommend that this amendment to the definition of family scheme income also apply to the definition of “adjusted net income” for calculating student loan repayment obligations. The amendment should apply from 1 April 2014 for the 2014–15 and later tax years. Comment The definition of “adjusted net income” for student loan purposes is largely based on and aligned with, the definition of “income” used for determining entitlement to Working for Families tax credits. This ensures that a borrower’s repayment obligation accurately reflects their ability to pay. When a non-cash benefit is provided as a substitute for salary or wages, if it is not included in “adjusted net income” in the same way salary or wages would be, inequity arises. Including these types of benefits in the definition of “adjusted net income” ensures greater fairness. If an employee who is a student loan borrower receives a motor vehicle from their employer, and the employee would be entitled to a greater amount of employment income if they chose not to receive the non-cash benefit, that benefit will be included in the calculation of “adjusted net income”, regardless of its value. The amount which the employee would be required to report would be the amount by which their employment income would be greater in the absence of the above benefit. 20 Employees who are student loan borrowers will also be required to include short-term charge facilities they have received in “adjusted net income” in certain situations. This will only be when the value of the benefit provided under short-term charge facilities provided in an income year (not including the fringe benefit tax payable on the benefits) is more than the lesser of 5 percent of the employee’s salary or wages for the tax year, or $1,200. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 21 Matters raised by FEC 22 23 ANY OTHER ORDER THE COURT THINKS FIT Submission (Matter raised by the Committee) Clause 8 of the bill inserts section 162B(2) which allows the court to make a range of orders when a liable person is brought before the court. Section 162B(2)(d) includes that the court may make “any other order the court thinks fit”. The Committee raised concerns about the scope of this provision and the lack of clarity around what orders could potentially be made. Comment Section 162B(2)(d) was intended to give the court discretion to deal with situations that the other orders in the bill may not adequately address and to deal with unforeseen circumstances. The main two orders that we foresee being made under this provision are:  An order that the borrower provide information to the court. This information could include the borrower’s contact details, assets, income or employment status.  An order that the borrower pays Inland Revenue the amount in default or enters an arrangement with Inland Revenue to pay the amount in default. To address the Committee’s concerns around the scope of the provision, officials propose to remove clause 162B(2)(d) from the bill and replace it with two additional clauses describing the situations outlined above. This would make it clear what orders the court can make. Recommendation That the clause be removed and replaced with two additional clauses as set out above. 24 ARREST AT BORDER CRITERIA Submission (Matter raised by the Committee) The court must be satisfied that the borrower meets the criteria set out in section 162B of the bill before the court may grant an arrest warrant. The criteria in section 162B are that:  the borrower is in default of their overseas-based repayment obligation;  after being notified that they are in default, the borrower knowingly fails, or refuses, to make reasonable efforts to pay, or enter an arrangement to pay; and  the borrower is about to leave New Zealand. The Committee raised concerns that Inland Revenue had too much discretion in the decision of which borrowers are identified for an arrest warrant to be applied. It wanted to know about the specific criteria Inland Revenue would use to determine which borrowers would be selected. Comment If a borrower has any amount of default on their student loan, they face the risk of an arrest warrant being sought if they do not contact Inland Revenue to address their overdue repayments. If borrowers in default are concerned that they may face arrest, they should contact Inland Revenue to discuss their situation. In practice, Inland Revenue would not request a warrant for all loan defaulters. Inland Revenue would balance the costs of applying for an arrest warrant against the benefits of additional compliance. The worst offenders would be targeted when deciding who to request an arrest warrant for and Inland Revenue would consider the following criteria:  the size of the defaulter’s loan;  the amount of their overdue payments, including penalties;  the time since they last made a payment;  how often they return to New Zealand; and  their history of non-compliance. Inland Revenue intends to maintain the confidentiality of the specifics of the criteria it will apply to decide which borrowers will be targeted for an arrest warrant. To publicise specific criteria would undermine the effectiveness of the border sanctions policy by:  Enabling borrowers to circumvent the criteria. For example, if the criteria for the level of default were publicly known, borrowers could repay to the threshold in order to disqualify them from the target group. 25  Weakening the deterrent effect of the policy. If non-compliant borrowers know they do not meet the criteria for requesting an arrest warrant, there is little incentive for them to contact Inland Revenue to address their overdue repayments. Recommendation That the submission be declined.
    M Brie Minis efing ster Inl g for of R Ju land Rev r the Reve une 201 venue D e In enue 13 Departme com e – ent ming 201 g 3   Page 1 of 8    Briefing to Incoming Minister – June 2013  As Minister of Revenue you are accountable for the overall working of New Zealand’s tax system and  for the Inland Revenue Department. In addition, tax policy decisions are made jointly by yourself and  the Minister of Finance.  This briefing provides you with some initial information relevant to your role, a summary  of current  issues and some details on suggested administrative arrangements.    OVERVIEW  1. New Zealand’s tax system  New Zealand’s tax system is robust and provides reliable sources of revenue to fund Government  programmes.  Our tax system is perceived as being among the most coherent in the OECD.  The  different pieces of the tax system fit together well and the tax bases are broad,  with few  exemptions.  These broad bases in turn allow sufficient revenue to be collected with relatively low  tax rates (as such, our tax system has been characterised as a “broad‐based, low‐rate” system).    As well as having a coherent tax policy, the tax administration functions well; this is critical  as a good  tax system is not just about good policy.  Both tax policy and tax administration must be working  well for the tax system to be effective.    The tax system was comprehensively reviewed by the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working  Group in 2009/10.  That review considered that the foundation  of the tax system, of broad tax bases  with low tax rates, is sound.  The review did express concerns about some tax settings – in particular,  the difference between the company, trust and top personal tax rates – and these issues were  largely addressed in Budget 2010 by reducing the  top personal rate to align with the trust rate.  In its Budget 2013 Fiscal Strategy the Government stated it is comfortable with the broad structure  of the tax system and that it has no plans for further major reforms in the near term.  That  statement mentioned that the Government has considered,  and rejected, potential tax changes such  as moving away from the broad‐based, low‐rate structure, a land tax or a capital gains tax.  The Government collects approximately 65 percent of its revenue – around $55 billion per year –  through taxes. 1   The two largest sources of tax revenue are PAYE (withholding tax on salary and  wages) and GST.  These two sources alone amount to 66 percent of tax collections.                                                               1  This includes indirect taxes such as excises and duties.    Page 2 of 8      2. Inland Revenue   Inland Revenue is charged by Parliament to levy tax in accordance with the law to the best of its  ability.  Inland Revenue must also maintain the integrity of the tax system and confidentiality of  people’s tax affairs.  To ensure these duties are  met, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has  statutory independence from Ministers.  From time to time the Commissioner must exercise a statutory judgement to determine where  resources should be focused.  This statutory independence means Ministers cannot direct the  Commissioner in how her duties should be carried out.    This is a somewhat different  arrangement from other Government departments, where Ministers  have more ability to influence how a department should act.  Inland Revenue is bound to  independently assess and collect tax according to the law; it cannot be influenced in this by  Ministers.    Inland Revenue employs around 5,300 people in 17 offices across the  country.  Its largest office is in  Wellington, but it also has a large presence in Auckland, Hamilton, Christchurch and Dunedin.    The areas of Inland Revenue include:   Service delivery (processing and assisting with returns)   Investigations (auditing taxpayers)   Office of the Chief Tax Counsel (providing rulings on tax law and  issuing interpretation  statements)  Individuals' tax,  $24.2b Corporate tax, $8.6b GST, $14.6b Other indirect  taxation, $5.3b Other direct taxes,  $2.0b Total taxation revenue 2011/12 ($55 billion)   Page 3 of 8     Business transformation (working with the rest of the department to implement Inland  Revenue’s change programme)   Policy and Strategy (advising Ministers on policy matters, drafting certain revenue  legislation, forecasting tax revenue and providing strategic direction for the department).   Inland Revenue is responsible for more than  the tax system.  It administers several social policy and  other programmes; including child support, repayments of student loans, Working for Families, paid  parental leave and KiwiSaver.  At present, the main challenges facing Inland Revenue are:  Doing more with less: Along with other Government departments, Inland Revenue is facing  a slowly  reducing funding baseline.  At the same time, Government expectations of the  department’s performance have not changed.    Peak season: Inland Revenue has very high contact volumes in the months surrounding  June, when numerous taxpayers are required to file tax returns.  Many of these calls are  from people who are seeking advice  on how certain tax rules work and apply to them.  These  high volumes can translate into very long wait times.  This is managed in a number of ways  including by increasing call centre resources.  This often creates some media interest.    Business transformation: Inland Revenue’s computer systems and processes are becoming  increasingly  out‐of‐date, increasing the risk of operational failure and making it difficult to  implement new policies to meet Government or customer expectations.    Part of the  department’s business transformation process involves re‐engineering its key computer  systems.  This also presents an opportunity to update Inland Revenue’s business processes  and how  we interact with taxpayers at the same time.  This is a very large and on‐going  process of change, which we expect to take around 10 years.  Cabinet agreed in April to the  overall business transformation direction that Inland Revenue wishes to pursue.    3. Tax policy development  The Treasury and Inland  Revenue jointly develop tax policy.  The specific changes that are worked on  are based on the Government’s tax policy work programme.  This is updated regularly, with the next  update scheduled for later this year.    Tax changes are developed in accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP).  This is a  very  open and interactive process which helps ensure that tax policy changes are well thought through  and workable in practice.  The key element of this process is consultation.  This works especially well  as New Zealand has a private sector that is particularly well informed on tax policy issues.  We  believe this  is in large part a legacy of the open and constructive policy debates that have flowed  from the GTPP.  A consequence of the GTPP is that it increases the time it takes to develop and implement tax policy.   However, we believe the GTPP to be a valuable and essential part  of building and maintaining a good  tax system.  On occasion, there will be some changes that require immediate action to protect the  revenue base.  It is not possible to respond quickly and, at the same time, engage in wide  consultation.  In these instances it is accepted that public consultation cannot occur.       Page 4 of 8    CURRENT ISSUES  There are a number of current issues that will require your immediate attention including:   Date Item Comments  11 June Sign Parliamentary Questions from Hon Phil

It provides a high - level ass ess men t of a nu mber of po ten tial reforms t o t he t axation of savings and investmen t, based on whe the r reforms cou ld improve eff icien cy , incentives t o save and invest, and reduce macroeconomic vulnerabili ties. These are importan t in contributing t o t he ultimate goals of increa sing economic performan ce and improving economic welfare in New Zea land. This ha s clea r li nks t o t he Business Growth Agenda: work in t his space is urgent, so it is importan t Ministers consider what t ax reforms cou ld off er. We ha ve complemen ted existing analys is by using a computable general equili brium model tha t ha s been adapted t o reflect t he New Zea land economy (the DZ model). Overall we t hink the model is useful f or drawing general observation s/insights t o use as part of a broader ass ess ment into diff eren t t ax reforms, but does no t off er t he level of con fidence t o rely on quantified results. For cap ital ga ins t ax on ly, we ha ve used a simpler general equili brium model f ocused on housing and t axation in New Zea land (the And rew Coleman model). The analys es do no t examine practical aspe cts of designing and implemen ting reforms in de tail , which would need t o be con sidered more f ull y if such reforms were pursued. The modelli ng work ha s suggested t ha t personal i ncome tax cuts may have greater economic benefit than corporate i ncome tax cuts i n New Zealand. This is primaril y because most of t he benefits of personal t ax cuts would acc rue t o residents, whe rea s a larger proportion of t he benefits of corpo rate income t ax cuts ’lea k’ oversea s t o non-r esidents given New Zealand’s high level of f oreign cap ital ownership; and t ha t a pe rsonal income t ax cut would increa se incentives f or both saving s and investmen t, and labour supply. It also suggests t hat reforms which cut corporate i ncome tax may res ult i n a net welfare loss. This is be cau se t he country may lose more f rom giving up t ax revenue t o non-r esidents than it gains f rom improved investmen t incen tives generall y (due t o impu tation , a corporate income t ax cut is expe cted t o have li tt le impa ct on investment incentives f or residents, li miting economic welfare gains, bu t does increa se f oreign investmen t). This welfare result may at f irst be surprising given economic li terature suggests cuts t o t he corporate t ax rate tend t o be be st f or economic growth. 1 However such studies t end t o f ocus on ly on t he eff ects of lower t ax rates on GDP rather t han on economic welfare, so do no t pick up t he f act tha t some of t he economic benefits of a t ax cut may acc rue t o non-r esidents (which is importan t f or New Zea land given our relatively high levels of f oreign capital ownership). This will act t o reduce economic welfare benefits compa red t o impacts on GDP. I n addition studies oft en do no t acc ount f or t he general equili brium eff ect of t he t ax cut (which is captured in t he DZ model) – so whil e residents only enjoy some of t he benefits of t he t ax cut, they bear t he en tire burden of t he revenue off set t o f und t he t ax cut, which will f urthe r reduce economic welfare. There are also li kely t o be dynamic growth benefits f rom reducing corpo rate t axes (e.g. higher productivity growth and spill overs f rom FDI), which are no t cap tured by t he model. Personal t ax cuts will also li kely have wide r growth benefits, which are also not cap tured in the results (e.g., increa sed investmen t in hu man capital and spill overs f rom t his investmen t), 1 Such as Tax and Economic Growth, Economics Departmen t Working Paper No. 620, OECD (2008), although this is ba sed on cross -country “average” results, so does no t pick up impo rtan t variation s be tween countries (such as t he relatively high level of f oreign cap ital owne rship and presen ce of an impu tation system no ted above). and this is not expected to change the earlier insight that personal tax cuts are more favourable than corporate tax cuts Overall, we think the welfare result suggests caution in considering a further corporate income tax reduction at this stage-but that it is only one factor. Corporate tax rates have been falling in other countries (although there has been some slowing of the rate of these reductions with the Global Financial Crisis) and it is important to make sure that our company rate is not too far out of line with rate in other countries to minimise the risk of profit-shifting pressures (using transfer pricing). This may lead to an increased case for company rate cuts in the future. It is important that New Zealand remains an open dynamic economy and an attractive destination for FOI, given the benefits foreign investment can bring. The following table summarises some of the main conclusions from our analysis. The various reforms are modelled at a fiscal cost of $1 billion to aid comparability (with the exception of the Allowance for Corporate Equity}, 2 with the cost offset by reduced government transfers. Reform National savings Cut in corporate 0 income tax Cut in all personal 0 income tax rates Cut in tax on 0 interest income Dual income tax 0 Allowance for 0 corporate equity Key: 'Lr =significant positive impact, ~ = some negative impact, These indicate: Steady state impacts GOP Economic Macro Equity~ Complexity welfare vulnerability of change 0 ~ • Small-ve Low impact 0 lJ 0 Depends on Low design 0 0 w Worsens Medium 0 ~ w Worsens High • • • Worsens High 'Lr =some positive impact, ¢:::> = negligible impact or unclear, ...... = significant negative impact • The tax reform option that appears most effective in boosting economic welfare and reducing macroeconomic vulnerability is a personal income tax reduction. This also boosts GOP and increases national savings. The other tax reform which also boosts economic welfare but has a negligible effect on macroeconomic vulnerability is a cut in personal capital income tax restricted to residents (such as reducing tax on interest income). This has the biggest effect in promoting savings. • A reduction in corporate income tax offers a more limited increase in national savings compared to other reforms, and also leads to an increase in macro vulnerability. The result that this reform may reduce economic welfare also suggests caution around considering a further corporate income tax reduction at this time. 4 As noted earlier wider factors, such as the competitiveness of our corporate tax rate, may increase the case for a further corporate rate reduction in the future. • A dual income tax is likely to increase national savings and GOP, but reduce economic welfare. However, while there are economic gains from a dual income tax, greater gains can be realised from simpler cuts to personal tax rates as shown above. 2 Given the high cost of an ACE, part of the fiscal impact is met through increasing remaining income tax rates as well as reducing government transfers. 3 Based on current equity impacts. Assessing equity impacts on a lifetime basis has not been possible given lack of longitudinal data. However, such assessments would tend to dampen the impacts noted above. 4 This may suggest that an increase in the corporate tax rate will be welfare-enhancing for New Zealand. However such a tax change might not be sustainable given our corporate tax rate is already above the OECD average. It would be a negative signal for business, impacting New Zealand's ability to attract FDI, and would increase incentives for firms to shift profits overseas, eroding the corporate tax base.

We t he refore do no t recommend prioritising f urthe r work on a dual income t ax in t he medium t erm. • The negative f isc al and economic impa cts of an All owance for Corporate Equity (ACE) outweigh t he benefits of any additional savings and investmen t. It would also add sign ifican t complexity and wou ld be cha ll enging t o implemen t. For t he se reasons, we do no t recommend pu rsuing t his op tion . Treasury ha s reported previously on all ocative eff iciency iss ues cau sed by gaps in t he t ax base (primaril y no t t axing capital gains) and t he interaction of inflation and t he t ax system. 5 Treasury con tinues t o see a cap ital ga ins t ax as t he be st way of reducing t hese distortion s, although it is cognisan t t ha t a f ull y de veloped reg ime must be con side red be fore poli cy decision s can be made. I nland Revenue ack nowledges t ha t t his reform is consisten t with ou r BBLR f ramework bu t it con side rs t he de vil is in t he de tail - as well as additional complexity, it is not clea r t ha t a CGT t hat appli ed on reali sation and exempted t he f amil y home wou ld be more eff icien t t han no t ha ving one. Reduction s in pe rsonal capital income t ax, disc uss ed above as one of t he most beneficial reforms, may ha ve some second be st eff ects in reducing all ocative distortion s depending on how t he y are implemented . Options include: • Reducing tax on i nteres t i ncome which was modell ed and ind icated a strong increase in na tional saving s, simil ar t o a personal t ax reduction . The reform is also expe cted t o improve economic welfare (the mea sure of economic eff iciency in t he model). However, t he reduction in t ax on interest income may also cau se other distortions, no t cap tured in t he model (such as be tween debt and equity investmen ts), so overall eff icien cy impacts are un clea r. There are also f isc al risks f rom t ax arbitrage opportunities which wou ld ha ve t o be managed or address ed with new an ti-arbitrage rules, adding t o complexity of t he t ax system. • Reforming the PIE regime for example by extending PIE rates to portf oli o investmen ts directly held by t axpa yers (debt and equity). 6 This would en cou rage more domestic saving s. On ba lan ce, t he Trea sury con side r t ha t overall eff iciency would li kely be improved ; whe rea s I nland Revenue con siders t ha t t he opposite may be t rue . I nland Revenue con side rs t ha t f or coheren ce rea son s it may be preferable t o instead remove the cap on PIE t ax rates, as was suggested by t he Tax Working Group, and use t he revenue raised t o lower pe rsonal t ax rates. Both options will be con sidered as part of furthe r work on PIE reform. • Index ing the tax base for i nflation, which wou ld increase aft er- tax returns t o interest income and li kely result in a significan t increase in saving s (although t he level of foreign investmen t will li kely f all given only real interest expense would no w be deductible, which cou ld reduce macro vulne rab ili ties). I ndexation is also a very complex exercise due t o high ongoing compli an ce costs (espe ciall y f or SMEs), meaning overall ne t benefits are unclear, and it would be chall enging t o implemen t given curr en t I R systems capabili ty.

This report provide s a high-level ass ess men t of a numbe r of po ten tial t ax reforms t o the t axation of saving s and investment, as ag reed in Treasury’s 2011/12 ou tpu t plan and t he Governmen t’s Tax Poli cy Work Prog ramme.

We wou ld li ke t o disc uss t he report with you at t he joint Ministers’ mee ting on 16 October 2012 and get you r ag ree men t on medium-term reform priorities. Back ground 2. There ha ve been a nu mber of New Zealand t ax and other poli cy reviews t ha t ha ve examined po ten tial reforms around t he t axation of saving s and investmen t income. These include t he Tax Working Group (2009-10) and t he Saving s Working Group (2010-11 ), alongside Australi a’s Hen ry Tax Review and t he UK’s Mirr lees Tax Review. Back ground t o t hese reviews ha s been provided in Annex 1. I n pa rticular t he Saving s Working Group raised con cerns t hat New Zealand’s low level of na tional savings increased its vulnerabili ty due t o high levels of external debt and low levels of do mestic saving . Treasury’s interest in t his project ha s also been motivated by concerns about low productivity growth (underpinned by cap ital sha ll owne ss ), which is f orecast t o continue. The se iss ue s ha ve clea r li nks t o t he Business Growth Agenda: work in t his space is urgent, so it is impo rtan t Ministers con side r wha t t ax reforms could off er. Aims and objective of the work 3. Drawing on t he se recen t reviews, Trea sury and I nland Revenue off icials have been ass ess ing t he merits of a number of major and minor t ax reforms t o understand t heir impact f rom a New Zealand context be tt er, estab li sh whe ther t here is a prima f acie case f or t he ir implemen tation , and t o identify med ium-term reform priorities. 4. In addition t o economic welfare, key iss ue s have been ho w diff erent reforms wou ld aff ect t he : • Overall eff icien cy of t he all ocation of savings and investmen t in t he economy; and • Total level of saving s and investmen t, along with t he po ten tial t o reduce macroeconomic vulnerabili ties in t he economy. 5. These are impo rtan t in con tribu ting t o t he ultimate goals of increa sing economic performance and improving economic welfare in New Zea land. The diff eren t iss ue s are motivated by a number of consideration s: • Eff icien cy is t he standard benchmark f or determining how well a t ax system contribu tes t o economic performan ce. It generall y t ries t o ass ess ho w li tt le a t ax system crea tes distortions, f or example t o investment and labour supply decision s; • Treasury ha s express ed con cern t hat t here are low levels of na tional saving s in New Zea land. It con side rs t hat t he re may be po ten tial f or t ax reform (in combina tion with po li cies in othe r areas) t o improve savings pe rforman ce and all ocation of investmen ts even if t he t ax system is not t he f undamen tal cause of the prob lem; and T2012/2470 : Taxation of Savings and I nvestment I ncome Page 8 • Concern about t he vulne rabili ty po sed by New Zea land’s high ne t external li abili ty position has ga ined increa sed impo rtan ce in t he wake of t he global f inancial crisis. All else equal, increa ses in national saving s relative t o investment, changes in t he mix of external li abili ties (from debt t o equity) and increasing GDP growth f or a given supply of cap ital reduces vulnerabili ty or mitiga tes t he impa ct of an increa se in net externa l li abili ties. But ass ess ing t he impa ct of poli cy changes on vulne rab ili ty is complex and requires consideration of economic variables such as t he curr en t acc ount and gross and ne t levels of national debt, as well as debt servicing capacity f actors such as national savings, expo rts and off shore investmen ts. 6. This analys is is intended t o inform us and Ministers as t o whethe r an y t ax reforms ha ve the po ten tial t o improve economic performance, and t he refore whether off icials should do any sign ifican t f urthe r analys is of t hem. The analys is presented he re does not examine practical aspects of designing and implementing reforms in de tail , which would need t o be considered more f ull y be fore f orming a f ina l judgemen t on whe the r such reforms should be pu rsued. 7. This work may ha ve li tt le immediate poli cy impli cations given t ha t t he Government recen tly completed a major t ax reform, bu t is impo rtant go ing f orward given t he Governmen t’s strateg ic priority of bu il ding a more productive and competitive economy, and t he Business Growth Agenda. It also helps en sure off icials are well placed t o provide ad vice on f uture economic and f isc al chall enges (for example, t his work will also be used t o inform t he disc uss ion of t ax in t he Long Term Fisc al Statement). Analys is 8. We ha ve drawn on a nu mbe r of analys es t o inform our ass ess men ts. The se include: • Standard f irst principles analys is including drawing f rom analys es we ha ve done for t he Tax Working Group and t he Saving s Working Group; • A computable general equili brium model de veloped by US academics John Diamond and George Zodrow and modified by Trea sury and I R off icials (kno wn as t he DZ model), which all ows us t o examine ho w t ax reforms migh t aff ect t he all ocation of cap ital in New Zea land, and impact key variables such as GDP, economic welfare (the mea sure of economic eff iciency in t he model) 7 and t he level of saving s; • A model designed by And rew Coleman t o provide insigh ts into how a capital gains t ax cou ld impact investmen t in housing in New Zea land; and • High-level analys es of t he li kely impa cts on equity, t ax system integrity (arbitrage poten tial), complexity, compli an ce, and ad ministration costs (which is importan t given I R systems capabili ty f or sub stan tial t ax reform in t he short t erm). These ass ess ments do not con side r de tail ed de sign iss ue s f or t he specific t ax reforms. 9. The general equili brium modelli ng is a step f orward in buil ding ou r analytical capabili ty, consisten t with I nland Revenue and Trea sury work on quantifying t he eff ects of t ax poli cy changes and as pa rt of t he wider Treasury work on quantifying our key poli cies. It has been cali brated t o include specific f actors relevan t t o New Zea land (e.g. high levels of f oreign capital owne rship and li kely location-spe cific economic rents) t o he lp us understand ho w t hese make t he analys is diff erent f rom standard results. Overall we 7 Economic welfare is impo rtan t t o con side r as a rise in GDP may no t ne cess aril y mean t ha t New Zea landers are be tt er off given some benefits f rom t he t ax change and higher GDP may acc rue to f oreign investors.

The DZ model ha s its li mitation s, particularly as it does no t pick up dynamic growth impacts or distribu tional impa cts. We have att empted t o address t he se t hrough additional ass ess men t ou tside of t he model to help us reach conclusion s. 10. Furthe r disc uss ion and results f rom t he analytical work can be f ound in Annex 2. No one method of analys is is determina tive bu t con sidered t ogether t he y provide gu idance as t o which t ax reforms have t he grea test po ten tial economic benefits. 11. Reforms considered in t he analytical work include major changes t o ou r curr en t BBLR system (all owan ce f or corporate equity, dual income t ax, and t he indexation of t ax bases). Alongside t his we ha ve con side red incremental changes t o existing t ax rates within t he BBLR system. This ha s broadened our understanding of t he margina l economic impa ct of reducing t ax rates of diff eren t t ax bases (corporate income, personal income, and interest income). Reforms are modell ed on a f isc all y neutral basis with reduction in lump-sum go vernmen t pa yments t o off set t he f isc al cost of t he reforms, which isolates t he impa ct of t he change be ing modell ed . 8 This is most closely proxied by a reduction in go vernmen t spending or by introducing a well -de signed land tax. If tax cuts are f inanced by t ax increases t ha t are not completely eff icien t, t his will obviou sly reduce t he benefits of t he t ax reforms no ted here. 12. We ha ve also commen ted on revenue-r aising t ax reforms we ha ve con side red previou sly (such as land t ax and a risk -free return method f or t axing housing investments) and have undertaken f urthe r analys is of cap ital gains t ax using t he Andrew Coleman model. Findings 13. The analytical work has provided t he f oll owing high -level insigh ts: • Personal income t ax cuts may have greater economic benefit t han company income t ax cuts in New Zealand. This is primaril y because: o Most of t he benefits of personal t ax cuts would acc rue t o residents, wherea s some benefit of company income t ax cuts would acc rue t o non- residents given New Zea land’s high level of f oreign cap ital ownership; and o A pe rsonal income t ax cut wou ld increa se incentives f or both savings and investment by residents, and labour supply. • General company income t ax cuts may result in a net welfare loss . This is because t he country may lose more f rom a reduction in t ax revenue t o non- residents t han it ga ins f rom improved investment incen tives generall y (company income t ax cut is expe cted t o have li tt le impa ct on investment incentives f or residents, be cau se t he impu tation system claws ba ck t he benefit f or resident shareholders when income is distributed , bu t does increa se levels of f oreign investment). Examples of t hese are a general company t ax cut and an all owan ce for corporate equity (ACE); and • Capital income t ax cuts t ha t apply t o resident individuals may have some ne t benefits, although t he se will have eff ects t ha t are not ab le t o be cap tured in t he modelli ng (such as t he t ax reductions will no t apply t o all t ypes of cap ital) and t he eff ects are no t as great as f or a personal t ax rate cut. Examples of t hese include 8 Reforms (with t he exc ep tion of ACE) are modell ed at a f isc al cost of $1 billi on t o aid compa rab ili ty, with t he cost off set by reduced go vernmen t t ran sfers. See Tab le 1 f or f urthe r de tail s. T2012/2470 : Taxation of Savings and I nvestment I ncome Page 10 a reduced t ax rate on interest income which we ha ve modell ed and an extended PIE regime which ha s not been modell ed . 14. Whil e t he modelli ng work suggests t hat t he re may be a ne t economic welfare loss f rom corporate income t ax cuts t ha t increa se f oreign direct investmen t (FDI), t his does no t mean other poli cies (such as regulatory changes) which encourage additional FDI may not be de sirab le. New Zealand curr en tly has a very large stock of FDI and corpo rate income t ax cuts also apply t o non-r esident owne rs of t he stock of existing FDI. It is giving up revenue on existing FDI which con tributes t o t he ne t welfare reduction. Furthe r work, such as t he work on location-spe cific rents, may he lp us get more con fidence in understanding how much of t he t ax reduction s are en joyed by non- resident shareholders. I n addition t here may be other f actors, such as profit-shift ing press ures and t he question of whe the r ou r corporate t ax rate is t oo f ar ou t of li ne with othe r countries, which aff ect t he decision around f uture changes t o corporate t ax sett ing s. All ocation of ca pital 15. The DZ and Coleman models do give some insigh ts into t he con sequences of how changing t he t ax sett ing s would change t he all ocation of cap ital, and how t his aff ects GDP and economic welfare. I n f ocusing t he iss ue of capital all ocation on amounts invested in housing versus other investments, t he Coleman model of t ax and housing (which is simpler t han t he DZ model bu t more informative about t he impa cts on housing) suggests t ha t t axing housing more heavil y (by t axing capital ga ins, even when the t ax is li mited t o investmen t housing only) does t end t o: • reduce t he t otal amount invested in housing ; • increase t he amount invested in interest-bearing ass ets; • reduce t he price of housing and increa se aff ordabili ty of owne r- occ up ied housing ; • increase ren ts and reduce t he aff ordabili ty of ren tal housing ; • increase economic welfare; and • reduce t he level of f oreign bo rr owing compared t o t he status quo. Key conclusions 16. A summary of ou r ass ess men ts is presen ted in Tab le 1 at t he end of t he report (with a more de tail ed disc uss ion of results in Annex 2). At t his stage, t he f ind ing s f rom t he se ass ess ments lead us t o t he f oll owing conclusions on medium-term reform priorities. Potential medium-t erm reform priorities • Personal i ncome tax reduction – This reform reduces all personal income t ax rates and appears strongly beneficial. It provides higher GDP and economic welfare, increa sed saving s (because lower pe rsonal rates also reduce t he taxation of interest income) and reduced macroe conomic vulne rab ili ty. The model does no t pick up dyna mic growth benefits f rom reducing personal t ax rates, (e.g. higher productivity and en trepreneurship), which will f urther improve the benefits of t his reform. It is also relatively easy t o implemen t given t he f airly simple structure of t he curr en t t ax system and wou ld help with overall coherence of t he t ax system if t he t op rate is lowered ; T2012/2470 : Taxation of Savings and I nvestment I ncome Page 11 • Capital i ncome tax reduction accruing to res idents – Ano the r area of poten tial reform is a cap ital t ax reduction t argeted t owards residents. The reform modell ed above which does t his is a cut in t ax on interest income. I n t he model this increases GDP, welfare, and ha s t he biggest impact on savings. The increase in economic welfare in t he DZ model suggests some ga in in economic eff icien cy . However, t he re are other eff ects on economic eff iciency which are no t captured in t he model so t he impa ct on t he all ocative eff icien cy of investmen t is unclea r. On one hand, a disc ounted t ax rate on interest may reduce t he eff ective tax rate on interest t o be closer t o t he eff ective t ax rate on housing and other rea l property investmen ts, where cap ital gains are not t axed . On t he other hand, an arbitrary disc ount amount could also increase eff ective t ax rate diff eren tials with othe r investmen ts. Two othe r reforms which also reduce capital t axes on residents are extended PIE and indexing t he t ax ba se f or inflation. These are: o Reforming the PIE regime for example by extending PIE rates t o portf oli o investments directly he ld by t axpayers (debt and equity) – i.e. removing t he requirement t hat t he investmen t be held in a managed f und. 9 This would encourage more do mestic saving s. Although direct investmen ts would be taxed at t he no rmal rates, Treasury considers t his boundary is more sustainable t han t he curr ent boundary. On ba lan ce, Trea sury con side rs tha t overall eff icien cy would li kely be improved; wherea s I nland Revenue considers t ha t t he opposite may be t rue . I nland Revenue conside rs t ha t f or coherence reasons it may be preferable t o instead remove t he cap on PIE tax rates, as was suggested by t he Tax Working Group, and use t he revenue raised t o lower pe rsonal t ax rates. Off icials will report later on bo th options t he se as pa rt of t he curr en t t ax poli cy work prog ramme. o Index ing the tax base for i nflation – Although no t specificall y modell ed , this reform is also a capital t ax reduction t ha t is restricted t o residents. Inflation ad justmen ts t o interest income would be expe cted t o increa se saving s sign ifican tly given it will increase aft er- tax returns. However by all owing t he deduction of on ly rea l interest expense t he cost of cap ital borr owed f rom non-r esidents may increase, po ss ibly reducing t he overall level of investment (although in itself t his cou ld improve macro vulnerabili ty). I ndexation is also a very complex exercise given t he inflation adjustmen t f actor is li kely t o be imprecise, which will dampen overall benefits, and due t o high ongoing compli ance costs (espe ciall y f or SMEs). 10 Overall net benefits are un clear, and would be cha ll enging t o implemen t given curr en t I R systems capabili ty. We do no t recommend it be pu rsued as a med ium-term reform. 17. Many of t he se po ten tial reforms would ha ve a f isc al cost. Given t he t igh t f isc al position in t he next f ew yea rs, t he re may be merit in conside ring a ‘pa ck age’ approach, as was done in Budget 2010, with reduction s in t axes be ing off set either by increasing other tax rates or by ba se broadening . Spe cific ba se broadening options con side red at t he time of Budget 2010 11 include: 9 An alterna tive PIE exten sion wou ld be t o lower PIE rates, as recommended by t he Saving s Working Group. The t ype of impa cts of such a reform are li kely t o be simil ar t o t he reduction in t ax on interest income, modell ed above, given it involves reducing t he t ax rate on spe cific f orms of cap ital investmen t. 10 It may be po ss ible t o mitiga te compli an ce costs f or small er t axpa yers without sophisticated systems by all owing t he m t o “elect ou t”, ho wever t his also ha s some compli cation s and may also be cha ll enging f or t he I R t o ad minister with its curr en t systems li mitation s 11 Risk -free return t ax on ren tal property (taxing ren tal housing on a deemed return ba sis) is also revenue po sitive.

In 2009 t he Tax Working Group conside red a nu mber of alterna tives t o New Zea land’s broad-ba se low-r ate t ax (BBLR) system. The se included: • A class ical company t ax system with a low company income t ax rate and a high tax rate on residents (as is done in I reland); • A dual income t ax (a low t ax rate on cap ital income t han on labour income, as is done in Norway); • An all owan ce f or corpo rate equity (ACE) (a deduction all owed f or a deemed return on company equity so t ha t a no rmal return earned by a company is no t taxed , bu t returns in exc ess of a no rmal return are t axed); and • A combina tion of a dual income t ax and an ACE system. 25. The Tax Working Group did no t recommend any of t he se alterna tives, no ting t he y would add complexity and arbitrage opportunities t o t he t ax system. 26. The Tax Working Group also con side red less comprehensive base broadening within the BBLR system. This was partly t o address pe rceived under- taxation in real property investments.

We have drawn on several pieces of analytical work de veloped as pa rt of t his review of diff eren t t ax reforms. The primary model we ha ve used is a compu tab le general equili brium (CGE) model de veloped by t wo US academics , John Diamond and George Zod row (known as t he DZ model), t hen modified by Treasury and I R. This model has been cali brated t o New Zea land spe cific parameters (ba sed on 2007 da ta). It all ows us t o estimate how t ax reforms might aff ect t he all ocation of capital in New Zealand, and impa ct key variab les such as economic growth, individual economic welfare and t he level of savings. A more de tail ed desc ription and diagram of t he model can be f ound in Appendix A. 2. The DZ model ha s its li mitations. Clearly, as with an y model, t he DZ work is a necess ary simpli fication of t he real world so t he results are sub ject t o con straints of the methodology and quali ty of ass umption s used (see Appendix A f or f urther disc uss ion). I n pa rticular, t he model on ly conside rs changes t o levels of economic variables (e.g. GDP) and does no t pick up endogenous growth eff ects. Endogenous growth eff ects can be impo rtant given t he li nk be tween t ax reform and productivity growth, 1 so t he f ull exten t of economic impacts of t ax reform may no t be f ull y reflected in t he results. Given t hese li mitations, such models should no t be regarded as de finitive; t hey can only inform a wider analys is. We have t he refore complemented disc uss ion of DZ model results with a wider ass ess men t of t he li kely economic impacts of t ax reforms t hat are no t captured in t he model (such as dyna mic eff ects), ba sed on wider evidence and studies and also anecdo tal evidence f rom othe r countries on t he ir expe riences with specific t ax reforms. Ano the r weakness of t he model is t hat it does no t have an expli cit exc hange rate, and exports are calculated pu rely t o clear t he ba lance of paymen ts. This means tha t it is li kely t he model isn’t properly cap turing t he f ull impa cts of t ax changes on external ba lan ces.

Finall y it is not poss ible t o use the model t o ass ess certain reform options, such as a land t ax or f ull indexation of the t ax ba se, as t he model does no t include land as a separate f orm of wea lth and does no t include inflation . 3.

The closest proxy for this is likely to be a well-designed land tax (of around 0.25% based on current revenue estimates). Scaling all reform options to the same fiscal cost has been done to allow better comparability of the different reform options. In reality these options should not be considered as complete reform packages, because to be a package the $1 billion fiscal cost must be offset by government spending reductions or the introduction of a non-distorting lump-sum tax such as a well-designed land tax. In the absence of lump sum alternatives or acceptable government expenditure reductions, any revenue shortfalls are likely to need to be made up by increasing other distorting taxes which will create additional costs and may reduce any economic benefits of the tax reforms explored here. 1 0. The remainder of this report sets out the results for the tax reforms listed above. Results for key economic variables from the DZ model are set out for each reform based on the colour-coded scale noted below. Additional assessments are provided alongside these results. {r = significant positive impact {r = some positive impact ¢:::> = negligible impact (<±0.1% change) or unclear ~= some negative impact ..... = significant negative impact Analytical results Reform A: Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Reduction Context 11. This reform looks at a simple reduction to the corporate income tax rate. DZ Modelling Results 12. We have modelled a $1 billion reduction in corporate income tax, which is equivalent to reducing the CIT rate by 4.3 percentage points (based on standard Treasury fiscal cost estimates). As noted above, this is offset by reduced government transfers to households. Table 1: Summary of modelling impacts for a corporate income tax reduction GOP Economic Personal Total capital Foreign Current welfare savings stock capital account 0 ~ 0 0 0 • See key on p.3 of Annex 2 13. The DZ model indicates that one of the main impacts of a corporate tax reduction would be a deterioration of the current account balance due to an increase in foreign capital inflows (and therefore outflows of capital income to non-residents), as shown in Table 1. This also increases net indebtedness. There is an increase in GOP and a small increase in both savings and in total capital stock, driven by the increase in foreign capital from the reform. These changes take effect almost immediately, with little difference between short-and long-run results. Treasury:2366671 v1 0 3 Trea sury:2366671v10 4 14. However t here is a small decli ne in economic welfare despite t he f act t ha t GDP increases.

The eff ects of a corporate t ax cut are small , in pa rt, due t o t he presence of imputation in t he New Zea land t ax system (so aft er t ax returns t o residents are no t aff ected sign ifican tly). There is an increa se in cap ital stock in t he corporate sectors, given t hey are t he only t wo sectors t o receive t he t ax cut, with capital falli ng in othe r sectors in t he economy (notably t he non-corporate sector but also the housing sectors). 16. The impact on macro vulne rab ili ty is always diff icult t o ass ess , bu t overall t his sc enario suggests t ha t it may worsen, given t he increase in f oreign capital and li tt le domestic cap ital response and worsening of t he curr ent acc ount (although dynamic growth benefits, no ted be low, f rom t he cut in corporate t ax cou ld help mitiga te t his through increased servicing capacity of external li abili ties).

Much of t his evidence (includ ing t he OECD work referenced below) looks on ly at t he eff ects of lower t ax rates on GDP rather than on economic welfare. As a result, these analys es won’t pick up t he f act t ha t some economic benefits acc rue t o non-r esidents, which will t end t o reduce economic welfare benefits relative t o impa cts on GDP. The DZ model t akes t hese welfare impacts into acc ount as pa rt of its general equili brium analys is of t he t ax change. This is importan t f or New Zealand be cause we ha ve a higher share of foreign investmen t as a proportion of GDP t han most other OECD countries. This may also explain why t he model suggests a small er impa ct on economic growth from a change in CIT rates t han a change in personal income t ax rates (see Reform B). 5 I n addition , othe r stud ies t end t o be ba sed on cross -country averages, which make it diff icult t o draw inferences about ind ividual countries. 18.

This has the potential to increase total factor productivity (TFPf and economic growth, which is not picked up in the model results. 19. The model results suggest a large foreign capital response to the modelled CIT reduction. In general FDI can be an important source of the capital needed to support increased productivity growth (through spillovers to domestic firms), which would not be picked up in the model. However, evidence is limited about whether FDI has any additional increased productivity benefits over and above the usual benefits from increasing capital investment. Non-Economic Assessment 20. The equity implications of this option are lower than for other capital tax reductions such as ACE and DIT as, for individual shareholders, much of the benefit of a company tax reduction is clawed back by imputation. However, cutting the company tax rate without cutting personal income tax rates reduces the integrity of the tax system by making it easier for people to use companies to shelter income from higher rates of personal taxation. On its own, changing the tax rate should have little impact on complexity or administrative costs, but other measures may be required to address the integrity issues identified above, which could add complexity. Reform 8: Persona/Income Tax (PIT) Reduction Context 21. This reform looks at a simple reduction to personal income tax rates (labour income, dividend income and interest income taxes). DZ Modelling Results 22. We have modelled a $1 billion personal income tax reduction 8 , which is equivalent to reducing the average tax rate by around 1 percentage point (from 23.4% to 22.4% in the model based on 2007 rates), while retaining the current progressive structure. As noted above, this is offset by reduced government transfers to households.

The DZ model suggests that this change would result in increases in GOP, savings, economic welfare and capital stocks as shown in Table 2.

The increa sed consumption increa ses GDP, and t he increa sed saving increa ses cap ital stocks. All sectors see increases in t heir cap ital stocks, although t he highest increa se is seen in t he non-corpo rate sector given t he na ture of t he t ax change. Wide r Economic Ass ess men t 25. The results f rom t he DZ modelli ng are con sistent with wider evidence t hat personal income t axes are ha rmful t o levels of economic growth. The OECD 9 also f ound tha t t axes aff ecting labour supply mainly influence GDP levels (r ather t han growth rates), bu t t ha t t he re may be some additional productivity growth benefits f rom such a t ax change, which are no t cap tured in t he model. I n particular, reducing PIT rates can promote R&D activities and en terprise crea tion , given it is li kely t he most relevan t t ax rate f acing small , start-up en trepreneurs.

The OECD no te t he se are li kely t o ha ve persisten t long- run eff ects on economic growth. 26. The model may also underestimate t he impact of reducing labour t axes on FDI: evidence 10 suggests t he impa ct of t he labour t ax rate on FDI is poten tiall y large (although, as no ted above, evidence is li mited about whe the r greater FDI f lowing into New Zealand will led t o increased productivity or economic growth). However, if grea ter FDI f lows were t o result f rom reducing t he pe rsonal t ax rate, it is unli kely to have t he same economic welfare-r educing result as seen by a corporate t ax reduction since almost all pe rsonal t ax revenues are ea rned f rom residents. Non-Economic Ass ess men t 27. The equity impa ct of such a change will depend on how t he personal income t ax structure is changed in practice t o bring about the ass umed reduction in t he average t ax rate. Of cou rse, t he way t hat t he personal t ax structure is changed will also ha ve some impact on t he othe r variables t ha t we have commented on above. There is li kely t o be li tt le change t o complexity, compli ance and ad ministration costs compared t o t he curr en t system. Reducing t he t op pe rsonal t ax rate, relative t o t he company rate, wou ld also reduce t he benefits of sheltering income within companies, increasing t he coherence of t he t ax system. 9 OECD (2008) 10 OECD (2008) Reform C: Reduced tax on interest income Context 28. Currently, all income from interest payments is taxed, including that part of the nominal return that is due to inflation. Taxing the inflationary component of returns has efficiency consequences as it can distort how people decide to invest. A simple option to address this partially would be a tax discount applying to interest income only, such as considered in the (Australian) Henry review. Discounting the interest income taxation rate would, by itself, be a relatively simple change to the current tax system, but anti-arbitrage rules (e.g. to prevent individuals converting one form of capital income into another) and other tax integrity issues could add significant complexity. DZ Modelling Results 29. We have modelled a $1 billion reduction in tax received from interest, which is equivalent to reducing the average tax rate on interest income by around 4 percentage points (from 24.9% to 21% in the model based on 2007 rates). As in other reforms, this is offset by reduced government transfers to households. Table 3: Summary of modelling impacts for a reduction in tax on interest income GOP Economic Personal Total capital Foreign Current welfare savings stock capital account 0 0 0 0 0 • See key on p.3 of Annex 2 30. The DZ model estimates this would result in increases in savings and capital stocks, but smaller increases in GOP and economic welfare, as shown in Table 3. Initially, savings and therefore investment and the capital stock increase substantially. Over the longer term, savings settle back to a level that is still higher than pre-reform, and consumption increases so that the extra household income ends up being more balanced between consumption and savings. 31. Our modelling results suggest that reducing the tax on interest income increases the effective return on that income, and so encourages more personal saving. This increases the capital available for production, enabling some increase in GOP. Economic welfare also increases. The effects on the level of savings and the total capital stock are similar to those estimated to arise from a reduction in PIT (see reform B). However, the impact on production and GOP is muted in part as, unlike a reduction in PIT, a reduction in the tax on interest income does not directly incentivise additional labour supply. Furthermore, the accumulation of capital under a reduction in the tax on interest income owes partially to an increase in foreign capital, due to general equilibrium effects, as opposed to a reduction in PIT where the level of foreign capital is estimated to decrease. 32. The impact on macro-vulnerability is likely to be mixed: while there is an increase in net indebtedness and worsening of the current account, there is also higher national savings and capital stock, which may partly improve the economy's servicing capacity of external liabilities. Treasury:2366671 v1 0 7 Trea sury:2366671v10 8 Wide r Economic Ass ess men t 33. As no ted ea rli er, an y increa se in private saving f rom changes t o t ax rates is li kely t o overstate t he increa se in cap ital stock given investment alternatives ab road. This is not pick ed up in t he DZ model. If it were t he case, t his wou ld reduce additional capital investmen t taking place in New Zealand and t he model results may overestimate t he economic impacts of t he t ax reform. I n reali ty, we would also expe ct much of t he savings response t o be driven by changes in peoples’ saving habits (e.g. shift ing f rom shares t o t erm deposits t o t ake ad vantage of t he lower t ax on interest income as compared t o other capital income). 34. The DZ model is also li mited in t hat it doesn’t cap ture t he economic cost of incen tivising debt investmen ts when t he pre-tax return is lower t han t he pre-tax cost of capital. The impact wou ld t end t o reduce economic welfare. Non-Economic Ass ess men t 35. The reform in itself is regress ive (as higher income households t end t o ea rn more interest income) and it would add complexity. An importan t question is how comprehensive t he rules would be . For example, lease payments ha ve an interest component and systematicall y att empting t o t ax t his at a low rate cou ld be complex. The reform would remove t he neutrali ty of debt and equity f inancing do mesticall y and instead f avou r debt f inancing of domestic companies, which could reduce t he financial stabili ty of t he domestic company sector. It also raises t he arbitrage poten tial of ba ck -to-back lending where a t ax ad vantage is obtained and t he re is no net debt created overall . It may require some po tentiall y compli cated rules, such as a do mestic t hin capitali sation regime. Reform D: Dual I ncome Tax Context 36. A dual income t ax, as used in Norway, constitutes a low, f lat t ax rate on all capital income (corpo rate and interest income, with t ax on most dividend income removed to avoid double t axation) 11 and a higher, progress ive rate structure f or labour income. This would be a f undamen tal change t o New Zea land’s t ax system. DZ Modelli ng Results 37. We ha ve modell ed t he introduction of a dual income t ax at cost of $1 billi on , comparable t o other reform option s. This is equivalen t t o capping cap ital income tax rates at 30% in t he model (whil e t his reduces corporate income t ax f rom 33 %, it does no t change t he average interest income t ax rate in t he model, which is 24 .9% - a reform t ha t set a sing le cap ital rate equal t o t his rate wou ld instead cost around $2.5billi on ). It also includes t he removal of impu tation and dividend t axation given capital is only t axed on ce under a dual income t ax reg ime. Con sisten t with other reforms, f isc al cost is t hen off set by reduced governmen t t ran sfers t o households. 11 I n practice, dividends and cap ital ga ins are t axed t o t he exten t t ha t t he y exc eed t he aft er- tax risk -free interest rate (which in itself penali ses risk ). A f ull Norweg ian system also ensures t ha t double t axing at t he cap ital t ax rate is equivalen t t o sing le t axation at t he t op pe rsonal rate. Table 4: Summary of modelling impacts for a dual income tax GOP Economic Personal Total capital Foreign Current welfare savings stock capital account 0 ~ 0 0 0 • See key on p.3 of Annex 2 38. The model results (in Table 4 above) show that the introduction of a OIT regime at a cost of $1 billion would lead to an increase in personal savings and total capital stock, and some increase in GOP. This is due in part to the increase in foreign capital resulting from the reduction in capital tax rates, which also leads to a small reduction in economic welfare for reasons discussed under the corporate income tax reform above. The tax change sees the capital stock increase in all sectors of the economy, although this is more pronounced in the corporate sectors. Economic welfare and GOP are not significantly affected. 39. Impacts on macro-vulnerability are mixed. On the one hand, the model results suggest a small worsening of the current account and net indebtedness. On the other hand, the more significant increase in national savings and the capital stock may improve debt servicing capacity. 40. While the fiscal cost of a OIT is modelled here as offset by reduced government transfers to households, it could also be offset by higher labour income taxes. Results for this combination of reforms show that, while there would still be increases in savings and capital, there would be a fall in both GOP and economic welfare due to the negative impact of higher labour taxes on labour supply. Wider Economic Assessment 41 . As indicated earlier in the paper, reductions in corporate income tax rates are likely to have additional dynamic growth effects not captured in the model through increased TFP. 42. In its study on tax and economic growth, the OEC0 12 notes that for open economies with mobile capital (such as New Zealand), any increase in private saving is likely to overstate the increase in capital stock given investment alternatives abroad, meaning some private savings will flow into foreign investment options. This is not picked up in the OZ model. If it were the case, this will reduce additional capital investment taking place in New Zealand and the model results may overestimate the economic impacts of the tax reform. 43. It has been argued that dual income tax could be a way of reducing perceived preferences for investing in owner-occupied housing or rental housing or both. Norway, which has the most complete example of dual-income tax system, also has a high level of domestic savings invested in residential property compared to financial assets. The same observation has been made of New Zealand. Norway also has significant tax preferences relating to housing, such as: • Non-taxation of imputed rental income combined with a deduction for mortgage interest expense; • Non-taxation of capital gains on owner-occupied housing; and 12 Tax and Economic Growth, Economics Department Working Paper No. 620, OECD (2008) Treasury:2366671 v1 0 9 Trea sury:2366671v10 10 • A wealth t ax on all capital (includ ing housing ) bu t calculated in such a way t ha t the eff ective t ax rate on housing cap ital is lower t han t he eff ective t ax rate on othe r cap ital. 44. This suggests t ha t a low income t ax rate on capital income alone (or other measures con side red elsewhe re in t his report such as cutt ing personal t ax rates) will not ne cess aril y corr ect f or an y preferen ces f or investmen t in housing ; instead these should be address ed more directly. 13 Non-Economic Ass ess men t 45. I n a steady state a dual income t ax would t end t o be a less progress ive t ax structure, becau se individuals who earn a high level of capital income compa red t o labour income t end t o be wealthier t han ind ividuals who ea rn predomina tely labour income. 46. The need t o diff eren tiate be tween labour and cap ital income at t he pe rsonal level requires rules t o distinguish capital and labour income, and also t o distinguish normal capital returns f rom very high capital t ax returns (as t his is oft en bundled with labour income in a way t hat cannot be separated ). Such a system would significan tly increa se complexity, compli ance costs and administration costs compared t o t he curr en t system, and lead t o con siderab le arbitrage risk ass ociated with ha ving people reclass ify labour income as cap ital income. Reform E: All owance for Corporate Equity Context 47. An all owan ce f or corporate equity (ACE), as recommended f or t he UK by t he Mirr lees Review, only t axes above-normal returns on equity capital, and does no t tax normal returns. I n its f ull f orm it also includes a rate of return all owance (RRA) for normal returns t o investmen t at t he individual level, which was also included in the Mirr lees Review’s recommendation s. This wou ld also be a f undamen tal change to New Zea land’s t ax system. DZ Modelli ng Results 48. The ACE/RRA reform ha s been modell ed by reducing t he t ax rate t o zero on normal corpo rate returns and on interest and dividends ea rned by ind ividuals. Abo ve-no rmal returns (which are ass umed t o exist only in t he imperfectly compe titive company sector) would con tinue t o be t axed . The t otal cost of t he reform is estimated t o be around $9bn p.a. - $1 billi on of t his cost ha s been met through reduced go vernmen t t ran sfers t o households (so it is consisten t with other reforms presen ted) with t he remainder of t he cost met by increasing remaining income t ax rates.

The model used to inform much of this report is an overlapping-generations dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, originally designed for a closed economy by George Zodrow and John Diamond. They have extended the model to an open economy for New Zealand. This model allows the calculation of changes to GOP, savings, utility, and other economic variables due to the tax changes considered in the model. It also provides a guide to understanding the indirect effects of the tax changes, some of which are counter-intuitive at first glance. 57. The economy is made up of five sectors: the perfectly competitive corporate, imperfectly competitive corporate (to reflect the presence of location-specific economic rents in New Zealand), a non-corporate sector, rental housing, and owner-occupied housing sector. Firms in each sector uses capital and labour to produce goods and maximise the value of the sector, based on the dividends each sector provides to investors. Capital and goods can be both imported and exported from the corporate sectors. Individuals, in the model, work for 45 years then retire and live off their savings for 1 0 years before dying and leaving a bequest to younger generations. They maximise their lifetime utility from consumption, leisure, and bequests. The government taxes personal income, corporate income, consumption, and some types of capital gains, then use the funds primarily for government consumption. The money flows modelled in the Diamond and Zodrow model are shown in Figure 1 below. bequests Generations capital (FDI) Production International Figure 1: Money flows in the Diamond and Zodrow model. Note that, as this is a money flows diagram, the arrows labelled "capital" refer to the return from capital, rather than the capital itself. Treasury:2366671 v1 0 13 Trea sury:2366671v10 14 58. The model parameters were t aken f rom New Zea land da ta when po ss ible, and t he model starts f rom a presumed equili brium of 2007 (the latest year f or which we had complete da ta). The model t hen calculates a new equili brium ba sed on a t ax change. When t ax changes are implemen ted t he revenue loss is made up eithe r from changes t o lump-sum governmen t t ransfers (fisc all y neutral changes) or by making proportional, off sett ing changes t o income t ax rates t o make t he reform revenue neutral. This varies by t ax reform bu t is noted in t he disc uss ion of t he results f or each sc enario. Interpretation of economic welfare 59. Economic welfare, in t he DZ model, is represen ted by a li fetime utili ty f un ction of consumption, leisure, and t he bequest left for f uture generations. Utili ty does not have a measureable value , just a compa rative ranking . Therefore t he cho ice of mathe matical f un ction is arbitrary provided t he utili ty f unction ranks diff erent op tions in a suitable way, (e.g. more leisure means more utili ty all else equal). Because of this f ea ture, a 3.1% improvemen t in utili ty will no t necess aril y make people 3.1% happier – t he only t hing t his nu mber can say is t hat people ha ve a grea ter improvemen t in utili ty (and by proxy , economic welfare) t han if t he reform ga ve a 2.4% improvemen t in utili ty, f or example. Model testing 60. Analys ts f rom Treasury and I R carr ied out robustne ss t esting of t he initial version of the DZ model t o ensure it was suitable f or ou r purpo ses and t o understand t he shortcomings of t he model. This high li ghted a nu mber of iss ue s around how t he open economy pa rt of the model is be ing modell ed , which cen tre around t he calculation of f oreign cap ital (and how it responded t o changes in t he corporate income t ax rate). 61. As a result we made a nu mbe r of improvemen ts t o t he model t o address t he se, and othe r, iss ues and improve t he robustne ss of t he results. The key changes are: • Changing t he production f unctions used in t he model t o give a more rea li stic elasticity of sub stitution be tween cap ital and labour f or New Zealand, and improve model cali bration using New Zealand national acc ounts da ta; • Separately calculating t he aft er- tax rate of return earned by f oreign investors in New Zea land in t he model. This all ows f or a more robust calculation of t he foreign capital f lows in response t o a New Zealand t ax change (foreign cap ital flows had previou sly been based on t he do mestic investors’ rate of return, which included a t erm f or impu tation so does no t properly reflect t he impa ct of a change in corpo rate t ax, f or example); • All owing f oreign cap ital t o be invested as bonds as well as equity. This now all ows t he model t o pick up t he diff eren t rates of return (and diff eren t t ax treatments) of debt vs . equity investmen ts by f oreign investors, and t herefore provide s f or more reali stic f oreign income f lows in t he ba lan ce of paymen ts; and • Updating t he wage profil e so it uses New Zealand da ta and properly incorpo rates t he cohort eff ect of increa sing labour productivity. Trea sury:2366671v10 15 62. Separately, we are con cerned t ha t t he absence of an expli cit exc hange rate in t he model and t he f act t ha t exports are calculated purely t o clea r t he ba lan ce of paymen ts. This means it is li kely t he model is not properly cap turing t he f ull impacts of t ax changes on externa l ba lances. This was no t po ss ible t o address in t he t ime avail ab le bu t is something we can loo k t o refine go ing f orward. 63. Overall t hough we t hink t he model is useful f or drawing broad observations/insigh ts tha t can he lp as part of a broader ass ess men t into each of t he modell ed t ax reforms rathe r t han reporting specific quantified results.

The se include t he elasticity of labour supply, t he elasticity of supply of foreign cap ital and t he ass umption about t he size of economic ren ts. I n addition we ass ess ed changes t o some of the main pa rameters underpinn ing t he model calculation s (such as t he intertempo ral elasticity of substitution and rate of t ime preference). In general t hese ass umption s were varied by ±50 % of t he ir origina l value s t o ass ess changes on model results f or separate changes in t he corporate income t ax rate, pe rsonal income t ax rates and GST rate.

Overall varying t he se key pa rameters did no t materiall y change t he con clusion s of the results and direction of impa ct of t he model results. • The size of model results was most sensitive t o changes in t he intertempo ral elasticity of sub stitution , which is no t surprising given it de termine s how consumption changes over t ime. The ass umption used in t he model is based on existing economic li terature and is a midpoint of t he elasticity value s used in othe r simil ar models.

It is deli be rately complex t o cap ture t he key f ea tures of t he f actors t ha t aff ect how people make housing choices. The heart of t he model is a dynamic, f orward looking maximization problem in which a series of agents who diff er by income, age, and wea lth make choices about t he t ype of housing in which t hey li ve, how much t he y con sume and save, and how much t he y borr ow and lend. These agents have choices over whe the r t o ren t or buy, t o li ve in large or small houses, or t o share housing with othe r people.

Long-term house prices and ren ts are de termined endogenously in the model, and reflect t he interaction of t he de cisions t o supply or demand housing by households, landlords, and a construction sector. 67. The model calculates dynamic steady-state pa ths f or house prices and ren ts, and a set of equili brium housing supply and demand pa tt erns t hat depend on f undamen tal parameters such as interest rates, con struction sector supply elasticities, the inflation rate, and t he f eatures of t he t ax system.

The wide range of international tax planning techniques that are used to achieve such results are collectively referred to as “base erosion and profit shifting” or “BEPS”. The Government has publicly released two tax policy reports on BEPS: one in December 2012 (T2012/3250, PAD2012/268) and one in April 2013 (T2013/927, PAS2013/63). The central concern is that international tax standards have not kept pace with developments in the global economy. It will be difficult for any country, acting alone, to fully address the issue; it is a global problem that requires a global solution. The OECD’s Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting was released on 20 July this year. New Zealand officials participated in the development of the action plan. We strongly support the approach suggested by the OECD and the particular focus and priority given to the actions recommended in the plan. This report provides a summary of some of the key items in the OECD action plan. While we will continue to be closely involved in, and guided by, the OECD work, this does not prevent us from addressing potential deficiencies in New Zealand’s own rules, which we have concerns about. To this end, we recommend that initiatives to protect the New Zealand tax base from BEPS should be a key focus when developing the next 18-month tax policy work programme.

The current work programme has resources allocated to develop BEPS projects and as previously noted we recommend this remain a key focus. We will discuss with you how these projects can be prioritised and sequenced to fit within the current and future resource allocations that support the BEPS initiatives. We expect to identify an initial tranche of projects that can be added to the work programme when it is updated in September. Once we have established a sequence we intend to report separately on each specific proposal. Every proposal needs to be evaluated on its merits taking into account relevant trade-offs. In particular, the benefit of increased base protection from a proposed reform needs to be weighed against any adverse implications in terms of overall economic efficiency including increases in compliance costs. Any resulting reform needs to be consistent with the “broad base low rate” framework. In addition, the decision to proceed with any proposals for reforms relating to BEPS needs to be evaluated more generally in the context of all of the Government’s priorities on the tax policy work programme. Finally, if you decide a proposal for reform will be added to the work programme, it should be subject to the normal consultation process under the generic tax policy process. Improving the disclosure of tax information While it is important to ensure international and domestic tax rules are robust and fit-for- purpose, it is equally important that tax authorities have the information they need to assess specific revenue risks and identify any deficiencies in how these tax rules operate in practice. We have identified a set of other measures that could be implemented to improve the quality and usefulness of tax information collected by Inland Revenue:  Improve information disclosure for large corporates.  Require large corporates to file their tax returns earlier.  Align information disclosure for approved issuer levies (AIL) with non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) disclosure requirements. In Confidence PAS2013/152: Taxation of Multinationals Page 4 In addition, we suggest that Inland Revenue should consult with corporates on introducing a voluntary code of practice to promote good behaviour.

The global international tax framework reflected in tax treaties and countries’ domestic law assumes that multinational corporates will be taxed somewhere on their cross-border income. As mentioned in our report in December 2012, it is envisaged that income will be taxed either in the country where the income is earned (the source state) or the state where the taxpayer is resident (the residence state). 2. Since late 2012, there has been global media and political reaction to evidence suggesting that some multinationals pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. The wide range of international tax planning techniques that are used to achieve such results are collectively referred to as “base erosion and profit shifting” or “BEPS”. 3. The problem is that international tax standards have not kept pace with developments in the global economy. For example, multinational profits increasingly relate to brands, intellectual property or digital services that can be located anywhere in the world. Other problems arise from complex interactions between different countries’ tax rules. 4. For these reasons, it will be difficult for any single country, acting alone, to fully address the issue. This is a global problem that requires a global solution. 5. The OECD has been leading the global response and has recently produced an action plan that identifies 15 specific actions that OECD member countries and G20 nations will work together to implement. 6. Although BEPS is a global problem, it can affect New Zealand’s ability to collect tax. If other countries do not effectively tax their multinationals, this may have a knock-on effect of giving these multinationals incentives to shift profits or minimise their taxable presence in New Zealand (and therefore pay no tax anywhere in the world). 7. In New Zealand, there has been significant media and corporate interest in BEPS and the Government’s response. The Government has publicly released two tax policy reports on BEPS: one in December 2012 (T2012/3250, PAD2012/268) and one April 2013 (T2013/927, PAS2013/63). The OECD’s action plan 8. Inland Revenue and Treasury officials are closely involved in an OECD/G20 project that is developing measures that countries can implement to counter BEPS. This work builds on our existing involvement in the OECD tax working parties, which includes chairing the Aggressive Tax Planning Steering Group. In Confidence PAS2013/152: Taxation of Multinationals Page 7 9. The OECD’s action plan is designed to be comprehensive (given there are a wide range of BEPS concerns) and multilateral (as countries can’t address many of the concerns on their own, and there is a risk that poorly co-ordinated or “knee-jerk” reactions could harm cross-border trade and investment). 10. Some of the more significant areas of work are:  considering whether special tax rules are needed to tax digital goods and services that are provided over the internet (Action 1)  reviewing hybrid mismatches, which occur because countries have different tax rules for distinguishing between debt and equity or companies and partnerships (Action 2)  improving rules for controlled foreign companies (CFCs), which allow countries to tax their multinationals on passive/mobile income that they earn through foreign subsidiaries (Action 3)  reviewing domestic rules for limiting interest deductions (for example, thin- capitalisation rules) (Action 4)  preventing the misuse of tax treaties (for example, by investors who shouldn’t qualify for tax relief under a tax treaty) (Action 6)  improving the “permanent establishment” rules for determining when an overseas business has a taxable presence in a foreign country (Action 7)  improving “transfer pricing” rules (which ensure that a market price is paid on related- party transactions), particularly in relation to debt (Action 4) and brands and intellectual property (Actions 8 to 10). 11. In each area of work, the OECD will develop specific recommendations for countries to implement. 12. Some of these recommendations could be implemented through a multilateral agreement or updates to the OECD’s existing guidelines and commentaries (including transfer pricing guidelines and model tax agreement commentary). Such changes will require a broad consensus among OECD and G20 countries. The challenge will be building this consensus in the proposed OECD timeframes. 13. Other recommendations will rely on countries being willing and able to make amendments to their domestic laws. This approach provides countries with more control and flexibility on the specific design of any reforms. There is a risk, however, that some countries may opt out or may delay or water-down their reforms in an effort to attract profits or mobile business activity from countries with tougher rules. 14. New Zealand officials will continue to be closely involved in the OECD work on BEPS and will report to you on any significant developments, including recommendations for improving our international tax policy settings in New Zealand. In Confidence PAS2013/152: Taxation of Multinationals Page 8 Protecting the New Zealand tax base from base erosion and profit shifting 15. The starting point is that, like other countries, New Zealand taxes non-residents on income that is earned (“sourced”) in New Zealand. However, non-resident investors who invest or have operations in New Zealand may have incentives to reduce or eliminate their tax liabilities in New Zealand by shifting income out of New Zealand. 16. New Zealand also taxes its residents on their world-wide income. (The main exception to this rule is firms that have foreign subsidiaries earning “active income” – ie income from manufacturing etc.) However, residents who have operations offshore may seek to reduce their New Zealand tax obligations by shifting income offshore – including by increasing deductions taken in New Zealand. 17. In either case, the result is that income earned in New Zealand, either by non-residents or residents, is not fully taxed in New Zealand. 18. The OECD’s action plan highlights the wide variety of techniques and structures that multinational businesses can use to shift profits away from where the economic activity is carried out and into more lightly taxed entities or countries. 19. New Zealand and other countries have various rules to guard against profit shifting of this nature. The OECD action plan is focused on the use of these rules generally and how to make them work effectively. (Annex 3 provides a table comparing our rules with areas of focus of the OECD action plan.) 20. We will be closely involved in, and guided by, the OECD work. However, this does not prevent us from addressing potential deficiencies in our own rules, which we have concerns about. 21. To this end, we recommend that initiatives to protect the New Zealand tax base from BEPS should be a key area of focus when developing the next 18-month tax policy work programme. 22. Officials have identified a range of initiatives that could be considered in terms of potential additions to the tax policy work programme. These are outlined below and described in detail in Annex 1. Preventing profit shifting using related-party debt  Examine problems with the thin capitalisation and transfer pricing rules that are designed to prevent profit shifting by non-residents who fund their New Zealand investment using related-party debt, that gives rise to deductible interest payments.  Explore whether New Zealand should restrict interest deductions on hybrid instruments where the interest payment is not taxed in the foreign jurisdiction.  Address problems with the application of NRWT on interest on related-party debt. In Confidence PAS2013/152: Taxation of Multinationals Page 9 Removing tax advantages from certain investment vehicles and ensuring effective taxation of offshore investments  Explore the need for an anti-arbitrage rule for offshore entities which allow double non- taxation of income or double deductions of expenditure by taking advantage of differences between countries’ tax rules.  Examine incoherence relating to different tax treatment of “look-through vehicles” and structures.  Design the active income exemption for offshore branches to ensure it does not facilitate profit shifting through repatriation of losses. Ensuring tax rules keep pace with changes in the global economy  Review the tax treatment of foreign trusts.  Explore options for collecting GST on goods and services bought online. 23. The current work programme has resources allocated to develop BEPS projects and as previously noted we recommend this remain a key focus. We will discuss with you how these projects can be prioritised and sequenced to fit within the current and future resource allocations that support the BEPS initiatives. We expect to identify an initial tranche of projects that can be added to the work programme when it is updated in September. 24. Once we have established a sequence we intend to report separately on each specific proposal. Every proposal needs to be evaluated on its merits taking into account relevant trade- offs. In particular, the benefit of increased base protection from a proposed reform needs to be weighed against any adverse implications in terms of overall economic efficiency including increases in compliance costs. Any resulting reform needs to be consistent with the “broad base low rate” framework. 25. In addition, the decision to proceed with any proposals for reforms relating to BEPS needs to be evaluated more generally in the context of all of the Government’s priorities on the tax policy work programme. 26. Finally, if you decide a proposal for reform will be added to the work programme, it should be subject to the normal consultation process under the generic tax policy process. Improving disclosure of tax information 27. The availability of relevant, timely electronic tax and financial information can greatly assist tax authorities in assessing revenue risks and identifying any deficiencies in how tax rules operate in practice. In Confidence PAS2013/152: Taxation of Multinationals Page 10 28. The OECD’s action plan on BEPS has also called for improved transparency of multinationals’ tax affairs. However, this improved transparency is in the context of additional collection and disclosure of information to tax authorities. This includes collecting aggregate statistical data on the extent of BEPS (Action 11), requiring taxpayers to disclose aggressive tax planning arrangements (Action 12), and requiring multinationals to provide all relevant tax authorities with information on the global allocation of their income as well as transfer pricing documentation (Action 13). 29. We have identified a set of initiatives that New Zealand could consider to improve the quality and usefulness of tax information collected by Inland Revenue. The following initiatives are described in more detail in Annex 2:  Improve information disclosure for large corporates.  Require large corporates to file their tax returns earlier.  Align information disclosure for approved issuer levies (AIL) with non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) disclosure requirements. 30. Separately, other countries, including the United Kingdom, South Africa and Spain have sought to encourage large taxpayers to take a public stance against aggressive tax planning by introducing a voluntary code of practice. We believe this is an idea worth exploring, and it is discussed in more detail in Annex 2. 31. In response to public concerns about the amount of tax paid by multinationals, Australia has recently introduced legislation that will require the Australian Taxation Office to publish the tax liabilities of corporate taxpayers with accounting incomes of $100 million or more a year. 1 The rationale for this legislation is that it may put consumer or shareholder pressure on large taxpayers to refrain from aggressive tax planning. One difficulty with this approach is that reported tax liabilities can be low for a variety of other reasons such as prior-year losses or intended tax concessions and in these cases the published information may not be a good indicator of taxpayer behaviour. 32. The Financial Reporting Bill, which is currently awaiting the Committee of the Whole House stage, relaxes some current public reporting rules which apply to subsidiaries of multinationals. This would appear to move in a contrary direction to the Australian proposal by reducing the public availability of some information. We reported to Ministers on this point earlier this year (T2013/1194, PAS2013/79; and T2013/2067, PAS 2013/156 refer) and we understand the matter is under consideration. The issue is one of appropriate trade-offs: on the one hand, the compliance costs the current rules impose on businesses, and on the other, the benefits of public transparency. 1 The legislation still needs to be passed by the Australian Senate In Confidence PAS2013/152: Taxation of Multinationals Page 11 Annex 1 Protecting the New Zealand tax base from base erosion and profit shifting Multinationals shifting profit using related party debt Examine problems with tax rules (thin capitalisation and transfer pricing) designed to prevent profit shifting by non-residents who fund their New Zealand investment using related party debt New Zealand’s thin-capitalisation rules are generally more comprehensive and tighter than rules in other countries. However, the taxation of related-party debt is probably the most significant BEPS issue for New Zealand. Interest expenses paid by borrowers are tax deductible. Accordingly, multinationals have tax incentives to fund their New Zealand operations using debt rather than equity. Another way of looking at it is to view the deductions for interest payments as a means of shifting income to the non-resident parent or another related party. One of the significant ways that multinationals can shift profits offshore is by funding New Zealand operations with excessive levels of debt or by setting a very high interest rate on the debt. Currently we use thin- capitalisation rules to limit the level of debt a New Zealand subsidiary can have. The thin-capitalisation rules place an upper limit on the amount of debt that multi-nationals can stack into their New Zealand operations. Once this limit is breached, any additional interest deductions are denied. Recent reform has focused on strengthening these rules. In 2011 the thin-capitalisation limit on investment into New Zealand by non-residents was reduced from a 75 percent debt-to-asset ratio to a 60 percent ratio. As part of Budget 2013, the Government announced measures to further improve the effectiveness of the thin- capitalisation rules. At present the rules apply only to companies that are majority owned (50 percent or more) by a single non-resident. However, there are situations where multiple non-resident investors, such as private equity investors, can coordinate and act together as if they were a single non-resident investor. The rules are being extended to apply to these situations where investors act together. In addition, shareholder debt will be excluded from the “worldwide group” test, as this ensures the rules are still effective in situations where the ultimate investors have little external debt. These measures will apply from the 2015/16 income year. There may also be other areas, such as with financial intermediaries where, as was the case previously with banks, the existing thin cap rules do not enable an appropriate limitation on the debt funding of the entity. While the thin-capitalisation rules limit levels of debt, transfer pricing rules can be used to challenge related- party transactions that are not conducted on commercial “arm’s-length” terms (such as excessive interest rates). If the price (including an interest rate) for a related-party transaction is too high, we can replace it with the “arm’s-length” price that would be expected from a similar transaction with a third party. The concern we have, however, is that transfer pricing is a complex and resource-intensive process, which may only be effective for the most egregious cases. Moreover, there are structures that may allow the “arm’s-length” price of debt to be artificially inflated, potentially defeating the intent of the transfer pricing rules. An alternative approach could be to directly limit the ability to use high-priced debt. For example, many European countries have thin-capitalisation rules that are based on the ratio of interest deductions to earnings, which effectively combines a limit on the level and price of debt into the one test. New Zealand could consider the pros and cons of this type of rule with a view to possibly bolstering our existing thin-capitalisation rules with a similar approach. As part of its action plan, the OECD will be doing a similar review of the effectiveness of different types of interest limitations (through Action 4 on limiting base erosion via interest deductions and other financial payments). Our involvement in this work will also inform our thinking on what improvements New Zealand could consider. In Confidence PAS2013/152: Taxation of Multinationals Page 12 Another concern in terms of profit shifting using transfer pricing are investors who are “acting together”. In such cases the transfer pricing rules may not apply, even though such investors may have the ability to manipulate prices in order to shift profits out of New Zealand. We plan to review the scope of the transfer pricing rules. For example, the scope of application of the transfer pricing rules could be aligned with the recently announced changes to the scope of application of the thin-capitalisation rules described above. Further analysis and consultation would be needed to consider what changes, if any, would be appropriate. Explore whether New Zealand should restrict interest deductions on hybrid instruments where the interest payment is not taxed in the foreign jurisdiction A hybrid instrument is an instrument that has both equity and debt characteristics. Commonly these instruments will create a tax deduction in one jurisdiction and corresponding untaxed income in another country. This usually is because the country allowing the deduction views the hybrid instrument as debt and the country receiving the payment views it as equity. Currently New Zealand allows deductions for some hybrid instruments but not others, depending on whether or not they are part of a tax avoidance arrangement. Last year we looked at this treatment to determine if it is appropriate. Our conclusion was that the current rules should remain unchanged. However, we noted that Australia had announced that it was planning to change its tax law for hybrid instruments. Depending on how Australia implements this change, it may make it even easier to use hybrid instruments between New Zealand and Australia. Given this, we may need to explore whether New Zealand needs to tighten its rules on when deductions are allowed on hybrid instruments. We note the issue of hybrid instruments has been identified by the OECD as a key area for further work (Action 2 in the OECD’s Action Plan). Address problems with the application of non-resident withholding tax to related party debt There are two ways that we tax non-residents who earn income in New Zealand. We tax net profits by applying company tax. We also apply non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) to gross payments of dividends, interest and royalties made to non-residents. The company tax and NRWT mechanisms work together to tax non-resident investors at appropriate levels. In the absence of NRWT, there would be an increased incentive and ability for multinationals to shift profits offshore by charging interest on borrowing from a related party. This would reduce the amount of profits that would be subject to company tax in New Zealand. Inland Revenue has identified a wide range of arrangements that can be used to defer or circumvent NRWT on related-party interest payments. The concern is that such payments can be used to shift profits out of New Zealand and into low-tax countries or entities. Our concern is that tackling particular arrangements through the disputes process or through specific legislative amendments can be complex and resource-intensive and may not be effective if taxpayers are able to switch to another technique. We propose to explore options for dealing with these issues in a comprehensive way. Any change would need to be carefully designed and consulted on to ensure it did not lead to unintended outcomes. More generally, any reform would need to strike an appropriate balance between reducing the potential for companies to shift profits out of New Zealand and ensuring that New Zealand companies can raise funds for investment, particularly in cases where the funding is ultimately sourced from third-parties. In Confidence PAS2013/152: Taxation of Multinationals Page 13 Removing tax advantages from certain investment vehicles and effective taxation of offshore investments Explore the need for an anti-arbitrage rule for offshore entities who seek double non-taxation of income or double deductions of expenditure by taking advantage of differences between countries’ tax rules. Inland Revenue investigators have identified revenue risks associated with the use of offshore hybrid entities, which are treated as a separate company for foreign tax purposes but are considered to belong to the New Zealand investor (for example, are seen as a partnership) for New Zealand tax purposes. This type of offshore investment can be used to claim the same deduction in two countries. For example an interest payment would be deductible for the foreign company and also deductible for the New Zealand investor. The ability to claim such double deductions can lead to additional deductions being taken in New Zealand and a corresponding reduction in New Zealand income tax. Some other countries prevent these situations from arising by having anti-arbitrage rules for offshore hybrid entities. For example, they classify offshore entities in a way that is consistent with the classification in the country where the entity is formed. Australia has a rule that treats offshore hybrid entities as partnerships for Australian tax purposes. It is important that any measure New Zealand develops is compatible with approaches taken in other countries. The OECD’s action plan includes reviewing hybrid entities and other hybrid mismatches. This review will help guide our work in this area. Examine incoherence relating to different tax treatment of “look through vehicles” and structures New Zealand has a variety of vehicles that are either legally or effectively fiscally transparent. That is, the vehicle or structure enables income from an investment to “flow through” to an investor without any tax imposed at the level of the vehicle. Cross-border, these vehicles can potentially allow overseas investors to earn foreign income via New Zealand without any New Zealand tax. These vehicles include some limited liability companies, look-through companies (LTCs), limited partnerships (LPs), foreign portfolio investment entities (foreign PIEs) and foreign trusts (discussed below). The concern we have is that different tax treatments or consequences arise depending on the type of vehicle used for the investment. In other words, there is a lack of overall coherence across the different sets of rules, and we think this should be explored further. More specifically, rules that apply to protect the New Zealand tax base when either a foreign PIE or ordinary New Zealand company is used, may not apply when an LTC or LP is used. For instance, in 2011 the Government decided to introduce “foreign PIEs” that allow foreign investors to earn foreign income tax-free via New Zealand. But entities must meet certain criteria to become foreign PIEs and are subject to a number of base protection rules (as are companies). Similarly, under some of New Zealand’s tax treaties, a New Zealand subsidiary is able to pay a dividend to a non-resident parent company without paying any NRWT. If that dividend was funded by exempt foreign active income, no New Zealand tax will have been payable. The result is effective flow-through treatment. However, the New Zealand tax base is protected in this scenario by a number of measures that are designed to prevent profit shifting and other abuses, including:  the active/passive distinction in the CFC rules  the thin-capitalisation rules, which limit the amount of interest deductions the New Zealand company can make against any New Zealand income  limitations on the use of foreign losses to offset New Zealand income  “anti-treaty-shopping” rules in our tax treaties, which mean that artificial investment structures cannot access the lower NRWT rates  exchange-of-information articles in our treaties that would allow us to obtain relevant information regarding the non-resident shareholder. In Confidence PAS2013/152: Taxation of Multinationals Page 14 The base protection rules that are relevant to foreign PIEs and to New Zealand companies with foreign shareholders or offshore investments don’t always apply to investors in New Zealand LPs or LTCs. This may be because when LPs and LTCs were introduced, it was not expected that they would be used by foreign investors earning foreign income. However, because LPs and LTCs can be substituted for companies, they can be used to avoid the base protection rules that apply to ordinary companies. That is, they can be used to achieve tax results that could not be obtained through the use of a company or a foreign PIE. We consider that this apparent incoherence in the tax system should be examined. Design the active income exemption for offshore branches to ensure it does not facilitate profit shifting through repatriation of losses New Zealand companies looking to expand into new markets will normally adopt one of two structures. The firm may set up or acquire a separate company in the foreign country, such as a subsidiary or a joint venture with a foreign investment partner. Alternatively, the company may set up a branch office in the foreign country, which would still be part of the New Zealand company. In 2009, offshore companies controlled by New Zealand investors were granted tax relief through a new active income exemption. Most business income earned through an offshore subsidiary is no longer subject to New Zealand tax. Passive income is still taxable which limits the ability to use foreign subsidiaries for profit shifting. Similarly, business losses incurred by the offshore subsidiary would not be available to the New Zealand company. The overall effect of these reforms was to bring New Zealand’s international tax rules into line with international norms. In 2011, the new rules were extended to joint ventures and other offshore companies that New Zealand companies had a substantial interest in but did not control. Officials are currently preparing an issues paper on extending the same tax treatment to New Zealand companies which operate offshore branches. This will put New Zealand companies with offshore branches on an equal footing with New Zealand companies with offshore subsidiaries. That is, active business conducted through offshore branches will be exempt from New Zealand tax. What this also means is that key base maintenance features that apply under the new international tax rules will be extended to the new offshore branch rules. Under both the existing active income exemption available for offshore subsidiaries, and the proposed exemption for offshore branches, the “passive” income of the business (such as interest, royalties and rents) remains liable for tax. This removes the incentive that firms would otherwise have to shift this highly mobile income out of New Zealand and into a low-tax jurisdiction. Importantly, net losses of active branches would become non-deductible in New Zealand. Currently, net losses may be deductible in the country where the branch is located and in New Zealand. This would also prevent a common tax planning technique, where foreign operations by a New Zealand company are first undertaken in branch form, generating losses deductible in New Zealand, but then shifted to company form when the business becomes profitable, so the profits of the same activity are not subject to New Zealand tax. It also follows that New Zealand companies with interests in offshore companies are not able to offset New Zealand income with losses generated in those entities. Offshore branches will be subject to similar rules to prevent their losses being used to reduce New Zealand income. Furthermore, New Zealand firms with significant shareholdings in offshore companies are also subject to the thin capitalisation rules. These rules place a cap on the amount of interest that can be deducted against New Zealand income. The rules will be extended to New Zealand firms with offshore branches. Overall, the application of the key base maintenance features of the international tax rules is the quid pro quo of an active income exemption for branches. It also ensures that the decision of whether or not to invest through a subsidiary or a branch is not affected by tax considerations. In Confidence PAS2013/152: Taxation of Multinationals Page 15 Ensuring tax rules keep pace with changes in the global economy Review the tax treatment of foreign trusts New Zealand taxes trusts if the settlor is, or was, a New Zealand resident. Accordingly, the question of whether the income of a trust is in the New Zealand tax base turns on the residence of the settlor as opposed to the trustee. These trust rules were originally intended to prevent New Zealand settlors avoiding tax on foreign- sourced income by establishing trusts with foreign trustees. It follows from the general design of our trust rules that a “foreign trust” is a trust that does not have a New Zealand-resident settlor. Consistent with the general policy of not taxing the foreign-sourced income of a non- resident, the trustee income of a foreign trust is not taxable in New Zealand if it has a foreign source. (A foreign trust is therefore only taxed on New Zealand-sourced income, or if it has New Zealand-resident beneficiaries.) A foreign trust may be established under New Zealand law and/or be administered from New Zealand. It may also have one or more New Zealand resident trustees. The fact that New Zealand does not tax the foreign income of foreign trusts has resulted in the development of a significant “offshore trust” industry in New Zealand. Other factors also contribute to the development of this industry, such as the fact that New Zealand is a stable, English-speaking country, with a strong rule of law and a well-developed body of trust case law. There is no central registry for trusts in New Zealand. Given the size of the offshore industry that has developed, Inland Revenue introduced disclosure and record-keeping requirements for foreign trusts in 2006. These rules were intended to maintain transparency and to enable us to fulfil our exchange-of-information obligations under our tax treaties. However, our foreign trust rules continue to attract criticism, including claims that New Zealand is now a tax haven in respect of trusts. This is largely because the mismatch between our rules and those of other countries may result in income not being taxed either in New Zealand or offshore. To protect our international reputation, it may be necessary to strengthen our regulatory framework for disclosure and record-keeping. This would result in increased administration costs for Inland Revenue and divert compliance resources away from the general business of collecting New Zealand tax. This, in turn, raises the question of whether our foreign trust rules are sustainable. We will report to you on this matter, including whether keeping the existing tax treatment of foreign trusts is sustainable in the long term. Explore options to collect GST on goods and services bought online The internet has made it possible for certain business activities (such as internet sales) to be performed anywhere in the world. The OECD’s action plan includes a project (action 1) to consider whether special rules are needed to tax digital goods and services. The OECD will establish a special taskforce on the digital economy will look at a range of income tax issues, as well as “how to ensure the effective collection of VAT/GST with respect to the cross- border supply of digital goods and services.” Inland Revenue, the Treasury and the New Zealand Customs Service are currently preparing an issues paper examining the growth of online shopping, its impacts on the tax system, and the potential options for improving the collection of GST on online sales. This work includes looking at physical goods that are purchased from offshore websites as well as at digital goods and services. The issues paper will be released later this year and is intended to be the starting point for a full and open discussion on the issue. Feedback received on the paper will inform how we proceed. In Confidence PAS2013/152: Taxation of Multinationals Page 16 Annex 2 Improving disclosure of tax information Consider introducing a code of practice for large corporates Codes of practice are a form of voluntary self-regulation where organisations commit to a set of principles that promote good behaviour. The codes are typically brief documents that are high-level and aspirational rather than detailed and prescriptive. Codes for large corporates have been introduced in other countries, including the United Kingdom, South Africa and Spain. In 2009, the UK introduced the Code of Practice on Taxation for Banks, which encouraged banks to follow the spirit as well as the letter of the law. The code asks banks to:  adopt adequate governance to control the types of transactions they enter into  not undertake tax planning that aims to achieve a tax result that is contrary to the intentions of Parliament  comply fully with all their tax obligations  maintain a transparent relationship with HM Revenue & Customs. By November 2010, the top 15 banks in the UK had adopted the voluntary code. By May 2013, over 250 institutions had signed up. Codes of practice work best when they are transparent and visible. Organisations that sign up can publicise their adoption of the code as evidence of their good behaviour. Investors and consumers may question organisations that choose not to adopt the code, or they may choose to only invest in code- compliant organisations. Investors, consumers and media will be able to use the code as a framework to challenge decisions made by the organisation when those decisions appear contrary to the principles of the code. Improving information disclosure for large companies New Zealand’s disclosure requirements are light compared to those of other jurisdictions. While most large corporates provide their financial statements with their returns, this information is not easily scrutinised, and Inland Revenue is unable to efficiently or effectively carry out in-depth analytical work. As these statements do not follow a prescribed format or contain a standard set of information, Inland Revenue often needs to request additional information from taxpayers. This places additional compliance costs on businesses, which, as the requests are made on an ad-hoc basis, can be difficult to plan for. Inland Revenue envisages a short (one or two page) electronic declaration that would collect essential information only. The information could include:  key performance metrics  specific high-risk items (for example, cross-border interest payments)  group membership details. Additional compliance costs can be minimised by focusing on information that is already collected in their structure charts, financial statements and tax reconciliations. This targeted approach would compare favourably with other jurisdictions. Australia, for example, requires a very detailed 13-page disclosure from any business with overseas dealings. In the BEPS action plan, the OECD has recommended that countries establish methodologies to collect and analyse data on the scale and economic impact of BEPS. Receiving this additional information from large corporates and multinationals will help New Zealand meet this action point. In Confidence PAS2013/152: Taxation of Multinationals Page 17 Requiring large corporates to file their tax returns earlier Most large corporates, including multinationals, must file their tax returns by 31 March following the end of the tax year. Depending on their balance date, this gives them six to 18 months from the end of their accounting year to prepare their returns. This length of time is generous compared to other jurisdictions. Large corporates will generally have finalised their financial accounts well ahead of their return filing date in order to satisfy other obligations. These could include tax returns for other jurisdictions, disclosures to shareholders and returns to the Companies Office. The Financial Reporting Bill currently before the House proposes to give large companies just five months to file their annual report to the Companies Office. Earlier filing would allow faster detection of transactions and trends that may highlight specific risks to the tax base which will lead to earlier investigations and quicker remedial law changes if required. Aligning AIL information disclosure with NRWT disclosure requirements Another area where information disclosure could be improved is when the approved issuer levy (AIL) is paid. The AIL is an alternative to paying NRWT on interest payments to non-resident lenders who are not related to the New Zealand borrower. Taxpayers do not currently file NRWT withholding certificates in cases where they pay the AIL. It is proposed that AIL payers should be required to file an NRWT withholding certificate at the end of each tax year. This will make it easier for Inland Revenue to verify the correct application of the NRWT and AIL rules and to fulfil exchange-of-information requests under our tax treaties.

We reported to you on the taxation of multinational companies in December 2012 (T2012/3250, PAD2012/268 refers). A key message of that report was that these were global concerns which required a co-ordinated global response. 2. Actions that we are taking to address multinational tax concerns fall into several categories: • Contributing to the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project. • Reviewing our domestic law and prioritising projects which protect the New Zealand tax base from multinational profit-shifting. • Co-ordinating with Australia on their review, the OECD BEPS work and other multinational tax issues. 3. This report updates you on progress in these areas. Contributing to the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project (BEPS) 4. The OECD has been directed by the G20 to develop an action plan for addressing concerns that some multinationals appear to be able to use certain tax structures and strategies in order to pay little tax anywhere in the world. 5. This project published its first report, Addressing Base Erosion and Profit Shifting in February. The OECD report identified some of the ways in which multinationals shift profits and reviewed the existing research on the scale of the problem. This report was designed to develop a common understanding of the problem and to build a consensus on the need to develop appropriate policy responses. 6. The next phase of the BEPS project is the development of an action plan which will be considered by tax authorities from the OECD and participating non-member countries (such as India and China) at the Committee for Fiscal Affairs meeting in June 2013. The action plan T2013/927, PAS2013/63: Taxation of Multinationals: Update Page 1 In Confidence will (i) identify actions needed to address BEPS, (ii) set deadlines to implement these actions and (iii) identify the resources needed and the methodology to implement these actions. 7. So far the work has concentrated on scoping the main ways in which multinationals engage in BEPS and outlining a menu of possible options for dealing with this. 8. In their February report the OECD indicated that the action plan is likely to include proposals on: • Instruments to put an end to or neutralise the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements and arbitrage. • Rules on the treatment of intra-group financial transactions, such as those related to the deductibility of payments and the application of withholding taxes. • Improvements or clarifications to transfer pricing rules to address specific areas where the current rules produce undesirable results from a policy perspective. The current work on intangibles, which is a particular area of concern, would be included in a broader reflection on transfer pricing rules. • Updated solutions to the issues related to jurisdiction to tax, in particular in the areas of digital goods and services. These solutions may extend to a revision of treaty provisions. • More effective anti-avoidance measures, as a complement to the previous items. Anti-avoidance measures can be included in domestic laws or included in international instruments. Examples of these measures include General Anti- Avoidance Rules, Controlled Foreign Companies rules, Limitation of benefits rules and other anti-treaty abuse provisions. • Solutions to counter harmful regimes more effectively, taking into account factors such as transparency and substance. 9. The options noted in the OECD report range from fairly targeted rules to address BEPS (such as thin cap, anti-hybrid and anti-avoidance rules) to more fundamental questions about allocating taxing rights under DTAs (permanent establishment, withholding tax rates) and options to improve the effectiveness of CFC and transfer pricing rules. Some of the more targeted rules could be applied by each country unilaterally improving their domestic laws, but many of the options will be easier to implement if there is a co-ordinated response (for example some countries may be reluctant to tighten their domestic rules if they are concerned that businesses will shift investment or headquarters into countries with weaker rules). 10. Details on the final form of the action plan and how it will be implemented are currently under consideration. New Zealand is contributing to these discussions. We note that the OECD brings together a very high level of tax expertise and has a major influence on international tax policy. For example it maintains the most influential model tax treaty and transfer pricing guidelines. The BEPS work builds on the success that the OECD has recently T2013/927, PAS2013/63: Taxation of Multinationals: Update Page 2 In Confidence had in improving exchange of tax information between countries through its Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information in Tax Matters. Prioritising projects which protect the New Zealand tax base 11. New Zealand has a range of existing measures which address BEPS concerns. These were discussed in the Annex 2 of our December 2012 report. 12. New Zealand's rules and enforcement of multinational taxation are generally considered to be at or above world standards. 13. However, it is important to continue to review these rules to identify and address any gaps and weaknesses and ensure the rules stay up-to-date with international developments. 14. To this end, we are currently consulting on a package of proposals to increase the effectiveness of the thin capitalisation rules. These rules will be included in an August 2013 tax bill. 15. We have also identified several issues that can affect New Zealand's ability to collect withholding tax, particularly on interest payments. This project is still at the research stage, we will report to you once some options have been developed. 16. We expect that our involvement in the OECD BEPS project will help to identify other areas where New Zealand could improve its rules. For example many countries have specific rules for dealing with arbitrage caused by hybrid mismatches, the OECD work could help New Zealand to review the experiences of other countries and consider similar rules. Co-ordinating with Australia 17. New Zealand officials have been in regular contact with our counterparts at the Australian Treasury to share views on the OECD developments and related matters. 18. New Zealand officials are visiting the Australian Treasury next week to continue our engagement and to discuss latest developments. Australian review of multinational taxation 19. As mentioned in our report in December, the Australian government has announced it will publish a scoping paper that will set out the risks to the sustainability of Australia's corporate tax base from multinational tax minimisation strategies and identify potential responses. The Australian government's scoping paper will be informed by a specialist reference group, made up of experts from business, tax professionals, academics and the community sector. 20. A consultation paper is expected to be released for comment in late April. We understand that the scoping paper will be released in late June. T2013/927, PAS2013/63 Taxation of Multinationals: Update Page 3 In Confidence Reporting tax paid by large companies 21. In addition to their more general review, the Australian Government is seeking input on proposals to improve the transparency of corporate tax information. These proposals are motivated in part by BEPS as well as other domestic law considerations. 22. Last week, a discussion document was released seeking submissions on three proposals: • A proposal that the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) would publish a list of the names, total income, taxable income and income tax payable of companies with over $100m of total income. In addition, the ATO would also publish the names of companies that pay the new Minerals Resource Rent Tax or the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax and how much of each of these taxes they pay. • A proposal to publish aggregate collections for each type of Australian tax even if this information could be used to deduce tax paid by a particular taxpayer. • A proposal to enable greater information sharing between the ATO and the Treasury with respect to foreign acquisition and investment decisions affecting Australia. 23. In New Zealand, the issue of requiring certain companies to publish tax information has not been formally considered to date. We will discuss this issue further with you in the context of the Financial Reporting Bill. We note that the Financial Reporting Bill which is currently under consideration will require companies with more than $30m of revenue or $60m of assets (in each of the previous two years) to file their financial statements with the Companies Office. The Companies Office then publishes these statements (which include accounting measures of tax paid) on their website.

Fact sheet May 2013 TRANS-TASMAN PORTABILITY OF RETIREMENT SAVINGS HOW THE NEW RULES WORK Key features The retirement savings portability arrangements have been developed to allow transfers of retirement savings between certain Australian superannuation funds and New Zealand KiwiSaver funds.  Participation is voluntary for KiwiSaver members and scheme providers.  Retirement savings may only be transferred between a KiwiSaver scheme and an Australian complying superannuation scheme regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).  A KiwiSaver member must permanently migrate to Australia to be able to transfer their retirement savings.  Any KiwiSaver member tax credits and the $1,000 kick-start payment may be transferred to Australia.  A KiwiSaver member will not be able to withdraw any retirement savings in cash upon permanent migration to Australia, as can be done one year after the person migrates to a country other than Australia.  An amount of Australian-sourced retirement savings transferred to a KiwiSaver scheme under the portability arrangements will be treated as exempt from tax at the point of entry.  Australian-sourced retirement savings will be subject to certain Australian complying scheme rules, including a minimum retirement age of 60. These savings cannot be withdrawn to purchase a first home. Questions and answers Why is retirement savings portability being implemented? The New Zealand and Australian labour, financial, and goods and services markets are highly integrated by international standards. Retirement savings portability is part of the Single Economic Market (SEM) work programme, which builds on our existing relationship and aims to reduce barriers that may impede the movement of people, trade and capital across the Tasman. The introduction of retirement savings portability supports and adds to the degree of integration between the two countries by allowing New Zealanders and Australians to consolidate their financial affairs in their country of residence. When will the portability arrangements take effect? The arrangements take effect from 1 July 2013. What kind of transfers will be allowed under the portability arrangements?  Savings that are held in a New Zealand KiwiSaver scheme may be transferred to Australia. This means savings in all other funds (including complying funds) or other retirement funds cannot be transferred. Fact sheet May 2013  The arrangements will allow individuals to transfer all their savings held in a KiwiSaver fund, including member tax credits and the $1,000 kick-start from the Government.  The portability arrangements will be the only way of making a transfer of KiwiSaver funds to Australia. This means individuals will no longer be able to withdraw their savings as cash one year after permanently migrating to Australia. However, as noted above, you will be able to transfer the amount of member tax credits you have accumulated. The current KiwiSaver rules require you to return your member tax credits to the Government if you withdraw your savings as cash.  KiwiSaver funds can only be transferred to Australian complying schemes regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). This means you cannot transfer your savings to an Australian self-managed superannuation fund. For more information on which Australian schemes apply, go to http://www.apra.gov.au/Super/Pages/default.aspx  Retirement savings transferred from Australia may only be transferred into KiwiSaver funds in New Zealand. This means Australian savings cannot be transferred into any other private retirement funds (including complying funds). If I move to Australia, can I leave my savings in KiwiSaver instead of transferring them? Yes. Transferring your savings to Australia when you migrate is optional. However any contributions you make to your KiwiSaver account while living offshore will not be eligible for member tax credits. If I transfer my savings to Australia, when will I be able to access them? You will be able to access your KiwiSaver funds at the age of entitlement to New Zealand superannuation. Currently this is at 65 years of age. Any earnings on these KiwiSaver funds as well as contributions made while in Australia will be subject to all Australian rules regarding access to funds. Which country’s rules will apply to savings transferred between the two countries? In general the rules of the host country scheme will apply. However there are certain differences that will be applied to transferred savings in order to protect the integrity of the respective schemes. These differences apply only to the savings that are transferred, and not to any subsequent earnings on these transfers. The key differences are set out in the table below: New Zealand KiwiSaver funds transferred to Australia: Australian funds transferred to New Zealand: May not be accessed until the New Zealand age of retirement (65 years). May not be accessed until age 60 and the individual satisfies the Australian definition of retirement at that age. May not be transferred into Australian self- managed superannuation funds. May not be used to assist with the purchase of a first home. May not be transferred to a third country. May not be transferred to a third country. Fact sheet May 2013 If I transfer savings from Australia, can I use those funds to put towards buying a first home? As noted in the table above, funds transferred from Australia cannot be used to buy a first home. This is consistent with Australia’s policy regarding superannuation funds. In addition, any savings transferred from Australia will not count towards your eligibility for the deposit subsidy.

Any savings transferred between the countries must be separately identified within an individual’s retirement savings account. Can I transfer my savings to Australia even if I don’t migrate there? You can only transfer funds to Australia if you permanently migrate. Before transferring your funds, your KiwiSaver scheme provider will require proof that you are residing in Australia. Can I transfer some savings to Australia and leave some in New Zealand? No. If you choose to transfer your savings to Australia when you migrate, you must transfer them all. This avoids the proliferation of small and inactive accounts which are costly to administer. If I transfer savings from Australia, can I withdraw these for reasons of significant financial hardship or on compassionate grounds, such as serious illness? Australian savings transferred to New Zealand will be subject to New Zealand rules regarding hardship access. Likewise, New Zealand savings transferred to Australia will be subject to Australian rules regarding early access. Does my KiwiSaver provider have to accept my funds from Australia if requested? It is not compulsory for scheme providers to receive funds from Australia. However KiwiSaver members are able to transfer their savings to a KiwiSaver scheme that does offer this facility. Do I have to transfer my savings if I move to Australia or vice versa? No, the arrangements are voluntary. Will New Zealand tax any transfers from New Zealand to Australia or vice versa? No. Will Australia tax any transfers? Australia will not specifically tax the transfer of retirement savings to or from New Zealand. However at the initial point of entry into the Australian superannuation system, transfers of New Zealand savings will be subject to Australia’s rules regarding Fact sheet May 2013 the taxation of retirement savings contributions greater than $150,000 per annum. This is known as the non-concessional contributions cap. For more information on this cap go to: http://www.ato.gov.au/superfunds/content.asp?doc=/content/00106372.htm&page=6& H6 Australian-sourced retirement savings, and any New Zealand-sourced retirement savings re-entering Australia, will be exempted from these rules upon re-entering the Australian superannuation system. Is there a difference in the rate of tax on earnings between Australia and New Zealand? Yes, Australia generally has a flat rate of 15% on earnings. The New Zealand tax rate on superannuation earnings generally ranges from 10.5% to 28%. It is also not straightforward to make a comparison between the two tax regimes because of other factors. For example, Australia also taxes capital gains on equities whereas New Zealand does not tax capital gains on Australasian equities. There are also other advantages to transferring your retirement savings to your country of residence, such as being able to consolidate your financial affairs and not pay multiple sets of fees.
