IR265 January 2022 General depreciation rates The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. 2 GENERAL DEPRECIATION RATES Introduction General depreciation rates This guide sets out the general depreciation rates for both diminishing value (DV) and straight line (SL) that apply to assets acquired in the 2006 and later tax years. Inland Revenue sets the depreciation rates in the form of general and provisional determinations for all depreciable assets, other than fixed-life intangible depreciable assets or excluded depreciable assets, based on an asset's estimated useful life. New determinations and provisional determinations are published on ird.govt.nz and in our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB). For more detailed information on fixed-life intangible assets see the Depreciation - a guide for business - IR260. Excluded depreciable assets must be depreciated using the historic rates - see our guide Historic depreciation rates - IR267, available on our website ird.govt.nz under "Forms and guides". Our online depreciation rate finder allows you to quickly search for assets across all industry and asset categories. The depreciation rates are set out in industry and asset categories. Assets which are unique to one or two specific industries are listed under the industry category. Assets which are typically used in a variety of different industries (for example, tanks, boilers and heating) are listed under the asset category. Assets are listed alphabetically within each industry and asset category. The following details are shown for each asset: • Column 1 - the estimated useful life • Column 2 - the DV rate • Column 3 - the SL rate Depreciation loading Before 21 May 2010, a 20% loading could be applied to the DV or SL depreciation rate in certain cases. The loading accelerated the depreciation of eligible assets. It generally applied to new assets never used or held for use in New Zealand and imported second-hand assets. The asset must have been purchased after the beginning of the 1995-96 income year. For buildings, imported used cars, second-hand assets acquired in New Zealand and depreciable intangible property, the 20% loading didn't apply. Any asset purchased on or after 21 May 2010 isn't entitled to the 20% depreciation loading. However, if you entered into a contract to purchase an asset on or before 20 May 2010, you can still depreciate this asset with the loading. Any asset being depreciated at a rate with loading before 21 May 2010 can continue to be depreciated at that rate for that asset's lifetime. However, if there is a capital improvement to an asset with the 20% loading, this improvement will need to be depreciated separately from the original asset, and will be depreciated without the loading allowance. The general depreciation rates, including the 20% loading, are listed in the table on the following page. Special rules that apply to buildings Buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005 must apply the rates from the 2005-06 year except: • buildings acquired as relationship property or under a wholly owned group company transfer that the previous owner depreciated using the old building depreciation rates - in which case those rates continue to apply, and • buildings that were purchased, or to be built, and the relevant contract was signed prior to 19 May 2005, the old building depreciation rates also continue to apply. ird.govt.nz 3 2006 and future years asset rates Assets other than buildings acquired on or after 1 April 2005 Buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005\*\* DV rate (%)DV rate +20% loading (%)\* SL rate (%)SL rate +20% loading (%)\* DV rate (%)SL rate (%) 22.41.51.81.31 44.833.632 67.244.84.53 89.667.26.54 101278.48.55 1315.68.510.2116.5 1619.210.512.613.58 202413.516.200 253017.52100 30362125.200 4048303600 5060404800 6780.46780.400 10010010010000 10010010010000 \* The 20% depreciation loading doesn't apply to assets acquired after 20 May 2010. \*\* For buildings, depreciation will reduce to 0% from the 2011-12 income year where they have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. Between the 2012 and 2020 income years, depreciation on buildings was reduced to 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applied to both commercial and residential properties, including leasehold property, and regardless of when the building was acquired. For the 2021 and subsequent income years, the depreciation rates of 2% DV and 1.5% SL were introduced for non-residential buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. Although a 0% depreciation rate continues to apply to residential buildings, they remain in the tax base and when they are sold for more than the book value, an adjustment will be required for any depreciation (claimed prior to the 2012 income year) recovery. Estimated useful life The estimated useful life of an asset is the period over which an asset might reasonably be expected to be useful in earning income in New Zealand. The fact that an asset may have been previously used for a purpose other than deriving income (for example, private use) or carrying on a business overseas won't reduce its estimated useful life. Maximum depreciation claims Whether you're using the straight line (SL) or diminishing value (DV) method you can't claim depreciation in excess of the cost price/value of the depreciable asset. To make sure you don't claim more depreciation than you're entitled to, you need to keep a track of the adjusted tax value of the asset. You'll need to keep a fixed assets register with the following information: • a description of the asset • original purchase price or valuation • date the asset was acquired and the date in service • estimated useful life of asset • depreciation method to be used for the asset • percentage of private use if any • the adjusted tax value for each year. You use this information to complete a depreciation schedule. 4 GENERAL DEPRECIATION RATES Example 1 April 2011 Simone purchases a dishwasher for $1,200, used 100% for business. Using the straight line depreciation method the rate is 13.5%. Original cost Depreciation rate Depreciation claimed Adjusted tax value Year 1$1,20013.5%$162.00$1,038 Year 2$1,20013.5%$162.00$876 Year 3$1,20013.5%$162.00$714 Year 4$1,20013.5%$162.00$552 Year 5$1,20013.5%$162.00$390 Year 6$1,20013.5%$162.00$228 Year 7$1,20013.5%$162.00$66 Year 8$1,20013.5%$66$0.00 Simone can claim $162.00 for the first seven years. However, in the eighth year the final claim is $66.00. This is because the dishwasher's adjusted tax value is less than the original calculated depreciation of $162.00. The amount of depreciation claimed can't exceed the adjusted tax value so no further depreciation can be claimed on the dishwasher after year seven. Buildings and building fit-out asset categories The term "building" can have various meanings depending on the context in which the term is used. A building in ordinary circumstances is defined as: • a structure of considerable size • permanent in the sense that it's intended to last a considerable time • enclosed by walls and a roof • able to function independently of any other structure. However, a building is not necessarily a physically separate structure. Interpretation statement 10/02 "Meaning of 'building' in the depreciation provisions" provides a full explanation and can be found in the Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 22, No 5 (June 2010). The chattels and fit-out of a building, where it doesn't form part of the building, can still be depreciated. Interpretation statement 10/01 "Residential rental properties - Depreciation of items of depreciable property" sets out a three-step test that Inland Revenue will apply to determine whether an item can be separated out or whether it's seen as being part of the building. You can find this in the Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 22, No 4 (May 2010). How to find the right rate Follow this step-by-step process to find the right depreciation rate. 1. See the "Industry" category list in the contents pages. If there is an appropriate industry category for your industry and your asset is listed there, use that depreciation rate (either DV or SL), otherwise go to step 2. 2. See the "Asset" category list in the contents pages. If there is an appropriate asset category and your asset is listed, use that depreciation rate (either DV or SL), otherwise go to step 3. 3. If the asset is listed under an industry category (step 1) which isn't your main industry, and you use the asset in a similar way to the industry shown, use that depreciation rate (either DV or SL), otherwise go to step 4. 4. If none of the first three steps apply, use the default class from the appropriate asset category if the description of the default class is applicable to your asset. 5. If none of the first four steps apply, use the default class rate from the appropriate industry category if the description of the default class is applicable to your asset. 6. Where there is no appropriate listing for your asset under an industry or asset category, you can apply for a provisional depreciation rate.

IR265 October 2022 General depreciation rates The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. 2 GENERAL DEPRECIATION RATES Introduction General depreciation rates This guide sets out the general depreciation rates for both diminishing value (DV) and straight line (SL) that apply to assets acquired in the 2006 and later tax years. Inland Revenue sets the depreciation rates in the form of general and provisional determinations for all depreciable assets, other than fixed-life intangible depreciable assets or excluded depreciable assets, based on an asset's estimated useful life. New determinations and provisional determinations are published on ird.govt.nz and in our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB). For more detailed information on fixed-life intangible assets see the Depreciation - a guide for business - IR260. Excluded depreciable assets must be depreciated using the historic rates - see our guide Historic depreciation rates - IR267, available on our website ird.govt.nz/depreciation. Our online depreciation rate finder allows you to quickly search for assets across all industry and asset categories. The depreciation rates are set out in industry and asset categories. Assets which are unique to one or two specific industries are listed under the industry category. Assets which are typically used in a variety of different industries, for example, tanks, boilers and heating are listed under the asset category. Assets are listed alphabetically within each industry and asset category. The following details are shown for each asset: • Column 1 - the estimated useful life • Column 2 - the DV rate • Column 3 - the SL rate Depreciation loading Before 21 May 2010, a 20% loading could be applied to the DV or SL depreciation rate in certain cases. The loading accelerated the depreciation of eligible assets. It generally applied to new assets never used or held for use in New Zealand and imported second-hand assets. The asset must have been purchased after the beginning of the 1995-96 income year. For buildings, imported used cars, second-hand assets acquired in New Zealand and depreciable intangible property, the 20% loading didn't apply. Any asset purchased on or after 21 May 2010 isn't entitled to the 20% depreciation loading. However, if you entered into a contract to purchase an asset on or before 20 May 2010, you can still depreciate this asset with the loading. Any asset being depreciated at a rate with loading before 21 May 2010 can continue to be depreciated at that rate for that asset's lifetime. However, if there is a capital improvement to an asset with the 20% loading, this improvement will need to be depreciated separately from the original asset, and will be depreciated without the loading allowance. The general depreciation rates, including the 20% loading, are listed in the table on the following page. Special rules that apply to buildings Buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005 must apply the rates from the 2005-06 year except: • buildings acquired as relationship property or under a wholly owned group company transfer that the previous owner depreciated using the old building depreciation rates - in which case those rates continue to apply, and • buildings that were purchased, or to be built, and the relevant contract was signed prior to 19 May 2005, the old building depreciation rates also continue to apply. ird.govt.nz 3 2006 and future years asset rates Assets other than buildings acquired on or after 1 April 2005 Buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005\*\* DV rate (%)DV rate +20% loading (%)\* SL rate (%)SL rate +20% loading (%)\* DV rate (%)SL rate (%) 22.41.51.81.31 44.833.632 67.244.84.53 89.667.26.54 101278.48.55 1315.68.510.2116.5 1619.210.512.613.58 202413.516.200 253017.52100 30362125.200 4048303600 5060404800 6780.46780.400 10010010010000 10010010010000 \* The 20% depreciation loading doesn't apply to assets acquired after 20 May 2010. \*\* For buildings, depreciation will reduce to 0% from the 2011-12 income year where they have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. Between the 2012 and 2020 income years, depreciation on buildings was reduced to 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applied to both commercial and residential properties, including leasehold property, and regardless of when the building was acquired. For the 2021 and subsequent income years, the depreciation rates of 2% DV and 1.5% SL were introduced for non-residential buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. Although a 0% depreciation rate continues to apply to residential buildings, they remain in the tax base and when they are sold for more than the book value, an adjustment will be required for any depreciation (claimed prior to the 2012 income year) recovery. Estimated useful life The estimated useful life of an asset is the period over which an asset might reasonably be expected to be useful in earning income in New Zealand. The fact that an asset may have been previously used for a purpose other than deriving income (for example, private use) or carrying on a business overseas won't reduce its estimated useful life. Maximum depreciation claims Whether you're using the straight line (SL) or diminishing value (DV) method you can't claim depreciation in excess of the cost price/value of the depreciable asset. To make sure you don't claim more depreciation than you're entitled to, you need to keep a track of the adjusted tax value of the asset. You'll need to keep a fixed assets register with the following information: • a description of the asset • original purchase price or valuation • date the asset was acquired and the date in service • estimated useful life of asset • depreciation method to be used for the asset • percentage of private use if any • the adjusted tax value for each year. You use this information to complete a depreciation schedule. 4 GENERAL DEPRECIATION RATES Example 1 April 2011 Simone purchases a dishwasher for $1,200, used 100% for business. Using the straight line depreciation method the rate is 13.5%. Original cost Depreciation rate Depreciation claimed Adjusted tax value Year 1$1,20013.5%$162.00$1,038 Year 2$1,20013.5%$162.00$876 Year 3$1,20013.5%$162.00$714 Year 4$1,20013.5%$162.00$552 Year 5$1,20013.5%$162.00$390 Year 6$1,20013.5%$162.00$228 Year 7$1,20013.5%$162.00$66 Year 8$1,20013.5%$66$0.00 Simone can claim $162.00 for the first seven years. However, in the eighth year the final claim is $66.00. This is because the dishwasher's adjusted tax value is less than the original calculated depreciation of $162.00. The amount of depreciation claimed can't exceed the adjusted tax value so no further depreciation can be claimed on the dishwasher after year seven. Buildings and building fit-out asset categories The term "building" can have various meanings depending on the context in which the term is used. A building in ordinary circumstances is defined as: • a structure of considerable size • permanent in the sense that it's intended to last a considerable time • enclosed by walls and a roof • able to function independently of any other structure. However, a building is not necessarily a physically separate structure. Interpretation statement 22/04 “Claiming depreciation on buildings” steps through the depreciation rules that apply to buildings and explains how to distinguish between a residential building and a non-residential building. You can find this in the Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 34, No 8 (September 2022). The chattels and fit-out of a building, where it doesn't form part of the building, can still be depreciated. Interpretation statement 10/01 “Residential rental properties - Depreciation of items of depreciable property” sets out a three-step test that Inland Revenue will apply to determine whether an item can be separated out or whether it's seen as being part of the building. You can find this in the Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 22, No 4 (May 2010). How to find the right rate Follow this step-by-step process to find the right depreciation rate. 1. See the "Industry" category list in the contents pages. If there is an appropriate industry category for your industry and your asset is listed there, use that depreciation rate (either DV or SL), otherwise go to step 2. 2. See the "Asset" category list in the contents pages. If there is an appropriate asset category and your asset is listed, use that depreciation rate (either DV or SL), otherwise go to step 3. 3. If the asset is listed under an industry category (step 1) which isn't your main industry, and you use the asset in a similar way to the industry shown, use that depreciation rate (either DV or SL), otherwise go to step 4. 4. If none of the first three steps apply, use the default class from the appropriate asset category if the description of the default class is applicable to your asset. 5. If none of the first four steps apply, use the default class rate from the appropriate industry category if the description of the default class is applicable to your asset. 6.

IR265 October 2023 General depreciation rates The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. 2 GENERAL DEPRECIATION RATES Introduction General depreciation rates This guide sets out the general depreciation rates for both diminishing value (DV) and straight line (SL) that apply to assets acquired in the 2006 and later tax years. Inland Revenue sets the depreciation rates in the form of general and provisional determinations for all depreciable assets, other than fixed-life intangible depreciable assets or excluded depreciable assets, based on an asset's estimated useful life. New determinations and provisional determinations are published on ird.govt.nz and in our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB). For more detailed information on fixed-life intangible assets see the Depreciation - a guide for business - IR260. Excluded depreciable assets must be depreciated using the historic rates - see our guide Historic depreciation rates - IR267, available on our website ird.govt.nz/depreciation. Our online depreciation rate finder allows you to quickly search for assets across all industry and asset categories. The depreciation rates are set out in industry and asset categories. Assets which are unique to one or two specific industries are listed under the industry category. Assets which are typically used in a variety of different industries, for example, tanks, boilers and heating are listed under the asset category. Assets are listed alphabetically within each industry and asset category. The following details are shown for each asset: • Column 1 - the estimated useful life • Column 2 - the DV rate • Column 3 - the SL rate Depreciation loading Before 21 May 2010, a 20% loading could be applied to the DV or SL depreciation rate in certain cases. The loading accelerated the depreciation of eligible assets. It generally applied to new assets never used or held for use in New Zealand and imported second-hand assets. The asset must have been purchased after the beginning of the 1995-96 income year. For buildings, imported used cars, second-hand assets acquired in New Zealand and depreciable intangible property, the 20% loading didn't apply. Any asset purchased on or after 21 May 2010 isn't entitled to the 20% depreciation loading. However, if you entered into a contract to purchase an asset on or before 20 May 2010, you can still depreciate this asset with the loading. Any asset being depreciated at a rate with loading before 21 May 2010 can continue to be depreciated at that rate for that asset's lifetime. However, if there is a capital improvement to an asset with the 20% loading, this improvement will need to be depreciated separately from the original asset, and will be depreciated without the loading allowance. The general depreciation rates, including the 20% loading, are listed in the table on the following page. Special rules that apply to buildings Buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005 must apply the rates from the 2005-06 year except: • buildings acquired as relationship property or under a wholly owned group company transfer that the previous owner depreciated using the old building depreciation rates - in which case those rates continue to apply, and • buildings that were purchased, or to be built, and the relevant contract was signed prior to 19 May 2005, the old building depreciation rates also continue to apply. ird.govt.nz 3 2006 and future years asset rates Assets other than buildings acquired on or after 1 April 2005 Buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005\*\* DV rate (%)DV rate +20% loading (%)\* SL rate (%)SL rate +20% loading (%)\* DV rate (%)SL rate (%) 22.41.51.81.31 44.833.632 67.244.84.53 89.667.26.54 101278.48.55 1315.68.510.2116.5 1619.210.512.613.58 202413.516.200 253017.52100 30362125.200 4048303600 5060404800 6780.46780.400 10010010010000 10010010010000 \* The 20% depreciation loading doesn't apply to assets acquired after 20 May 2010. \*\* For buildings, depreciation will reduce to 0% from the 2011-12 income year where they have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. Between the 2012 and 2020 income years, depreciation on buildings was reduced to 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applied to both commercial and residential properties, including leasehold property, and regardless of when the building was acquired. For the 2021 and subsequent income years, the depreciation rates of 2% DV and 1.5% SL were introduced for non-residential buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. Although a 0% depreciation rate continues to apply to residential buildings, they remain in the tax base and when they are sold for more than the book value, an adjustment will be required for any depreciation (claimed prior to the 2012 income year) recovery. Estimated useful life The estimated useful life of an asset is the period over which an asset might reasonably be expected to be useful in earning income in New Zealand. The fact that an asset may have been previously used for a purpose other than deriving income (for example, private use) or carrying on a business overseas won't reduce its estimated useful life. Maximum depreciation claims Whether you're using the straight line (SL) or diminishing value (DV) method you can't claim depreciation in excess of the cost price/value of the depreciable asset. To make sure you don't claim more depreciation than you're entitled to, you need to keep a track of the adjusted tax value of the asset. You'll need to keep a fixed assets register with the following information: • a description of the asset • original purchase price or valuation • date the asset was acquired and the date in service • estimated useful life of asset • depreciation method to be used for the asset • percentage of private use if any • the adjusted tax value for each year. You use this information to complete a depreciation schedule. 4 GENERAL DEPRECIATION RATES Example 1 April 2011 Simone purchases a dishwasher for $1,200, used 100% for business. Using the straight line depreciation method the rate is 13.5%. Original cost Depreciation rate Depreciation claimed Adjusted tax value Year 1$1,20013.5%$162.00$1,038 Year 2$1,20013.5%$162.00$876 Year 3$1,20013.5%$162.00$714 Year 4$1,20013.5%$162.00$552 Year 5$1,20013.5%$162.00$390 Year 6$1,20013.5%$162.00$228 Year 7$1,20013.5%$162.00$66 Year 8$1,20013.5%$66$0.00 Simone can claim $162.00 for the first seven years. However, in the eighth year the final claim is $66.00. This is because the dishwasher's adjusted tax value is less than the original calculated depreciation of $162.00. The amount of depreciation claimed can't exceed the adjusted tax value so no further depreciation can be claimed on the dishwasher after year seven. Buildings and building fit-out asset categories The term "building" can have various meanings depending on the context in which the term is used. A building in ordinary circumstances is defined as: • a structure of considerable size • permanent in the sense that it's intended to last a considerable time • enclosed by walls and a roof • able to function independently of any other structure. However, a building is not necessarily a physically separate structure. Interpretation statement 22/04 “Claiming depreciation on buildings” steps through the depreciation rules that apply to buildings and explains how to distinguish between a residential building and a non-residential building. You can find this in the Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 34, No 8 (September 2022). The chattels and fit-out of a building, where it doesn't form part of the building, can still be depreciated. Interpretation statement 10/01 “Residential rental properties - Depreciation of items of depreciable property” sets out a three-step test that Inland Revenue will apply to determine whether an item can be separated out or whether it's seen as being part of the building. You can find this in the Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 22, No 4 (May 2010). How to find the right rate Follow this step-by-step process to find the right depreciation rate. 1. See the "Industry" category list in the contents pages. If there is an appropriate industry category for your industry and your asset is listed there, use that depreciation rate (either DV or SL), otherwise go to step 2. 2. See the "Asset" category list in the contents pages. If there is an appropriate asset category and your asset is listed, use that depreciation rate (either DV or SL), otherwise go to step 3. 3. If the asset is listed under an industry category (step 1) which isn't your main industry, and you use the asset in a similar way to the industry shown, use that depreciation rate (either DV or SL), otherwise go to step 4. 4. If none of the first three steps apply, use the default class from the appropriate asset category if the description of the default class is applicable to your asset. 5. If none of the first four steps apply, use the default class rate from the appropriate industry category if the description of the default class is applicable to your asset. 6.

IR 267 June 2010 Historic depreciation rates For assets acquired before 1 April 2005 The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. 2 DEPRECIATION INLAND REVENUE Introduction Historic rates Historic rates are used to depreciate assets acquired on or before 31 March 2005. Following is an explanation of how to read the list in Part 1 of this guide. Assets are listed alphabetically and their available rates are shown in four columns. Column 1 shows the diminishing value (DV) rate Column 2 shows the DV rate including the 25% loading, where applicable (see “Assets acquired between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993” for details) Column 3 shows the straight line (SL) rate Column 4 shows the SL rate with the 25% loading, where applicable (see “Assets acquired between16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993” for details) SV means standard value. For specific assets, a standard value has been negotiated with Inland Revenue. Generally, this value gives an average of the original cost of specified assets for the 1993 and earlier income years. The use of a diamond  means that for the 1993 and earlier income years you must choose one of the following to set the asset’s value: • replacement value • annual value • standard value. Part 1 – Depreciation rates before 1993 Some of the figures in the list are printed in bold. These highlighted figures show the method you must use to calculate the depreciation for each asset acquired in the 1993 income year and earlier. For example, on page 4 you will see that you must use the diminishing value (DV) method to calculate depreciation on accounting machines, but for barns you must use the straight line (SL) method. Assets acquired between 16 December 1991 and March 1993 Historic depreciation rates with a 25% loading are available for assets that meet certain criteria. This means depreciation on these assets can be calculated at the appropriate historic rate plus a further 25% of that rate. Example To depreciate a beer brewing plant: its historic rate is 15% DV plus loading equals 18.8% DV To qualify for the 25% loading, the assets must either be a new asset or an imported secondhand asset used in New Zealand for the first time, and • acquired between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993 (inclusive), and • must have been used on or before 31 March 1994. Buildings and imported used cars don’t qualify for the 25% loading. The increased depreciation rate will still apply for every income year until the asset is sold or disposed of. Each year, from the 1994 income year onwards, you can choose to use either the SL or the DV method to calculate your depreciation for that year. 3 INLAND REVENUE DEPRECIATION Assets acquired before 1 April 1993 and used in shift work An additional (sometimes referred to as “supplementary”) depreciation allowance is available for certain new or secondhand plant and machinery used for two or three shifts each working day. The asset must be an excluded depreciable asset. Broadly speaking, this means that the asset must be: • used in business in New Zealand, and • purchased before 1 April 1993, and • an asset that qualifies for the 25% interim depreciation loading. These allowances don’t apply to: • plant and machinery used in refining petroleum or smelting aluminium • motor cars • ships, aircraft and hovercraft • plant and machinery for which ordinary depreciation isn’t allowed • plant and machinery for which Inland Revenue hasn’t, in determining a rate of ordinary depreciation, set a differential rate for more than one shift operating for the 1993 year. Differential rates of depreciation for more than one shift were set for the following plant and machinery. • Manufacturing plant and machinery generally, not specifically mentioned and used between 16 and 24 hours daily. • Water-fed evaporating air conditioners used 24 hours a day. The additional allowance is calculated on the number of shifts the asset is in operation for. Two shifts (that is, an average of not less than 16 hours each working day) = an additional 3% Three shifts (that is, normally used 24 hours each working day) = an additional 6% Plant and machinery may qualify for both the supplementary depreciation rate and the 25% loading. To calculate the depreciation rate including both allowances: • first, determine the historic rate • then add the supplementary rate for two or three shifts • finally, add the 25% loading. Converting from DV rates to SL rates To change from the DV method to the SL method (or the other way around) simply pick the corresponding rate in the schedule. Part 2 – 1993 to 2005 asset rates: Industry categories This part contains the rates for assets acquired on or after 1 April 1993 and before 1 April 2005, listed by industry type, and the rates for buildings acquired on or after 1 April 1993 and before 19 May 2005. Part 3 – 1993 to 2005 rates: Asset categories This part contains the rates for assets acquired on or after 1 April 1993 and before 1 April 2005, listed by asset type, and the rates for buildings acquired on or after 1 April 1993 and before 19 May 2005. From the 1994 income year For assets acquired before April 1993, you can choose between SL or DV methods to calculate depreciation for the 1994 and future income years. To calculate depreciation for the 1994 and future income years you may either: • use the general rates shown in Parts 2 or 3, or • pool the asset with others listed in the historic rates schedule. 4

Entertainment expenses 3 About this guide This guide explains how to account for entertainment expenses in your tax returns. The guide explains: the difference between business-related entertainment expenses and private expenses which business-related entertainment expenses are 50% deductible and which are 100% deductible why you need to make adjustments for expenses in your tax returns. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. 4 ird.govt.nz Expenses when running a business All businesses have expenses, such as builders have timber, fixings and roofing materials. Supermarkets have vegetables, dairy goods and groceries. Taxi drivers have petrol, oil, and airport charges. Expenses pay for what you need to earn your income. They're also important for tax reasons. If you're in business for yourself, you complete an annual income tax return showing your net profit for the year. You need to record (among other things) your gross income, expenses and net profit. Here's a simple example of the net profit calculation: Gross income $500 Less deductible expenses $400 Net profit $100 Expenses are deducted from your gross income. You pay tax on your net profit. You can only deduct business- related expenses for tax purposes. Entertainment as part of your business Business is not all work and no play. You can also claim the cost of entertainment to build up business contacts, keep your employees happy or promote your goods or services as an expense. If it's helping you earn your income, it's usually deductible when it's time to work out your tax. The rules for entertainment expenses apply to deductions in your income tax return, though you may need to make an annual adjustment in your GST return (see page 19). Expenses help you earn your income. Only business-related expenses are deductible. All business people must file an income tax return every year. Entertainment expenses 5 Business-related entertainment expenses Very specific rules apply to different categories of entertainment. Some entertainment expenses can be fully deducted, while others can only be 50% deducted. For example, the use of an "executive dining room" is one of the categories you can claim for, but the cost may or may not be fully deductible depending on how it's used. Most types of entertainment will fall under the categories listed in this guide. We've defined terms to help make the rules clear, but in some cases, the wording requires you to make a judgement, for example, defining a "light" meal. You may also have to work out if the expense is a fringe benefit (see page 6). If you're not sure, contact a tax advisor. What are private entertainment expenses? It should be clear when expenses are business-related or private. An entertainment expense is business-related if you spend the money to help your business earn income. 2 common examples are: entertaining an existing or potential business contact holding an event for employees to improve engagement, for example, a party or team-building activity. If the expense does not help your business earn gross income, it's private and you cannot claim it as a tax deduction, even if you paid for it out of your business account. Example Mary took the family out for a meal. They used the business credit card to pay for the meal. Mary cannot claim the cost of the meal as entertainment expenses because it's a private expense. A business-related entertainment expense may be 50% or 100% deductible. Entertainment can mean food and drink, social events, trips, accommodation, privileges, musical, sporting or theatrical events and freebies (free samples). You can never deduct your private entertainment expenses, even if you pay for them from a business bank account. 6 ird.govt.nz Entertainment expenses and Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) A fringe benefit includes most benefits given to employees other than salary or wages. For example, motor vehicles for private use or free, subsidised or discounted goods and services. If these benefits are enjoyed or received by employees as a result of their employment the benefits are liable for FBT. All employers and businesses who provide fringe benefits must file regular FBT returns with Inland Revenue. An entertainment expense where the benefits are enjoyed or received by employees may be subject to FBT. If it's a business-related entertainment expense which is only 50% deductible (see page 7) it is not subject to FBT, however there is an exception. FBT will be payable if the employer provides the 50% deductible entertainment and: the employee can choose when and where to enjoy the benefit, or the benefit is enjoyed outside of New Zealand, and the benefit is not provided in the course of, or as a necessary consequence of, the employee's employment duties. Read about fringe benefits at ird.govt.nz/fbt or download our Fringe benefit tax guide - IR409. Example This month, Patrick delivered some impressive results at work, and is given a $100 gift voucher by their employer Jillian. Because Patrick can spend the voucher how they like, Jillian must pay FBT on the $100. Jillian declares it on their FBT return and pays tax on the $100. Entertainment expenses 7 How GST affects what you can claim If you are registered for GST, the entertainment expenses in your income tax return must be GST-exclusive. If you are not registered, your expenses are GST-inclusive. Keep records When you deduct an expense, you need to have invoices and receipts to support your deduction. Keep a record of people you entertain, the date and the reason. At the end of the year, it will make it easier to complete your income tax return. 50% deductible entertainment expenses Some business-related entertainment expenses are 100% deductible. Others are set as 50% deductible because they have a significant private element. Even if you think that the private element was more or less than 50% of the expense, you can only claim 50% of the expense as a deduction. The following types of entertainment include a private element and cannot be 100% deducted. In general, an entertainment away from work or out of usual work hours has a private element. A private element means the entertainment expense is not completely business related. Keeping good records makes tax time a lot ea sier. 8 ird.govt.nz Corporate boxes Expenses for entertainment you provide in boxes, marquees, tents or similar exclusive areas (permanent or temporary) at cultural, sporting, other recreational events or away from your business premises, are only 50% deductible. This also applies to the cost of tickets and any food and drink provided. Holiday accommodation If you have business expenses for a holiday home, time- share apartment or similar venue, you can deduct only 50% of the cost of accommodation as well as 50% for food and drink expenses relating to using the accommodation. You can claim a deduction of 100% if using the accommodation is secondary to the business activities or employment duties. Contact a tax advisor if you need help working this out. Example Catriona is self-employed and travels to Queenstown to attend a meeting with business clients. Because no other accommodation is available they stay at a holiday home while in Queenstown for the meeting. Catriona can deduct 100% of the cost of the holiday home as an expense. Entertainment expenses 9 Recreational boats You can deduct only 50% of business expenses on: yachts launches, or similar recreational boats. You can deduct 50% of the cost of food and drink accompanying the use of a recreational boat. Example Eileen is a business owner and hires a large yacht to take the management team out on the harbour for a planning day. The cost of the trip is 50% deductible. Food and drink at work You can deduct only 50% of the cost of food and drink you provide at your business premises (other than light refreshments): at a social event, for example, celebration meal, party, reception, or in an area restricted to senior employees, such as an executive dining room. This rule applies whether the entertainment is provided to staff or to guests invited from outside the business. Example ABC Ltd puts on a Christmas party for its employees. It holds the party at work. The company can claim 50% of the costs. Light refreshments, like morning and afternoon teas, are 100% deductible. 10 ird.govt.nz Offsite food and drink Food and drink provided away from your business premises is only 50% deductible. Example Hannah invites a supplier to a business lunch at a local restaurant and pays the bill, which comes to $160. Hannah deducts 50% of the cost ($80) in their income tax return. Gifts of food and drink Gifts of food and drink that will provide a private benefit to the recipient and a business benefit to the taxpayer are only 50% deductible. Example Real estate agent Bob delivers a bottle of champagne to the owner each time the sale of a house is arranged. Bob can only deduct 50% of the cost of the bottle of champagne, as this is providing entertainment away from the business premises in the form of drink. Bob also sends a gift basket containing a bottle of wine, some cheese and various household items such as tea towels and soaps to the purchaser. Bob can deduct the full cost of the tea towels and soap, because these items are not food and drink. Bob can only deduct 50% of the cost of the wine and cheese. If the cost cannot be identified separately, then an appropriate amount should be apportioned. Supporting expenses If you provide entertainment that's only 50% deductible, you can only deduct 50% of any "supporting" expenses. For example: running costs, repairs and maintenance for corporate boxes, holiday accommodation and recreational boats hire of crockery, glasses, waiting staff and music. Entertainment expenses 11 100% deductible entertainment expenses Some business-related entertainment expenses might look as though they are only 50% deductible, but specific rules mean you may be able to claim 100% of the expense. You need to check the rules carefully when there is a mix of situations which may have different rates. Entertainment expenses will be 100% deductible and not liable for FBT if they are completely business related. This includes: meals an employee buys while travelling on business (unless it is with an existing or potential business contact, or the meal is a celebration, reception or similar event – in these situations it would only be 50% deductible) food and drink provided at a conference, education course or similar event that lasts at least 4 hours (unless the conference is mainly for entertainment – in which case it would only be 50% deductible) light meals provided in a dining room for senior managers and consumed as part of their duties (such as sandwiches provided during a board meeting) entertainment that promotes your business publicly (the public must have the same access to this as your employees, business contacts or people associated with the business – if the public has less access it would only be 50% deductible) entertainment that is only a secondary part of either a function that is open to the public, or any trade display (for example, serving coffee at your business’s trade display) freebies promoting your business (such as branded stationery, but excluding any given to employees or people associated with you – these are only 50% deductible) 12 ird.govt.nz  entertainment provided to someone who is going to review it for publication (such as giving a free meal to food critics) entertainment provided at a discount, if your business regularly provides entertainment at market prices (for example, offering half-price meals at your restaurant) entertainment enjoyed outside of New Zealand. 50% deductible and not liable for FBT Entertainment expenses will be 50% deductible and not liable for FBT if they are not completely business related. This includes entertainment that is away from work or out of usual working hours, so that it has a ‘significant private element’. The expense will be 50% deductible even if you think the private element was more or less than 50%. Examples of this include: entertainment at sports or cultural events (for example, a corporate box) business use of a holiday home hiring a boat, and providing food and drink to people on it food and drink you provide for social events (such as parties) or in an area set aside for senior employees (though there is an exception for ‘light meals’ consumed as part of the manager’s duties, which are 100% deductible) gifts of food and drink that benefit your business and are enjoyed privately by the person who receives them (for example, if you give a bottle of wine to each customer who buys a car off you) ‘supporting expenses’ for other entertainment that is 50% deductible (such as hire of wine glasses and wait staff for a party). Entertainment expenses 13 100% deductible and liable for FBT Entertainment expenses will be 100% deductible and liable for FBT if they are received by employees because of the work they do. An example of this includes a reward for good performance, such as a restaurant gift voucher or a weekend away. Food and drink while travelling on business If you or one of your employees buys a meal while travelling on business, the cost is 100% deductible. That's despite the rule which says that food and drink provided away from your business premises is only 50% deductible. However you can only deduct 50% of the cost of food and drink consumed if either: the trip is mainly for the purpose of enjoying entertainment, for example, a team bonding trip, or the meal or function involves an existing or potential business contact as a guest, or a celebration meal, party, reception or similar occasion where you will not be working. Food and drink provided at a conference You can deduct 100% of the food and drink you provide at a conference, education course or similar event that lasts for four consecutive hours or more (not counting meal breaks). If the conference is mainly for the purpose of entertainment the expenses are only 50% deductible. Light refreshments, like morning and afternoon teas, are 100% deductible, regardless of the length of the conference. 14 ird.govt.nz Light meals provided in a dining room for senior managers You read earlier that you can only deduct 50% of the costs of food and drink you provide at your business premises in an area restricted to senior managers. You can claim 100% of the expense of the food or drink if it's: a light meal, and consumed as part of the manager's employment duties. Example Once a month, the senior managers at XYZ Ltd meet in their executive dining room to review the month's production figures. The light meal of sandwiches and fruit they share is 100% deductible. Promoting your business, products or services If you supply entertainment to promote a business or the business's products or services to the public, you can deduct 100% of the costs. But you can only deduct 50% of the costs if: the business contacts or employees of the business being promoted have a greater opportunity to enjoy the entertainment than the general public anyone associated with the business being promoted has a greater opportunity to enjoy the entertainment than the general public. For more information about associated persons, see A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes - IR620. Entertainment expenses 15 Secondary promotion costs Despite the previous 50% limitation rule, you can claim 100% of entertainment expenses which only form a secondary part of a trade display or function held to promote a business. To claim 100% of the cost of this expenditure, the function must be open to the public. A trade display does not need to be open to the public to claim 100% of the secondary expense. Freebies You can deduct 100% of the cost of freebies promoting your business. You can only deduct 50% of the cost of freebies you give employees or people associated with you. Entertainment for review Entertainment which you provide to someone who's going to review it for publication (for example, in a magazine, newspaper or on a website) is 100% deductible. Example A restaurant provides a free meal to a food critic who will write a review of the restaurant for their newspaper column. The restaurant can claim 100% of the meal's cost. Entertainment as a business If you provide entertainment in the ordinary course of your business at market prices or in an arm's-length transaction, you can deduct 100% of the entertainment costs. Freebies may be 100% or 50% deductible. 16 ird.govt.nz Example Every Tuesday night, a restaurant offers half-price meals to the general public. The restaurant can deduct 100% of the cost of these meals. Meals provided free to restaurant employees are 50% deductible. Entertainment supplied for charity You can deduct 100% of the cost of entertainment you supply to the general public for charitable purposes. Example A building firm donates food to a Christmas party at a children's hospital. The expense is 100% deductible. Offshore entertainment Entertainment enjoyed or consumed outside New Zealand is 100% deductible. Note that New Zealand includes the waters around New Zealand. Example RST Ltd holds a business-planning conference in Perth, Australia. The costs are 100% deductible because the entertainment is held outside New Zealand. RST Ltd also provides entertainment for employees and clients on a recreational fishing boat. The boat travels 20 km from the North Island. The costs are only 50% deductible because the boat is still in New Zealand. Entertainment enjoyed or consumed outside New Zealand is 100% deductible. Entertainment expenses 17 Claiming for reimbursed entertainment expenses An employee who pays for an entertainment expense upfront may get an allowance from their employer to reimburse them. It depends whether the allowance is tax free or taxable. The rate is either 50% or 100%. See our website for examples of each type. Tax-free allowances If an employee pays for entertainment that's 50% deductible, for example, a meal for a potential business customer and you reimburse the employee with a tax-free allowance, you can deduct 50% of the allowance. A tax-free meal allowance paid to an employee working overtime is 100% deductible. Taxable allowances You can deduct 100% of any taxable entertainment allowances you pay your employee. For more details, go to ird.govt.nz/allowances Extra benefits can reduce your deduction If you pay for entertainment and you get an extra benefit back as a result, you'll need to adjust the amount of the deduction in your income tax return. The two most common situations where you'll need to do this are promotions and employee contributions. An allowance may be tax free or taxable. Our website gives examples of each. 18 ird.govt.nz Promotions You can deduct 100% of expenses in promoting your business. But, if you receive an extra benefit, you have to deduct 50% of the value of the benefit from your expense deduction. Example Kiz Ltd provides $5,000 of sponsorship to a local netball team, who wear outfits with the Kiz logo on it, giving the company brand exposure. In return, Kiz Ltd gets tickets worth $590 to the team's corporate box. This is the extra benefit. Instead of deducting the full $5,000, Kiz Ltd must take into account 50% of the tickets' price. Sponsorship expense (100%) $ 5,000 Less tickets: 50% of $590 $ 295 Adjusted deduction $ 4,705 Employee contributions If you provide entertainment to an employee, and they contribute to the costs, you reduce your expense claim by the amount of the contribution. Example Bernadette buys Christmas lunch for all five employees. Each person's lunch costs $42 and they each contribute $10 (the extra benefit). Bernadette is GST registered, so the expenses are GST- exclusive. Cost of meal (including GST) $ 210.00 Less employee contributions $ 50.00 $ 160.00 Less GST $ 20.87 Bernadette pays (GST-exclusive) $ 139.13 Bernadette can only deduct 50% of $139.13 = $ 69.57 You'll need to make an adjustment for employee contributions. Entertainment expenses 19 Making adjustments in your GST return Although the entertainment rules apply to deductions in your income tax return, you may also need to make a GST adjustment. If you're registered for GST, you can usually deduct the full amount of all your business-related entertainment expenses in your GST return. You add the expenses to Box 11, along with the other expenses you're deducting. You need to make an annual adjustment for any entertainment expenses that are 50% deductible. You make the adjustment in Box 9. For more information see our GST guide - IR 375. When to make the GST adjustment You make your annual adjustment on the earlier of: the date your income tax return is due, or the date you actually file your income tax return. You then follow these steps: 1. Take the non-deductible expense figure from your income tax return. This figure is GST-exclusive. 2. Multiply it by 0.15 to give the GST component (15% of the GST-excusive figure). 3. Add the GST component to Box 9 of your GST return. Example In August 2018, Rick takes a supplier out to lunch. The lunch costs $225, which is 50% deductible. Rick is GST registered and files two-monthly GST returns for January, March, May, July, September and November. He deducts the full cost of the lunch ($225) in Box 11 of his September 2018 GST return. Rick has the standard 31 March balance date, so the August 2018 lunch date falls in his 2019 tax year. His 2019 income tax return is due by 7 July 2019 and he files early, on 27 June 2019.

Entertainment expenses 3 About this guide This guide explains how to account for entertainment expenses in your tax returns. The guide explains: the difference between business-related entertainment expenses and private expenses which business-related entertainment expenses are 50% deductible and which are 100% deductible why you need to make adjustments for expenses in your tax returns. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. 4 ird.govt.nz Expenses when running a business All businesses have expenses, such as builders have timber, fixings and roofing materials. Supermarkets have vegetables, dairy goods and groceries. Taxi drivers have petrol, oil, and airport charges. Expenses pay for what you need to earn your income. They're also important for tax reasons. If you're in business for yourself, you complete an annual income tax return showing your net profit for the year. You need to record (among other things) your gross income, expenses and net profit. Here's a simple example of the net profit calculation: Gross income $500 Less deductible expenses $400 Net profit $100 Expenses are deducted from your gross income. You pay tax on your net profit. You can only deduct business- related expenses for tax purposes. Entertainment as part of your business Business is not all work and no play. You can also claim the cost of entertainment to build up business contacts, keep your employees happy or promote your goods or services as an expense. If it's helping you earn your income, it's usually deductible when it's time to work out your tax. The rules for entertainment expenses apply to deductions in your income tax return, though you may need to make an annual adjustment in your GST return (see page 19). Expenses help you earn your income. Only business-related expenses are deductible. All business people must file an income tax return every year. Entertainment expenses 5 Business-related entertainment expenses Very specific rules apply to different categories of entertainment. Some entertainment expenses can be fully deducted, while others can only be 50% deducted. For example, the use of an ‘executive dining room’ is one of the categories you can claim for, but the cost may or may not be fully deductible depending on how it's used. Most types of entertainment will fall under the categories listed in this guide. We've defined terms to help make the rules clear, but in some cases, the wording requires you to make a judgement, for example, defining a ‘light’ meal. You may also have to work out if the expense is a fringe benefit (see page 6). If you're not sure, contact a tax advisor. What are private entertainment expenses? It should be clear when expenses are business-related or private. An entertainment expense is business-related if you spend the money to help your business earn income. 2 common examples are: entertaining an existing or potential business contact holding an event for employees to improve engagement, for example, a party or team-building activity. If the expense does not help your business earn gross income, it's private and you cannot claim it as a tax deduction, even if you paid for it out of your business account. Example Mary took the family out for a meal. They used the business credit card to pay for the meal. Mary cannot claim the cost of the meal as entertainment expenses because it's a private expense. A business-related entertainment expense may be 50% or 100% deductible. Entertainment can mean food and drink, social events, trips, accommodation, privileges, musical, sporting or theatrical events and freebies (free samples). You can never deduct your private entertainment expenses, even if you pay for them from a business bank account. 6 ird.govt.nz Entertainment expenses and Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) A fringe benefit includes most benefits given to employees other than salary or wages. For example, motor vehicles for private use or free, subsidised or discounted goods and services. If these benefits are enjoyed or received by employees as a result of their employment the benefits are liable for FBT. All employers and businesses who provide fringe benefits must file regular FBT returns with Inland Revenue. An entertainment expense where the benefits are enjoyed or received by employees may be subject to FBT. If it's a business-related entertainment expense which is only 50% deductible (see page 7) it is not subject to FBT, however there is an exception. FBT will be payable if the employer provides the 50% deductible entertainment and: the employee can choose when and where to enjoy the benefit, or the benefit is enjoyed outside of New Zealand, and the benefit is not provided in the course of, or as a necessary consequence of, the employee's employment duties. Read about fringe benefits at ird.govt.nz/fbt or download our Fringe benefit tax guide - IR409. Example This month, Patrick delivered some impressive results at work, and is given a $100 gift voucher by their employer Jillian. Because Patrick can spend the voucher how they like, Jillian must pay FBT on the $100. Jillian declares it on their FBT return and pays tax on the $100. Entertainment expenses 7 How GST affects what you can claim If you are registered for GST, the entertainment expenses in your income tax return must be GST-exclusive. If you are not registered, your expenses are GST-inclusive. Keep records When you deduct an expense, you need to have invoices and receipts to support your deduction. Keep a record of people you entertain, the date and the reason. At the end of the year, it will make it easier to complete your income tax return. 50% deductible entertainment expenses Some business-related entertainment expenses are 100% deductible. Others are set as 50% deductible because they have a significant private element. Even if you think that the private element was more or less than 50% of the expense, you can only claim 50% of the expense as a deduction. The following types of entertainment include a private element and cannot be 100% deducted. In general, an entertainment away from work or out of usual work hours has a private element. A private element means the entertainment expense is not completely business related. Keeping good records makes tax time a lot ea sier. 8 ird.govt.nz Corporate boxes Expenses for entertainment you provide in boxes, marquees, tents or similar exclusive areas (permanent or temporary) at cultural, sporting, other recreational events or away from your business premises, are only 50% deductible. This also applies to the cost of tickets and any food and drink provided. Holiday accommodation If you have business expenses for a holiday home, time- share apartment or similar venue, you can deduct only 50% of the cost of accommodation as well as 50% for food and drink expenses relating to using the accommodation. You can claim a deduction of 100% if using the accommodation is secondary to the business activities or employment duties. Contact a tax advisor if you need help working this out. Example Catriona is self-employed and travels to Queenstown to attend a meeting with business clients. Because no other accommodation is available they stay at a holiday home while in Queenstown for the meeting. Catriona can deduct 100% of the cost of the holiday home as an expense. Entertainment expenses 9 Recreational boats You can deduct only 50% of business expenses on: yachts launches, or similar recreational boats. You can deduct 50% of the cost of food and drink accompanying the use of a recreational boat. Example Eileen is a business owner and hires a large yacht to take the management team out on the harbour for a planning day. The cost of the trip is 50% deductible. Food and drink at work You can deduct only 50% of the cost of food and drink you provide at your business premises (other than light refreshments): at a social event, for example, celebration meal, party, reception, or in an area restricted to senior employees, such as an executive dining room. This rule applies whether the entertainment is provided to staff or to guests invited from outside the business. Example ABC Ltd puts on a Christmas party for its employees. It holds the party at work. The company can claim 50% of the costs. Light refreshments, like morning and afternoon teas, are 100% deductible. 10 ird.govt.nz Offsite food and drink Food and drink provided away from your business premises is only 50% deductible. Example Hannah invites a supplier to a business lunch at a local restaurant and pays the bill, which comes to $160. Hannah deducts 50% of the cost ($80) in their income tax return. Gifts of food and drink Gifts of food and drink that will provide a private benefit to the recipient and a business benefit to the taxpayer are only 50% deductible. Example Real estate agent Bob delivers a bottle of champagne to the owner each time the sale of a house is arranged. Bob can only deduct 50% of the cost of the bottle of champagne, as this is providing entertainment away from the business premises in the form of drink. Bob also sends a gift basket containing a bottle of wine, some cheese and various household items such as tea towels and soaps to the purchaser. Bob can deduct the full cost of the tea towels and soap, because these items are not food and drink. Bob can only deduct 50% of the cost of the wine and cheese. If the cost cannot be identified separately, then an appropriate amount should be apportioned. Supporting expenses If you provide entertainment that's only 50% deductible, you can only deduct 50% of any "supporting" expenses. For example: running costs, repairs and maintenance for corporate boxes, holiday accommodation and recreational boats hire of crockery, glasses, waiting staff and music. Entertainment expenses 11 100% deductible entertainment expenses Some business-related entertainment expenses might look as though they are only 50% deductible, but specific rules mean you may be able to claim 100% of the expense. You need to check the rules carefully when there is a mix of situations which may have different rates. Entertainment expenses will be 100% deductible and not liable for FBT if they are completely business related. This includes: meals an employee buys while travelling on business (unless it is with an existing or potential business contact, or the meal is a celebration, reception or similar event – in these situations it would only be 50% deductible) food and drink provided at a conference, education course or similar event that lasts at least 4 hours (unless the conference is mainly for entertainment – in which case it would only be 50% deductible) light meals provided in a dining room for senior managers and consumed as part of their duties (such as sandwiches provided during a board meeting) entertainment that promotes your business publicly (the public must have the same access to this as your employees, business contacts or people associated with the business – if the public has less access it would only be 50% deductible) entertainment that is only a secondary part of either a function that is open to the public, or any trade display (for example, serving coffee at your business’s trade display) freebies promoting your business (such as branded stationery, but excluding any given to employees or people associated with you – these are only 50% deductible) 12 ird.govt.nz  entertainment provided to someone who is going to review it for publication (such as giving a free meal to food critics) entertainment provided at a discount, if your business regularly provides entertainment at market prices (for example, offering half-price meals at your restaurant) entertainment enjoyed outside of New Zealand. 50% deductible and not liable for FBT Entertainment expenses will be 50% deductible and not liable for FBT if they are not completely business related. This includes entertainment that is away from work or out of usual working hours, so that it has a ‘significant private element’. The expense will be 50% deductible even if you think the private element was more or less than 50%. Examples of this include: entertainment at sports or cultural events (for example, a corporate box) business use of a holiday home hiring a boat, and providing food and drink to people on it food and drink you provide for social events (such as parties) or in an area set aside for senior employees (though there is an exception for ‘light meals’ consumed as part of the manager’s duties, which are 100% deductible) gifts of food and drink that benefit your business and are enjoyed privately by the person who receives them (for example, if you give a bottle of wine to each customer who buys a car off you) ‘supporting expenses’ for other entertainment that is 50% deductible (such as hire of wine glasses and wait staff for a party). Entertainment expenses 13 100% deductible and liable for FBT Entertainment expenses will be 100% deductible and liable for FBT if they are received by employees because of the work they do. An example of this includes a reward for good performance, such as a restaurant gift voucher or a weekend away. Food and drink while travelling on business If you or one of your employees buys a meal while travelling on business, the cost is 100% deductible. That's despite the rule which says that food and drink provided away from your business premises is only 50% deductible. However you can only deduct 50% of the cost of food and drink consumed if either: the trip is mainly for the purpose of enjoying entertainment, for example, a team bonding trip, or the meal or function involves an existing or potential business contact as a guest, or a celebration meal, party, reception or similar occasion where you will not be working. Food and drink provided at a conference You can deduct 100% of the food and drink you provide at a conference, education course or similar event that lasts for four consecutive hours or more (not counting meal breaks). If the conference is mainly for the purpose of entertainment the expenses are only 50% deductible. Light refreshments, like morning and afternoon teas, are 100% deductible, regardless of the length of the conference. 14 ird.govt.nz Light meals provided in a dining room for senior managers You read earlier that you can only deduct 50% of the costs of food and drink you provide at your business premises in an area restricted to senior managers. You can claim 100% of the expense of the food or drink if it's: a light meal, and consumed as part of the manager's employment duties. Example Once a month, the senior managers at XYZ Ltd meet in their executive dining room to review the month's production figures. The light meal of sandwiches and fruit they share is 100% deductible. Promoting your business, products or services If you supply entertainment to promote a business or the business's products or services to the public, you can deduct 100% of the costs. But you can only deduct 50% of the costs if: the business contacts or employees of the business being promoted have a greater opportunity to enjoy the entertainment than the general public anyone associated with the business being promoted has a greater opportunity to enjoy the entertainment than the general public. For more information about associated persons, see A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes - IR620. Entertainment expenses 15 Secondary promotion costs Despite the previous 50% limitation rule, you can claim 100% of entertainment expenses which only form a secondary part of a trade display or function held to promote a business. To claim 100% of the cost of this expenditure, the function must be open to the public. A trade display does not need to be open to the public to claim 100% of the secondary expense. Freebies You can deduct 100% of the cost of freebies promoting your business. You can only deduct 50% of the cost of freebies you give employees or people associated with you. Entertainment for review Entertainment which you provide to someone who's going to review it for publication (for example, in a magazine, newspaper or on a website) is 100% deductible. Example A restaurant provides a free meal to a food critic who will write a review of the restaurant for their newspaper column. The restaurant can claim 100% of the meal's cost. Entertainment as a business If you provide entertainment in the ordinary course of your business at market prices or in an arm's-length transaction, you can deduct 100% of the entertainment costs. Freebies may be 100% or 50% deductible. 16 ird.govt.nz Example Every Tuesday night, a restaurant offers half-price meals to the general public. The restaurant can deduct 100% of the cost of these meals. Meals provided free to restaurant employees are 50% deductible. Entertainment supplied for charity You can deduct 100% of the cost of entertainment you supply to the general public for charitable purposes. Example A building firm donates food to a Christmas party at a children's hospital. The expense is 100% deductible. Offshore entertainment Entertainment enjoyed or consumed outside New Zealand is 100% deductible. Note that New Zealand includes the waters around New Zealand. Example RST Ltd holds a business-planning conference in Perth, Australia. The costs are 100% deductible because the entertainment is held outside New Zealand. RST Ltd also provides entertainment for employees and clients on a recreational fishing boat. The boat travels 20 km from the North Island. The costs are only 50% deductible because the boat is still in New Zealand. Entertainment enjoyed or consumed outside New Zealand is 100% deductible. Entertainment expenses 17 Claiming for reimbursed entertainment expenses An employee who pays for an entertainment expense upfront may get an allowance from their employer to reimburse them. It depends whether the allowance is tax free or taxable. The rate is either 50% or 100%. See our website for examples of each type. Tax-free allowances If an employee pays for entertainment that's 50% deductible, for example, a meal for a potential business customer and you reimburse the employee with a tax-free allowance, you can deduct 50% of the allowance. A tax-free meal allowance paid to an employee working overtime is 100% deductible. Taxable allowances You can deduct 100% of any taxable entertainment allowances you pay your employee. For more details, go to ird.govt.nz/allowances Extra benefits can reduce your deduction If you pay for entertainment and you get an extra benefit back as a result, you'll need to adjust the amount of the deduction in your income tax return. The two most common situations where you'll need to do this are promotions and employee contributions. An allowance may be tax free or taxable. Our website gives examples of each. 18 ird.govt.nz Promotions You can deduct 100% of expenses in promoting your business. But, if you receive an extra benefit, you have to deduct 50% of the value of the benefit from your expense deduction. Example Kiz Ltd provides $5,000 of sponsorship to a local netball team, who wear outfits with the Kiz logo on it, giving the company brand exposure. In return, Kiz Ltd gets tickets worth $590 to the team's corporate box. This is the extra benefit. Instead of deducting the full $5,000, Kiz Ltd must take into account 50% of the tickets' price. Sponsorship expense (100%) $ 5,000 Less tickets: 50% of $590 $ 295 Adjusted deduction $ 4,705 Employee contributions If you provide entertainment to an employee, and they contribute to the costs, you reduce your expense claim by the amount of the contribution. Example Bernadette buys Christmas lunch for all five employees. Each person's lunch costs $42 and they each contribute $10 (the extra benefit). Bernadette is GST registered, so the expenses are GST- exclusive. Cost of meal (including GST) $ 210.00 Less employee contributions $ 50.00 $ 160.00 Less GST $ 20.87 Bernadette pays (GST-exclusive) $ 139.13 Bernadette can only deduct 50% of $139.13 = $ 69.57 You'll need to make an adjustment for employee contributions. Entertainment expenses 19 Making adjustments in your GST return Although the entertainment rules apply to deductions in your income tax return, you may also need to make a GST adjustment. If you're registered for GST, you can usually deduct the full amount of all your business-related entertainment expenses in your GST return. You add the expenses to Box 11, along with the other expenses you're deducting. You need to make an annual adjustment for any entertainment expenses that are 50% deductible. You make the adjustment in Box 9. For more information see our GST guide - IR 375. When to make the GST adjustment You make your annual adjustment on the earlier of: the date your income tax return is due, or the date you actually file your income tax return. You then follow these steps: 1. Take the non-deductible expense figure from your income tax return. This figure is GST-exclusive. 2. Multiply it by 0.15 to give the GST component (15% of the GST-excusive figure). 3. Add the GST component to Box 9 of your GST return. Example In August 2018, Rick takes a supplier out to lunch. The lunch costs $225, which is 50% deductible. Rick is GST registered and files two-monthly GST returns for January, March, May, July, September and November. He deducts the full cost of the lunch ($225) in Box 11 of his September 2018 GST return. Rick has the standard 31 March balance date, so the August 2018 lunch date falls in his 2019 tax year. His 2019 income tax return is due by 7 July 2019 and he files early, on 27 June 2019. You'll need to make an adjustment for entertainment expenses that are 50% deductible. 20 ird.govt.nz The figures in Rick’s income tax return are GST-exclusive. He calculates his income tax deduction like this: Cost of the meal (including GST) $ 225.00 Less GST content $ 29.34 GST-exclusive cost $ 195.66 Rick’s income tax deduction (50%) $ 97.83 (The non-deductible expense is also $ 97.83.) He calculates his GST adjustment as follows: Non-deductible expense $ 97.83 GST content ($97.83 × 0.15)\* $ 14.67 Rick’s GST adjustment $ 14.67 Rick must add the adjustment to the GST return that covers 27 June 2019 because he filed it before the date it was due. He adds the $14.67 adjustment to Box 9 of his July 2019 GST return. \* Note: before 1 April 2018 the GST content was calculated $97.83 × 3 ÷ 23 =$12.76 Employees' contributions If an employee contributes towards an expense, treat the 2 items separately.  Deduct the expense in Box 11 of your GST return.  Add the employee contribution to Box 5. Entertainment expenses 21 Penalties and interest If you make a mistake with your entertainment expenses, you may be charged penalties. Unpaid amounts may also be liable for interest. Please check your deductions before you complete your return. Have you: kept complete records deducted only business-related expenses worked out which expenses are 50% deductible and which are 100% deductible? Most people deduct their expenses correctly, but anyone who's careless or dishonest may be charged penalties. There's more information in our guide Penalties and interest -IR240.

IR274 April 2024 Imputation A guide for New Zealand companies ird.govt.nz2 Introduction The dividend imputation system lets companies pass on to their shareholders credits for the New Zealand income tax paid by the company. This means that shareholders get the benefit of the income tax the company has paid. Imputation applies to income tax paid by New Zealand resident companies for all income years from 1989 onwards. In this guide Part 1 of this guide is a general explanation of how the imputation system works and gives a basic explanation of a Māori authority credit. Part 2 explains the ICA (imputation credit account). A company records in this memorandum account the amount of income tax it pays, which it can pass on as tax credits with the dividends it pays to its shareholders. This part also gives a brief explanation of a Māori authority credit account (MACA). Part 3 covers imputation groups, which are companies that operate their imputation accounts together. Part 4 explains the special imputation rules relating to cooperative companies. Part 5 outlines how shareholders are taxed for dividends they receive, and the impact on the income of an overseas shareholder. Part 6 provides the Inland Revenue contact details you may need for more information on imputation. Tax year and income year The term tax year is a global concept across all tax activities in New Zealand. Each tax year ends on 31 March of the relevant year. For example, the 2024 tax year runs from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. The term income year means a company's income year ending at its balance date. • • Most companies have a standard balance date of 31 March. Their income year runs from 1 April to 31 March of the following year, which aligns with the tax year. • • If a company has a non-standard balance date, its income year will follow a different timeline from the tax year, for example, 1 October to 30 September. These companies should get professional tax advice if they need help with the timing of imputation. ird.govt.nz Go to our website for information and to use our services and tools. • • Log in or register for myIR – manage your tax and entitlements online. • • Demonstrations – learn about our services by watching short videos. • • Get it done online – complete forms and returns, make payments, give us feedback. • • Work it out – use our calculators, worksheets and tools, for example, to check your tax code, find filing and payment dates, calculate your student loan repayment. • • Forms and guides – download our forms and guides.

Companies can do this by imputing (attaching to the dividends they pay out) credits for the income tax the company has already paid. The amount imputed is called an imputation credit. When the shareholders receiving these dividends fill in their income tax returns, they include in their gross income not only the dividend they receive from the company, but also the imputation credit attached to it. They can then claim credit against their income tax liability for the amount of the imputation credit attached to the dividend. The reason for imputation The imputation system was introduced to make sure that, as far as possible, company profits are taxed once only, at the marginal tax rate of the company's shareholders. Before imputation, a company paid income tax on its profits, then the shareholders paid tax again when the profits were distributed in the form of dividends. The imputation system allows shareholders a credit for the income tax the company has already paid, so company profits are not taxed twice. The difference imputation makes Without imputation With imputation Tax on company Company profit $ 1,000.00$ 1,000.00 Company income tax at 28% $ 280.00$ 280.00 After-tax profit $ 720.00$ 720.00 Share of profits to shareholders $ 720.00$ 720.00 Retained earnings Nil Nil Tax on shareholder Share of profits distributed $ 720.00$ 720.00 Imputation credit attached Nil$ 280.00 Taxable amount $ 720.00$ 1,000.00 Tax (RWT) at 33% $ 237.60$ 330.00 Less imputation credit Nil$ 280.00 Tax payable by shareholder $ 237.60$ 50.00 Result for shareholder Share of profits received $ 720.00$ 720.00 Less tax payable $ 237.60$ 50.00 Net dividend after tax $ 482.40$ 670.00 This shows how the shareholder receives a greater net dividend when imputation is used. Related tax credit systems Some other tax credit systems are connected to imputation or use similar practices, such as memorandum accounts. Life insurers A life insurer must operate a policyholder credit account (PCA), which interacts with the ICA (imputation credit account). If you need more information about how a PCA operates, please contact: Team Leader Significant Enterprises, Services Inland Revenue Private Bag 39010 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 Phone 0800 443 773 Māori authority credits If you're a Māori authority, you use the Māori authority credit system. This is similar to a company imputation credit. The Māori authority credit system allows authorities to pass on to their members the benefit of the income tax they have already paid. Māori authorities can do this by attaching to the distributions they pay out, credits for the income tax which the authority has already paid, so profits aren't taxed twice. The amount attached to the distribution is called a Māori authority credit. For more information on this system and to see if you must keep a Māori authority credit memorandum account (MACA), refer to our guide Becoming a Māori authority - IR487. Research and development (R&D) loss tax credit For income years beginning on or after 1 April 2015, you may be able to cash out (have refunded) up to 28% of any tax losses associated with an eligible R&D (research and development) activity. You may be eligible to apply for the credit if your company: • • is a loss-making company • • is a tax resident in New Zealand, and • • expenditure on R&D salary and wages is 20% or more of your total salary and wage expenditure. However, you will need to be aware that no credit balance due to provisional or income tax paid will arise in an imputation credit account of a company that has claimed the R&D tax credit until that company has repaid the cashed-out amounts. This is to maintain tax neutrality with companies who are not able to cash out losses. For more information and examples on the R&D loss tax credit go to ird.govt.nz/research-and-development/loss-tax-credit Part 1 - Imputation overview IMPUTATION 5 Part 2 - ICA (imputation credit account) An ICA is simply a memorandum or record-keeping account that a company maintains. Its purpose is to keep track of how much tax a company has paid, and how much credit for that tax is available to pass on to shareholders. You use the information in the ICA to complete your imputation return each tax year. Who must keep an ICA Every New Zealand-resident company, and any other organisation considered a company for tax purposes, must keep an ICA. This includes unit trusts, cooperative companies, life insurance companies and statutory producer boards. It also includes group investment funds (except for certain income). Companies not required to keep an ICA are: • • companies not resident in New Zealand • • companies resident in New Zealand, but treated as non-resident because of a double tax agreement (with the exception of the Australian double tax agreement from 15 March 2017) • • trustee companies (except any group investment funds deriving category A income) • • companies whose constitution prohibits their income or property from being distributed to any proprietor, member, or shareholder • • companies whose income is wholly exempt from income tax, unless the income is exempt because it consists of: –foreign dividends derived by a New Zealand resident company or trustee of a group investment fund –dividends paid before 1 April 1996 to a unit trust manager or a trustee or manager of a group investment fund –inter-company dividends between companies in a 100% commonly owned group • • local authorities • • a subsidiary company of the Accident Compensation Corporation to which section 266 of the Accident Compensation Act 2001 applies • • a Māori authority • • a look-through company (LTC). Māori authority credit account (MACA) A MACA is a memorandum or record-keeping account. Its purpose is to keep track of how much tax a Māori authority has paid, and how much credit for tax is available to pass on to the members. Who must keep a MACA? All Māori authorities are required to set up a MACA except: • • a Māori authority whose rules do not allow them to distribute their income or property to any of their members, or • • a Māori authority whose entire income is not liable for income tax, unless this income consists of: –foreign dividends derived by a New Zealand-resident company or trustee of a group investment fund, or –dividends paid before 1 April 1996 to a unit trust manager or a trustee or manager of a group investment fund. What should you do if you are a Māori authority? Find out more information on a MACA in our guide Becoming a Māori authority - IR487. Australian companies with New Zealand shareholders (trans-Tasman imputation) Australian companies can elect to maintain an ICA in New Zealand. This is to address the double taxation on certain trans-Tasman investments by allowing electing companies to pass on imputation credits for New Zealand tax paid, to their shareholders. Companies that make a valid election are referred to as Australian imputation credit account companies and are subject to all the New Zealand domestic, administrative and legislative requirements for imputation. Any differences to the rules for Australian ICA companies are detailed in the relevant sections of this guide. Eligibility Australian companies and unit trusts are eligible to elect to maintain a New Zealand ICA provided: • • their Australian residence is determined by a provision which tests whether the company is resident in Australia (the provision uses the existing New Zealand residence rules but with application to Australia) • • the company is not treated, under a double taxation agreement, as a resident in a country other than Australia or New Zealand • • they meet all the existing New Zealand eligibility criteria (with the exception of the residency criteria) set out in Who must keep an ICA. All the companies in the same wholly owned group as the electing company will be jointly liable for any further income tax, penalties and interest incurred. Where an ICA company tie breaks to Australia under the Australia/ New Zealand Double Tax Agreement, no election is required, it will automatically become an Australian ICA company. You will still need to register using the Trans-Tasman imputation election - IR488 form. ird.govt.nz6 Making an election The Australian company must provide an election to us, at least 30 days before the payment of any dividend including a New Zealand imputation credit. An imputed dividend can be paid only after this notice period has passed. For all other purposes, the election start date is retrospective to the beginning of the tax year in which we receive the election. Australian companies wanting to elect to maintain a New Zealand ICA can either register online through our website, or complete the Trans-Tasman imputation election form - IR488. If the Australian company is not already a New Zealand taxpayer, an IRD number will be issued for the maintenance of the ICA.

This period is called the tax year. A company with a balance date other than 31 March cannot align its tax year with its accounting year. Transactions recorded in the ICA The ICA is used to maintain a record of the balance of imputation credits available for allocation with dividends. For each tax year, the company uses it to record: • • an opening balance • • credit entries • • debit entries • • a closing balance. Opening balance The opening balance of the ICA (either debit or credit) is exactly the same as the closing balance for the preceding tax year. For a new ICA company, the opening balance is nil. Credit entries Credits to an ICA increase the amount currently available for allocation to dividends the company pays to its shareholders. The main credit entries are: • • New Zealand income tax paid by the company for 1989 and subsequent income years to meet a provisional tax obligation or end-of-year tax liability (does not include imputation additional tax or use-of-money interest) • • the portion of any amount attributed under the personal services attribution rules that represents the tax that would have been paid on the income • • imputation credits attached to dividends the company receives from other companies • • RWT deducted from interest and dividends the company has received • • residential land withholding tax (RLWT) deducted from the sale or transfer of residential property in New Zealand, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transferred to outstanding amounts • • further income tax that a company may have paid to reduce a closing debit balance for the previous year (pages 10 and 11) • • tax allocated to a company by another wholly owned company that has overpaid its provisional tax • • an adjustment to offset a previous debit that has arisen from a determination that the imputation credits are subject to an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage, which has subsequently been overturned • • payment(s) of qualifying company election tax (QCET) made from 17 May 2007 onwards. Additional credit entries for Australian companies include payment of: • • NRWT on interest, dividends or royalties • • non-resident contractors' withholding tax • • non-resident shippers' tax • • non-resident film renters' tax • • non-resident insurers' tax. In most cases, credit entries occur in the ICA on the date the transaction that causes them takes place, for example the date of payment. This happens regardless of the period it relates to. Note Where an ICA company automatically becomes an Australian ICA company because its residence tie-breaks to Australia under the New Zealand/Australia Double Tax Agreement, any accumulated imputation credits up until the point of becoming an Australian ICA company are included in the trans-Tasman ICA. This is done by making a credit entry in the first trans- Tasman ICA return and equal debit entry in the final New Zealand ICA return. These entries are for administrative purposes only and do not change the imputation credit origination dates for shareholder continuity purposes. Examples - date of credit Source of creditDate of credit Company pays 2023 end-of-year income tax on 7 February 2024. 7 February 2024 (2024 tax year) Company pays instalment of 2023 provisional tax on 28 August 2023. 28 August 2023 (2024 tax year) Company pays instalment of 2023 provisional tax on 7 May 2023. 7 May 2023 (2024 tax year) Company receives a dividend with an imputation credit amount attached on 31 March 2023. 31 March 2023 (2023 tax year) Payments that do not cause credit ICA entries The following payments do not cause a credit entry in a company's ICA: • • income tax paid by a company on income it received simply as a trustee • • income tax paid when a company was not an ICA company • • income tax paid by offsetting foreign investor tax credits (FITC) (page 29) • • income tax paid by offsetting further income tax (page 10) • • income tax paid by offsetting imputation credits (page 27) • • income tax paid by a group investment fund deriving category A income to the extent that income tax does not exceed the company's schedular income tax liability for category A income • • payment of QCET before 17 May 2007. Debit entries Debits to an ICA reduce the amount currently available for allocation to dividends paid to shareholders. The main debit entries are: • • imputation credits attached to dividends that a company pays to its shareholders • • an adjustment when a change of shareholding of more than 34% has occurred (page 14) • • income tax refunds received during the income year, except: –a refund of income tax paid for an income year when the company was not an ICA company (a proportional adjustment is needed if the company became an ICA part- way through an income year) ird.govt.nz10 Closing balance Credit entries Opening balance +-= Debit entries Opening balance + creditdebit Significance of the ICA closing balance If the closing balance is nil or in credit If the ICA closing balance is nil or a credit no further action is required. The company simply carries the closing balance forward as the opening balance for the next tax year. If the closing balance is a debit The ICA can have a debit balance at any time during the tax year. If the balance is a debit at the end of the tax year the company must make a payment to clear the account. The payment the company must make is called further income tax. When a company has to pay further income tax, it must also pay a penalty of 10% of the closing balance. This penalty is called imputation penalty tax. Further income tax and imputation penalty tax are due by 20 June following the end of the tax year in which the debit closing balance arose. Late payment penalties and interest may apply if payment is not made by the due date (page 16). When payment is made towards the ICA debit, it will first go towards any late payment penalties and interest before being credited to further income tax and imputation penalty tax. The amount credited to further income tax is treated as being a payment towards income tax for the income year the payment is made in. This payment will show in the income tax account for that year as a credit transfer. However, the payment cannot be used to pay tax arrears. A company can choose to credit an income tax payment made after the end of the income year to its further income tax liability. Refer to the following example. Example A company with a 31 March balance date has an ICA closing debit balance at 31 March 2023 of $4,500.00 plus 10% penalty tax of $450.00 – due 20 June 2023. The company chooses to use its P3 payment for 2023 provisional tax (PT) paid 7 May 2023 to clear the 2023 ICA. –if there's already been a debit entry because of an adjustment to a change of shareholding and the refund is of income tax paid before that change –if there's already been a debit entry because of an adjustment to a change of shareholding and the refund is an FITC refund from a supplementary dividend paid before the change (FITC is explained on page 29) • • overpaid income tax transferred to cover income tax due for 1988 or earlier income years • • overpaid income tax transferred to cover other types of tax owed by the company • • an adjustment when the credit ratio has altered and a ratio change declaration has not been made (page 13) • • tax allocated by a company to another wholly owned company that has underpaid its provisional tax • • cancellation of notional credits in circumstances where qualifying company dividend methodology has been adopted as a result of the attribution rules • • an adjustment if the company has made an on-market acquisition of its own shares • • an adjustment when a company ceases to be an ICA company (page 15) • • the amount of a credit in the company's ICA (equal to the amount of the imputation credit shown for the personal services under the personal attribution rules) if the company's financial statements are adjusted to reflect an amount attributed under the personal attribution rules • • adjustments made when we consider that an arrangement has been made to obtain a tax advantage • • the total amount of the company's R&D loss tax credits, minus the total amount of previous imputation debit entries for R&D loss tax credits from previous years. The amount of this debit entry is limited to the amount of New Zealand income tax paid by the company in the current year to meet a provisional tax obligation or end-of-year tax liability. Additional debit entries for Australian companies include refunds of: • • NRWT on interest, dividends or royalties • • non-resident contractors' withholding tax • • non-resident shippers' tax • • non-resident film renters' tax • • non-resident insurers' tax. As with credit entries to the ICA, in most cases the date that a debit entry occurs in the ICA is the date the transaction causing the entry takes place. Closing balance At 31 March each year, a company must balance its ICA. It does this by adding all the credit entries (including the opening balance if it's a credit) and deducting all the debit entries (including the opening balance if it's a debit). The final sum is the closing balance. IMPUTATION 11 2019 ICA account $4,500.00ICA assessment / debit closing balance +$ 450.0010% imputation penalty tax $4,950.00Due 20/06/2019 −($4,950.00) Credit transferred from 2019 INC (P3) at 07/05/2019 $0.00 2020 INC account +($4,500.00)Credit transfer (from 2023 ICA at 07/05/2023) The provisional tax payment clears the debit ICA balance of $4,500 and the imputation penalty tax of $450. Because the $450 is a penalty only $4,500 is transferred into income tax for 2024. The transferred credit is not able to be used to pay any 2023 income tax shortfall because it can only be used for current or future income tax years. This could mean the company has not paid enough provisional tax for 2023. Further income tax for Australian companies Australian ICA companies that pay further income tax will not generally have a New Zealand income tax liability. In these cases the company may gross up the further income tax paid into a loss, and transfer that loss to another group company, using the following formula: a b Where: a is the amount of further income tax that is paid by the company and not credited against an income tax liability b is the company tax rate for the relevant tax year. Using the example above (of a debit closing balance), if an Australian company has a further income tax payment of $3,000 for the 2023-24 income year this would be divided by 28% to give a loss of $10,714.29. Australian companies should attach a letter to their imputation return, advising that this option has been taken. The receiving company may claim the loss in their following year's income tax return. For example, further income tax payment made on 20 June 2023 for an ICA debit for the year ended 31 March 2023 may be claimed in the receiving company's 2024 income tax return. An explanation of the loss entry should also be attached to the return. Relief for qualifying companies from paying further income tax If the company is a qualifying company and the debit ICA balance arose because the company received an income tax refund, its liability to pay further income tax may be reduced. In this situation, a qualifying company that has a debit imputation balance at the end of the year, or when it ceases to be an ICA company, may have its further income tax liability reduced by an amount calculated using the following formula: refunds − credits Where: • • refunds is the total amount of all refunds of income tax paid to the company, before the debit balance creating the liability for further income tax arises • • credits is the total amount of all credits to the company's ICA, for the period that runs from the tax year in which the first refund was received to the time the calculation is made. A company in this situation will need to make an adjustment in its imputation return for that year. Our Qualifying companies - IR435 guide has more details. Annual imputation return At the end of each tax year, every company that maintains an ICA must complete an annual imputation return. The company can file this return on a separate Annual imputation return - IR4J, or it can use the imputation return included with the Companies income tax return - IR4. The Company tax return guide – IR4GU explains how to fill in the imputation return. Non-active companies can apply to be exempt from filing a return if they fill in a Non-active company declaration - IR433. Australian companies with no New Zealand income tax liability will be issued with a separate IR4J. Due date for filing the imputation return A company must file its imputation return by the due date for filing its income tax return for the corresponding income year. The return due date for Australian ICA companies is 31 July following the end of the tax year, for example, 31 July 2024 for the year ending 31 March 2024. Companies that file returns late may be charged a late filing penalty. The ICA return must show: • • the opening and closing balance of the ICA for the tax year • • the amount and source of all debits and credits that have arisen during the tax year • • the amount of any further income tax payable • • the amount of any imputation penalty tax. Ratio change disclosure We also require a company to make a disclosure in its imputation return if certain ratios increase or decrease by more than 20% from one year to the next. There are two ratios to be considered: 1. The fraction equal to: a b Where: a is the total of all ICA credits attached to all dividends paid by the company during the tax year b is the total amount of all dividends paid by the company during the tax year. ird.govt.nz12 2. The fraction equal to: a b Where: a is the total of all debits arising in the company's ICA during the tax year b is the total of all credits arising in the company's ICA during the t a x year. If either of these ratios increase or decrease by more than 20% from the equivalent ratio in the preceding tax year, the company must state this in its annual imputation return. It must also explain why the change occurred. Rules for allocating imputation credits to dividends A company may choose whether or not to attach imputation credits to dividends it pays to its shareholders. However, if it chooses to do this it must follow certain rules. Maximum imputation ratio If a company decides to attach imputation credits to dividends it pays, there's a maximum ratio of credit to dividend that can be allocated. The maximum ratio limits the imputation credit that can be attached as follows: • • 38.89% of the share of profit amount: Up to 38.89 cents of imputation credit can be attached to each $1 of share of profit. • • 28% of gross dividend: Each $1 of gross dividend (ie, share of profit plus imputation credits) can consist of up to 28 cents of imputation credit. The imputation ratio is represented using the format 28:72. This indicates the latter proportion of 28 cents of credit attached to each 72 cents of the share of profit amount - see diagram below. Imputation credits: $28 Share of profits distributed as dividend: $72 Gross dividend $100 The net dividend paid to the shareholder may also involve deducting RWT from the share of profit - see the next page for more details. If this ratio is exceeded, the company would effectively be passing on more imputation credits to its shareholders than the amount of tax the company has paid on its profits from which those dividends were paid. Example Company profit: income year 2023-24 $ 100 Tax @ 28% $ 28 Profit after tax $ 72 The company has paid $28 income tax on the $72 available for distribution as dividends. This is why the maximum imputation ratio is 28:72. Australian companies distributing dividends to New Zealand shareholders Even if an Australian ICA company's payment of a dividend is made in Australian dollars, the relevant entries to the ICA must be in New Zealand dollars. These companies may, when paying an Australian dollar dividend, use the New Zealand dollar equivalent at the time of declaring the dividend for all purposes of the imputation rules. This concession depends on there being no more than three months between the declaration and the payment of the dividend. An Australian ICA company can use this concessionary rate to calculate the RWT it must pay to us if it: • • qualifies for the concessionary rate for the calculation of its imputation credits. • • is liable for RWT on resident passive income in the form of a dividend. RWT payable on dividends The rate of RWT payable on a dividend is 33% of the gross amount (the share of profits plus any imputation). However, any imputation credit attached to the dividend reduces the amount of RWT that the company needs to deduct before it pays the dividend to the shareholder. If the total of imputation credits is less than the 33% RWT due, the company paying the dividend must deduct RWT to bring the total deductions up to 33% of the gross dividend (unless the shareholder holds a certificate of exemption from RWT). There's more information about this in our guide Resident withholding tax on dividends - IR284. In the diagram below, the dividend has been fully imputed, ie, the maximum of 28:72 imputation credit has been attached. T a x c o m p o n e n t : $ 3 3 S h a r e o f p r o f i t s : $ 7 2 Gross dividend $100 Net dividend: $67 Imputation credits: $28 RWT: $5 IMPUTATION 13 Shareholders exempt from RWT If a shareholder holds a certificate of exemption from RWT, the company does not deduct any RWT, no matter how many imputation credits are attached. The net dividend the shareholder receives is the full amount of the share of profits. In these cases, the shareholder will generally still be liable to pay any RWT on that dividend income when they complete their annual income tax return. The diagram below shows the proportions of amounts in a fully imputed dividend in such cases. Note A company that pays a fully imputed dividend to another company on or after 1 April 2017 can choose not to deduct RWT. T a x c o m p o n e n t : $ 2 8 S h a r e o f p r o f i t s : $ 7 2 Gross dividend $100 Net dividend: $72 Imputation credits: $28 RWT: nil Benchmark dividend The first dividend paid by a company in a tax year is called the benchmark dividend. This sets the required ratio between the company's credits and dividends for the rest of that tax year, ie, the benchmark dividend ratio. Example A company pays a benchmark dividend with $2 of imputation credit attached for every $10 of dividend. This sets the company's benchmark dividend ratio for the tax year at 2:10 or 20%. Every subsequent dividend the company pays during that tax year must have credits attached at a ratio of 2:10. Similarly, if the benchmark dividend has no credits attached, the company cannot attach credits to any subsequent dividends it pays in the same tax year. An exception to this rule applies if: • • the subsequent dividend is not paid as part of an arrangement to get a tax advantage, and • • the company completes a Ratio change declaration - IR407 form. Exception The benchmark dividend rules do not apply to supplementary dividends paid under the foreign investor tax credit (FITC) rules. An explanation of these rules is on page 29. Ratio change declaration The Ratio change declaration - IR407 form is a statutory declaration a company must complete if it wants to change the ratio of a subsequent dividend from the ratio of its benchmark dividend. The IR407 requires the company to make a statutory declaration that the ratio change has not occurred as part of an arrangement to provide a tax advantage. The company must send us the IR407 before it pays the subsequent dividend. Allocation debit The ICA will be debited with an amount called an allocation debit if the ratio of a subsequent dividend is different from the benchmark dividend and either of the following applies: • • the company is required to send us a ratio change declaration, but does not do this before it pays the dividend, or • • the subsequent dividend was paid as part of a tax advantage arrangement. The allocation debit is calculated using this formula: (a × b) − c Where: a is the total amount of all dividends paid during the tax year, excluding any credits attached b is the lesser of: the imputation ratio of the dividend with the greatest imputation ratio of all dividends paid during the tax year, or the maximum imputation ratio permitted c is the total of all imputation credits attached to all dividends paid during the tax year. Allocation debit example 2 June 2023 Benchmark dividend paid$1,000 Imputation credit attached$200 Imputation ratio2:10 2 December 2023 Subsequent dividend paid$1,000 Imputation credit attached$100 Imputation ratio1:10 Allocation debit calculation: atotal dividends paid$2,000 bgreatest imputation ratio2:10 ctotal imputation credits$300 Allocation debit = (2,000 × 2 ÷ 10) − 300 = $100 The allocation debit of $100 is debited to the ICA. This reduces the amount of credit available for the shareholders. Tax advantage arrangements The imputation system includes special rules to prevent shareholders from buying and selling shares to redirect imputation credits to certain shareholders. There are also rules to prevent companies from streaming credits to redirect them to certain shareholders. All these rules exist because all shareholders have borne the company tax, so the credits should be allocated to them in proportion to their shareholding. ird.govt.nz14 Note Even if a company files an interim imputation return for a tax year, it must still complete an annual imputation return covering the period 1 April to 31 March of that tax year. Change of shareholder continuity Imputation credits can only be passed on to shareholders if at least 66% of the company's voting rights and/or market value interests haven't changed hands, from the date the credits arose in the ICA to the date when they are passed on to the shareholders - refer to page 15 for special rules for qualifying companies. Shareholders' economic interests in a company are generally measured by reference to their direct and indirect voting interests in the company. In certain circumstances the shareholders' economic interests in a company will also be determined by the market value of interests in the company. This happens when the voting interests do not reflect the true economic interests held in the company. For more information about this, refer to our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 3, No 7 (April 1992). If a company's shareholder interests change by more than 34%, the company has lost shareholder continuity. In this situation it must enter a debit in its ICA to eliminate any unused credit balance. Example 1 Kokako Adventures Ltd is a company with 7 shareholders, whose voting interests are shown in the table below. On 31 January 2023, Lucy sold a 25% shareholding to Robert and a 10% shareholding to Justin. Justin was an existing shareholder, but Robert is a new shareholder. There have been no other shareholding changes since 31 December 2022. Shareholder Shareholding 31/12/22 Shareholding 31/01/23 Lowest voting interest Jack5%5%5% James15%15%15% Amber25%25%25% Lucy40%5% 1 5% Justin10%20% 2 10% Adam5%5%5% Robert0%25% 3 0% Total100%100%65% 1 40% − 25% - 10% = 5% 2 10% + 10% = 20% 3 0% + 25% = 25% The lowest voting interests of the shareholders have changed by 35% (100% − 65%), so the credit balance in the ICA must be eliminated by entering a debit of the same amount as the credit. The rules to prevent companies streaming credits do not apply to supplementary dividends paid under the FITC rules. Limits on income tax refunds If a company's income tax return works out to a refund, the amount that can be refunded will generally be limited to the amount of the credit closing balance in the company's ICA at the end of the most recently ended tax year. If the ICA's closing balance is nil or a debit, the company is only entitled to receive an income tax refund if it's a qualifying company. Our guide Qualifying companies - IR435 has more details. If the income tax refund is more than the ICA closing credit balance, we'll release only the amount of the tax refund equal to the ICA credit balance, and carry the rest of the refund (the excess imputation credits) forward as a credit against the company's next income tax payment or provisional tax payment. Special provisions and deemed adjustments Any non-refundable overpayment may instead be offset against income tax due for any income year. A special provision allows certain refunds to be issued by deeming the ICA balance to be increased if all these criteria are met: • • A debit adjustment has been made because of a change in shareholding. • • The debit adjustment occurred: –before the date the ICA balance is calculated –at the end of the tax year, on ceasing to be an ICA company –the date an imputation return was filed. • • The refund relates to income tax paid before the date of the debit adjustment. The ICA balance is deemed to be increased by the amount of the debit adjustment made. This allows a refund to be issued. Once it has been issued, there are special rules to make sure a double debit does not occur. Interim imputation returns A company may file an interim imputation return at any time during the tax year. It may want to do this if its income tax refund is limited by the closing imputation balance at the end of the previous tax year, but more credits have arisen in its ICA since that time. In this situation the company can file an interim imputation return to show that the credit balance in the ICA is now sufficient to allow the remainder of the income tax refund to be released. The interim imputation return must cover the period from 1 April to a date not more than 7 days before the date the company files the interim imputation return. Example At 20 April 2023 a company’s income tax account shows: 2022 tax refund due $ 6,000 ICA credit balance at 31 March 2023 $ 300 Maximum refund is $ 300 Balance of 2022 credit retained $ 5,700 The company files an interim imputation return on 20 June 2023 showing that the balance in the ICA at 16 June 2023 was a credit of $7,000. The balance of $5,700 can now be released. IMPUTATION 15 Example 2 Kereru Steel Ltd has 3 shareholders, whose shareholdings are shown in the table below. On 31 January 2023 Jasper sold his 20% shareholding to Ozzy. This change was less than 34%, so it wasn’t great enough to cause the company to lose shareholder continuity at that date. However, Jasper sold a further 15% shareholding to Brent at 31 March 2023, and this change, when combined with the previous change, made a 35% change of shareholding, resulting in a loss of shareholder continuity at 31 March 2023. Shareholder Shareholding 31/12/22 Lowest shareholding 31/01/23 Interest for 31/12/22 to 31/01/23 Lowest shareholding 31/03/23 Interest for 31/12/22 to 31/03/23 Jasper100%80%80%65%65% Ozzy0%20%0%20%0% Brent0%0%0%15%0% Total100%100%80%100%65% The credit entries in Kereru Steel Ltd’s ICA over the same period are: DateItemAmount Balance 31/12/2022Balance$,1000 CR 15/01/2023Credit arising from tax paid$100 $1,100 CR 15/03/2023Credit arising from tax paid$200 $1,300CR The $1,000 ICA credit balance as at 31 December 2022 will be lost due to the loss of shareholder continuity as at 31 March 2023. The $100 credit that arose on 15 January 2023 will also be lost as a result of the 2 shareholding changes totaling 35% on 31 January 2023 and 31 March 2023. The $200 credit that arose on 15 March 2023 will not be lost because the change of shareholding between 15 March 2023 and 31 March 2023 is only 15%. The ordering rule in the imputation system states that ICA credits are offset against any debits in the order in which the credits arose. If Kereru Steel had attached $1,100 of imputation credits to dividends paid out before 31 March 2023 there would be no debit adjustment to the ICA at 31 March 2023. The $200 credit balance on hand would represent the $200 tax payment made on 15 March 2023. Change of shareholding for qualifying companies The shareholder continuity requirement does not apply to qualifying companies. These special rules apply instead. When a company ceases to be a qualifying company there's a debit to the ICA of the lesser of these amounts: • • the balance at that time (after attaching maximum possible imputation credits to the dividends paid during the tax year and up to that time), or • • the greatest previous debit in the ICA at the date of any previous breach of the 66% continuity rule. Transferring imputation credits between commonly owned companies Companies that are commonly owned (ie have at least 66% common voting interests), but are not wholly owned (ie 100% common voting interests), can elect to transfer imputation credits as part of a loss grouping transaction (ie a subvention payment, loss offset or a combination of the 2). The maximum amount of imputation credits which can be transferred is 28% of the total loss grouping transaction. A company can only elect to transfer imputation credits as part of loss grouping transactions that relate to the 2017-18 and later income years. For more information, including about how to make an election to transfer imputation credits, refer to the Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 29 No 5 (June 2017) at pages 110 to 113. Ceasing to be an ICA company A company will cease to be an ICA company if it's unable to keep an ICA. This will happen when the conditions listed under Who must keep an ICA on page 5 no longer apply to the company. Imputation requirements when ceasing to be an ICA company In any of these situations the company must file an imputation return within 2 months of the cease date. The return should cover the period from the previous 1 April (the first day of the current tax year) to the last day on which the company is an ICA company. If the company has a debit balance in its ICA on cessation, it must pay further income tax to clear the debit balance (page 10). If the closing balance is a credit, a debit entry equal to the amount of the credit must be made to the company's ICA to bring its balance to nil. The entry is dated as at the date of cessation and the benefits of the credit balance are lost. For more information on the obligations of a company that's being liquidated, refer to the Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 6, No 11 (April 1995). ird.govt.nz16 Disputes If you disagree with an imputation assessment you can follow our formal disputes process. Find out more about the disputes process at ird.govt.nz/disputes Penalties and interest There are 4 types of imputation penalties on further income tax: • • imputation penalty tax • • late payment penalty • • shortfall penalties, and • • late filing penalties for Australian companies. Imputation penalty tax If a company has a debit balance in its ICA at 31 March in any year, it automatically incurs a 10% penalty on the further income tax due (unless the relief provision applies - page 11). This penalty serves 2 purposes. • • It penalises the company for having a debit closing balance. • • It deters the company from having a debit closing balance in following years. Late payment We may charge you a late payment penalty if you miss a payment or it’s late. We’ll also charge you interest if you don’t make your tax payment by the due date. If you cannot pay your tax by the due date, please call us. We’ll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement, depending on your circumstances. Go to ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/penalties-and-interest/ penalties-and-debt for more information. Shortfall penalties A shortfall penalty is a percentage of a tax shortfall (or tax deficit) that results from certain actions. There are 5 categories of fault and the penalty increases according to the seriousness of the fault, as shown below. ActionPenalty Not taking reasonable care20% Unacceptable tax position20% Gross carelessness40% Abusive tax position100% Evasion150% These penalties are fully explained in our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. Late filing penalties for Australian companies A late filing penalty of $250 may be imposed on Australian companies that do not file their annual imputation account returns on time. Amounts under $100 Interest and late payment penalties are not charged on outstanding amounts less than $100. Australian ICA companies An Australian company that has elected to maintain an ICA can revoke this election at any time, or it will lapse if the company ceases to be eligible to maintain an ICA. These cessations are effective for all purposes other than paying imputed dividends, until the end of that tax year. The effect is that a debit will arise in the ICA for the same amount as any credit balance, ie, the company will lose its existing imputation credits. Such credits cannot be reinstated should the company re-elect to maintain an ICA or if its eligibility is restored and an election is made. Imputed dividends cannot be paid from the date that either: • • we receive the revocation, or • • eligibility ceases. Neither the revocation nor the lapse in eligibility will affect the obligations of the Australian company that arose while the company was maintaining an ICA. We have the discretion to revoke an Australian company's election in the event of an actual or potential breach in the imputation rules, including: • • non-payment of further income tax, penalties and interest without entering into an arrangement with us to remedy the default • • non-filing of imputation returns, or • • we have reasonable grounds to believe the Australian company will incur and default on liability for further income tax, penalties and interest. We're not obliged to accept the re-election of any company whose election we have revoked previously, if the company cannot satisfy us that the reasons for revocation will not occur again. An Australian company's revocation is also effective immediately for the purposes of paying imputed dividends, but for all other purposes it's effective from the end of that tax year. Note Where an ICA company tie breaks to Australia under the Australia/New Zealand Double Tax Agreement it remains an Australian ICA company until it becomes a NZ resident company. Any balance will move with the company between the regimes. Assessments and disputes Assessments We'll issue a notice of assessment only when a company files an annual imputation return that works out to a debit balance. We will not issue a notice of assessment for returns with nil or credit balances. If we disagree with the imputation return a company files, we'll generally issue a Notice of proposed adjustment - IR770. In limited cases we may issue an assessment instead. For example, if the assessment: • • reflects an agreement between the company and us, or • • corrects a simple and obvious mistake in the return. IMPUTATION 17 Documentation of dividends Company dividend statement When a company declares a dividend, it must complete and retain the dividend distribution details on a company dividend statement at the time the dividend is declared. The company dividend statement must contain: • • the number of shares for which the dividend was declared (or for a bonus issue, the number of shares included in the bonus issue) • • the date the dividend was declared • • the date the dividend was paid • • the total amount paid as dividends or the amount of the bonus issue • • the total amount of imputation credits attached • • the imputation ratio of the dividend • • the applicable exchange rate used when a dividend is paid in Australian dollars by an Australian company • • any other information we require. Submitting company dividend statements The company must send its dividend statement(s) to us within the time allowed for filing its income tax return. These can be sent attached to the income tax return, or separately. Australian companies should attach the dividend statement to their imputation return. Shareholder dividend statement When a company pays a shareholder a dividend with any imputation credit attached, it must give the shareholder a shareholder dividend statement at the time it pays the dividend. This statement must be in a form approved by us, and show the following details: • • name of the company • • date of payment of the dividend • • name, address and IRD number of the shareholder receiving the dividend • • amount of any RWT deducted • • amount of any NRWT deducted • • amount of the dividend paid to the shareholder, excluding imputation credits • • the amount of any imputation credits attached • • total of the dividend plus any imputation credit attached • • any other information we require. Australian companies paying a dividend with an imputation credit attached are required to specifically use the term New Zealand imputation credit on the shareholder dividend statement. This is because the term imputation credit is also used in Australia for Australian credits of company tax attached to dividends. ird.govt.nz18 Companies can elect to form imputation groups. Because Australian companies fall within the imputation rules, they may also elect to form, or be part of an imputation group. Imputation grouping enables any Australian or New Zealand company within a wholly owned group to pay an imputed dividend using imputation credits gained by any Australian or New Zealand company within the group from: • • tax any of those companies have paid, or • • imputation credits attached to dividends received by any of those companies that are shareholders of other companies. More information For more information about imputation grouping go to ird.govt.nz/imputation Eligibility to form a group Companies are entitled to form an imputation group if they meet these requirements: • • The companies must each maintain an ICA. • • They must be wholly owned groups of companies resident in either New Zealand or Australia, but not resident for double tax agreement purposes in another country. • • Qualifying companies may only form an imputation group if all members of the group are qualifying companies. • • Mining companies may only form an imputation group if all members of that group are mining companies. • • Members of a consolidated group may only be part of an imputation group if all members of the consolidated group become the imputation group. • • Members of more than 1 consolidated group may only be part of an imputation group if the existing credits in the consolidated imputation accounts have the same shareholder continuity profile. • • There must be no arrangement to defeat the intent and application of the imputation rules. Trans-Tasman imputation groups It's possible to have either imputation groups with New Zealand or Australian-only members. Imputation groups that have any combination of New Zealand and Australian members are known as trans-Tasman imputation groups. How to form a group Nominated companies Imputation groups must nominate 1 member of the group as an agent of the group for the purposes of the imputation rules. This company will be known as the nominated company. The nominated company must be a member of the imputation group, and if the imputation group is also a trans-Tasman imputation group (has Australian and New Zealand members), the nominated company must be a New Zealand company. The same company must also be the nominated company of the associated resident imputation subgroup. Consolidated groups Where a consolidated group forms or joins an imputation group, the nominated company of the consolidated group must give notice that all the members of the group are eligible and wish to be part of the imputation group. Resident imputation subgroups Trans-Tasman imputation groups must also form and operate a resident imputation subgroup account. The subgroup consists of all the New Zealand members of the trans-Tasman imputation group. Making an election An imputation group is formed and eligible companies join an existing imputation group from the beginning of the tax year in which we receive the notice of election. For example, an election received on 20 March 2024 will apply for the entire 2024 tax year, 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. Companies wanting to form an imputation group should complete an Election to form an imputation group - IR473 form.

Criteria for forming an imputation group All companies forming the imputation group must be wholly-owned. Each company must be also eligible to be part of an imputation group, i.e meets all the following criteria: - resident in New Zealand or Australia, and - maintains an imputation credit account - is not a qualifying company unless all members are qualifying companies - is not a mining company, unless all members are mining companies - is not a member of a consolidated group, unless all members of the consolidated group meet all of the above criteria and also elect to be members of the imputation group - members of more than one consolidated group may only be part of an imputation group if the existing credits in the consolidated imputation accounts have the same shareholder continuity profile - there must be no arrangement to defeat the intent and application of the imputation rules All Australian companies electing to be part of an imputation group must also complete a Trans-Tasman imputation election (IR488) form. This is available from our website www.ird.govt.nz Elections from consolidated groups The nominated company of an electing consolidated group should complete the "Consolidated group election" section on this page. Details also need to be provided on page 1 of this form. Application date of elections An election applies from the start of the imputation year in which we receive it. The imputation year covers the period 1 April to 31 March regardless of companies' balance dates. Nominated company One member of the imputation group must be the nominated company. Where the group has both Australian and New Zealand members, the nominated company must be a New Zealand resident and responsible for the resident imputation subgroup filing requirement.

It has an opening balance, credit and debit entries and a closing balance. Once the imputation group has formed, all the members' debits and credits are recorded in the group's ICA, not the individual company's ICA. Opening balance The following table shows how the ICA's opening balance is determined when the group is formed. When an imputation group forms, there is generally no credit for an opening balance. The general rule is that there is no credit for an opening balance in the account when a consolidated group, company or person starts a memorandum account. The following table shows the exceptions for particular types of groups. Type of groupOpening balance Imputation group converts to a consolidated group Consolidated group's opening balance 2 or more consolidated imputation groups combine Sum of all consolidated groups' current balances immediately before combining Resident imputation subgroup forms Trans-Tasman imputation group's balance Credit and debit entries When more than 1 consolidated group forms or joins an imputation group, all the existing entries in the ICA become entries in the ICA of the imputation group. Otherwise, credits are basically the same as those for a company ICA, for example: • • income tax paid • • further income tax • • imputation credits attached to dividends received • • certain transfers of credits from other credit accounts • • for Australian members - NRWT, non-resident contractors' withholding tax and schedular taxes (shippers, film renters and insurance) paid by that company. Debits include, for example: • • imputation credits attached to dividends paid by a group member • • refunds of income tax • • any unused credit balance after a breach of continuity of shareholder rules (page 14) • • credit balance if the group ceases to exist • • certain transfers to other credit accounts • • for Australian members - refunds of NRWT, non-resident contractors' withholding tax and schedular taxes (shippers, film renters and insurance) paid by that company. Refer to pages 9 and 10 for a more complete list of possible debits and credits. Closing balances While the pre-grouping balances of the members' individual ICAs are not transferred to the imputation group's ICA, credits can be used to offset to the extent of the group's ICA debit. This is subject to shareholder continuity being maintained. Like standard ICAs, if the balance at 31 March is a debit, the group must make a payment (called further income tax) to clear the account. An imputation penalty tax of 10% of the closing payment is also payable. Both amounts are due by 20 June following the end of the tax year. Normally, an ICA company gets the benefit from the payment of further income tax as an income tax credit. Because the imputation group has no income tax liability an election to transfer the corresponding credit to any or all of the group members to offset their income tax liability is allowed. Attach a letter to the imputation return telling us how you want to action the transfer. Groups' annual imputation returns - IR4J The group representative will file one IR4J, taking in all the transactions for each member of the group. Members of imputation groups should complete individual ICA returns with their annual Companies income tax return - IR4. The individual ICAs will generally record the balance to the date of consolidation. If a member of a consolidated group has a nil balance at all times during the imputation year, they will not be required to file an individual Imputation credit account return - IR4J or a Māori authority credit account return – IR8J. Member entities that do not have a nil balance at all times during the year are still required to file IR 4J or IR8J returns. This change applies from 2021 tax year and onwards. Return due dates Returns for New Zealand and trans-Tasman groups are due on the same dates as if they were not grouped. If the group has all Australian members, the due date is 31 July after the end of the tax year. Limits on income tax refunds Companies in an imputation group can request a refund only if that refund does not cause the ICA to go into debit. If a company in an imputation group receives a refund without requesting it, the company has the choice of either returning it to us or filing an updated ICA that shows sufficient credit to allow the release of the refund. ird.govt.nz22 Maintaining a resident imputation subgroup ICA As already described, special requirements apply for trans-Tasman imputation groups. When entries arise to the trans-Tasman imputation group's ICA that, had the imputation group not been formed, would have been entered in the ICA of a New Zealand member, these must also be entered into the resident imputation subgroup's ICA. Should a debit balance remain in the resident imputation subgroup's ICA at 31 March, further income tax will be payable. In these cases the nominated company of the trans-Tasman imputation group will file an imputation return and pay the further income tax under their own IRD number. When such further income tax is paid, the payment is credited to the ICAs of both the: • • trans-Tasman imputation group, and • • resident imputation subgroup. Changing imputation groups Notifying changes to a group's members The Imputation group maintenance form - IR475 is available for imputation groups to add or cease members or change nominated companies. Ceasing to be part of a group Companies may either cease to be eligible to be in an imputation group (eg, no longer part of the wholly owned group) or choose to opt out. Members who want to leave an imputation group can elect to do so on an IR475. Generally, a company wishing to leave a group does so either on the date specified on the notice of election to cease, or at the beginning of the tax year when we receive the notice. Where a company ceases to be eligible to be a member, the departure from the imputation group occurs either on the day eligibility ceases if an election is made, or from the beginning of the tax year in which the cessation of eligibility arose. If a New Zealand member leaves an imputation group that is a trans-Tasman imputation group, it will also leave the resident imputation subgroup. Ceasing to be a group Although 2 or more companies are eligible to form an imputation group, the group may continue to exist if it's reduced to 1 member and that member is itself the nominated company. Where an entire imputation group ceases, they should notify us in writing. Use this form to make one or more of the following elections (tick the ones that apply): Election to join an existing imputation group Election to leave an imputation group Change of the nominated company of an imputation group If you need help completing this form, please read the notes on the back page. Election to join an existing imputation group Name of imputation group (8 digit numbers start in the second box. ) Current ICA balance The undersigned company (or all companies in the consolidated group) agree and are eligible to: - join an imputation group under section FN 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 - be jointly and severally liable for the imputation group's further income tax, civil penalties and interest.

A newly incorporated company can join an existing group from the beginning of the income year of incorporation. A newly acquired company can join an existing group from the day it becomes eligible to be a member. All other elections will apply from the beginning of the following income year. Leaving an imputation group If a company is choosing to leave the group, unless a later date is requested, membership will cease from the beginning of the income year in which we are notified. If the company is no longer eligible or entitled to membership, unless a later date is requested, membership will cease from the beginning of the income year in which it became ineligible or no longer entitled. The company may use the date that it is no longer to be treated as part of the imputation group however the company must notify us within 30 days after the date on which eligibility or entitlement to part of the group ended. We may agree to extend the 30 day period if it is reasonable in the circumstances to do so. If a company leaves the group in the same year that it joined the company is treated as leaving on the same day it joined. If there is no nominated company for the group this will mean membership of all companies ceases at the beginning of the income year. Liquidation will mean membership of the group ceases during the income year, on the day of liquidation, and not the beginning of the income year. Change in nominated company It is the exiting nominated company's responsibility to advise us if there is to be an alternative nominated company for the imputation group. The change of a nominated company will apply from 30 days after the date we receive the notice, unless a later date is specified on the notice.

Cooperative companies can declare dividends in the same way as other companies. In this case the normal imputation rules (explained in Part 1) apply. They can also pass on imputation credits to their shareholders by: • • attaching a credit to a cash distribution, or • • making a notional distribution with a credit attached. However, a cooperative company can make each of the above distributions only once in any income year. Cash distributions treated as dividends If a cooperative company makes a cash distribution, it can elect not to claim the amount of the distribution as a deduction. In these cases the distribution is treated as if it were a dividend. Any election not to deduct the amount of the cash distribution must be in writing and be sent to us on or before the day the distribution is made. Determining the amount distributed The amount of the cash distribution allocated to each shareholder is based on produce transactions. Produce transactions: • • are between a cooperative company and its shareholders • • involve the acceptance or supply of produce that is trading stock, or goods that are trading stock • • are purchases, sales, or other acquisitions, or disposals of the produce or goods between the company and its shareholders, so long as this is a principal activity of the company. Calculating total imputation credits If a cooperative company decides to attach imputation credits to a cash distribution, the total of all imputation credits to be attached is calculated according to the following formula: a× b 1 − b Where: a is the total amount of the cash distribution (excluding any imputation credits) b is the company income tax rate for the income year that covers the most recently ended tax year. Calculating credits to distribute to individuals Once the total imputation credit has been determined, the amount to be allocated to each shareholder is calculated according to the following formula: c ×e d Where: c is the shareholder's share of the cash distribution (excluding the imputation credit) d is the total amount of the cash distribution (excluding any imputation credit) e is the total of all imputation credits attached to the cash distribution. Example Total cash distribution for the year $ 300,000 Shareholder’s share $ 15,000 To t a l imputation credit: a× b = $300,000 × 28 =$116,666 1 − b72 Shareholder’s share of imputation credit: c ×e= $15,000 × $116,666 =$5,833 d$300,000 The shareholder returns dividend income of $20,833 ($15,000 plus $5,833) and claims an imputation credit of $5,833. Imputation credits and notional distributions Cooperative companies may also allocate imputation credits to shareholders by making a notional distribution. If they choose to do so, they must first calculate the amount of the imputation credit to be allocated to each shareholder and then calculate the amount of the notional distribution. Calculating the shareholder's imputation credit The imputation credit is calculated using this formula: a ×c b Where: a is the total amount payable to or by the shareholder for the year for produce transactions b is the total of all amounts payable to or by all shareholders for the year for produce transactions c is the total of all imputation credits attached to the notional distribution. Part 4 - Cooperative companies ird.govt.nz26 Example Piopio Fruit Ltd is a shareholder of a cooperative company. Amount payable to Piopio Fruit Ltd for produce transactions $ 10,000 Total amounts payable to all shareholders for produce transactions $ 140,000 Total imputation credits $ 15,000 Imputation credit allocated to Piopio Fruit Ltd: $ 10,000 ×$15,000=$1,071 $140,000 Calculating the notional distribution The notional distribution is calculated using this formula: a −a b Where: a is the amount of imputation credit allocated to the shareholder b is the company income tax rate for the income year that covers the most recently ended tax year. Example Imputation credit as calculated previously $1,071 2019-20 company income tax rate 28% $1,071 −$1,071=$2,754 0.28 Piopio Fruit Ltd returns dividend income of $3,825 ($2,754 plus $1,071) and claims an imputation credit of $1,071. Other imputation rules for cooperative companies Imputation ratio and benchmark Unlike other companies that make cash or notional distributions, the rules relating to the imputation ratio and benchmark dividend (pages 12 and 13) don't apply to cooperative companies. Imputation credits can be attached to a cash distribution at different rates even if a notional distribution has been made. The cooperative companies' exemption from the imputation ratio and benchmark dividend rules does not apply to dividends paid based on shareholding, ie, the exemption only relates to distributions based on produce transactions. Statutory producer boards Most of the imputation rules apply to statutory producer boards in a similar way to how they apply to cooperative companies. However, there are some differences. For more information about imputation and statutory producer boards, please contact: Team Leader Significant Enterprises, Services Inland Revenue PO Box 39010 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 Phone 0800 443 773 IMPUTATION 27 Benefit for New Zealand-resident shareholders The advantage of the imputation system for New Zealand-resident shareholders is that they can benefit from the income tax paid by the company. When a company allocates imputation credits to the dividends it pays to its shareholders, it passes on to them the credit for these tax payments. When New Zealand-resident shareholders file their tax returns, they include in their taxable income both the dividend they received and the amount of the imputation credits. They can then offset the credit amount against their income tax payable. If they receive excess imputation credits, these are not refundable. Instead, they are used as described below. Treatment of excess imputation credits Income yearShareholder typeTr e a t m e n t 2006 and onward Individuals Unincorporated clubs/societies Carry excess forward to reduce any tax liability in the following year. Deemed losses generated before 2006 continue to be carried forward until offset against taxable income. Companies Estates Tr u s t s Māori authorities Incorporated clubs/societies Convert excess to a deemed loss. Converting excess imputation credits into a loss The amount of the deemed loss is calculated using the following formula: a b Where: a is the amount of imputation credits unable to be used in payment of the year's income tax b is either: –the company income tax rate, if the shareholder is a company or if the imputation credits that give rise to the credit of tax are assessable as category A income of the trustee of a group investment fund, or –the extra emolument rate, in any other case. Example The 2023 income tax return of a shareholder who is a company showed the following: Net dividends received $ 16,000 Imputation credits attached $ 6,000 Loss from business income $ 5,000 2023 taxable income $ 17,000 Tax at 28% $ 4,760 Less imputation credits $ 6,000 Excess imputation credits $ 1,240 Because the shareholder is a company taxpayer and the income is for the 2023 year the excess imputation credits are converted to a loss by dividing them by 28%. $1,240 =$4,428 0.28 The $4,428 is carried forward and used to reduce the shareholder's taxable income in the following year. Determining the amount of credit in certain cases Credit distributed to the beneficiary of a trust If a trust receives a dividend that's been distributed as beneficiaries' income, any imputation credits attached to the dividend must be allocated to the beneficiaries according to the following formula: a× b c Where: a is the total of all imputation credits attached to all dividends distributed to the beneficiaries during the year b is the total distribution, including capital or non-taxable distributions, made to a particular beneficiary during the year c is the total distribution, including capital or non-taxable distributions, made to all beneficiaries during the year. Note If an imputation credit is limited by the formula then only that imputation credit the person actually receives is included in their assessable income rather than the full imputation credit. Part 5 - Shareholders receiving imputed dividends ird.govt.nz28 Example The Piwakawaka Booklovers Trust receives gross dividend income of $16,000 which includes $4,000 of imputation credits attached. The trust has 3 beneficiaries: Rose, Josie and Harry. The trustee makes distributions to the beneficiaries as follows: Gross dividendCapital incomeTotal income Rose$ 6,400$20,000$26,400 Josie$ 9,600$10,000$19,600 HarryNil$10,000$10,000 Total$16,000$40,000$56,000 The dividend's imputation credits are allocated to the beneficiaries as follows: Rose $4,000× $26,400 =$1,885.71 $56,000 Josie $4,000× $19,600 =$1,400.00 $56,000 There is no calculation here for Harry because he received no dividends. The residual imputation credits of $714.29 ($4,000 − $1,885.71 − $1,400) are lost. Foreign investor tax credit (FITC) received by the beneficiary of a trust When a beneficiary of a trust derives a supplementary dividend (under the FITC rules), the calculation for allocating imputation credits is different, in the following ways: • • Item a - imputation credits - in the preceding calculations includes all supplementary dividends paid to beneficiaries. • • The amount of the imputation credits for a particular beneficiary is reduced by the gross amount of supplementary dividends paid to that beneficiary. There's an explanation of the FITC rules on page 29. Example Using the previous example, the Piwakawaka Booklovers Trust has a supplementary dividend of $100 included in its dividend income. The dividend imputation credits attached are $3,900 (reduced because a supplementary dividend is now paid) plus $100 supplementary dividend = $4,000. The supplementary dividend is distributed to Rose (who is a non-resident). Gross dividendCapital incomeTotal income Rose$ 6,500$20,000$26,500 Josie$ 9,600$10,000$19,600 HarryNil$10,000$10,000 Total$16,100$40,000$56,100 The dividend imputation credits are allocated to the beneficiaries as follows: Rose $4,000× $26,500 =$1,889.48−$100=$1,789.48 $56,100 Josie $4,000× $19,600 =$1,397.50 $56,100 There is no calculation here for Harry because he received no dividends. Partnerships If a partnership derives a dividend with imputation credits attached, the proportion of the credits allocated to each partner is calculated using the following formula: a× b c Where: a is the total of all imputation credits attached to dividends derived by the partners from the partnership b is the income the partner receives from the partnership c is the income of the partnership for the income year. Example Total partnership income for the year is $40,000. This includes dividend income of $10,000 and trading income of $30,000. The dividend has imputation credits attached of $3,000. There are 2 partners: • • Sam receives 50% of the dividend income ($5,000) and 40% of the trading income ($12,000) = $17,000 total. • • Michael receives 50% of the dividend income ($5,000) and 60% of the trading income ($18,000) = $23,000 total. Calculating each partner's share of the imputation credits: Sam $3,000× $17,000 =$1,275 $40,000 Michael $3,000× $23,000 =$1,725 $40,000 IMPUTATION 29 Companies Companies, including widely held savings vehicles, are limited in the amount of tax credit they can claim. Allocation ratio The amount of imputation credits that a company is permitted to allocate to shareholders is limited to a specific ratio - Part 2 has more details. Non-resident shareholders Unlike New Zealand-resident shareholders, imputation credits attached to a non-resident's dividend have no effect, because the dividend: • • is not assessable in New Zealand • • is unlikely to be taxable in the non-resident's own country • • cannot be claimed for a tax credit. Where NRWT is deducted from any dividend paid to a non-resident the amount of NRWT deducted will not be reduced by the amount of imputation credits that are attached to the dividend paid to the non-resident shareholder. There's more information about NRWT in our NRWT - payer's guide - IR291. For more information on these changes refer to our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 7, No 11 (March 1996). Foreign investor tax credits (FITC) Special rules apply when a New Zealand-resident company has non-resident shareholders. These include the FITC rules. FITC reduce the maximum rate of tax (company tax and NRWT) paid in New Zealand by certain non-resident shareholders. Note From 1 February 2010, where fully imputed dividends are paid to a non-resident shareholder and that shareholder is a non- portfolio (greater than 10% direct voting interest) shareholder the dividend will be exempt from NRWT and the FITC rules will not apply. Before the FITC rules were introduced, non-resident shareholders were effectively taxed twice on their income from New Zealand companies. The company itself paid income tax and then NRWT was deducted from the net profit distributed as dividends to the non-resident shareholders. The FITC rules let New Zealand-resident companies pay a supplementary dividend to their non-resident shareholders and then claim an FITC credit in New Zealand to make up the supplementary dividend paid. The amount of FITC credit the company can claim is calculated as a portion of the imputation credits attached to dividends paid to non-resident shareholders. The following comparison shows the result of claiming the FITC credit: Without FITCWith FITC New Zealand company's profit before tax $ 100.00$ 100.00 Less income tax at company rate (28%) $28.00$28.00 Company's after-tax profit$72.00$72.00 Add back FITC claimed by company $0.00$12.71 Amount available for non-resident's dividend $72.00$72.00 Share of profits paid to non-resident shareholder $72.00$84.71 Less NRWT deducted @ 15%$10.80$12.71 Net dividend paid to non-resident shareholder $61.20$72.00 For more detailed information on the FITC rules, including calculating supplementary dividends, refer to our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 7, No 11 (March 1996) Special FITC rules There are special imputation rules for FITC. Neither the imputation rules for benchmark dividends nor the anti-credit streaming rules apply to FITC attached to dividends (page 13). Under these special imputation rules, the supplementary dividend is treated as if it were not paid. How the company claims FITC The New Zealand-resident company claims FITC in its IR4 income tax return. FITC is allowed as a deduction against the company's income tax payable for the year in which it paid the dividend. If the company has no tax liability for that year, FITC can be offset against income tax it has paid in any of the previous four income years. If the company is part of a wholly owned group, it can offset the FITC amount against the tax liability of another company in the group for the current or previous four income years. If the company still has leftover FITC after that, it can carry the credits forward to future years, as long as it keeps at least 66% shareholder continuity. When the FITC rules first apply The FITC rules apply to all dividends with NRWT deducted. The FITC rules also apply to companies which pay supplementary dividends to non-resident portfolio shareholders (shareholders who hold less than 10% of a company's shares). Cessation of FITC rules for dividends paid to non- portfolio investors Where fully imputed dividends are paid to non-resident investors with a non-portfolio holding (those holding a 10% or greater voting interest in a company) or they're exempt from tax under a double tax agreement, an FITC credit will no longer be available from 1 April 2010. Transitional rules will apply for a supplementary dividend holding company. ird.govt.nz30 Need to speak with us?

IR274 July 2022 Imputation A guide for New Zealand companies IMPUTATION 2 Introduction The dividend imputation system lets companies pass on to their shareholders credits for the New Zealand income tax paid by the company. This means that shareholders get the benefit of the income tax the company has paid. Imputation applies to income tax paid by New Zealand resident companies for all income years from 1989 onwards. In this guide Part 1 of this guide is a general explanation of how the imputation system works and gives a basic explanation of a Māori authority credit. Part 2 explains the ICA (imputation credit account). A company records in this memorandum account the amount of income tax it pays, which it can pass on as tax credits with the dividends it pays to its shareholders. This part also gives a brief explanation of a Māori authority credit account (MACA). Part 3 covers imputation groups, which are companies that operate their imputation accounts together. Part 4 explains the special imputation rules relating to cooperative companies. Part 5 outlines how shareholders are taxed for dividends they receive, and the impact on the income of an overseas shareholder. Part 6 provides the Inland Revenue contact details you may need for more information on imputation. Tax year and income year The term tax year is a global concept across all tax activities in New Zealand. Each tax year ends on 31 March of the relevant year. For example, the 2020 tax year runs from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020. The term income year means a company's income year ending at its balance date. • • Most companies have a standard balance date of 31 March. Their income year runs from 1 April to 31 March of the following year, which aligns with the tax year. • • If a company has a non-standard balance date, its income year will follow a different timeline from the tax year, for example, 1 October to 30 September. These companies should get professional tax advice if they need help with the timing of imputation. www.ird.govt.nz Go to our website for information and to use our services and tools. • • Log in or register for myIR – manage your tax and entitlements online. • • Demonstrations – learn about our services by watching short videos. • • Get it done online – complete forms and returns, make payments, give us feedback. • • Work it out – use our calculators, worksheets and tools, for example, to check your tax code, find filing and payment dates, calculate your student loan repayment. • • Forms and guides – download our forms and guides.

Companies can do this by imputing (attaching to the dividends they pay out) credits for the income tax the company has already paid. The amount imputed is called an imputation credit. When the shareholders receiving these dividends fill in their income tax returns, they include in their gross income not only the dividend they receive from the company, but also the imputation credit attached to it. They can then claim credit against their income tax liability for the amount of the imputation credit attached to the dividend. The reason for imputation The imputation system was introduced to make sure that, as far as possible, company profits are taxed once only, at the marginal tax rate of the company's shareholders. Before imputation, a company paid income tax on its profits, then the shareholders paid tax again when the profits were distributed in the form of dividends. The imputation system allows shareholders a credit for the income tax the company has already paid, so company profits are not taxed twice. The difference imputation makes Without imputation With imputation Tax on company Company profit $ 1,000.00$ 1,000.00 Company income tax at 28% $ 280.00$ 280.00 After-tax profit $ 720.00$ 720.00 Share of profits to shareholders $ 720.00$ 720.00 Retained earnings Nil Nil Tax on shareholder Share of profits distributed $ 720.00$ 720.00 Imputation credit attached Nil$ 280.00 Taxable amount $ 720.00$ 1,000.00 Tax (RWT) at 33% $ 237.60$ 330.00 Less imputation credit Nil$ 280.00 Tax payable by shareholder $ 237.60$ 50.00 Result for shareholder Share of profits received $ 720.00$ 720.00 Less tax payable $ 237.60$ 50.00 Net dividend after tax $ 482.40$ 670.00 This shows how the shareholder receives a greater net dividend when imputation is used. Related tax credit systems Some other tax credit systems are connected to imputation or use similar practices, such as memorandum accounts. Life insurers A life insurer must operate a policyholder credit account (PCA), which interacts with the ICA (imputation credit account). If you need more information about how a PCA operates, please contact: Team Leader Significant Enterprises, Services Inland Revenue Private Bag 39010 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 Phone 0800 443 773 Māori authority credits If you're a Māori authority, you use the Māori authority credit system. This is similar to a company imputation credit. The Māori authority credit system allows authorities to pass on to their members the benefit of the income tax they have already paid. Māori authorities can do this by attaching to the distributions they pay out, credits for the income tax which the authority has already paid, so profits aren't taxed twice. The amount attached to the distribution is called a Māori authority credit. For more information on this system and to see if you must keep a Māori authority credit memorandum account (MACA), refer to our guide Becoming a Māori authority - IR487. Research and development (R&D) loss tax credit For income years beginning on or after 1 April 2015, you may be able to cash out (have refunded) up to 28% of any tax losses associated with an eligible R&D (research and development) activity. You may be eligible to apply for the credit if your company: • • is a loss-making company • • is a tax resident in New Zealand, and • • expenditure on R&D salary and wages is 20% or more of your total salary and wage expenditure. However, you will need to be aware that no credit balance due to provisional or income tax paid will arise in an imputation credit account of a company that has claimed the R&D tax credit until that company has repaid the cashed-out amounts. This is to maintain tax neutrality with companies who are not able to cash out losses. For more information and examples on the R&D loss tax credit go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: RDLTC). Part 1 - Imputation overview www.ird.govt.nz5 Part 2 - ICA (imputation credit account) An ICA is simply a memorandum or record-keeping account that a company maintains. Its purpose is to keep track of how much tax a company has paid, and how much credit for that tax is available to pass on to shareholders. You use the information in the ICA to complete your imputation return each tax year. Who must keep an ICA Every New Zealand-resident company, and any other organisation considered a company for tax purposes, must keep an ICA. This includes unit trusts, cooperative companies, life insurance companies and statutory producer boards. It also includes group investment funds (except for certain income). Companies not required to keep an ICA are: • • companies not resident in New Zealand • • companies resident in New Zealand, but treated as non-resident because of a double tax agreement • • trustee companies (except any group investment funds deriving category A income) • • companies whose constitution prohibits their income or property from being distributed to any proprietor, member, or shareholder • • companies whose income is wholly exempt from income tax, unless the income is exempt because it consists of: –foreign dividends derived by a New Zealand resident company or trustee of a group investment fund –dividends paid before 1 April 1996 to a unit trust manager or a trustee or manager of a group investment fund –inter-company dividends between companies in a 100% commonly owned group • • local authorities • • a subsidiary company of the Accident Compensation Corporation to which section 266 of the Accident Compensation Act 2001 applies • • a Māori authority • • a look-through company (LTC). Māori authority credit account (MACA) A MACA is a memorandum or record-keeping account. Its purpose is to keep track of how much tax a Māori authority has paid, and how much credit for tax is available to pass on to the members. Who must keep a MACA? All Māori authorities are required to set up a MACA except: • • a Māori authority whose rules do not allow them to distribute their income or property to any of their members, or • • a Māori authority whose entire income is not liable for income tax, unless this income consists of: –foreign dividends derived by a New Zealand-resident company or trustee of a group investment fund, or –dividends paid before 1 April 1996 to a unit trust manager or a trustee or manager of a group investment fund. What should you do if you are a Māori authority? Find out more information on a MACA in our guide Becoming a Māori authority - IR487. Australian companies with New Zealand shareholders (trans-Tasman imputation) Australian companies can elect to maintain an ICA in New Zealand. This is to address the double taxation on certain trans-Tasman investments by allowing electing companies to pass on imputation credits for New Zealand tax paid, to their shareholders. Companies that make a valid election are referred to as Australian imputation credit account companies and are subject to all the New Zealand domestic, administrative and legislative requirements for imputation. Any differences to the rules for Australian ICA companies are detailed in the relevant sections of this guide. Eligibility Australian companies and unit trusts are eligible to elect to maintain a New Zealand ICA provided: • • their Australian residence is determined by a provision which tests whether the company is resident in Australia (the provision uses the existing New Zealand residence rules but with application to Australia) • • the company is not treated, under a double taxation agreement, as a resident in a country other than Australia or New Zealand • • they meet all the existing New Zealand eligibility criteria (with the exception of the residency criteria) set out in Who must keep an ICA. All the companies in the same wholly owned group as the electing company will be jointly liable for any further income tax, penalties and interest incurred. IMPUTATION 6 Making an election The Australian company must provide an election to us, at least 30 days before the payment of any dividend including a New Zealand imputation credit. An imputed dividend can be paid only after this notice period has passed. For all other purposes, the election start date is retrospective to the beginning of the tax year in which we receive the election. Australian companies wanting to elect to maintain a New Zealand ICA can either register online through our website, or complete the Trans-Tasman imputation election form - IR488. If the Australian company is not already a New Zealand taxpayer, an IRD number will be issued for the maintenance of the ICA.

This period is called the tax year. A company with a balance date other than 31 March cannot align its tax year with its accounting year. Transactions recorded in the ICA The ICA is used to maintain a record of the balance of imputation credits available for allocation with dividends. For each tax year, the company uses it to record: • • an opening balance • • credit entries • • debit entries • • a closing balance. Opening balance The opening balance of the ICA (either debit or credit) is exactly the same as the closing balance for the preceding tax year. For a new ICA company, the opening balance is nil. Credit entries Credits to an ICA increase the amount currently available for allocation to dividends the company pays to its shareholders. The main credit entries are: • • New Zealand income tax paid by the company for 1989 and subsequent income years to meet a provisional tax obligation or end-of-year tax liability (does not include imputation additional tax or use-of-money interest) • • the portion of any amount attributed under the personal services attribution rules that represents the tax that would have been paid on the income • • imputation credits attached to dividends the company receives from other companies • • RWT deducted from interest and dividends the company has received • • residential land withholding tax (RLWT) deducted from the sale or transfer of residential property in New Zealand, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transferred to outstanding amounts • • further income tax that a company may have paid to reduce a closing debit balance for the previous year (pages 10 and 11) • • tax allocated to a company by another wholly owned company that has overpaid its provisional tax • • an adjustment to offset a previous debit that has arisen from a determination that the imputation credits are subject to an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage, which has subsequently been overturned • • payment(s) of qualifying company election tax (QCET) made from 17 May 2007 onwards. Additional credit entries for Australian companies include payment of: • • NRWT on interest, dividends or royalties • • non-resident contractors' withholding tax • • non-resident shippers' tax • • non-resident film renters' tax • • non-resident insurers' tax. In most cases, credit entries occur in the ICA on the date the transaction that causes them takes place, for example the date of payment. This happens regardless of the period it relates to. Examples - date of credit Source of creditDate of credit Company pays 2019 end-of-year income tax on 7 February 2020. 7 February 2020 (2020 tax year) Company pays instalment of 2019 provisional tax on 28 August 2019. 28 August 2019 (2020 tax year) Company pays instalment of 2020 provisional tax on 7 May 2020. 7 May 2020 (2021 tax year) Company receives a dividend with an imputation credit amount attached on 31 March 2020. 31 March 2020 (2020 tax year) Payments that do not cause credit ICA entries The following payments do not cause a credit entry in a company's ICA: • • income tax paid by a company on income it received simply as a trustee • • income tax paid when a company was not an ICA company • • income tax paid by offsetting foreign investor tax credits (FITC) (page 29) • • income tax paid by offsetting further income tax (page 10) • • income tax paid by offsetting imputation credits (page 27) • • income tax paid by a group investment fund deriving category A income to the extent that income tax does not exceed the company's schedular income tax liability for category A income • • payment of QCET before 17 May 2007. Debit entries Debits to an ICA reduce the amount currently available for allocation to dividends paid to shareholders. The main debit entries are: • • imputation credits attached to dividends that a company pays to its shareholders • • an adjustment when a change of shareholding of more than 34% has occurred (page 14) • • income tax refunds received during the income year, except: –a refund of income tax paid for an income year when the company was not an ICA company (a proportional adjustment is needed if the company became an ICA part- way through an income year) –if there's already been a debit entry because of an adjustment to a change of shareholding and the refund is of income tax paid before that change –if there's already been a debit entry because of an adjustment to a change of shareholding and the refund is an FITC refund from a supplementary dividend paid before the change (FITC is explained on page 29) • • overpaid income tax transferred to cover income tax due for 1988 or earlier income years • • overpaid income tax transferred to cover other types of tax owed by the company IMPUTATION 10 Significance of the ICA closing balance If the closing balance is nil or in credit If the ICA closing balance is nil or a credit no further action is required. The company simply carries the closing balance forward as the opening balance for the next tax year. If the closing balance is a debit The ICA can have a debit balance at any time during the tax year. If the balance is a debit at the end of the tax year the company must make a payment to clear the account. The payment the company must make is called further income tax. When a company has to pay further income tax, it must also pay a penalty of 10% of the closing balance. This penalty is called imputation penalty tax. Further income tax and imputation penalty tax are due by 20 June following the end of the tax year in which the debit closing balance arose. Late payment penalties and interest may apply if payment is not made by the due date (page 16). When payment is made towards the ICA debit, it will first go towards any late payment penalties and interest before being credited to further income tax and imputation penalty tax. The amount credited to further income tax is treated as being a payment towards income tax for the income year the payment is made in. This payment will show in the income tax account for that year as a credit transfer. However, the payment cannot be used to pay tax arrears. A company can choose to credit an income tax payment made after the end of the income year to its further income tax liability. Refer to the following example. Example A company with a 31 March balance date has an ICA closing debit balance at 31 March 2019 of $4,500.00 plus 10% penalty tax of $450.00 – due 20 June 2019. The company chooses to use its P3 payment for 2019 provisional tax (PT) paid 7 May 2019 to clear the 2019 ICA. 2019 ICA account $4,500.00ICA assessment / debit closing balance +$ 450.0010% imputation penalty tax $4,950.00Due 20/06/2019 −($4,950.00) Credit transferred from 2019 INC (P3) at 07/05/2019 $0.00 2020 INC account +($4,500.00)Credit transfer (from 2019 ICA at 07/05/2019) The provisional tax payment clears the debit ICA balance of $4,500 and the imputation penalty tax of $450. Because the $450 is a penalty only $4,500 is transferred into income tax for 2020. The transferred credit is not able to be used to pay any 2019 income tax shortfall because it can only be used for current or future income tax years. This could mean the company has not paid enough provisional tax for 2019. • • an adjustment when the credit ratio has altered and a ratio change declaration has not been made (page 13) • • tax allocated by a company to another wholly owned company that has underpaid its provisional tax • • cancellation of notional credits in circumstances where qualifying company dividend methodology has been adopted as a result of the attribution rules • • an adjustment if the company has made an on-market acquisition of its own shares • • an adjustment when a company ceases to be an ICA company (page 15) • • the amount of a credit in the company's ICA (equal to the amount of the imputation credit shown for the personal services under the personal attribution rules) if the company's financial statements are adjusted to reflect an amount attributed under the personal attribution rules • • adjustments made when we consider that an arrangement has been made to obtain a tax advantage • • the total amount of the company's R&D loss tax credits, minus the total amount of previous imputation debit entries for R&D loss tax credits from previous years. The amount of this debit entry is limited to the amount of New Zealand income tax paid by the company in the current year to meet a provisional tax obligation or end-of-year tax liability. Additional debit entries for Australian companies include refunds of: • • NRWT on interest, dividends or royalties • • non-resident contractors' withholding tax • • non-resident shippers' tax • • non-resident film renters' tax • • non-resident insurers' tax. As with credit entries to the ICA, in most cases the date that a debit entry occurs in the ICA is the date the transaction causing the entry takes place. Closing balance At 31 March each year, a company must balance its ICA. It does this by adding all the credit entries (including the opening balance if it's a credit) and deducting all the debit entries (including the opening balance if it's a debit). The final sum is the closing balance. Closing balance Credit entries Opening balance +-= Debit entries Opening balance + creditdebit www.ird.govt.nz11 Further income tax for Australian companies Australian ICA companies that pay further income tax will not generally have a New Zealand income tax liability. In these cases the company may gross up the further income tax paid into a loss, and transfer that loss to another group company, using the following formula: a b Where: a is the amount of further income tax that is paid by the company and not credited against an income tax liability b is the company tax rate for the relevant tax year. Using the example above (of a debit closing balance), if an Australian company has a further income tax payment of $3,000 for the 2019-20 income year this would be divided by 28% to give a loss of $10,714.29. Australian companies should attach a letter to their imputation return, advising that this option has been taken. The receiving company may claim the loss in their following year's income tax return. For example, further income tax payment made on 20 June 2019 for an ICA debit for the year ended 31 March 2019 may be claimed in the receiving company's 2020 income tax return. An explanation of the loss entry should also be attached to the return. Relief for qualifying companies from paying further income tax If the company is a qualifying company and the debit ICA balance arose because the company received an income tax refund, its liability to pay further income tax may be reduced. In this situation, a qualifying company that has a debit imputation balance at the end of the year, or when it ceases to be an ICA company, may have its further income tax liability reduced by an amount calculated using the following formula: refunds − credits Where: • • refunds is the total amount of all refunds of income tax paid to the company, before the debit balance creating the liability for further income tax arises • • credits is the total amount of all credits to the company's ICA, for the period that runs from the tax year in which the first refund was received to the time the calculation is made. A company in this situation will need to make an adjustment in its imputation return for that year. Our Qualifying companies - IR435 guide has more details. Annual imputation return At the end of each tax year, every company that maintains an ICA must complete an annual imputation return. The company can file this return on a separate Annual imputation return - IR4J, or it can use the imputation return included with the Companies income tax return - IR4. The Company tax return guide – IR4GU explains how to fill in the imputation return. Non-active companies can apply to be exempt from filing a return if they fill in a Non-active company declaration - IR433. Australian companies with no New Zealand income tax liability will be issued with a separate IR4J. Due date for filing the imputation return A company must file its imputation return by the due date for filing its income tax return for the corresponding income year. The return due date for Australian ICA companies is 31 July following the end of the tax year, for example, 31 July 2020 for the year ending 31 March 2020. Companies that file returns late may be charged a late filing penalty. The ICA return must show: • • the opening and closing balance of the ICA for the tax year • • the amount and source of all debits and credits that have arisen during the tax year • • the amount of any further income tax payable • • the amount of any imputation penalty tax. Ratio change disclosure We also require a company to make a disclosure in its imputation return if certain ratios increase or decrease by more than 20% from one year to the next. There are two ratios to be considered: 1. The fraction equal to: a b Where: a is the total of all ICA credits attached to all dividends paid by the company during the tax year b is the total amount of all dividends paid by the company during the tax year. 2. The fraction equal to: a b Where: a is the total of all debits arising in the company's ICA during the tax year b is the total of all credits arising in the company's ICA during the t a x year. If either of these ratios increase or decrease by more than 20% from the equivalent ratio in the preceding tax year, the company must state this in its annual imputation return. It must also explain why the change occurred. IMPUTATION 12 Rules for allocating imputation credits to dividends A company may choose whether or not to attach imputation credits to dividends it pays to its shareholders. However, if it chooses to do this it must follow certain rules. Maximum imputation ratio If a company decides to attach imputation credits to dividends it pays, there's a maximum ratio of credit to dividend that can be allocated. The maximum ratio limits the imputation credit that can be attached as follows: • • 38.89% of the share of profit amount: Up to 38.89 cents of imputation credit can be attached to each $1 of share of profit. • • 28% of gross dividend: Each $1 of gross dividend (ie, share of profit plus imputation credits) can consist of up to 28 cents of imputation credit. The imputation ratio is represented using the format 28:72. This indicates the latter proportion of 28 cents of credit attached to each 72 cents of the share of profit amount - see diagram below. Imputation credits: $28 Share of profits distributed as dividend: $72 Gross dividend $100 The net dividend paid to the shareholder may also involve deducting RWT from the share of profit - see the next page for more details. If this ratio is exceeded, the company would effectively be passing on more imputation credits to its shareholders than the amount of tax the company has paid on its profits from which those dividends were paid. Example Company profit: income year 2019-20 $ 100 Tax @ 28% $ 28 Profit after tax $ 72 The company has paid $28 income tax on the $72 available for distribution as dividends. This is why the maximum imputation ratio is 28:72. Australian companies distributing dividends to New Zealand shareholders Even if an Australian ICA company's payment of a dividend is made in Australian dollars, the relevant entries to the ICA must be in New Zealand dollars. These companies may, when paying an Australian dollar dividend, use the New Zealand dollar equivalent at the time of declaring the dividend for all purposes of the imputation rules. This concession depends on there being no more than three months between the declaration and the payment of the dividend. An Australian ICA company can use this concessionary rate to calculate the RWT it must pay to us if it: • • qualifies for the concessionary rate for the calculation of its imputation credits. • • is liable for RWT on resident passive income in the form of a dividend. RWT payable on dividends The rate of RWT payable on a dividend is 33% of the gross amount (the share of profits plus any imputation). However, any imputation credit attached to the dividend reduces the amount of RWT that the company needs to deduct before it pays the dividend to the shareholder. If the total of imputation credits is less than the 33% RWT due, the company paying the dividend must deduct RWT to bring the total deductions up to 33% of the gross dividend (unless the shareholder holds a certificate of exemption from RWT). There's more information about this in our guide Resident withholding tax on dividends - IR284. In the diagram below, the dividend has been fully imputed, ie, the maximum of 28:72 imputation credit has been attached. T a x c o m p o n e n t : $ 3 3 S h a r e o f p r o f i t s : $ 7 2 Gross dividend $100 Net dividend: $67 Imputation credits: $28 RWT: $5 Shareholders exempt from RWT If a shareholder holds a certificate of exemption from RWT, the company does not deduct any RWT, no matter how many imputation credits are attached. The net dividend the shareholder receives is the full amount of the share of profits. www.ird.govt.nz13 In these cases, the shareholder will generally still be liable to pay any RWT on that dividend income when they complete their annual income tax return. The diagram below shows the proportions of amounts in a fully imputed dividend in such cases. Note A company that pays a fully imputed dividend to another company on or after 1 April 2017 can choose not to deduct RWT. T a x c o m p o n e n t : $ 2 8 S h a r e o f p r o f i t s : $ 7 2 Gross dividend $100 Net dividend: $72 Imputation credits: $28 RWT: nil Benchmark dividend The first dividend paid by a company in a tax year is called the benchmark dividend. This sets the required ratio between the company's credits and dividends for the rest of that tax year, ie, the benchmark dividend ratio. Example A company pays a benchmark dividend with $2 of imputation credit attached for every $10 of dividend. This sets the company's benchmark dividend ratio for the tax year at 2:10 or 20%. Every subsequent dividend the company pays during that tax year must have credits attached at a ratio of 2:10. Similarly, if the benchmark dividend has no credits attached, the company cannot attach credits to any subsequent dividends it pays in the same tax year. An exception to this rule applies if: • • the subsequent dividend is not paid as part of an arrangement to get a tax advantage, and • • the company completes a Ratio change declaration - IR407 form. Exception The benchmark dividend rules do not apply to supplementary dividends paid under the foreign investor tax credit (FITC) rules. An explanation of these rules is on page 29. Ratio change declaration The Ratio change declaration - IR407 form is a statutory declaration a company must complete if it wants to change the ratio of a subsequent dividend from the ratio of its benchmark dividend. The IR407 requires the company to make a statutory declaration that the ratio change has not occurred as part of an arrangement to provide a tax advantage. The company must send us the IR407 before it pays the subsequent dividend. Allocation debit The ICA will be debited with an amount called an allocation debit if the ratio of a subsequent dividend is different from the benchmark dividend and either of the following applies: • • the company is required to send us a ratio change declaration, but does not do this before it pays the dividend, or • • the subsequent dividend was paid as part of a tax advantage arrangement. The allocation debit is calculated using this formula: (a × b) − c Where: a is the total amount of all dividends paid during the tax year, excluding any credits attached b is the lesser of: the imputation ratio of the dividend with the greatest imputation ratio of all dividends paid during the tax year, or the maximum imputation ratio permitted c is the total of all imputation credits attached to all dividends paid during the tax year. Allocation debit example 2 June 2019 Benchmark dividend paid$1,000 Imputation credit attached$200 Imputation ratio2:10 2 December 2019 Subsequent dividend paid$1,000 Imputation credit attached$100 Imputation ratio1:10 Allocation debit calculation: atotal dividends paid$2,000 bgreatest imputation ratio2:10 ctotal imputation credits$300 Allocation debit = (2,000 × 2 ÷ 10) − 300 = $100 The allocation debit of $100 is debited to the ICA. This reduces the amount of credit available for the shareholders. Tax advantage arrangements The imputation system includes special rules to prevent shareholders from buying and selling shares to redirect imputation credits to certain shareholders. There are also rules to prevent companies from streaming credits to redirect them to certain shareholders. All these rules exist because all shareholders have borne the company tax, so the credits should be allocated to them in proportion to their shareholding. The rules to prevent companies streaming credits do not apply to supplementary dividends paid under the FITC rules. IMPUTATION 14 Note Even if a company files an interim imputation return for a tax year, it must still complete an annual imputation return covering the period 1 April to 31 March of that tax year. Change of shareholder continuity Imputation credits can only be passed on to shareholders if at least 66% of the company's voting rights and/or market value interests haven't changed hands, from the date the credits arose in the ICA to the date when they are passed on to the shareholders - refer to page 15 for special rules for qualifying companies. Shareholders' economic interests in a company are generally measured by reference to their direct and indirect voting interests in the company. In certain circumstances the shareholders' economic interests in a company will also be determined by the market value of interests in the company. This happens when the voting interests do not reflect the true economic interests held in the company. For more information about this, refer to our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 3, No 7 (April 1992). If a company's shareholder interests change by more than 34%, the company has lost shareholder continuity. In this situation it must enter a debit in its ICA to eliminate any unused credit balance. Example 1 Kokako Adventures Ltd is a company with 7 shareholders, whose voting interests are shown in the table below. On 31 January 2019, Lucy sold a 25% shareholding to Robert and a 10% shareholding to Justin. Justin was an existing shareholder, but Robert is a new shareholder. There have been no other shareholding changes since 31 December 2018. Shareholder Shareholding 31/12/18 Shareholding 31/01/19 Lowest voting interest Jack5%5%5% James15%15%15% Amber25%25%25% Lucy40%5% 1 5% Justin10%20% 2 10% Adam5%5%5% Robert0%25% 3 0% Total100%100%65% 1 40% − 25% - 10% = 5% 2 10% + 10% = 20% 3 0% + 25% = 25% The lowest voting interests of the shareholders have changed by 35% (100% − 65%), so the credit balance in the ICA must be eliminated by entering a debit of the same amount as the credit. Limits on income tax refunds If a company's income tax return works out to a refund, the amount that can be refunded will generally be limited to the amount of the credit closing balance in the company's ICA at the end of the most recently ended tax year. If the ICA's closing balance is nil or a debit, the company is only entitled to receive an income tax refund if it's a qualifying company. Our guide Qualifying companies - IR435 has more details. If the income tax refund is more than the ICA closing credit balance, we'll release only the amount of the tax refund equal to the ICA credit balance, and carry the rest of the refund (the excess imputation credits) forward as a credit against the company's next income tax payment or provisional tax payment. Special provisions and deemed adjustments Any non-refundable overpayment may instead be offset against income tax due for any income year. A special provision allows certain refunds to be issued by deeming the ICA balance to be increased if all these criteria are met: • • A debit adjustment has been made because of a change in shareholding. • • The debit adjustment occurred: –before the date the ICA balance is calculated –at the end of the tax year, on ceasing to be an ICA company –the date an imputation return was filed. • • The refund relates to income tax paid before the date of the debit adjustment. The ICA balance is deemed to be increased by the amount of the debit adjustment made. This allows a refund to be issued. Once it has been issued, there are special rules to make sure a double debit does not occur. Interim imputation returns A company may file an interim imputation return at any time during the tax year. It may want to do this if its income tax refund is limited by the closing imputation balance at the end of the previous tax year, but more credits have arisen in its ICA since that time. In this situation the company can file an interim imputation return to show that the credit balance in the ICA is now sufficient to allow the remainder of the income tax refund to be released. The interim imputation return must cover the period from 1 April to a date not more than 7 days before the date the company files the interim imputation return. Example At 20 April 2019 a company’s income tax account shows: 2018 tax refund due $ 6,000 ICA credit balance at 31 March 2019 $ 300 Maximum refund is $ 300 Balance of 2018 credit retained $ 5,700 The company files an interim imputation return on 20 June 2019 showing that the balance in the ICA at 16 June 2019 was a credit of $7,000. The balance of $5,700 can now be released. www.ird.govt.nz15 Example 2 Kereru Steel Ltd has 3 shareholders, whose shareholdings are shown in the table below. On 31 January 2019 Jasper sold his 20% shareholding to Ozzy. This change was less than 34%, so it wasn’t great enough to cause the company to lose shareholder continuity at that date. However, Jasper sold a further 15% shareholding to Brent at 31 March 2019, and this change, when combined with the previous change, made a 35% change of shareholding, resulting in a loss of shareholder continuity at 31 March 2019. Shareholder Shareholding 31/12/18 Lowest shareholding 31/01/19 Interest for 31/12/18 to 31/01/19 Lowest shareholding 31/03/19 Interest for 31/12/18 to 31/03/19 Jasper100%80%80%65%65% Ozzy0%20%0%20%0% Brent0%0%0%15%0% Total100%100%80%100%65% The credit entries in Kereru Steel Ltd’s ICA over the same period are: DateItemAmount Balance 31/12/2018Balance$,1000 CR 15/01/2019Credit arising from tax paid$100 $1,100 CR 15/03/2019Credit arising from tax paid$200 $1,300CR The $1,000 ICA credit balance as at 31 December 2018 will be lost due to the loss of shareholder continuity as at 31 March 2019. The $100 credit that arose on 15 January 2019 will also be lost as a result of the 2 shareholding changes totaling 35% on 31 January 2019 and 31 March 2019. The $200 credit that arose on 15 March 2019 won’t be lost because the change of shareholding between 15 March 2019 and 31 March 2019 is only 15%. The ordering rule in the imputation system states that ICA credits are offset against any debits in the order in which the credits arose. If Kereru Steel had attached $1,100 of imputation credits to dividends paid out before 31 March 2019 there would be no debit adjustment to the ICA at 31 March 2019. The $200 credit balance on hand would represent the $200 tax payment made on 15 March 2019. Change of shareholding for qualifying companies The shareholder continuity requirement does not apply to qualifying companies. These special rules apply instead. When a company ceases to be a qualifying company there's a debit to the ICA of the lesser of these amounts: • • the balance at that time (after attaching maximum possible imputation credits to the dividends paid during the tax year and up to that time), or • • the greatest previous debit in the ICA at the date of any previous breach of the 66% continuity rule. Transferring imputation credits between commonly owned companies Companies that are commonly owned (ie have at least 66% common voting interests), but are not wholly owned (ie 100% common voting interests), can elect to transfer imputation credits as part of a loss grouping transaction (ie a subvention payment, loss offset or a combination of the 2). The maximum amount of imputation credits which can be transferred is 28% of the total loss grouping transaction. A company can only elect to transfer imputation credits as part of loss grouping transactions that relate to the 2017-18 and later income years. For more information, including about how to make an election to transfer imputation credits, refer to the Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 29 No 5 (June 2017) at pages 110 to 113. Ceasing to be an ICA company A company will cease to be an ICA company if it's unable to keep an ICA. This will happen when the conditions listed under Who must keep an ICA on page 5 no longer apply to the company. Imputation requirements when ceasing to be an ICA company In any of these situations the company must file an imputation return within 2 months of the cease date. The return should cover the period from the previous 1 April (the first day of the current tax year) to the last day on which the company is an ICA company. If the company has a debit balance in its ICA on cessation, it must pay further income tax to clear the debit balance (page 10). IMPUTATION 16 If the closing balance is a credit, a debit entry equal to the amount of the credit must be made to the company's ICA to bring its balance to nil. The entry is dated as at the date of cessation and the benefits of the credit balance are lost. For more information on the obligations of a company that's being liquidated, refer to the Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 6, No 11 (April 1995). Australian ICA companies An Australian company that has elected to maintain an ICA can revoke this election at any time, or it will lapse if the company ceases to be eligible to maintain an ICA. These cessations are effective for all purposes other than paying imputed dividends, until the end of that tax year. The effect is that a debit will arise in the ICA for the same amount as any credit balance, ie, the company will lose its existing imputation credits. Such credits cannot be reinstated should the company re-elect to maintain an ICA or if its eligibility is restored and an election is made. Imputed dividends cannot be paid from the date that either: • • we receive the revocation, or • • eligibility ceases. Neither the revocation nor the lapse in eligibility will affect the obligations of the Australian company that arose while the company was maintaining an ICA. We have the discretion to revoke an Australian company's election in the event of an actual or potential breach in the imputation rules, including: • • non-payment of further income tax, penalties and interest without entering into an arrangement with us to remedy the default • • non-filing of imputation returns, or • • we have reasonable grounds to believe the Australian company will incur and default on liability for further income tax, penalties and interest. We're not obliged to accept the re-election of any company whose election we have revoked previously, if the company cannot satisfy us that the reasons for revocation will not occur again. An Australian company's revocation is also effective immediately for the purposes of paying imputed dividends, but for all other purposes it's effective from the end of that tax year. Assessments and disputes Assessments We'll issue a notice of assessment only when a company files an annual imputation return that works out to a debit balance. We will not issue a notice of assessment for returns with nil or credit balances. If we disagree with the imputation return a company files, we'll generally issue a Notice of proposed adjustment - IR770. In limited cases we may issue an assessment instead. For example, if the assessment: • • reflects an agreement between the company and us, or • • corrects a simple and obvious mistake in the return. Disputes If you disagree with an imputation assessment you can follow our formal disputes process. Find out more about the disputes process at www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: disputes). Penalties and interest There are 4 types of imputation penalties on further income tax: • • imputation penalty tax • • late payment penalty • • shortfall penalties, and • • late filing penalties for Australian companies. Imputation penalty tax If a company has a debit balance in its ICA at 31 March in any year, it automatically incurs a 10% penalty on the further income tax due (unless the relief provision applies - page 11). This penalty serves 2 purposes. • • It penalises the company for having a debit closing balance. • • It deters the company from having a debit closing balance in following years. Late payment We may charge you a late payment penalty if you miss a payment or it’s late. We’ll also charge you interest if you don’t make your tax payment by the due date. If you cannot pay your tax by the due date, please call us. We’ll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement, depending on your circumstances. Go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: penalties and debt) for more information. Shortfall penalties A shortfall penalty is a percentage of a tax shortfall (or tax deficit) that results from certain actions. There are 5 categories of fault and the penalty increases according to the seriousness of the fault, as shown below. ActionPenalty Not taking reasonable care20% Unacceptable tax position20% Gross carelessness40% Abusive tax position100% Evasion150% These penalties are fully explained in our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. Late filing penalties for Australian companies A late filing penalty of $250 may be imposed on Australian companies that do not file their annual imputation account returns on time. Amounts under $100 Interest and late payment penalties are not charged on outstanding amounts less than $100. www.ird.govt.nz17 Documentation of dividends Company dividend statement When a company declares a dividend, it must complete and retain the dividend distribution details on a company dividend statement at the time the dividend is declared. The company dividend statement must contain: • • the number of shares for which the dividend was declared (or for a bonus issue, the number of shares included in the bonus issue) • • the date the dividend was declared • • the date the dividend was paid • • the total amount paid as dividends or the amount of the bonus issue • • the total amount of imputation credits attached • • the imputation ratio of the dividend • • the applicable exchange rate used when a dividend is paid in Australian dollars by an Australian company • • any other information we require. Submitting company dividend statements The company must send its dividend statement(s) to us within the time allowed for filing its income tax return. These can be sent attached to the income tax return, or separately. Australian companies should attach the dividend statement to their imputation return. Shareholder dividend statement When a company pays a shareholder a dividend with any imputation credit attached, it must give the shareholder a shareholder dividend statement at the time it pays the dividend. This statement must be in a form approved by us, and show the following details: • • name of the company • • date of payment of the dividend • • name, address and IRD number of the shareholder receiving the dividend • • amount of any RWT deducted • • amount of any NRWT deducted • • amount of the dividend paid to the shareholder, excluding imputation credits • • the amount of any imputation credits attached • • total of the dividend plus any imputation credit attached • • any other information we require. Australian companies paying a dividend with an imputation credit attached are required to specifically use the term New Zealand imputation credit on the shareholder dividend statement. This is because the term imputation credit is also used in Australia for Australian credits of company tax attached to dividends. IMPUTATION 18 Companies can elect to form imputation groups. Because Australian companies fall within the imputation rules, they may also elect to form, or be part of an imputation group. Imputation grouping enables any Australian or New Zealand company within a wholly owned group to pay an imputed dividend using imputation credits gained by any Australian or New Zealand company within the group from: • • tax any of those companies have paid, or • • imputation credits attached to dividends received by any of those companies that are shareholders of other companies. More information For more information about imputation grouping go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: imputation). Eligibility to form a group Companies are entitled to form an imputation group if they meet these requirements: • • The companies must each maintain an ICA. • • They must be wholly owned groups of companies resident in either New Zealand or Australia, but not resident for double tax agreement purposes in another country. • • Qualifying companies may only form an imputation group if all members of the group are qualifying companies. • • Mining companies may only form an imputation group if all members of that group are mining companies. • • Members of a consolidated group may only be part of an imputation group if all members of the consolidated group become the imputation group. • • Members of more than 1 consolidated group may only be part of an imputation group if the existing credits in the consolidated imputation accounts have the same shareholder continuity profile. • • There must be no arrangement to defeat the intent and application of the imputation rules. Trans-Tasman imputation groups It's possible to have either imputation groups with New Zealand or Australian-only members. Imputation groups that have any combination of New Zealand and Australian members are known as trans-Tasman imputation groups. How to form a group Nominated companies Imputation groups must nominate 1 member of the group as an agent of the group for the purposes of the imputation rules. This company will be known as the nominated company. The nominated company must be a member of the imputation group, and if the imputation group is also a trans-Tasman imputation group (has Australian and New Zealand members), the nominated company must be a New Zealand company. The same company must also be the nominated company of the associated resident imputation subgroup. Consolidated groups Where a consolidated group forms or joins an imputation group, the nominated company of the consolidated group must give notice that all the members of the group are eligible and wish to be part of the imputation group. Resident imputation subgroups Trans-Tasman imputation groups must also form and operate a resident imputation subgroup account. The subgroup consists of all the New Zealand members of the trans-Tasman imputation group. Making an election An imputation group is formed and eligible companies join an existing imputation group from the beginning of the tax year in which we receive the notice of election. For example, an election received on 20 March 2020 will apply for the entire 2020 tax year, 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020. Companies wanting to form an imputation group should complete an Election to form an imputation group - IR473 form.

Each company must be also eligible to be part of an imputation group, i.e meets all the following criteria: - resident in New Zealand or Australia, and - maintains an imputation credit account - is not a qualifying company unless all members are qualifying companies - is not a mining company, unless all members are mining companies - is not a member of a consolidated group, unless all members of the consolidated group meet all of the above criteria and also elect to be members of the imputation group - members of more than one consolidated group may only be part of an imputation group if the existing credits in the consolidated imputation accounts have the same shareholder continuity profile - there must be no arrangement to defeat the intent and application of the imputation rules All Australian companies electing to be part of an imputation group must also complete a Trans-Tasman imputation election (IR488) form. This is available from our website www.ird.govt.nz Elections from consolidated groups The nominated company of an electing consolidated group should complete the "Consolidated group election" section on this page. Details also need to be provided on page 1 of this form. Application date of elections An election applies from the start of the imputation year in which we receive it. The imputation year covers the period 1 April to 31 March regardless of companies' balance dates. Nominated company One member of the imputation group must be the nominated company. Where the group has both Australian and New Zealand members, the nominated company must be a New Zealand resident and responsible for the resident imputation subgroup filing requirement.

It has an opening balance, credit and debit entries and a closing balance. Once the imputation group has formed, all the members' debits and credits are recorded in the group's ICA, not the individual company's ICA. Opening balance The following table shows how the ICA's opening balance is determined when the group is formed. When an imputation group forms, there is generally no credit for an opening balance. The general rule is that there is no credit for an opening balance in the account when a consolidated group, company or person starts a memorandum account. The following table shows the exceptions for particular types of groups. Type of groupOpening balance Imputation group converts to a consolidated group Consolidated group's opening balance 2 or more consolidated imputation groups combine Sum of all consolidated groups' current balances immediately before combining Resident imputation subgroup forms Trans-Tasman imputation group's balance Credit and debit entries When more than 1 consolidated group forms or joins an imputation group, all the existing entries in the ICA become entries in the ICA of the imputation group. Otherwise, credits are basically the same as those for a company ICA, for example: • • income tax paid • • further income tax • • imputation credits attached to dividends received • • certain transfers of credits from other credit accounts • • for Australian members - NRWT, non-resident contractors' withholding tax and schedular taxes (shippers, film renters and insurance) paid by that company. Debits include, for example: • • imputation credits attached to dividends paid by a group member • • refunds of income tax • • any unused credit balance after a breach of continuity of shareholder rules (page 14) • • credit balance if the group ceases to exist • • certain transfers to other credit accounts • • for Australian members - refunds of NRWT, non-resident contractors' withholding tax and schedular taxes (shippers, film renters and insurance) paid by that company. Refer to pages 9 and 10 for a more complete list of possible debits and credits. Closing balances While the pre-grouping balances of the members' individual ICAs are not transferred to the imputation group's ICA, credits can be used to offset to the extent of the group's ICA debit. This is subject to shareholder continuity being maintained. Like standard ICAs, if the balance at 31 March is a debit, the group must make a payment (called further income tax) to clear the account. An imputation penalty tax of 10% of the closing payment is also payable. Both amounts are due by 20 June following the end of the tax year. Normally, an ICA company gets the benefit from the payment of further income tax as an income tax credit. Because the imputation group has no income tax liability an election to transfer the corresponding credit to any or all of the group members to offset their income tax liability is allowed. Attach a letter to the imputation return telling us how you want to action the transfer. Groups' annual imputation returns The group representative will file one IR4J, taking in all the transactions for each member of the group. Members of imputation groups should complete individual ICA returns with their annual IR4 - the individual ICAs will generally record the balance to the date of consolidation. Return due dates Returns for New Zealand and trans-Tasman groups are due under the same filing requirements as they would be if they were not grouped. If the group has all Australian members, the due date is 31 July after the end of the tax year. Limits on income tax refunds Income tax refunds for members of an imputation group may not exceed the available credit in the imputation group ICA. Companies in an imputation group can request a refund only if that refund does not cause the ICA to go into debit. If a company in an imputation group receives a refund without requesting it, the company has the choice of either returning it to us or filing an updated ICA that shows sufficient credit to allow the release of the refund. IMPUTATION 22 Maintaining a resident imputation subgroup ICA As already described, special requirements apply for trans-Tasman imputation groups. When entries arise to the trans-Tasman imputation group's ICA that, had the imputation group not been formed, would have been entered in the ICA of a New Zealand member, these must also be entered into the resident imputation subgroup's ICA. Should a debit balance remain in the resident imputation subgroup's ICA at 31 March, further income tax will be payable. In these cases the nominated company of the trans-Tasman imputation group will file an imputation return and pay the further income tax under their own IRD number. When such further income tax is paid, the payment is credited to the ICAs of both the: • • trans-Tasman imputation group, and • • resident imputation subgroup. Changing imputation groups Notifying changes to a group's members The Imputation group maintenance form - IR475 is available for imputation groups to add or cease members or change nominated companies. Ceasing to be part of a group Companies may either cease to be eligible to be in an imputation group (eg, no longer part of the wholly owned group) or choose to opt out. Members who want to leave an imputation group can elect to do so on an IR475. Generally, a company wishing to leave a group does so either on the date specified on the notice of election to cease, or at the beginning of the tax year when we receive the notice. Where a company ceases to be eligible to be a member, the departure from the imputation group occurs either on the day eligibility ceases if an election is made, or from the beginning of the tax year in which the cessation of eligibility arose. If a New Zealand member leaves an imputation group that is a trans-Tasman imputation group, it will also leave the resident imputation subgroup. Ceasing to be a group Although 2 or more companies are eligible to form an imputation group, the group may continue to exist if it's reduced to 1 member and that member is itself the nominated company. Where an entire imputation group ceases, they should notify us in writing. Use this form to make one or more of the following elections (tick the ones that apply): Election to join an existing imputation group Election to leave an imputation group Change of the nominated company of an imputation group If you need help completing this form, please read the notes on the back page.

A newly incorporated company can join an existing group from the beginning of the income year of incorporation. A newly acquired company can join an existing group from the day it becomes eligible to be a member. All other elections will apply from the beginning of the following income year. Leaving an imputation group Unless otherwise requested, membership will cease from the beginning of the income year in which we are notified. Alternatively, you can request that the company's membership ceases from the beginning of the following income year. Certain events, such as liquidation, will mean membership of the group ceases during the income year rather than at the end of the year. Change in nominated company It is the exiting nominated company's responsibility to advise us if there is to be an alternative nominated company for the imputation group. The change of a nominated company will apply from the date we receive the notice, unless a later date is specified on the notice. www.ird.govt.nz Go to our website for information and to use our services and tools. • Log in or register for myIR to manage your tax and entitlements online. • Demonstrations - learn about our services by watching short videos. • Get it done online - complete forms and returns, make payments, give us feedback. • Work it out - use our calculators, worksheets and tools, for example, to check your tax code, find filing and payment dates, calculate your student loan repayment. • Forms and guides - download our forms and guides.

Cooperative companies can declare dividends in the same way as other companies. In this case the normal imputation rules (explained in Part 1) apply. They can also pass on imputation credits to their shareholders by: • • attaching a credit to a cash distribution, or • • making a notional distribution with a credit attached. However, a cooperative company can make each of the above distributions only once in any income year. Cash distributions treated as dividends If a cooperative company makes a cash distribution, it can elect not to claim the amount of the distribution as a deduction. In these cases the distribution is treated as if it were a dividend. Any election not to deduct the amount of the cash distribution must be in writing and be sent to us on or before the day the distribution is made. Determining the amount distributed The amount of the cash distribution allocated to each shareholder is based on produce transactions. Produce transactions: • • are between a cooperative company and its shareholders • • involve the acceptance or supply of produce that is trading stock, or goods that are trading stock • • are purchases, sales, or other acquisitions, or disposals of the produce or goods between the company and its shareholders, so long as this is a principal activity of the company. Calculating total imputation credits If a cooperative company decides to attach imputation credits to a cash distribution, the total of all imputation credits to be attached is calculated according to the following formula: a× b 1 − b Where: a is the total amount of the cash distribution (excluding any imputation credits) b is the company income tax rate for the income year that covers the most recently ended tax year. Calculating credits to distribute to individuals Once the total imputation credit has been determined, the amount to be allocated to each shareholder is calculated according to the following formula: c ×e d Where: c is the shareholder's share of the cash distribution (excluding the imputation credit) d is the total amount of the cash distribution (excluding any imputation credit) e is the total of all imputation credits attached to the cash distribution. Example Total cash distribution for the year $ 300,000 Shareholder’s share $ 15,000 To t a l imputation credit: a× b = $300,000 × 28 =$116,666 1 − b72 Shareholder’s share of imputation credit: c ×e= $15,000 × $116,666 =$5,833 d$300,000 The shareholder returns dividend income of $20,833 ($15,000 plus $5,833) and claims an imputation credit of $5,833. Imputation credits and notional distributions Cooperative companies may also allocate imputation credits to shareholders by making a notional distribution. If they choose to do so, they must first calculate the amount of the imputation credit to be allocated to each shareholder and then calculate the amount of the notional distribution. Calculating the shareholder's imputation credit The imputation credit is calculated using this formula: a ×c b Where: a is the total amount payable to or by the shareholder for the year for produce transactions b is the total of all amounts payable to or by all shareholders for the year for produce transactions c is the total of all imputation credits attached to the notional distribution. Part 4 - Cooperative companies IMPUTATION 26 Example Piopio Fruit Ltd is a shareholder of a cooperative company. Amount payable to Piopio Fruit Ltd for produce transactions $ 10,000 Total amounts payable to all shareholders for produce transactions $ 140,000 Total imputation credits $ 15,000 Imputation credit allocated to Piopio Fruit Ltd: $ 10,000 ×$15,000=$1,071 $140,000 Calculating the notional distribution The notional distribution is calculated using this formula: a −a b Where: a is the amount of imputation credit allocated to the shareholder b is the company income tax rate for the income year that covers the most recently ended tax year. Example Imputation credit as calculated previously $1,071 2019-20 company income tax rate 28% $1,071 −$1,071=$2,754 0.28 Piopio Fruit Ltd returns dividend income of $3,825 ($2,754 plus $1,071) and claims an imputation credit of $1,071. Other imputation rules for cooperative companies Imputation ratio and benchmark Unlike other companies that make cash or notional distributions, the rules relating to the imputation ratio and benchmark dividend (pages 12 and 13) don't apply to cooperative companies. Imputation credits can be attached to a cash distribution at different rates even if a notional distribution has been made. The cooperative companies' exemption from the imputation ratio and benchmark dividend rules does not apply to dividends paid based on shareholding, ie, the exemption only relates to distributions based on produce transactions. Statutory producer boards Most of the imputation rules apply to statutory producer boards in a similar way to how they apply to cooperative companies. However, there are some differences. For more information about imputation and statutory producer boards, please contact: Team Leader Significant Enterprises, Services Inland Revenue PO Box 39010 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 Phone 0800 443 773 www.ird.govt.nz27 Benefit for New Zealand-resident shareholders The advantage of the imputation system for New Zealand-resident shareholders is that they can benefit from the income tax paid by the company. When a company allocates imputation credits to the dividends it pays to its shareholders, it passes on to them the credit for these tax payments. When New Zealand-resident shareholders file their tax returns, they include in their taxable income both the dividend they received and the amount of the imputation credits. They can then offset the credit amount against their income tax payable. If they receive excess imputation credits, these are not refundable. Instead, they are used as described below. Treatment of excess imputation credits Income yearShareholder typeTr e a t m e n t 2006 and onward Individuals Unincorporated clubs/societies Carry excess forward to reduce any tax liability in the following year. Deemed losses generated before 2006 continue to be carried forward until offset against taxable income. Companies Estates Tr u s t s Māori authorities Incorporated clubs/societies Convert excess to a deemed loss. Converting excess imputation credits into a loss The amount of the deemed loss is calculated using the following formula: a b Where: a is the amount of imputation credits unable to be used in payment of the year's income tax b is either: –the company income tax rate, if the shareholder is a company or if the imputation credits that give rise to the credit of tax are assessable as category A income of the trustee of a group investment fund, or –the extra emolument rate, in any other case. Example The 2018 income tax return of a shareholder who is a company showed the following: Net dividends received $ 16,000 Imputation credits attached $ 6,000 Loss from business income $ 5,000 2018 taxable income $ 17,000 Tax at 28% $ 4,760 Less imputation credits $ 6,000 Excess imputation credits $ 1,240 Because the shareholder is a company taxpayer and the income is for the 2018 year the excess imputation credits are converted to a loss by dividing them by 28%. $1,240 =$4,428 0.28 The $4,428 is carried forward and used to reduce the shareholder's taxable income in the following year. Determining the amount of credit in certain cases Credit distributed to the beneficiary of a trust If a trust receives a dividend that's been distributed as beneficiaries' income, any imputation credits attached to the dividend must be allocated to the beneficiaries according to the following formula: a× b c Where: a is the total of all imputation credits attached to all dividends distributed to the beneficiaries during the year b is the total distribution, including capital or non-taxable distributions, made to a particular beneficiary during the year c is the total distribution, including capital or non-taxable distributions, made to all beneficiaries during the year. Part 5 - Shareholders receiving imputed dividends IMPUTATION 28 Example The Piwakawaka Booklovers Trust receives gross dividend income of $16,000 which includes $4,000 of imputation credits attached. The trust has 3 beneficiaries: Rose, Josie and Harry. The trustee makes distributions to the beneficiaries as follows: Gross dividendCapital incomeTotal income Rose$ 6,400$20,000$26,400 Josie$ 9,600$10,000$19,600 HarryNil$10,000$10,000 Total$16,000$40,000$56,000 The dividend's imputation credits are allocated to the beneficiaries as follows: Rose $4,000× $26,400 =$1,885.71 $56,000 Josie $4,000× $19,600 =$1,400.00 $56,000 There is no calculation here for Harry because he received no dividends. The residual imputation credits of $714.29 ($4,000 − $1,885.71 − $1,400) are lost. Foreign investor tax credit (FITC) received by the beneficiary of a trust When a beneficiary of a trust derives a supplementary dividend (under the FITC rules), the calculation for allocating imputation credits is different, in the following ways: • • Item a - imputation credits - in the preceding calculations includes all supplementary dividends paid to beneficiaries. • • The amount of the imputation credits for a particular beneficiary is reduced by the gross amount of supplementary dividends paid to that beneficiary. There's an explanation of the FITC rules on page 29. Example Using the previous example, the Piwakawaka Booklovers Trust has a supplementary dividend of $100 included in its dividend income. The dividend imputation credits attached are $3,900 (reduced because a supplementary dividend is now paid) plus $100 supplementary dividend = $4,000. The supplementary dividend is distributed to Rose (who is a non-resident). Gross dividendCapital incomeTotal income Rose$ 6,500$20,000$26,500 Josie$ 9,600$10,000$19,600 HarryNil$10,000$10,000 Total$16,100$40,000$56,100 The dividend imputation credits are allocated to the beneficiaries as follows: Rose $4,000× $26,500 =$1,889.48−$100=$1,789.48 $56,100 Josie $4,000× $19,600 =$1,397.50 $56,100 There is no calculation here for Harry because he received no dividends. Partnerships If a partnership derives a dividend with imputation credits attached, the proportion of the credits allocated to each partner is calculated using the following formula: a× b c Where: a is the total of all imputation credits attached to dividends derived by the partners from the partnership b is the income the partner receives from the partnership c is the income of the partnership for the income year. Example Total partnership income for the year is $40,000. This includes dividend income of $10,000 and trading income of $30,000. The dividend has imputation credits attached of $3,000. There are 2 partners: • • Sam receives 50% of the dividend income ($5,000) and 40% of the trading income ($12,000) = $17,000 total. • • Michael receives 50% of the dividend income ($5,000) and 60% of the trading income ($18,000) = $23,000 total. Calculating each partner's share of the imputation credits: Sam $3,000× $17,000 =$1,275 $40,000 Michael $3,000× $23,000 =$1,725 $40,000 www.ird.govt.nz29 Companies Companies, including widely held savings vehicles, are limited in the amount of tax credit they can claim. Allocation ratio The amount of imputation credits that a company is permitted to allocate to shareholders is limited to a specific ratio - Part 2 has more details. Non-resident shareholders Unlike New Zealand-resident shareholders, imputation credits attached to a non-resident's dividend have no effect, because the dividend: • • is not assessable in New Zealand • • is unlikely to be taxable in the non-resident's own country • • cannot be claimed for a tax credit. Where NRWT is deducted from any dividend paid to a non-resident the amount of NRWT deducted will not be reduced by the amount of imputation credits that are attached to the dividend paid to the non-resident shareholder. There's more information about NRWT in our NRWT - payer's guide - IR291. For more information on these changes refer to our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 7, No 11 (March 1996). Foreign investor tax credits (FITC) Special rules apply when a New Zealand-resident company has non-resident shareholders. These include the FITC rules. FITC reduce the maximum rate of tax (company tax and NRWT) paid in New Zealand by certain non-resident shareholders. Note From 1 February 2010, where fully imputed dividends are paid to a non-resident shareholder and that shareholder is a non- portfolio (greater than 10% direct voting interest) shareholder the dividend will be exempt from NRWT and the FITC rules will not apply. Before the FITC rules were introduced, non-resident shareholders were effectively taxed twice on their income from New Zealand companies. The company itself paid income tax and then NRWT was deducted from the net profit distributed as dividends to the non-resident shareholders. The FITC rules let New Zealand-resident companies pay a supplementary dividend to their non-resident shareholders and then claim an FITC credit in New Zealand to make up the supplementary dividend paid. The amount of FITC credit the company can claim is calculated as a portion of the imputation credits attached to dividends paid to non-resident shareholders. The following comparison shows the result of claiming the FITC credit: Without FITCWith FITC New Zealand company's profit before tax $ 100.00$ 100.00 Less income tax at company rate (28%) $28.00$28.00 Company's after-tax profit$72.00$72.00 Add back FITC claimed by company $0.00$12.71 Amount available for non-resident's dividend $72.00$72.00 Share of profits paid to non-resident shareholder $72.00$84.71 Less NRWT deducted @ 15%$10.80$12.71 Net dividend paid to non-resident shareholder $61.20$72.00 For more detailed information on the FITC rules, including calculating supplementary dividends, refer to our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 7, No 11 (March 1996). Special FITC rules There are special imputation rules for FITC. Neither the imputation rules for benchmark dividends nor the anti-credit streaming rules apply to FITC attached to dividends (page 13). Under these special imputation rules, the supplementary dividend is treated as if it were not paid. How the company claims FITC The New Zealand-resident company claims FITC in its IR4 income tax return. FITC is allowed as a deduction against the company's income tax payable for the year in which it paid the dividend. If the company has no tax liability for that year, FITC can be offset against income tax it has paid in any of the previous four income years. If the company is part of a wholly owned group, it can offset the FITC amount against the tax liability of another company in the group for the current or previous four income years. If the company still has leftover FITC after that, it can carry the credits forward to future years, as long as it keeps at least 66% shareholder continuity. When the FITC rules first apply The FITC rules apply to all dividends with NRWT deducted. The FITC rules also apply to companies which pay supplementary dividends to non-resident portfolio shareholders (shareholders who hold less than 10% of a company's shares). Cessation of FITC rules for dividends paid to non- portfolio investors Where fully imputed dividends are paid to non-resident investors with a non-portfolio holding (those holding a 10% or greater voting interest in a company) or they're exempt from tax under a double tax agreement, an FITC credit will no longer be available from 1 April 2010. Transitional rules will apply for a supplementary dividend holding company.

Classified Inland Revenue – Public IR278 | December 2015 This factsheet explains the tax treatment of payments or gifts in the Māori community for the purposes of income tax, GST and employing staff. Organisations can receive many types of income, such as subscriptions, grants, subsidies, donations or koha, fees, raffle money and trading profits from selling assets. Not all income is liable for income tax and not all goods and services attract GST. It's important to know when income tax and GST need to be paid, and when you should deduct PAYE if you employ staff. When is income tax paid? Most organisations are required to file yearly income tax returns unless they've received an income tax exemption. Income tax is normally paid on income received by an organisation for its business activities, eg, rent received, advertising or sponsorship, interest or dividends, and hall or equipment hire. If you give someone goods or provide them with a service instead of using cash for payment, the value of the good or service is liable for income tax. Your organisation may have to pay income tax depending on where the income is from. Fundraising is an example of this. Most fundraising activities are liable for income tax unless they're carried out entirely with your members and no outside persons are involved at any stage. Income tax/GST on koha Koha made voluntarily without the giver receiving a benefit, or material advantage, isn't liable for GST or income tax. This is determined on a case-by-case basis. Koha from a member of a marae isn't liable for GST provided the member doesn't benefit from it. For more on koha go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: koha). When should GST be paid? Any organisation involved in a taxable activity must register for GST if the turnover (including grants and subsidies) is over $60,000 in any 12-month period. Find out more about GST at www.ird.govt.nz/gst or view our factsheet GST - do you need to register? (IR365) and GST guide (IR375) under "Forms and guides". Grants and subsidies A grant or subsidy from government or a public authority is liable for GST. If you're GST registered include this in your GST return. Payments in kind Instead of money, sometimes payment is made by giving goods or providing services. You need to work out the GST on the market value of any goods or services received as payment and include this as an adjustment in your GST return. Example A Te Reo centre charges a fee for children to attend. A parent who can't pay the fee gives the centre fruit instead. GST must be assessed on the market value of the food provided. If the value of the food is more than the amount of the fee payable, the extra would be an unconditional gift with no GST payable. GST is not paid on unconditional gifts If you're a non-profit body or charitable organisation you don't pay GST on unconditional gifts you receive or the sale of these gifts. Money given by the Crown or a government department is not an unconditional gift.

Online tools "Tool for business" is an interactive tool that explains what you need to know about business tax. Go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: tfb). Do you have paid workers? If you do then you may be an employer. Employers deduct PAYE from their employees' wages and pay this to us. Our First-time employer's guide (IR333) will help you decide whether you should register as an employer. You may also find our pamphlet Self-employed or an employee? (IR336) helpful. Payments in kind instead of wages Payments for goods or services aren't always made with money. Some people are happy to accept labour, other goods, or other forms of payment in return for the amount owing. If someone is working for you to pay off a debt, you're that person's employer. Although the employee isn't receiving wages, you'll still have to pay us PAYE on this person's behalf. PAYE must be calculated on the market value of the services being provided. Example An early childhood centre charges a fee for children to attend. If the fee isn't paid, the child wouldn't be able to attend. A parent doesn't have the money to pay, so the centre lets the parent work for them instead. This means the centre becomes the parent's employer and must pay PAYE to us. The value of the fee is recorded in the wage records as net earnings. If the centre allows the children to attend even if the fee isn't paid, the parent working at the centre is providing voluntary labour and no PAYE is payable. Repaying worker's expenses Generally, when a payment is given to repay a person for actual expenses incurred on behalf of the business, this isn't taxable and PAYE (or tax) doesn't have to be deducted. However, if the repayment is more than the actual cost, the excess is taxable. Example 1 An employee travels to attend a hui and you pay for their actual petrol. This is a repayment and doesn't need PAYE deducted. Example 2 A kaumātua, a retired fisherman, gives a talk to children at a kura about traditional Māori fishing customs and methods. The kura makes a payment to the kaumātua to cover actual travel costs. As the payment is a repayment of actual travel expenses, tax doesn't need to be deducted. The kura and kaumātua should both keep proof of the costs and payment. Example 3 A kuia on NZ Super helps at a community centre for two days a week. She doesn't want to receive any payment as it might affect her tax. The community centre wants to give her something for helping so they give her grocery vouchers instead. The community centre must pay PAYE to us. The value of the vouchers must be recorded in the wage records as net earnings. Casual or one-off payments to people When someone does a particular job for you and there's no employer/employee relationship, you don't have to deduct PAYE from the payment. However, you may still need to deduct tax at a percentage rate set by legislation. If you're making these kinds of payments, see our Employer's guide (IR335) or the back of the Tax code declaration (IR330), which will show you if you need to deduct tax and the rate to use. Earnings after tax For payments made "in kind", the goods or services given are considered a net payment to the person (ie, any tax has already been deducted). However, for normal salary or wages, PAYE is worked out on the gross pay. What the person gets in their hand is their net pay. So to deduct PAYE from the value of vouchers and the like, you need to work out the equivalent gross pay. If you'd like more information or help with the calculation, go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: paye calculator) or see our Employer's guide (IR335).
IR280 February 2017 Putting your tax returns right How to tell Inland Revenue what's wrong with your tax returns The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing PUTTING YOUR TAX RETURNS RIGHT 2 Introduction If you make a mistake or file an incorrect tax return, tell us about it before we find out in some other way. This guide will help you put your tax returns right whether you've made a minor mistake or a more complex one. Telling us straightaway will mean any penalties will be much lighter. Getting your returns right doesn't have to be stressful and in some cases you may even be able to correct it yourself in a later return. In this guide Part 1 - Outlines your obligations as a taxpayer under the tax laws. Part 2 - What to do if you've made a minor or genuine error. Part 3 - Explains what a voluntary disclosure is, and the benefits to you of making one.

They include artificiality, contrivance, circularity of funding, concealment of information and unreliable interpretations of the law. Adjustments - Where some of the business costs are paid personally or some personal costs are paid by the business and a calculation has to be made to work out how much GST can be claimed by the business. Audit and investigation - A process where Inland Revenue checks the validity and accuracy of information a tax payer sends to them. Due date - The last date you can file a return or make a payment on before penalties are added. Input tax - When a registered person buys goods or services to use in a taxable activity, the GST portion of the price is called input tax. This is a legal term - we usually call it a GST credit. Instalment arrangement - An agreement between you and us to pay your outstanding taxes at a set sum and frequency to clear the amount owed, over a set term. NOPA (notice of proposed adjustment) - A notice telling you that we intend to change a tax assessment or impose shortfall penalties. It sets out the changes we intend to make, the facts and the law supporting our decision. Output tax - The legal term for GST charged by a registered person on goods and services supplied in a taxable activity. We usually call it GST payable or GST collected. Overstatement of input tax - Claimed more GST than you were allowed to. Personal tax summary - A notice which shows your income and tax deduction details for the year based on the employment, pension or benefit information provided to us each month by your employer or payer. Unacceptable tax position - A position you take in working out your tax that when looked at in detail by Inland Revenue is likely to be found incorrect. www.ird.govt.nz 5 Part 1 - Your tax obligations Before we explain how to correct your tax returns, here is a quick reminder of your tax obligations. Its up to you to work out your taxes and pay them as the law requires. So you need to know your basic tax obligations. You must: • work out the correct amount of tax you have to pay (unless you don't have to file a return) • deduct or withhold the correct amount of tax from payments or receipts, when required • pay your tax on time • keep all tax related information (including books and records) and maintain all necessary accounts or balances • disclose all information needed by us in a timely and useful way • cooperate with us as required by the Acts we administer • correctly respond to a personal tax summary, if you receive one • tell us if you didn't receive a personal tax summary and should have • comply with any other specific tax obligations. Some examples of not meeting your obligations are: • putting false information in a tax return or knowingly leaving income out of it • not deducting PAYE or not paying it to us. We routinely audit and investigate the tax affairs of people and businesses. Our guide Inland Revenue audits (IR297) has more information about audits and how they work. If you don't meet your tax obligations, you can be charged penalties. See Part 4 for more information about these. PUTTING YOUR TAX RETURNS RIGHT 6 Part 2 - Correcting errors Late claim of GST input tax If you didn't claim a GST input tax in a past return but should have, you may claim it in the current or future return. You can only make a late claim for GST on expenditure incurred in the previous two years. Exceptions to this two-year rule include: • not being able to get a tax invoice • payments for expenditure are under dispute • mistakenly treating a supply as non-taxable • clear mistakes or simple oversights you have made. Alternatively, you may follow the same process that applies to adjustments to output tax or overstated input tax - see below. Adjustments to GST output tax or overstated input tax For errors that involve an adjustment to output tax or an overstatement of input tax, you may use the "make an amendment" option in myIR, or send a Notice of proposed adjustment (IR770) (NOPA) to Inland Revenue within the response period the GST return period relates to. If you cannot issue a NOPA within this timeframe, you may request an amended GST assessment. When making an adjustment you must keep the following details as part of your records: • return period the error occurred • GST amount involved • nature of the error • return period when the correction was made. www.ird.govt.nz 7 Correcting genuine errors for any type of return Made a mistake in a return? You can ask us to correct it either by phone, post, secure mail or requesting an amendment online. Clear and genuine errors like arithmetic or transposition errors can be corrected in this way. You need to tell us: • the tax type and period containing the error, eg, Income tax, 31 March 2015 • the amount of tax in error • the nature of the error, eg, added your gross income from your two jobs up incorrectly • how the error occurred, eg, human error • how and why the error was identified • what the amended figures in the return should be so a correct assessment is made. You'll still have to pay any tax owing because of the mistake, but if you pay it by the due date we set, you won't be charged a late payment penalty (or non-payment penalty, in the case of an Employer monthly schedule). We'll send you an amended assessment so you know how much you have to pay and when to pay it. If it's more than $100, interest will be charged from the day after the original due date for paying the tax, up until the day the tax is paid in full. For more help For more information about correcting genuine errors, please read our Standard Practice Statement 07/03 Requests to amend assessments www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: SPS 07/03). PUTTING YOUR TAX RETURNS RIGHT 8 Part 3 - Voluntary disclosures A voluntary disclosure is when you tell us what's wrong with your tax returns before we find out in some other way. This could be, for example, that you forgot some of your income or incorrectly claimed expenses. Anyone can make a voluntary disclosure. This includes salary or wage earners, individuals, businesses, trusts and employers. You can make a voluntary disclosure for any of the following: • approved issuer levy (AIL) • child support payments • totalisator, lottery, casino and gaming machine duties • GST (goods and services tax) • fringe benefit tax (FBT) • Working for Families Tax Credits • income tax • student loan repayments • tax deductions for: –tax on employees' earnings –withholding tax on schedular payments –RWT (resident withholding tax) on interest or dividends –NRWT (non-resident withholding tax) on income paid to a non-resident –tax on superannuation contributions –foreign dividend withholding payments. www.ird.govt.nz 9 When to make a voluntary disclosure You can make a voluntary disclosure: • any time before we tell you we'll be doing a tax audit or investigation (pre-notification disclosure), or • after we tell you we're doing a tax audit or investigation but before it begins (post-notification disclosure). Advantages of voluntary disclosures Making a voluntary disclosure has several advantages compared to waiting for us to find out ourselves. The advantages are: • you won't be prosecuted in court (if you make a pre-notification disclosure) • any shortfall penalty will be reduced - see page 15. If you make a voluntary disclosure before we tell you about a pending tax audit or investigation you'll get a bigger reduction in shortfall penalty charges. If you make a post-notification disclosure, prosecution may only be considered in cases of evasion or fraud. Compare these advantages with the penalties listed in Part 4. How to make a voluntary disclosure You can make a voluntary disclosure in any one of the following ways: • complete and send us a Voluntary disclosure (IR281) form • call us • send us a letter, fax or email • visit one of our offices • during an interview • for a GST return, using the "make an amendment" option in myIR. You can get a Voluntary disclosure (IR281) form from www.ird.govt.nz "Forms and guides" or by calling us - see page 18. PUTTING YOUR TAX RETURNS RIGHT 10 You need to tell us what is wrong with your tax returns and why. Give as much information as you can including: • your details, or the details of the estate, trust, partnership or company including: -name -trade name -IRD number -address -date of birth or start date -contact details) • why you're making a voluntary disclosure (the nature of the mistakes or omissions) • the year(s) or period(s) concerned • an explanation of why the mistakes or omissions occurred • enough information for us to work out how much tax you owe. If you use the Voluntary disclosure (IR281) form, sign the declaration and send the completed form to us - see page 20 for address details. If you don't have all the information we need to work out your taxes, you can still make a voluntary disclosure. Tell us as much as you can and state that there is more information to come. We'll contact you to arrange a date you must give us the rest of the information by. We'll take into account your circumstances and the type of information you still have to collect. You can also get help with your voluntary disclosure from a tax agent, accountant, solicitor, friend, whanau support or one of our community compliance officers. If you have a tax agent, they can discuss your case with us, but you will still have to sign the voluntary disclosure form when it's completed. www.ird.govt.nz 11 What to pay If you make a voluntary disclosure, you have to pay any tax outstanding. You may also have to pay: • interest on unpaid tax • a shortfall penalty - see Part 4 for further information. We'll send you a new calculation to tell you how much you have to pay and when to pay it. If you have more than $100 tax to pay, interest is added from the day after the original date the tax was due, to the day the tax is paid in full. If you pay by the new due date we set, we won't charge late payment penalties (or non-payment penalties, in the case of an Employer monthly schedule). Repayment options If you can't pay your tax by the due date, please contact us to talk about the options available to you. In some situations, we might agree to payment in instalments (instalment arrangement). Instalment arrangements can be agreed to before or after the due date. However, there are greater reductions in the late payment penalties charged if the arrangement is made before the due date. For more help Like to know more about our repayment options? Read our Debt options (IR582) guide. You can get a copy from www.ird.govt.nz or order one by calling us - see page 18. For more on making a voluntary disclosure, read our Standard Practice Statement INV-251 Voluntary Disclosures in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 4 (April 2002). You can read this at www.ird.govt.nz PUTTING YOUR TAX RETURNS RIGHT 12 Disclosure at time of filing There are penalties for taking an "unacceptable tax position" or what is described as an "abusive tax position" - see pages 15 and 16. The penalty can be reduced if you give us details of the tax position you've taken at the time you filed the return - see page 16. To do this, complete a Statement in support of a tax position (IR282) form - the middle of this guide. You can get more copies from www.ird.govt.nz or by calling us - see page 18. Give as much information as you can, including: • your details, or the details of the estate, trust, partnership or company (including name, trade name, IRD number, address, date of birth or start date and contact details) • an overview of the tax position taken • the basis on which your tax position is taken (such as case law on the subject, contents of any legal opinions, legal articles and related material) • the tax type(s) and year(s) or period(s) the tax position relates to • reference to any Inland Revenue public or binding rulings, and • a calculation, if necessary, to show the position and how it was reached. Sign the declaration and send the completed form with the relevant return to us - see page 20 for address details. If the return is being E-Filed by a tax agent, the disclosure form needs to be sent separately. Note www.ird.govt.nz 13 Part 4 - If you choose not to tell us If you don't meet the obligations set out on page 5 and don't make a voluntary disclosure, you may face a number of penalties. These are: • late payment penalties • non-payment penalties for not paying Employer monthly schedule (IR348) amount • shortfall penalties • prosecution. We could also charge interest on any unpaid tax from the original date the tax was payable. Prosecution We may prosecute you for not meeting your tax obligations. The maximum penalties for different offences are: Absolute liability offences These include: • not filing a return on time • not supplying information that we need • not applying for GST registration when you must • not providing a tax invoice for GST purposes when you must • not keeping required books and documents. The maximum fine is $4,000 for the first offence, $8,000 for the second offence and $12,000 for any subsequent offences. PUTTING YOUR TAX RETURNS RIGHT 14 Knowledge offences These include knowingly: • not keeping required books and documents • not providing information, including tax returns and forms, when required to do so • providing altered, false, incomplete or misleading information, including on tax returns and forms • using the tax you've deducted or withheld for other purposes instead of paying it to us • not deducting or withholding tax when required to do so • issuing two GST tax invoices for the same taxable supply. If you don't have the information we ask for, or don't make or account for withholding payments for reasons beyond your control, you won't be prosecuted. The maximum fine for the first offence is $25,000 and $50,000 for any subsequent offences. However, the penalty for knowingly using tax deductions for any purpose other than payment to Inland Revenue is imprisonment for up to five years and/or a fine of up to $50,000 for each conviction. Evasion or similar offences You can also be imprisoned for up to five years and/or fined up to $50,000 if you intentionally evade the assessment or the payment of tax, or unlawfully try to get a refund for yourself or someone else by: • knowingly not making a deduction or a withholding of tax • knowingly not keeping books and documents that must be kept • knowingly not providing information, including tax returns and forms, when required to do so • knowingly providing altered, false, incomplete or misleading information • pretending to be another person for any purpose or reason • knowingly filing false returns. You may also be prosecuted for certain offences under the Crimes Act 1961. www.ird.govt.nz 15 Shortfall penalties A shortfall penalty is calculated as a percentage of a tax shortfall, or deficit or understatement of tax as a result of certain actions on the part of a taxpayer. There are five categories of fault. Reasonable care The law requires you take reasonable care in meeting your tax obligations. This means that you must take the same care that a reasonable person in the same circumstances would take. The standard does not require perfection on your part. If you don't take reasonable care a 20% penalty will be added to the resulting tax shortfall. Unacceptable tax position The legal definition of an unacceptable tax position is one that "fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct". This means that your tax position must be one a court would give serious consideration to, but not necessarily agree with. Your argument must be sufficient to have a reasonable chance of succeeding in court. The penalty for an unacceptable tax position is 20% of the resulting tax shortfall. This penalty is only applied to income tax shortfalls and only if the tax shortfall is both more than $50,000 and 1% of the total tax figure. Gross carelessness You can be penalised for gross carelessness if we consider your behaviour towards your tax affairs displays a high degree of carelessness or disregard for the consequences. The penalty for gross carelessness is 40% of the resulting tax shortfall. PUTTING YOUR TAX RETURNS RIGHT 16 Abusive tax position This penalty is to deter people entering into arrangements with the dominant purpose of avoiding tax. The penalty for taking an abusive tax position is 100% of the resulting tax shortfall. Evasion Tax evasion involves a deliberate attempt to pay less tax that the law requires. This includes obtaining refunds knowing that you are not lawfully entitled to them. The penalty for evasion is 150% of the resulting tax shortfall. Reduction for voluntary disclosures If you make a full and complete voluntary disclosure before we tell you you're going to be audited or investigated, any shortfall penalty will be reduced by 75% or 100% if the tax shortfall was due to not taking reasonable care, taking an unacceptable tax position or an unacceptable interpretation. If we've already notified you of a tax audit or investigation but you make a disclosure before it actually begins, any shortfall penalty will be reduced by 40%. If you make a disclosure at the time you file your return, any shortfall penalty will be reduced by 75%. Employer monthly schedule non-payment penalty If the amount owing from an Employer monthly schedule (IR348) isn't paid by the due date we'll send you a reminder letter. If the overdue amount isn't paid or an instalment arrangement agreed to, you'll be charged a 10% non- payment penalty (NPP). Every month an amount remains unpaid a further 10% NPP will be charged. If you pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement, after we've added a penalty the last NPP is reduced to 5%. www.ird.govt.nz 17 Late payment We may charge you a late payment penalty if you miss a payment or it's late. We'll also charge you interest if you don't make your tax payment by the due date. If you can't pay your tax by the due date, please call us. We'll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement, depending on your circumstances. Go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: managing penalties) for more information. Interest Interest on unpaid tax applies for all periods. Interest on underpayments of tax starts on the day after the original due date for paying the tax, and ends on the day the tax is paid in full. For example, if a reassessment increases your tax liability of three years ago, three years' interest is charged. Interest is charged on the difference between the original amount of tax paid and the new amount assessed, even if time is allowed for payment before a late payment penalty is imposed. Amounts of $100 or less There is no interest or late payment penalties added to overdue tax of $100.00 or less. For more information If you would like more information about penalties and interest, read our Penalties and interest (IR240) guide. You can get a copy from www.ird.govt.nz or order one by calling us - see page 18. The benefits of making a voluntary disclosure far outweigh waiting for us to find out what may be wrong with your tax returns.

Details about investment income will need to be provided more often and electronically, including any joint account holder information. 2. You need to report only for the months in which you make a payment and withhold tax. 3. The existing non-declaration rate for not providing an IRD number of 33% increases to 45% for RWT on interest. 4. Some administrative changes have also been made:  removing the requirement to provide some end of year withholding tax certificates  introducing an RWT exemption register  improved error correction processes. Find out more at ird.govt.nz/investment-income-reporting RWT - what it is RWT is a tax deducted from some kinds of investment income before the investor receives it. Why we have it Deducting RWT means that people who receive investment income do not have to pay all the tax in a lump sum at the end of the year. Also, people who do not declare their investment income still have tax deducted from it. 5 Income that must have RWT deducted Any income that fits the definition of resident passive income must have RWT deducted from it. Resident passive income is defined as an amount paid to a resident of New Zealand that consists of: interest, dividends a taxable Māori authority distribution that is not a retirement scheme contribution a replacement payment paid to a person under a share-lending arrangement. This guide does not cover RWT on dividends. Read our guide Resident withholding tax (RWT) on dividends - IR284 for information on this. Resident passive income includes all types of interest except interest that is: paid on a debt for goods or services purchased, such as trade credit on hire purchases paid to a transitional resident paid to a tax pooling intermediary under a specified lease or finance lease paid on Bonus Bonds interest or a redemption payment on money lent by a non-resident to the New Zealand Government or a New Zealand public authority interest that is exempt from income tax under any Act other than the Income Tax Act 2007. any amount expressly exempted from income tax by any other Act, to the extent of the exemption so provided paid on an overpaid levy under section 173 of the Accident Compensation Act 2001 paid to someone who has been granted exemption from RWT paid between two companies within the same group of companies paid to a non-resident (anyone who has been out of New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period and has had no enduring relationship with New Zealand in that time) derived from outside New Zealand by a non-resident payable by a taxpayer on any unpaid tax payable by us under section 84 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 6 Registering as an RWT payer You must register with us as an RWT payer if you pay out more than $5,000 a year in interest, and: you pay the interest as part of a taxable activity (such as a trade, profession or business, or an activity carried out by a not-for-profit body or local authority), or we’ve granted you RWT exempt status, or you’re a non-resident but are carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand through a fixed establishment. If you’re not already registered as an RWT payer, you must contact us and register as soon as your interest paid out for the year exceeds $5,000. You will not have to account for RWT on the interest you paid out before you reached the $5,000 threshold. Banks, building societies and trustee companies that have been granted RWT exempt status must register as RWT payers, regardless of how much resident passive income they pay in a year. Also, any taxpayer who has been granted RWT exempt status and whose income is, or estimated to be, more than $2 million for any year must register as a payer if they pay out any resident passive income. Note If you’re not required to register and you pay interest, you may still have disclosure obligations in your income tax return. Register as an RWT payer online through myIR or, fill in a Resident withholding tax - interest payer registration - IR450 form and send it to us. Record keeping With any RWT deductions you make, you must keep records for the: total interest you pay total amount of RWT and date it was deducted full name and last known address of the recipient recipient’s IRD number. 7 If you pay interest to someone who has been granted RWT exempt status and their IRD number is listed on the RWT exemption register you must also record: the full name and address of the person or organisation you pay interest to the total interest you pay the date RWT would have been deducted their IRD number. You must also keep details of all other financial arrangements that you’ve paid interest on at any time during the year. You must keep your records for seven years and they must be in English or Māori unless you get approval from us to use another language. We may ask you to keep your records for an additional three years if auditing or investigating you. Failure to keep adequate records is a very serious matter and can result in a fine. If you want to know more about audit procedures, read our guide Inland Revenue audits - IR297. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 8 Part 2 – Filing and payments Note Investment income information must be provided to us electronically. Deducting RWT One of the first things you need to do once you’ve registered as an RWT payer, is to ask all the people you pay interest to for their IRD numbers and contact details. You must deduct RWT from all the interest you pay that is not exempt. Taxpayers who earn interest can elect their own RWT rate by completing a Choose your RWT deduction rate - IR456 form. Individuals Individuals can choose a rate of 10.5%, 17.5%, 30% or 33%. Electing the correct rate for the total income earned for the tax year ensures that the correct amount of tax is deducted from the interest. If the rate selected is too low, the individual may have a tax bill to pay at the end of the income year. If an individual does not elect an RWT rate, but they’ve given you a valid IRD number, deduct RWT at 17.5% for existing accounts, or 33% for new accounts. If an individual has not provided you with their IRD number, RWT must be deducted at the non-declaration rate of 45%. Companies Companies must notify their interest payers that they are a company. A company can elect either the 28% or 33% RWT rate. If a company does not choose an RWT rate, but they have notified you that they’re a company and given you a valid IRD number, deduct RWT at 28%. If a company has not supplied their IRD number, deduct RWT at the non-declaration rate of 45%. Note Companies that are trustees are not required to notify the interest payer of their company status and may use the 17.5%, 30% or 33% rate. If the trust is a testamentary trust, it may also elect the 10.5% rate if appropriate. Companies that are Māori authorities are not required to notify their company status and may choose 17.5%, 30% or 33%. This reflects the obligation on trustees to act according to the tax position of the trust’s beneficiaries. 9 All others All other taxpayers can elect a rate of 17.5%, 30% or 33%. If they do not make a choice, but they have given you a valid IRD number, deduct RWT at 17.5% for existing accounts, or 33% for new accounts. From 1 April 2020 the non-declaration rate increases to 45%. Non-declaration rate You must deduct RWT at the non-declaration rate of 45% for anyone who has not given you a valid IRD number. If you deduct RWT at the non-declaration rate because a recipient has not given you an IRD number, but they do later, you cannot refund the extra RWT deducted. This is because at the time you made the deduction, the non-declaration rate was correct. The recipient can only recover the extra tax deducted at the end of the year in their income tax assessment. Interest recipients electing inconsistent RWT rates It’s important that individuals and organisations you pay interest to, elect an RWT rate that is consistent with their taxable income. Using the correct RWT rate can help them avoid a tax bill at the end of the year. We regularly check RWT rates against the income details we hold to make sure a consistent RWT rate is being used. If someone is using an inconsistent RWT rate, we’ll advise you to change it and let you know which rate they should be on. You’ll need to change their RWT rate to the new rate as soon as possible. We’ll also let them know that the rate they elected is inconsistent with their estimated income and that we’ve asked you, as their interest payer, to change it. We’ll also ask them to check their RWT rate on our website. If they disagree with the RWT rate we’ve chosen, they can request that their interest payer change it. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 10 RWT rates Rate for deducting RWT Who should use this rate 10.5% Individuals who have a reasonable expectation of their annual income being $14,000 or less\* if they’ve provided their IRD number.  Testamentary trusts may elect this rate if they provide their IRD number. 17.5% Individuals whose annual income is from $14,001 to $48,000\* if they’ve provided their IRD number.  Individuals, Māori authorities and trusts who have not elected a rate but have provided their IRD number (if they have not opened a new account since 31 March 2010).  Trusts and testamentary trusts may elect this rate if they’ve provided their IRD number. 28% Companies may elect this rate if they’ve provided their IRD number. 30% Individuals whose annual income is from $48,001 to $70,000\* if they’ve provided their IRD number.  Trusts and Māori authorities can elect this rate if they’ve provided their IRD number. 33% All interest recipients can elect this rate. They must provide their IRD number to choose this rate.  Individuals whose annual income is $70,001 or over\*.  Use this rate for all interest recipients who open a new account after 31 March 2010 who do not elect a rate. 45% For all interest recipients who have not provided their IRD number. \* You’re not required to confirm an individual’s income level; you can accept the rate they provide. If you’re a Māori authority, you can use an RWT rate of 17.5% to deduct RWT from distributions of $200 or less. You can also use this rate for distributions of over $200 where the member has provided their IRD number, otherwise use 33%. When to deduct RWT You must deduct RWT at the time you pay resident passive income to the recipient. For this purpose, “pay” means to: distribute to credit to an account deal with in a person’s interest or on their behalf. If you make automatic interest payments, you must deduct RWT and credit only the net amount to the recipient’s account. 11 Monthly information From 1 April 2020 you must provide us with your investment income interest payment information electronically by the 20th of the following month the interest was paid. You will need to provide: your name, IRD number and contact address the total amount of interest paid and tax withheld for the period. This is not a cumulative total. For each person or entity you paid interest to: their name and contact details, such as email, street address and mobile phone number the amount and type of income paid to them the tax withheld from it the date the tax was withheld their IRD number their date of birth if you have it the tax rate used the name, IRD number, date of birth and contact details of any joint owners if you have them. To allow for transition into the new requirements, the tax years ending 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2020, now have a due date for the IR15S and the IR15 of 15 May. From 1 April 2020: the information will need to be provided to us electronically (unless we exempt you from electronic filing) you’ll need to withhold tax at 45% for those who have not provided their IRD number you will no longer be required to file a nil return. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 12 RWT exempt status Do not deduct RWT from any interest you pay to taxpayers who have been granted RWT exempt status. This means they are exempt from having RWT deducted from their interest and dividend income. The following taxpayers can get an exemption by completing an Application for exemption from resident withholding tax (RWT) on interest and dividends - IR451: amateur sports promoters Board of Trustees charitable estates community housing providers registered with the Community Housing Regulatory Authority community trusts companies that are a member of the Public Trust group, the Public Trustee or the Maori Tr u s t e e finance houses or brokers friendly societies or credit unions funeral trusts gaming machine operators horse or greyhound racing clubs improvement or research promoters local or public authorities local or regional promotion bodies not-for-profit organisations portfolio investment entities (PIE) public purpose Crown-controlled companies registered banks or building societies statutory trustee companies tertiary education institutions. Taxpayers can also apply if they: have earned or think they’ll earn more than $2 million a year have losses, or a RWT refund, of $500 or more are exempt from paying tax under an Act other than the Tax Acts. Charitable organisations on the Charities Services register do not need to apply. They are given RWT exempt status and added automatically to the RWT exemption register. 13 Unincorporated bodies If an unincorporated body of persons, such as a partnership or a joint venture, has RWT exempt status, the exemption is granted in the name of the body and not in the name of the individual members. If the body is a trustee, the exemption is granted in the name of the trust. Checking the RWT exemption register The IRD number of everyone with RWT exempt status is listed on the RWT exemption register on our website at ird.govt.nz/rwt-exemption Use this register to confirm who has an active RWT exempt status and to identify people and organisations who no longer have an exemption. Most exemptions from RWT are issued for an unlimited period and remain active on the register unless they’re cancelled. These active exemptions don’t show an end date. If the exemption is granted for a limited period, an end date (or expiry date) will also be shown. The register is updated overnight every business day (Monday to Friday) providing you with near real-time information. Make sure that the person you’re paying the resident passive income to is the person listed on the register. Note From 1 April 2020 the online RWT exemption register replaced physical certificates of exemption for RWT. We no longer issue certificates of exemption or publish a list of cancelled certificates in the New Zealand Gazette. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 14 Cancelling RWT exempt status If we cancel an exemption, you must deduct RWT from any further interest you pay to that person or organisation. We may cancel an exemption if the person or organisation: no longer meets the conditions for which it was issued has provided misleading information in the application for exemption doesn’t meet the $2 million target (where the exemption was granted on the basis of estimated income of more than $2 million) or fails to supply satisfactory evidence of annual income fails to pay any income tax payable by the due date. When we cancel a person’s or organisation’s RWT exempt status, we also update their status on the RWT exemption register. Once this cancellation appears on the register, you have five working days to amend your records and start deducting RWT where appropriate. Due dates for payment All withheld tax must be paid by the 20th of the month following the month in which the interest income was paid to the investor. However, if the amount of resident withholding tax is under $500 a month, you can pay RWT in 2 six-monthly instalments. Note If the due date falls on a weekend, or statutory or public holiday, the due date is the next working day. RWT of $500 or more per month If you deduct RWT of $500 or more each month, you must pay the deductions made in each month by the 20th of the following month. 15 Example – monthly payer Each month, the ABC Building Society deducts RWT of more than $500 when it credits interest to its customers’ accounts. It must pay the RWT deductions to us as follows: Month RWT deductedTotal RWT deductedTotal paid to usDue date for payment June 2019$2,500$2,50020 July 2019 July 2019$2,500$2,50020 August 2019 RWT of less than $500 per month If you deduct RWT of less than $500 each month, you may pay on a six-monthly basis. 1 April to 30 September - due for payment on 20 October 1 October to 31 March - due for payment on 20 April. However, if the RWT deductions you’ve made accumulate to $500 during a six-month period, you must send them in by the 20th of the month after the month they reach $500. Note Once you’ve paid the RWT deductions to us, the $500 accumulation threshold recommences. Example – six-monthly payer Matt Weaver’s Carpet Company deducts less than $500 each month, so they must pay the deductions to us by the two regular six-monthly payment dates. Month RWT deducted Total RWT deductedTotal paid to usDue date for payment December 2019$200Nil– January 2020NilNil– February 2020$200Nil– March 2020Nil$400 20 April 2020 (regular six-monthly payment date) RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 16 Example – deductions over $500 accumulated Collcar Investments Ltd deducts RWT of varying amounts. Some months the RWT deducted is more than $500, other months it is less. They must pay the RWT to us on the 20th of the month that follows the month when their accumulated deductions exceed $500, and on the regular six-monthly payment dates. Month RWT deducted Total RWT deductedTotal paid to usDue date for payment January 2020$300Nil– February 2020$300$600 20 March 2020 (more than $500 accumulated) March 2020$200$200 20 April 2020 (regular six-monthly payment date) April 2020$200Nil– May 2020$550$750 20 June 2020 (more than $500 accumulated) No RWT to pay If you have no RWT to pay for the month, you do not need to file any income information. How to make payments Go to ird.govt.nz/pay to find out about paying by: internet banking credit or debit card direct debit You can also call 0800 257 777 to pay by credit/debit card over the phone. When making a payment, include: your IRD number the account type you are paying the period the payment relates to. 17 If you make a mistake when deducting RWT From 1 April 2020 you can correct errors occurring within a tax year, regardless of their size. There is no need to let us know about these errors. Correcting errors from earlier years Errors relating to earlier years can be corrected if the total value of the adjustment does not exceed the larger of: $2,000, or 5% of the payer’s withholding liability for the tax type that the error relates to (for example RWT or NRWT) for the year in which the first payment is made. How they are corrected depends on whether they result in too much or too little tax being deducted, and the type of income. These processes only apply to errors made by payers of investment income. If you discover you have not deducted enough RWT, you can: 1. Deduct it from later payments made to the person 2. Ask the person to pay the amount that was not deducted 3. Adjust the amount of taxable income (only for non-cash dividends). Whichever option is chosen, the correction must be made before the next due date for reporting investment income to us (provided it’s reasonably practicable to do so). You’ll need to let us know: your name, IRD number and contact address the name and contact address (email, street address or mobile phone number) of the person who received the income the IRD number and date of birth of the person who received the income (if you have it) the adjustments made to the investment income information originally provided. Example - option 1 - too little tax being deducted and recovered from future payments Shane makes monthly interest payments to Sarah of $100. Sarah has an RWT rate of 33%. Shane mistakenly pays $89.50 to Sarah, having only deducted 10.5%. The amount of the under-deduction is $22.50 (i.e. $33 − $10.50). Realising his mistake, he corrects it by withholding an additional amount from the next payment made to Sarah. Shane withholds $55.50 from the next interest payment to Sarah, being $33 + $22.50. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 18 Example – option 2 - too little tax being deducted and recovered from investor Company A Ltd pays a dividend of $1,000 to Kelvin in June 2020. The dividend includes $280 of imputation credits attached and needs to have RWT deducted of $50. The company’s accountant accidently deducts RWT of only $5 and pays Kelvin a net amount of $715 - $45 more than he should have received. The company’s accountant contacts Kelvin in July 2020 to inform him of the error. Company A Ltd then pays the extra $45 to Inland Revenue and must recover the additional amount from Kelvin before March 2021. Example – option 3 - too little tax being deducted and taxable non-cash dividend adjusted Company B Ltd provides $100 worth of shares in another company (Company C Ltd) to one of its resident shareholders. It does not realise that the amount provided is a non-cash dividend until the company’s accountant informs them at the end of the tax year when they’re preparing the company’s accounts. Company B Ltd can submit investment income information on the non-cash dividend by the 20th of April following the end of the tax year. The company will show the amount of the non-cash dividend being $149.50, with RWT of $49.50 payable to Inland Revenue. Because this adjustment occurs outside the tax year that the non-cash dividend relates to, Company B Ltd will also have to provide Inland Revenue with information so it can allocate the non-cash dividend and tax credits to the correct tax year for the company’s shareholder. Deducting too much tax If you discover you have withheld too much RWT, you can refund it any time before the 20th of April following the end of the tax year in which the error occurred, provided you have not provided the person who received the income with: an end-of-year withholding tax certificate for RWT, or a shareholder dividend statement, or a statement to a member who received a taxable Māori authority distribution. You must let us know the amount of the refund at the time you pay it so that we don’t also provide a refund. If you do not refund the amount by the 20th of April following the end of the tax year in which the error occurred, you must tell us and the recipient how much needs to be refunded. If the over-deduction has already been paid to us, we will: pay the refund to the payer if future payments to the person have been adjusted pay the refund to the person who received the income if future payments haven’t been adjusted. 19 Penalties and interest Late payment If you do not pay a bill on time, you may have to pay penalties and interest. Contact us if you are not able to pay on time. We’ll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement. Find out more at ird.govt.nz/penalties Amounts of $100 or less Interest and late payment penalties are not charged on outstanding amounts of $100 or less. Penalty for not filing electronically There is a penalty of $250 for each time investment income information is not supplied to us electronically and you do not have an exemption. If you are unable to supply your investment income information electronically, you can apply for an exemption. In considering your request we will assess: your capabilities the digital services available to you the compliance costs to you. Relief from late payment If late payment of RWT is due to circumstances beyond your control, we have the discretion to remit late payment penalties. To have your case considered, write to us explaining the reasons for the late payment. Remission or cancellation of use of money interest Interest will be remitted, or legally forgiven, only in exceptional circumstances and at our discretion. Remission occurs when interest is correctly imposed but a decision is made to relieve you of the liability to pay. For example, if we have given you incorrect advice, causing a return or payment to be late. You must be able to provide evidence to support the fact that incorrect advice was given. Failing to account for RWT deductions RWT that you have deducted is money held in trust for the Crown and there are penalties if you use it for any purpose other than payment to Inland Revenue. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 20 Failing to deduct RWT If the RWT rules require a deduction to be made, the payer and recipient cannot arrange between themselves not to deduct RWT. In addition, fines and penalties may be incurred by anyone who fails to account for RWT deductions by: making a false or misleading application for exemption falsely claiming to be the recipient named on the RWT exemption register holding exemption and failing to tell us when they no longer meet the conditions under which it was granted obtaining or attempting to obtain a credit for RWT deducted from someone else’s resident passive income. For more information If you would like more information about penalties and interest, see our booklet Penalties and interest - IR240. Ceasing to be a payer You’ll stop being an RWT payer if you cease to: carry on any taxable activity in New Zealand, for example, by disposing of it, closing it down or moving it overseas and don’t have exemption have a valid exemption and you’re not carrying on any taxable activity. In either of these situations you must: file your monthly income information by the 20th of the month after the month in which you stopped being a payer pay us any RWT you are holding, by the 20th of the month after the month in which you stopped being a payer 21 Part 3 – Special cases Joint accounts Note From 1 April 2020, you will need to provide the details of all joint account holders, so we can identify investments held in joint ownership. You will also need to provide us with information such as an account number and how many holders are on the account. Deduct RWT at the rate nominated by the account holders. Since 1 April 2018 you should be ensuring you get the IRD numbers for all people in a joint account. You do not need to split the interest between the holders as we will do this. For example, if we have information for three owners of a joint account, we will split the income and tax credits evenly among the owners – a third each. If a resident and a non-resident hold a joint account, deduct RWT from all interest paid on the account. The non-resident may claim a refund from Inland Revenue by completing either an Income tax return for non-resident individual taxpayers - IR3NR or an IR386 form. If a person has a valid exemption and has a joint account with someone who does not, deduct RWT from all interest you pay on the account. You only pay interest without deducting RWT if all account holders are exempt. Non-residents Interest paid to non-residents is non-resident passive income, so it’s not subject to RWT. Instead, you must deduct NRWT. If you’re not familiar with NRWT, read our NRWT - payer’s guide - IR291. The NRWT rates vary from country to country depending on where the person is resident. For lists these countries and the rate of NRWT to deduct, go to ird.govt.nz/nrwt RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 22 Foreign currency If paying interest in a currency other than New Zealand dollars, deduct RWT in the same currency. The tax deduction certificate must show both the income and deduction in New Zealand dollars. If you have deducted RWT in a foreign currency, you must still pay it to Inland Revenue in New Zealand dollars. Convert these deductions at the close of trading spot rate on the first working day of the month after the month in which you made the deductions. Most trading banks and financial institutions provide these on their website. Agents or trustees If you receive resident passive income as an agent or trustee for another person, you only have to deduct RWT from the payment if the payer should have deducted it and either failed to, or did not deduct the full amount. This liability to deduct includes situations where the payer did not have to deduct RWT because of specific provisions. If a person who has a exemption from RWT receives interest as trustee of a trust that is not a bare trust, they do not have to deduct RWT before passing it on to the trust. (A bare trust is a trust where the trustee’s only duty is to convey the property of the trust to the beneficiary.) An agent or trustee who carries on a taxable activity through a fixed establishment in New Zealand (whether resident or non-resident) must deduct RWT from interest payments made on behalf of another person. Custodians withholding and investment information reporting requirements Generally, custodians that are exempt from RWT and receive investment income on behalf of their clients are required to withhold tax and pay this to the Commissioner along with providing investor investment income information for on-payments or transfers of the income to their clients. Only where a third party agrees to take on and completes these requirements, or another custodian above you in the chain takes on these requirements will you be relieved from them. If sufficient tax has already been withheld and paid by the investment income payer, then a custodian or third party who has taken on the requirements need only provide the investor information. There are certain variations to the reporting requirements that can apply. Refer to the technical specifications for your channel of filing the information for the details. For more information read our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No.4. 23 Disclosures in your income tax return Transactions in financial arrangements If you have a exemption from RWT and you acquire or dispose of a financial arrangement, or make a redemption payment under a financial arrangement, you might have to send some information with your income tax return for the year in which the transaction took place. However, you do not have to send the information if the other party to the transaction: is the issuer of the financial arrangement, or has exemption at the time of the transaction and the interest would have otherwise been subject to RWT. In all other cases, the information to send is: the other person’s full name and last known address the other person’s IRD number (they must give you this within 10 working days of your asking for it) the date of the transaction the total amount you paid or received in the transaction (excluding fees).

Why we have it Deducting RWT means that people who receive investment income do not have to pay all the tax in a lump sum at the end of the year. Also, people who do not declare their investment income still have tax deducted from it. Income that must have RWT deducted Any income that fits the definition of resident passive income must have RWT deducted from it. Resident passive income is defined as an amount paid to a resident of New Zealand that consists of: interest dividends a taxable Māori authority distribution that is not a retirement scheme contribution a replacement payment paid to a person under a share-lending arrangement. This guide does not cover RWT on dividends. Read our guide Resident withholding tax (RWT) on dividends - IR284 for information on this. Resident passive income includes all types of interest except interest that is: paid on a debt for goods or services purchased, such as trade credit on hire purchases paid to a transitional resident paid to a tax pooling intermediary under a specified lease or finance lease paid on Bonus Bonds interest or a redemption payment on money lent by a non-resident to the New Zealand Government or a New Zealand public authority interest that is exempt from income tax under any Act other than the Income Tax Act 2007 any amount expressly exempted from income tax by any other Act, to the extent of the exemption so provided paid on an overpaid levy under section 173 of the Accident Compensation Act 2001 paid to someone who has been granted exemption from RWT RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 5 paid between 2 companies within the same group of companies paid to a non-resident (anyone who has been out of New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period and has had no enduring relationship with New Zealand in that time) derived from outside New Zealand by a non-resident payable by a taxpayer on any unpaid tax payable by us under section 84 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Registering as an RWT payer You must register with us as an RWT payer if you pay out more than $5,000 a year in interest, and: you pay the interest as part of a taxable activity (such as a trade, profession or business, or an activity carried out by a not-for-profit body or local authority), or we’ve granted you RWT exempt status, or you’re a non-resident but are carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand through a fixed establishment. If you’re not already registered as an RWT payer, you must contact us and register as soon as your interest paid out for the year exceeds $5,000. You will not have to account for RWT on the interest you paid out before you reached the $5,000 threshold. Banks, building societies and trustee companies that have been granted RWT exempt status must register as RWT payers, regardless of how much resident passive income they pay in a year. Also, any taxpayer who has been granted RWT exempt status and whose income is, or estimated to be, more than $2 million for any year must register as a payer if they pay out any resident passive income. Note If you’re not required to register and you pay interest, you may still have disclosure obligations in your income tax return. Register as an RWT payer online through myIR or, fill in a Resident withholding tax - interest payer registration - IR450 form and send it to us. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 6 Record keeping With any RWT deductions you make, you must keep records for the: total interest you pay total amount of RWT and date it was deducted full name and last known address of the recipient recipient’s IRD number. If you pay interest to someone who has been granted RWT exempt status and their IRD number is listed on the RWT exemption register you must also record: the full name and address of the person or organisation you pay interest to the total interest you pay the date RWT would have been deducted their IRD number. You must also keep details of all other financial arrangements that you’ve paid interest on at any time during the year. You must keep your records for 7 years and they must be in English or Māori unless you get approval from us to use another language. We may ask you to keep your records for an additional 3 years if auditing or investigating you. Failure to keep adequate records is a very serious matter and can result in a fine. If you want to know more about audit procedures, read our guide Inland Revenue audits - IR297. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 7 Part 2 – Filing and payments Note Investment income information must be provided to us electronically. Deducting RWT One of the first things you need to do once you’ve registered as an RWT payer, is to ask all the people you pay interest to for their IRD numbers and contact details. You must deduct RWT from all the interest you pay that is not exempt. Taxpayers who earn interest can elect their own RWT rate by completing a Choose your RWT deduction rate - IR456 form. Individuals Individuals can choose a rate of 10.5%, 17.5%, 30%, 33% or 39%. Electing the correct rate for the total income earned for the tax year ensures that the correct amount of tax is deducted from the interest. If the rate selected is too low, the individual may have a tax bill to pay at the end of the income year. If an individual does not elect an RWT rate, but they’ve given you a valid IRD number, deduct RWT at 33%. If an individual has not provided you with their IRD number, RWT must be deducted at the non-declaration rate of 45%. Companies Companies must notify their interest payers that they are a company. A company can elect either the 28%, 33% or 39% RWT rate. If a company does not choose an RWT rate, but they have notified you that they’re a company and given you a valid IRD number, deduct RWT at 28%. If a company has not supplied their IRD number, deduct RWT at the non-declaration rate of 45%. Note Companies that are trustees are not required to notify the interest payer of their company status and may use the 17.5%, 30%, 33% or 39% rate. If the trust is a testamentary trust, it may also elect the 10.5% rate if appropriate. Companies that are Māori authorities are not required to notify their company status and may choose 17.5%, 30%, 33% or 39%. This reflects the obligation on trustees to act according to the tax position of the trust’s beneficiaries. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 8 Non-declaration rate You must deduct RWT at the non-declaration rate of 45% for anyone who has not given you a valid IRD number. If you deduct RWT at the non-declaration rate because a recipient has not given you an IRD number, but they do later, you cannot refund the extra RWT deducted. This is because at the time you made the deduction, the non-declaration rate was correct. The recipient can only recover the extra tax deducted at the end of the year in their income tax assessment. Interest recipients electing inconsistent RWT rates It’s important that individuals and organisations you pay interest to, elect an RWT rate that is consistent with their taxable income. Using the correct RWT rate can help them avoid a tax bill at the end of the year. We regularly check RWT rates against the income details we hold to make sure a consistent RWT rate is being used. If someone is using an inconsistent RWT rate, we’ll advise you to change it and let you know which rate they should be on. You’ll need to change their RWT rate to the new rate as soon as possible. We’ll also let them know that the rate they elected is inconsistent with their estimated income and that we’ve asked you, as their interest payer, to change it. We’ll also ask them to check their RWT rate on our website. If they disagree with the RWT rate we’ve chosen, they can request that their interest payer change it. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 9 RWT rates RWT ratesRates where an IRD number has been provided 10.5% Individuals with annual income $15,600 or less\*  Testamentary trusts 17.5% Individuals with annual income $15,601 to $53,500\*  Individuals, Māori authorities and trusts who have not chosen a rate (if they have not opened a new account since 31 March 2010)  Trusts and testamentary trusts 28% Companies 30% Individuals with annual income $53,501 to $78,100\*  Trusts and Māori authorities 33% All interest recipients can use this rate, for example individuals with annual income $78,101 to $180,000\*  Use this rate for interest recipients who open a new account and do not choose a rate 39% Individuals whose annual income is $180,001 or more\* Rate where no IRD number has been provided 45% Use this rate for all interest recipients who have not provided an IRD number \* You’re not required to confirm an individual’s income level; you can accept the rate they provide. If you’re a Māori authority, you can use an RWT rate of 17.5% to deduct RWT from distributions of $200 or less. You can also use this rate for distributions of over $200 where the member has provided their IRD number, otherwise use 33%. When to deduct RWT You must deduct RWT at the time you pay resident passive income to the recipient. For this purpose, ‘pay’ means to: distribute to credit to an account deal with an amount in a person’s interest or on their behalf. If you make automatic interest payments, you must deduct RWT and credit only the net amount to the recipient’s account. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 10 Information required If you pay interest you need to send us the following information after each payment period: name, IRD number and contact address of the payer amount of interest paid, and tax withheld in the period for which interest is paid. The following information is required for each of the income recipients who received interest: their name their contact details - email, street address or mobile phone number the amount and type of income paid to them the tax withheld the date the tax was withheld. If it is available, you need to provide the following information for each of the income recipients who received interest: their IRD number their date of birth the tax rate they have provided. You must provide the name of any joint owners. If held, you also need to provide the following information for any joint owners: IRD number date of birth contact details - email, street address or mobile phone number. You must provide us with your investment income interest payment information electronically (unless we exempt you from electronic filing). Reports are due by the 20th of the month following the month in which the interest income was paid to the investor. You only need to report for the periods in which you make a payment and withhold tax on that payment. Nil returns are not required. You do not need to provide resident withholding tax (RWT) certificates to investors who have provided you their IRD number, but you do need to give them to those who have not. This also applies to dividends treated as interest and when an agent or trustee withholds RWT from dividends. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 11 RWT exempt status Do not deduct RWT from any interest you pay to taxpayers who have been granted RWT exempt status. This means they are exempt from having RWT deducted from their interest and dividend income. You do not need to include interest details for exempt customers in your monthly information report. The following taxpayers can get an exemption by completing an Application for exemption from resident withholding tax (RWT) on interest and dividends - IR451: amateur sports promoters Board of Trustees charitable estates community housing providers registered with the Community Housing Regulatory Authority community trusts companies that are a member of the Public Trust group, the Public Trustee or the Māori Tr u s t e e finance houses or brokers friendly societies or credit unions funeral trusts gaming machine operators horse or greyhound racing clubs improvement or research promoters local or public authorities local or regional promotion bodies not-for-profit organisations portfolio investment entities (PIE) public purpose Crown-controlled companies registered banks or building societies statutory trustee companies tertiary education institutions. Taxpayers can also apply if they: have earned or think they’ll earn more than $2 million a year have losses, or a RWT refund, of $500 or more are exempt from paying tax under an Act other than the Tax Acts. Charitable organisations on the Charities Services register do not need to apply. They are given RWT exempt status and added automatically to the RWT exemption register. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 12 Unincorporated bodies If an unincorporated body of persons, such as a partnership or a joint venture, has RWT exempt status, the exemption is granted in the name of the body and not in the name of the individual members. If the body is a trustee, the exemption is granted in the name of the trust. Checking the RWT exemption register The IRD number of everyone with RWT exempt status is listed on the RWT exemption register on our website at ird.govt.nz/rwt-exemption Use this register to confirm who has an active RWT exempt status and to identify people and organisations who no longer have an exemption. Most exemptions from RWT are issued for an unlimited period and remain active on the register unless they’re cancelled. These active exemptions do not show an end date. If the exemption is granted for a limited period, an end date (or expiry date) will also be shown. The register is updated overnight every business day (Monday to Friday) providing you with near real-time information. Make sure that the person you’re paying the resident passive income to is the person listed on the register. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 13 Cancelling RWT exempt status If we cancel an exemption, you must deduct RWT from any further interest you pay to that person or organisation. We may cancel an exemption if the person or organisation: no longer meets the conditions for which it was issued has provided misleading information in the application for exemption does not meet the $2 million target (where the exemption was granted on the basis of estimated income of more than $2 million) or fails to supply satisfactory evidence of annual income fails to pay any income tax payable by the due date. When we cancel a person’s or organisation’s RWT exempt status, we also update their status on the RWT exemption register. Once this cancellation appears on the register, you have 5 working days to amend your records and start deducting RWT where appropriate. When do I file and make payments If you estimate you will be required to withhold $500 or more in total for each month of the tax year ending 31 March, the return and payment are due by the 20th of the month following the month in which the tax was deducted. If you estimate for a tax year that you will be required to withhold less than $500 in total for each month of the tax year ending 31 March, then 2 returns and payments are due. These are by the 20th of April and 20th of October each year. If you discover that deductions of $500 or more have been made since the beginning of the previous month, those deductions must be paid for that 2-monthly period by the 20th of the month following the second month. Further returns and payments are required by the 20th of the month following each month where any amount is deducted for the rest of the tax year ending 31 March. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 14 Example – monthly payer Each month, the ABC Building Society deducts RWT of more than $500 when it credits interest to its customers’ accounts. It must pay the RWT deductions to us as follows: Month RWT deductedTotal RWT deductedTotal paid to usDue date for payment June 2023$2,500$2,50020 July 2023 July 2023$2,500$2,50020 August 2023 RWT of less than $500 per month If you deduct RWT of less than $500 each month, and the total for any 2 month period remains below $500 you may pay on a 6-monthly basis. 1 April to 30 September - due for payment on 20 October 1 October to 31 March - due for payment on 20 April. However, if the RWT deductions you’ve made accumulate to $500 during a 2-month period, you must send them in by the 20th of the month after the month they reach $500. Returns and payments are required on a monthly basis for the remainder of the tax year. Example – 6-monthly payer Matt Weaver’s Carpet Company deducts less than $500 each month, so they must pay the deductions to us by the 2 regular 6-monthly payment dates. Month RWT deducted Total RWT deductedTotal paid to usDue date for payment December 2023$200Nil– January 2024NilNil– February 2024$200Nil– March 2024Nil$400 20 April 2024 (regular 6-monthly payment date) RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 15 Example – deductions over $500 accumulated Collcar Investments Ltd deducts RWT of varying amounts. Some months the RWT deducted is more than $500, other months it is less. They must pay the RWT to us on the 20th of the month that follows the month when their accumulated deductions in a 2 month period exceed $500, and then each month they deduct after that. Month RWT deducted Total RWT deductedTotal paid to usDue date for payment January 2023$300Nil– February 2023$300$600 20 March 2023 (more than $500 accumulated) March 2023$200$20020 April 2023 April 2023$200Nil– May 2023$550$75020 June 2023 No RWT to pay If you have no RWT to pay for the month, you do not need to file any income information. How to make payments Go to ird.govt.nz/pay to find out about paying by: internet banking credit or debit card direct debit You can also call 0800 257 777 to pay by credit/debit card over the phone. When making a payment, include: your IRD number the account type you are paying the period the payment relates to. If you’re paying RWT on interest you need to select an account type of IPS. For information on choosing the right account types when making payments go to Ird.govt.nz/payment-account-type RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 16 If you make a mistake when deducting RWT Correcting errors from earlier years Errors relating to earlier years can be corrected if the total value of the adjustment does not exceed the larger of: $2,000, or 5% of the payer’s withholding liability for the tax type that the error relates to (for example RWT or NRWT) for the year in which the first payment is made. How they are corrected depends on whether they result in too much or too little tax being deducted, and the type of income. These processes only apply to errors made by payers of investment income. If you discover you have not deducted enough RWT, you can: 1. Deduct it from later payments made to the person 2. Ask the person to pay the amount that was not deducted 3. Adjust the amount of taxable income (only for non-cash dividends). Whichever option is chosen, the correction must be made before the next due date for reporting investment income to us (provided it’s reasonably practicable to do so). You’ll need to let us know: your name, IRD number and contact address the name and contact address (email, street address or mobile phone number) of the person who received the income the IRD number and date of birth of the person who received the income (if you have it) the adjustments made to the investment income information originally provided. Example - option 1 - too little tax being deducted and recovered from future payments Shane makes monthly interest payments to Sarah of $100. Sarah has an RWT rate of 33%. Shane mistakenly pays $89.50 to Sarah, having only deducted 10.5%. The amount of the under-deduction is $22.50 (i.e. $33 − $10.50). Realising his mistake, he corrects it by withholding an additional amount from the next payment made to Sarah. Shane withholds $55.50 from the next interest payment to Sarah, being $33 + $22.50. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 17 Example – option 2 - too little tax being deducted and recovered from investor Company A Ltd pays a dividend of $1,000 to Kelvin in June 2023. The dividend includes $280 of imputation credits attached and needs to have RWT deducted of $50. The company’s accountant accidently deducts RWT of only $5 and pays Kelvin a net amount of $715 - $45 more than he should have received. The company’s accountant contacts Kelvin in July 2023 to inform him of the error. Company A Ltd then pays the extra $45 to Inland Revenue and must recover the additional amount from Kelvin before March 2024. Example – option 3 - too little tax being deducted and taxable non-cash dividend adjusted Company B Ltd provides $100 worth of shares in another company (Company C Ltd) to 1 of its resident shareholders. It does not realise that the amount provided is a non-cash dividend until the company’s accountant informs them at the end of the tax year when they’re preparing the company’s accounts. Company B Ltd can submit investment income information on the non-cash dividend by the 20th of April following the end of the tax year. The company will show the amount of the non-cash dividend being $149.50, with RWT of $49.50 payable to Inland Revenue. Because this adjustment occurs outside the tax year that the non-cash dividend relates to, Company B Ltd will also have to provide Inland Revenue with information so it can allocate the non-cash dividend and tax credits to the correct tax year for the company’s shareholder. Deducting too much tax If you discover you have withheld too much RWT, you can refund it any time before the 20th of April following the end of the tax year in which the error occurred, provided you have not provided the person who received the income with: an end-of-year withholding tax certificate for RWT, or a shareholder dividend statement, or a statement to a member who received a taxable Māori authority distribution. You must let us know the amount of the refund at the time you pay it so that we do not also provide a refund. If you do not refund the amount by the 20th of April following the end of the tax year in which the error occurred, you must tell us and the recipient how much needs to be refunded. If the over-deduction has already been paid to us, we will: pay the refund to the payer if future payments to the person have been adjusted pay the refund to the person who received the income if future payments have not been adjusted. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 18 Penalties and interest Late payment If you do not pay a bill on time, you may have to pay penalties and interest. Contact us if you are not able to pay on time. We’ll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement. Find out more at ird.govt.nz/penalties Amounts of $100 or less Interest and late payment penalties are not charged on outstanding amounts of $100 or less. Penalty for not filing electronically There is a penalty of $250 for each time investment income information is not supplied to us electronically and you do not have an exemption. If you are unable to supply your investment income information electronically, you can apply for an exemption. In considering your request we will assess: your capabilities the digital services available to you the compliance costs to you. Relief from late payment If late payment of RWT is due to circumstances beyond your control, we have the discretion to remit late payment penalties. To have your case considered, write to us explaining the reasons for the late payment. Remission or cancellation of use of money interest Interest will be remitted, or legally forgiven, only in exceptional circumstances and at our discretion. Remission occurs when interest is correctly imposed but a decision is made to relieve you of the liability to pay. For example, if we have given you incorrect advice, causing a return or payment to be late. You must be able to provide evidence to support the fact that incorrect advice was given. Failing to account for RWT deductions RWT that you have deducted is money held in trust for the Crown and there are penalties if you use it for any purpose other than payment to Inland Revenue. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 19 Failing to deduct RWT If the RWT rules require a deduction to be made, the payer and recipient cannot arrange between themselves not to deduct RWT. In addition, fines and penalties may be incurred by anyone who fails to account for RWT deductions by: making a false or misleading application for exemption falsely claiming to be the recipient named on the RWT exemption register holding exemption and failing to tell us when they no longer meet the conditions under which it was granted obtaining or attempting to obtain a credit for RWT deducted from someone else’s resident passive income. For more information If you would like more information about penalties and interest, see our booklet Penalties and interest - IR240. Ceasing to be a payer You’ll stop being an RWT payer if you cease to: carry on any taxable activity in New Zealand, for example, by disposing of it, closing it down or moving it overseas and do not have an exemption have a valid exemption and you’re not carrying on any taxable activity. In either of these situations you must: file your monthly income information by the 20th of the month after the month in which you stopped being a payer pay us any RWT you are holding, by the 20th of the month after the month in which you stopped being a payer RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 20 Part 3 – Special cases Joint accounts Note You will need to provide the details of all joint account holders, so we can identify investments held in joint ownership. You will also need to provide us with information such as an account number and how many holders are on the account. Deduct RWT at the rate nominated by the account holders. Since 1 April 2018 you should be ensuring you get the IRD numbers for all people in a joint account. You do not need to split the interest between the holders as we will do this. For example, if we have information for 3 owners of a joint account, we will split the income and tax credits evenly among the owners – 1/3rd each. If a resident and a non-resident hold a joint account, deduct RWT from all interest paid on the account. The non-resident may claim a refund from Inland Revenue by completing either an Income tax return for non-resident individual taxpayers - IR3NR or a New Zealand non- resident withholding tax (NRWT) - IR386. If a person has a valid exemption and has a joint account with someone who does not, deduct RWT from all interest you pay on the account. You only pay interest without deducting RWT if all account holders are exempt. Non-residents Interest paid to non-residents is non-resident passive income, so it’s not subject to RWT. Instead, you must deduct NRWT. If you’re not familiar with NRWT, read our NRWT - payer’s guide - IR291. The NRWT rates vary from country to country depending on where the person is resident. For a list of countries and the rate of NRWT to deduct, go to ird.govt.nz/nrwt-rate-for-dta-countries RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 21 Foreign currency If paying interest in a currency other than New Zealand dollars, deduct RWT in the same currency. The tax deduction certificate must show both the income and deduction in New Zealand dollars. If you have deducted RWT in a foreign currency, you must still pay it to Inland Revenue in New Zealand dollars. Convert these deductions at the close of trading spot rate on the first working day of the month after the month in which you made the deductions. Most trading banks and financial institutions provide these on their website. Agents or trustees If you receive resident passive income as an agent or trustee for another person, you only have to deduct RWT from the payment if the payer should have deducted it and either failed to, or did not deduct the full amount. This liability to deduct includes situations where the payer did not have to deduct RWT because of specific provisions. If a person who has an exemption from RWT receives interest as trustee of a trust that is not a bare trust, they do not have to deduct RWT before passing it on to the trust. (A bare trust is a trust where the trustee’s only duty is to convey the property of the trust to the beneficiary.) An agent or trustee who carries on a taxable activity through a fixed establishment in New Zealand (whether resident or non-resident) must deduct RWT from interest payments made on behalf of another person. Custodians withholding and investment information reporting requirements Generally, custodians that are exempt from RWT and receive investment income on behalf of their clients are required to withhold tax and pay this to the Commissioner along with providing investor investment income information for on-payments or transfers of the income to their clients. Only where a third party agrees to take on and completes these requirements, or another custodian above you in the chain takes on these requirements will you be relieved from them. If sufficient tax has already been withheld and paid by the investment income payer, then a custodian or third party who has taken on the requirements need only provide the investor information. There are certain variations to the reporting requirements that can apply. Refer to the technical specifications for your channel of filing the information for the details. For more information read our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 32, No 4 (May 2020). RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 22 Disclosures in your income tax return Transactions in financial arrangements If you have an exemption from RWT and you acquire or dispose of a financial arrangement, or make a redemption payment under a financial arrangement, you might have to send some information with your income tax return for the year in which the transaction took place. However, you do not have to send the information if the other party to the transaction: is the issuer of the financial arrangement, or has exemption at the time of the transaction and the interest would have otherwise been subject to RWT. In all other cases, the information to send is: the other person’s full name and last known address the other person’s IRD number (they must give you this within 10 working days of your asking for it) the date of the transaction the total amount you paid or received in the transaction (excluding fees).

IR284 April 2024 Resident withholding tax (RWT) on dividends - payer's guide What you need to know about RWT when you pay dividends Introduction This guide tells companies that pay dividends what they must do under the resident withholding tax (RWT) laws. It tells you when you must deduct RWT from dividends, when to pay the deductions to us, and what information you must give to us and the people who receive the dividends. In most places in this booklet, resident withholding tax is called RWT. For more information on RWT on interest, refer to our RWT on interest - payer’s guide - IR283. You can get this from our website ird.govt.nz or order a copy by phoning us on 0800 257 773. The information in this booklet is based on current tax laws at the time of printing.

It helps people who receive investment income to pay their tax throughout the year, and makes sure that people who do not declare their investment income still have tax deducted from it. Inland Revenue still follows up on undeclared investment income and takes action against people who do not declare it. Note RWT must be accounted for the period 1 April to 31 March, regardless of your accounting year. Income that must have RWT deducted RWT is deducted from interest on money lent as well as on dividends, including Māori authority distributions. This guide deals only with RWT on dividends. For more information about RWT on interest, read our booklet IR283. For more information about RWT on Māori authority distributions, read our booklet Becoming a Māori authority - IR487. You can get these booklets from our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides or order a copy by phoning us on 0800 257 773. Registering as an RWT payer We automatically register all companies as dividend RWT payers. Any payments can then be credited to a separate RWT account for each company. However, any company, agent or trustee that pays dividends treated as interest will need to register in myIR. Manage all your Inland Revenue matters securely online with a myIR account. Go to ird.govt.nz/myIR to find out more. RWT ON DIVIDENDS 4 Dividends liable for RWT Cash dividends This covers most dividends, other than non-cash dividends and dividends treated as interest. Non-cash dividends Companies may provide other benefits to shareholders rather than paying a cash dividend. These benefits are also treated as dividends for tax purposes, and RWT must be paid on them. These benefits include: - loans to shareholders that are forgiven or become irrecoverable or unenforceable through the lapse of time, or where the shareholders benefit from being released or discharged, by operation of law or otherwise, from the obligation to pay an amount of the loan - property distributed or sold to shareholders at less than the market price (the difference between the market price and the actual price paid is the dividend) - use of company property by shareholders for inadequate consideration, such as interest-free loans (broadly speaking, the difference between the market value and the actual consideration is the dividend) - non-deductible expenditure of a close company, for the benefit of a shareholder, for example, private travel - taxable bonus issues - any bonus issue made instead of a dividend, or a bonus issue that the company elects to be a taxable bonus issue - property acquired from a shareholder at above market value - non-executive director shareholder in that capacity - dividends in relation to a group investment fund - Māori authority distributions. Note Non-cash benefits paid to shareholders, who are also employees of the company or trust which paid the benefits, may be subject to fringe benefit tax (FBT) rather than RWT. For more information on FBT, read our Fringe benefit tax guide - IR409. You can get this from our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides RWT ON DIVIDENDS 5 Dividends treated as interest Dividends treated as interest are dividends paid in relation to shares issued by a company that at the time of payment is any of the following: • a company not resident in New Zealand • a company that has a constitution that does not allow all its income or property to be distributed to a proprietor, member or shareholder • a company whose income is exempt (with some exceptions) • a company solely engaged in New Zealand in life insurance or re-insurance. Dividends not liable for RWT Companies do not have to deduct RWT from the following: - dividends paid between members of the same group of companies at the time of payment - excess remuneration paid to relatives, directors and shareholders, or non-deductible rebates to members of mutual associations, which Inland Revenue declares to be dividends - dividends paid to those on the RWT exemption register - dividends paid to non-residents - dividends paid by a qualifying company - dividends payable by a building society in relation to withdrawable shares and dividends paid by friendly societies to its members (these are treated as interest, so RWT on interest is deducted). - the use of company property by shareholders in a flat-owning company - dividends that are exempt from income tax under any act other than the Income Tax Act 2004 - attributed repatriation, ie dividends to a shareholder with an income interest of at least 10% in a controlled foreign company - dividends that are non-resident withholding income - dividends that are exempt income under section CW 9 and CW 10 of the Income Tax Act 2007 or CB 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994 - a fully imputed dividend paid to another company, if the company paying the dividend chooses not to deduct RWT (applies to dividends paid on or after 1 April 2017 only) - an amount treated as a dividend under section CB 32C (which relates to the amount of income for some look-through owners in the first year of a look-through company) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (applies for the 2017-18 and later income years only). RWT ON DIVIDENDS 6 Dividends paid by qualifying companies A New Zealand resident company with five or fewer ultimate shareholders can elect to become a qualifying company. Dividends paid to New Zealand resident shareholders by a qualifying company are not subject to further tax in the hands of the shareholder. The dividend is the shareholder's exempt income if it exceeds total imputation and dividend withholding payment (DWP) credits attached, divided by the basic rate of income tax for companies in the year it is derived. If you would like more information about qualifying companies, read our booklet Qualifying companies - IR435. You can get this from our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Flat-owning companies Flat-owning companies are not business companies - they are set up to own residential property. Having shares in the company entitles the owner to use of the property. The use of the company property would ordinarily be treated as a non-cash dividend to shareholders, but an exemption applies if the company meets both of the following conditions: - its rules or constitution allow each shareholder to use the property - its only assets are residential property and funds are reserved for maintenance and other expenses on the property. Significant Enterprises Our Significant Enterprises team is responsible for all business taxpayers with a group turnover of greater than $100 million, and taxpayers subject to special legislation such as those involved in mining and crown entities, plus large businesses involved in industries for which specific tax legislation applies. All Significant Enterprises business services areas are located in Wellington and Auckland.

RWT ON DIVIDENDS 7 Part 2 - Filing and payments Note Investment income information must be provided to us electronically. This part explains record keeping requirements and what a company needs to do for each of the three types of dividends - cash dividends, non-cash dividends and dividends treated as interest. It also explains when and how to make payments to us. Companies need to work out the RWT on dividends paid, and pay us the RWT by the due date. They also need to let shareholders know about the dividends paid, and the credits attached. Other credits attached to dividends that will affect the RWT calculation are: • Dividend withholding payment credit This credit comes from the amount paid by a company when it receives a dividend from a non- resident company. The credit can then be attached to dividends the company pays. • Imputation credit This is a portion of the New Zealand income tax paid by a company on its taxable profits, and passed on to shareholders, so the dividend is not taxed twice. When to deduct RWT A company must deduct RWT at the time it pays shareholders a dividend. For this purpose, "pay" means: - to distribute to - credit to an account - to deal with in a person's interest, or on behalf of that person. It does not mean the date a dividend was declared. Note No RWT to pay If you have no RWT to pay for the month, you do not need to file any income information. RWT ON DIVIDENDS 8 Record keeping Companies paying dividends and deducting RWT must keep a record of: - total dividends paid - total amount of RWT and date it was deducted - full name, IRD number and last known address of the recipient - date of birth if provided - any number used in paying the recipient (such as an account number). Agents paying dividends should also keep a record of the RWT on dividends treated as interest. If the company is attaching an imputation credit, or dividend withholding payment credits to a dividend, there are further requirements. For more information on imputation and dividend withholding payment credits, read our booklet Imputation - IR274. You can get this from our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides You must keep your records for seven years and they must be in English or Māori, unless you get approval from us to use another language. We may ask you to keep your records for an additional three years if auditing or investigating you. Failure to keep adequate records is a very serious matter and can result in a fine. If you want to know more about audit procedures, read our guide Inland Revenue audits - IR297 at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Monthly information You must provide us with your investment income interest payment information electronically by the 20th of the following month the interest was paid. You will need to provide: • your name, IRD number and contact address • the total amount of dividends paid • the date on which the dividend is declared and the payment date of the dividend • the total amount of tax withheld • the total amount of imputation credits provided and imputation ratio • for dividends paid in AUD$ by an Australian ICA company, the exchange rate used and the AUD$ used to calculate the imputation ratio. RWT ON DIVIDENDS 9 For each of the people who received dividends, the following information will be required: • their name and contact address (email, street address or mobile phone number) • the amount and type of income paid to them • the tax withheld from it • the date the tax was withheld • the imputation credits attached, if any. • The number of shares for which the dividend is declared, or in the case of a dividend that is a bonus issue, the number of shares included in the bonus issue • the date on which the dividend is declared and the payment date of the dividend • in the case of a dividend that is a bonus issue, the amount of the bonus issue. For each of the people who received dividends, the following information will be required if you have it: • their IRD number and date of birth • the tax rate used • the name, IRD number, date of birth and contact address of any joint owners. This information is due by the 20th of the month following the month in which the dividend is paid. You will not need to file a nil return. You must also pay any tax withheld to Inland Revenue by the 20th of the following month. There are a number of electronic channels for filing to choose from, including: • Gateway web service (suitable for large volume filers) • file upload through myIR, and • online form via myIR (this may suit if you are filing for a few accounts). Exemption from RWT Do not deduct RWT from any interest you pay to taxpayers who are on the RWT exemption register or advise they are exempt under another Act other than the Income Tax Act. Checking the RWT exemption register The IRD number of everyone with RWT exempt status is listed on the RWT exemption register on our website at ird.govt.nz/rwt-exemption. Use this register to confirm who has an active RWT exempt status and to identify people and organisations who no longer have an exemption. RWT ON DIVIDENDS 10 Most exemptions from RWT are issued for an unlimited period and remain active on the register unless they’re cancelled. These active exemptions don’t show an end date. If the exemption is granted for a limited period, an end date (or expiry date) will also be shown. The register is updated overnight every business day (Monday to Friday) providing you with near real-time information. Make sure that the person you’re paying the resident passive income to is the person listed on the re gister. Unincorporated bodies If an unincorporated body of persons, such as a partnership or a joint venture, has exemption for a taxable activity, they are exempt in the name of the body and not in the name of the individual members. If the body is a trustee, the exemption is granted in the name of the trust. Cancelling exempt status If we cancel an exemption, you must deduct RWT from any further interest you pay to that person or organisation. We may cancel an exemption if the person or organisation: • no longer meets the conditions for which it was issued • has provided misleading information in the application for exemption • doesn’t meet the $2 million target (where the exemption was granted on the basis of estimated income of more than $2 million) or fails to supply satisfactory evidence of annual income • fails to pay any income tax payable by the due date. When we cancel a person’s or organisation’s RWT exempt status, we also update their status on the RWT exemption register. Once this cancellation appears on the register, you have five working days to amend your records and start deducting RWT where appropriate. RWT ON DIVIDENDS 11 Cash dividends Calculating RWT on cash dividends RWT is currently calculated at a rate of 33 cents in every dollar of the gross dividend. The gross dividend includes any credits attached to that dividend. The RWT is then reduced by any imputation credit and dividend withholding payment credit attached to that dividend. This can be expressed by the following formula: (a × (b + c)) − c In this formula: a is the current RWT rate on dividends (33%) b is the amount of the dividend paid (but before deducting RWT) c is the total of the following amounts: i. if the dividend is paid in relation to shares issued by an imputation credit account (ICA) company, the amount of an imputation credit attached to the dividend ii. if the dividend is paid in relation to shares issued by a company not resident in New Zealand, the amount of foreign withholding tax paid or payable on the amount of dividend. If the dividend is fully imputed there will be an amount of RWT to pay. Example ABC Ltd pays a cash dividend of $2,000. It attaches a $200 imputation credit to the dividend. Using the above formula, RWT is calculated as follows: a = 0.33 b = $2,000 c = $200 (0.33 × ($2,000 + $200)) − $200 = (0.33 × $2,200) − $200 = $726 − $200 = $526 RWT payable The net dividend paid to the shareholder is $1,474. Note For dividends paid on or after 1 April 2017 a person can choose to apply this formula to determine the amount of RWT to deduct when a non-cash dividend is paid at the same time as a cash dividend. For this to apply the amount of the cash dividend has to be equal to or greater than the amount of RWT payable under the formula. RWT ON DIVIDENDS 12 Shareholder dividend statement A company or agent paying ordinary dividends must give the shareholder a dividend statement whenever RWT is deducted from a dividend in a form approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The statement must show: - the name and IRD number of the company - the date the dividend was paid - the name and address of the shareholder receiving the dividend - the IRD number of the shareholder receiving the dividend - the amount of any RWT deducted, or NRWT deducted if a non-resident - the amount of the dividend paid excluding imputation credits - the amount of any imputation credit attached to the dividend - the amount of any dividend withholding payment credit attached to the dividend - the sum of the dividend paid to the shareholder and the total credits. Example ABC Ltd shareholder dividend statement Date31 March 20XX ShareholderA N Investor Box 999 Marketville IRD numberXX-765-432 Dividend$2,000 Imputation credit$200 Dividend withholding payment credit$0 Taxable gross dividend$2,200 RWT$526 Net dividend received by shareholder$1,474 Non-cash dividends Calculating RWT on non-cash dividends For non-cash dividends (except a bonus issue in lieu or a share issued under a profit distribution plan), the RWT is calculated on the value of the dividend paid. The formula is: a × b − c 1 − a RWT ON DIVIDENDS 13 In this formula: a is the current RWT rate on dividends (33%) b is the amount of the dividend paid (but before deducting RWT) c is the total of the following amounts: i. if the dividend is paid in relation to shares issued by an ICA company, the amount of an imputation credit attached to the dividend ii. if the dividend is paid in relation to shares issued by a company not resident in New Zealand, the amount of foreign withholding tax paid or payable on the amount of dividend. If the dividend is fully imputed there will be an amount of RWT to pay. Note As you cannot make a deduction from a non-cash dividend, the company must pay us an amount equal to the RWT that would have been deducted if the dividend was a cash dividend. Example Dollar Corp, an ICA company, forgives a loan of $750 to a shareholder, so this is a non-cash dividend. An imputation credit of $50 is attached to this non-cash dividend. The RWT is calculated as follows: a = 0.33 b = $750 c = $50 0.33 × $750 − $50 1 − 0.33 = (0.492537 × $750) − $50 = $369.40 − $50 = $319.40 RWT to pay This RWT is not deducted from the dividend as there is no actual payment. Instead, Dollar Corp pays the amount of RWT to us. The shareholder shows the gross dividend (the total of the dividend, imputation credit and RWT) as income in their tax return. This will be: Forgiveness of debt$750.00 Imputation$50.00 RWT$319.40 Taxable dividend income$ 1,119.40 The shareholder claims the imputation and RWT credits in the overall tax calculation. The net dividend received by the shareholder is still $750 - unchanged by the RWT calculation. RWT ON DIVIDENDS 14 Note For a bonus issue in lieu, work out the RWT using the same formula as for cash dividends. Advice to shareholders A company or agent paying non-cash dividends must give the shareholder a dividend statement whenever RWT is deducted from a dividend. The statement must show the same information as the example on page 20 and must be approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Calculating RWT from a bonus issue in lieu or from a share issued under a profit distribution plan A bonus issue in lieu means a bonus issue made by a company under an arrangement giving shareholders the choice whether to receive a bonus issue, or money, or money's worth. A profit distribution plan is a scheme in which a company notifies some or all of its shareholders that shares will be issued on a particular date and gives those shareholders the choice to have some or all of the shares issued to them repurchased by the company. The amount of RWT for these types of payments is calculated as follows: (a × (b + c)) − c In this formula: a is the current RWT rate on dividends (33%) b is any of the following, as applicable: i. for bonus issues in lieu, the net amount of money offered as an alternative to the bonus issue (but before deducting RWT), or ii. for shares issued under a profit distribution plan, the net amount offered by the company for the repurchase of the share (but before deducting RWT). c is the total of the following amounts: i. if the dividend is paid in relation to shares issued by an ICA company, the amount of an imputation credit attached to the dividend ii. if the dividend is paid in relation to shares issued by a company not resident in New Zealand, the amount of foreign withholding tax paid or payable on the amount of dividend. Note If the calculation results in a negative amount, no RWT should be deducted. RWT ON DIVIDENDS 15 Dividends treated as interest Calculating RWT on dividends treated as interest For dividends treated as interest, work out the RWT using the same formula as for cash dividends. Most dividends treated as interest will not have imputation credits attached, which makes the formula simpler. However, agents or trustees may receive dividends with imputation credits attached. In this case, the agent or trustee must take the imputation credit into account when working out the RWT on the dividend. When the dividend is passed on to the final recipient, it will have both imputation and RWT credits. Calculating RWT on cash and non-cash dividends paid at the same time To the RWT obligation when cash and non-cash dividends are paid at the same time with the two dividends treated as a single dividend use the formula: (a × (b + c)) − c In this formula: a is the current RWT rate on dividends (33%) b is the total amount of the cash dividend and the non-cash dividend paid (but before deducting RWT) c is the total of the following amounts: i. if a dividend is paid in relation to shares issued by an ICA company, the total amount of imputation credits attached to the dividends ii. if a dividend is paid in relation to shares issued by a company not resident in New Zealand, the amount of foreign withholding tax paid or payable on the total amount of dividends. Custodians withholding and investment information reporting requirements Generally, custodians that are exempt from RWT and receive investment income on behalf of their clients are required to withhold tax and pay this to the Commissioner along with providing investor investment income information for on-payments or transfers of the income to their clients. Only where a third party agrees to take on and completes these requirements, or another custodian above you in the chain takes on these requirements will you be relieved from them. If sufficient tax has already been withheld and paid by the investment income payer, then a custodian or third party who has taken on the requirements need only provide the investor information. RWT ON DIVIDENDS 16 There are certain variations to the reporting requirements that can apply. Refer to the technical specifications for your channel of filing the information for the details. For more information read our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No.4. How to make payments Go to ird.govt.nz/pay to find out about paying by: • internet banking • credit or debit card • direct debit You can also call 0800 257 777 to pay by credit/debit card over the phone. When making a payment, include: • your IRD number • the account type you are paying • the period the payment relates to. If you’re paying RWT on dividends you need to select an account type of DWT. When paying RWT on Māori authority distributions and on dividends which are treated as interest use an account type of RWT. For information on choosing the right account types when making payments go to Ird.govt.nz/ payment-account-type Correcting errors in investment income reporting If you find you've made a mistake, for example, you have not deducted RWT when you should have, you have deducted too much or too little, or you have deducted NRWT but the recipient is not a non-resident, the next few sections explain what you need to do. You can correct errors occurring within a tax year, regardless of their size. There is no need to let us know about these errors. RWT ON DIVIDENDS 17 Correcting errors from earlier years Errors relating to earlier years can be corrected if the total value of the adjustment does not exceed the larger of: • $2,000, or • 5% of the payer’s withholding liability for the tax type that the error relates to (for example RWT or NRWT) for the year in which the first payment is made. How they are corrected depends on whether they result in too much or too little tax being deducted. If you discover you have not deducted enough RWT, you can: 1. Deduct it from later payments made to the person 2. Ask the person to pay the amount that was not deducted 3. Adjust the amount of taxable income (only for non-cash dividends) Whichever option is chosen, the correction must be made before the next due date for reporting investment income to us (provided it’s reasonably practicable to do so). You’ll need to let us know: • your name, IRD number and contact address • the name and contact address (email, street address or mobile phone number) of the person who received the income • the IRD number and date of birth of the person who received the income (if you have it) • the adjustments made to the investment income information originally provided. Example – too little tax being deducted and recovered from investor Company A Ltd pays a gross dividend of $1,000 to Kelvin in June 2023. The dividend includes $280 of imputation credits attached and needs to have RWT deducted of $50. The company’s accountant accidently deducts RWT of only $5 and pays Kelvin a net amount of $715 - $45 more than he should have received. The company’s accountant contacts Kelvin in July 2023 to inform him of the error. Company A Ltd then pays the extra $45 to Inland Revenue and must recover the additional amount from Kelvin before March 2024. RWT ON DIVIDENDS 18 Example – too little tax being deducted and taxable non-cash dividend adjusted Company B Ltd provides $100 worth of shares in another company (Company C Ltd) to one of its resident shareholders. It does not realise that the amount provided is a non-cash dividend until the company’s accountant informs them at the end of the tax year when they’re preparing the company’s accounts. Company B Ltd can submit investment income information on the non-cash dividend by the 20th of April following the end of the tax year. The company will show the amount of the non-cash dividend being $149.50, with RWT of $49.50 payable to Inland Revenue. Because this adjustment occurs outside the tax year that the non-cash dividend relates to, Company B Ltd will also have to provide Inland Revenue with information so it can allocate the non-cash dividend and tax credits to the correct tax year for the company’s shareholder. Deducting too much tax If you discover you have withheld too much RWT, you can refund it any time before the 20th of April following the end of the tax year in which the error occurred, provided you have not provided the person who received the income with: • an end-of-year withholding tax certificate for RWT, or • a shareholder dividend statement, or • a statement to a member who received a taxable Māori authority distribution. You must let us know the amount of the refund at the time you pay it so that we do not also provide a refund. If you do not refund the amount by the 20th of April following the end of the tax year in which the error occurred, you must tell us and the recipient how much needs to be refunded. If the over-deduction has already been paid to us, we will: • pay the refund to the payer if future payments to the person have been adjusted, • pay the refund to the person who received the income if future payments have not been adjusted. Non-residents Interest paid to non-residents is non-resident passive income, so it is not subject to RWT. Instead, you must deduct non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). If you deduct RWT and then find out that the recipient is a non-resident, this is what you should do: RWT ON DIVIDENDS 19 Current year If you find the error before you have filed your reconciliation, you can simply deduct less NRWT from the next payment to that recipient, and reduce the following NRWT payment to us. If you do this, please send a letter of explanation with your reduced payment, so we know not to charge you penalties. You’ll need to let us know the period you over-deducted in so we can transfer the credit to the period under-deducted. Back-year If you find a mistake in a previous income year, the recipient can claim the excess deductions in their end-of-year tax return, if they have an IRD number. Please do not issue amended certificates or file an amended reconciliation. Penalties and interest Late payment If you do not pay a bill on time, you may have to pay penalties and interest. Contact us if you are not able to pay on time. We’ll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement. Find out more at ird.govt.nz/penalties Amounts of $100 or less Interest and late payment penalties are not charged on outstanding amounts of $100 or less. Penalty for not filing electronically There is a penalty of $250 for each time investment income information is not supplied to us electronically and you do not have an exemption. If you are unable to supply your investment income information electronically, you can apply for an exemption. In considering your request we will assess: • your capabilities • the digital services available to you • the compliance costs to you. Arrangements If you are unable to pay your tax by the due date, please contact us to discuss an arrangement for making payments. In some situations, if you are in financial difficulties, we may agree to you paying your tax and any penalties and interest this way. Arrangements can be agreed upon before or after the due date for payment. However, there are greater reductions in the penalties charged if the arrangement is made before the due date. RWT ON DIVIDENDS 20 Remission or cancellation of use of money interest Interest will be remitted, or legally forgiven, only in exceptional circumstances and at our discretion. Remission occurs when interest is correctly imposed but a decision is made to relieve you of the liability to pay. For example, if we have given you incorrect advice, causing a return or payment to be late. You must be able to provide evidence to support the fact that incorrect advice was given. Failing to account for RWT deductions RWT that you have deducted is money held in trust for the Crown and there are penalties if you use it for any purpose other than payment to Inland Revenue. Failing to deduct RWT If the RWT rules require a deduction to be made, the payer and recipient cannot arrange between themselves not to deduct RWT. In addition, fines and penalties may be incurred by anyone who fails to account for RWT deductions by: - making a false or misleading application for RWT exemption - falsely claiming to be the recipient named on the exemption register - having exemption from RWT and failing to tell us when they no longer meet the conditions under which it was granted, or - obtaining or attempting to obtain a credit for RWT deducted from someone else’s resident withholding income. For more information If you would like more information about penalties and interest, see our booklet Penalties and interest - IR240. Agents and trustees If an agent or trustee for another person receives a dividend from which RWT was not deducted, that agent or trustee must work out and pay the RWT to us. The due date is the 20th of the month after the dividend was received. Non-residents contact Any dividends paid to a non-resident are liable to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) instead of RWT. If you would like to know more about the New Zealand tax residency rules, or about deducting and paying NRWT, read our booklets New Zealand tax residence guide - IR292 or NRWT - payers guide - IR291. You can view a copy on our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guide RWT ON DIVIDENDS 21 Foreign currency If you are paying dividends in a currency other than New Zealand dollars, you may deduct RWT in the same currency. The tax deduction certificate will then show both the income and deduction in the foreign currency. If you have deducted RWT in a foreign currency, you must still pay it to us in New Zealand dollars. Convert these deductions at the close of trading exchange rate on the first working day of the month after the month in which you made the deductions. Unit trusts You must provide us the following information electronically (unless we have given you an exemption form electronic filing): • the name, IRD number and contact address of the unit trust. • the total amount of dividends paid • the total amount of tax withheld • the total amount of imputation credits provided and imputation ratio. For each of the people who received a dividend, the following information will be required: • their name and address (email, street address or mobile phone number) • the amount and type of income paid to them • the tax withheld from it. For each of the people who received a dividend, the following information will be required if the unit trust has it: • the tax rate they have provided. • IRD number and date of birth • the name, IRD number, date of birth and contact address of any joint owners.
