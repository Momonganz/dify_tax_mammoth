1 DEDUCTIBILITY OF BREAK FEE PAID BY A LANDLORD TO EXIT EARLY FROM A FIXED INTEREST RATE LOAN ON SALE OF RENTAL PROPERTY PUBLIC RULING – BR PUB 10/20 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This ruling applies in respect of sections DA 1, DB 6, DB 7, and EW 31 and the definition of “interest” in section YA 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is where a person has entered into a fixed interest rate loan and the money has been used to acquire a property from which rental income is derived. The person subsequently pays a break fee to the lender to repay in full and terminate that loan earlier than its agreed repayment date in order to sell the rental property. Therefore, the person ceases to derive rental income from the property. This Ruling will not apply when the loan is not used solely for the deriving of rental income or where the loan is part of or connected with one or more other financial arrangements between the lender and the borrower. This Ruling will also not apply if the taxpayer has adopted the IFRS financial reporting method in section EW 15D. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the arrangement as follows: • A base price adjustment is required in the income year the loan is repaid. • The amount of any break fee is included in the “consideration” element of the base price adjustment formula and will increase the overall negative figure that the base price adjustment provides. • The negative amount under the base price adjustment is expenditure incurred under the financial arrangements rules and constitutes interest. • An automatic deduction is available for companies (other than qualifying companies) for the negative base price adjustment amount as interest under section DB 7. • A deduction is available for other taxpayers under section DB 6 and the general permission in section DA 1. 2 The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This ruling will apply from the first day of the 2008/09 income year to the last day of the 2011/12 income year. This ruling is signed by me on the 28 th day of October 2010. Martin Smith Chief Tax Counsel 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING – BR PUB 10/20 This commentary is intended to help readers understand and apply the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 10/20 (“the Ruling”). The commentary is not a legally binding statement. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. The relevant legislative provisions are reproduced in the Appendix to this commentary. Background This Ruling deals with the deductibility of a fee charged by banks to permit landlords to repay a fixed interest rate loan early in order to sell a rental property. These fees are variously referred to by terms such as “early repayment fees”, “early repayment adjustment charge”, “early exit fees” and “mortgage break fees”. In this Ruling, the term “break fee” is used to refer to all such charges. The amount of the break fee and the circumstances that trigger the charging of the fee vary from lender to lender. The fee is generally seen as compensation for the loss the lender may have suffered if their current interest rate for a similar loan for a fixed interest rate period closest to the borrower’s unexpired fixed interest period is lower than the fixed interest rate applying to the borrower’s loan. Public rulings BR Pub 09/09 ‘Deductibility of break fee paid by a landlord to exit early from a fixed interest rate loan’ and BR Pub 09/10 ‘Deductibility of break fee paid by landlord to vary the interest rate of an existing fixed interest rate loan’ deal with the deductibility of the break fee in two scenarios. These are when: • the loan is repaid early (whether replaced by further borrowing from the same or another financial institution or not); • the interest rate of the loan is simply renegotiated during the term of the loan and the existing loan continues. This Ruling considers the additional scenario where the break fee is paid in order to sell the rental property, so the landlord ceases to derive assessable income from the property. Application of the legislation Financial arrangements rules and base price adjustment A fixed interest rate loan is a financial arrangement under section EW 3. The financial arrangements rules (FA rules) will therefore apply. When a loan is repaid in full, a base price adjustment (BPA) is required under section EW 29. Although many landlords are likely to be cash basis persons under the FA rules and not required to use a spreading method, they are still subject to the FA rules and will be required to do a BPA when the loan is repaid in full. The formula for calculating a BPA is in section EW 31(5): consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted A break fee charged by a bank in respect of the early repayment of the loan will fall within the definition of “consideration” in section EW 31(7) as “consideration that has been paid ... by the person for or under the financial arrangement”. 4 “Consideration” is defined to exclude “non-contingent fees” and “non-integral fees”. The break fee will not be excluded as a “non-contingent fee” because the fee is not “for services provided for the taxpayer becoming a party to the financial arrangement and payable whether or not the financial arrangement proceeds” (emphasis added). The fee is payable to allow the taxpayer to cease being a party to the financial arrangement. The scope of these rulings excludes landlords who have adopted the IFRS financial reporting method under section EW 15D, so it is unnecessary to consider whether the break fee constitutes a non-integral fee. As part of the consideration paid by the borrower, the amount of the break fee will increase the overall negative figure that the BPA provides in this scenario. Deductibility of negative base price adjustment amount A negative BPA is expenditure incurred under the FA rules under section EW 31(4). Taxpayers who have previously returned income under a financial arrangement (such as lenders) are allowed an automatic deduction for the negative BPA expenditure under section DB 11 to the extent of that previously returned income. However, as landlords are generally borrowers who have not derived income from their loans, section DB 11 has no application in those circumstances. Negative BPA expenditure is “interest” for the purposes of sections DB 6 and DB 7 (see the definition of “interest” in section YA 1). In the case of a company (other than a qualifying company), the amount of the negative BPA will be automatically deductible under section DB 7. An individual taxpayer or a qualifying company will be able to deduct the amount of the negative BPA as interest under section DB 6, provided the general permission in section DA 1 is satisfied and none of the general limitations (excluding the capital limitation) apply. Section DB 6 specifically provides the capital limitation will not apply, so it is unnecessary to consider whether the amount is of a capital or revenue nature. The Commissioner’s view is that the general permission will be satisfied and the amount of the negative BPA will be deductible under section DB 6. The borrowed money was used to purchase a property from which rental income is derived. The BPA is being carried out at the time the rental property is sold and the deriving of rental income ceases. The negative BPA amount is deductible as interest as it has a sufficient relationship with the derivation of the rental income. Note that if the borrowing was used for a private or domestic purpose, a deduction would be denied under the private limitation in section DA 2(2). Alternative view – general permission not satisfied The Commissioner notes that some commentators have suggested that because the break fee is paid to allow the taxpayer to dispose of the property, and therefore to cease deriving assessable rental income, the break fee does not have a sufficient relationship with the derivation of assessable income and the general permission is not satisfied to the extent of the amount of the break fee. The Commissioner’s view is that the break fee amount is an indivisible part of the negative BPA amount produced by the application of the BPA formula. The BPA provides a net figure at the end of the financial arrangement. This net figure is treated as interest, and it is the deductibility of that interest net figure that must be considered. The individual amounts that go into the BPA formula are not considered separately to determine assessability or deductibility. 5 Relevance of post-cessation business cases It has also been suggested that relevant here is the line of reasoning in the post- cessation of business cases, such as Amalgamated Zinc (de Bavay’s) Ltd v FCT (1935) 54 CLR 295, Case U29 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,273 and Inglis v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,379. The post-cessation cases look at the deductibility of expenditure incurred after a business has ceased. These cases are concerned with how long after a business has ceased that expenditure may be claimed. However, under the present arrangement, the BPA is being performed at the same time as the rental property is sold and the deriving of rental income from it ceases. Therefore, the post-cessation cases are not relevant. Example At the beginning of year 1, B borrows $200,000 at a flat 10% per year fixed interest rate to purchase a rental property from which rental income is derived. The loan is interest only. At the end of year 2, B breaks the loan in order to sell the property. B repays the loan and pays an additional $10,000 break fee. B must calculate a BPA in relation to the loan as follows: consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted The consideration received by B is the original loan amount of $200,000. The consideration paid by B is the return of the principal, two instalments of interest at $20,000 each, and the break fee of $10,000: ($200,000 + $20,000 + $20,000 + $10,000) = $250,000. There is no income or amount remitted. The expenditure is the $20,000 interest incurred under the loan in year 1. Therefore, the BPA is: ($200,000 – $250,000) – $0 + $20,000 + $0 = –$50,000 + $20,000 = –$30,000 The negative BPA amount of $30,000 effectively represents the $20,000 interest expense for year 2 and the amount of the break fee. The negative BPA amount is expenditure incurred under the FA rules and is deemed to be interest. If B is a company, B will obtain an automatic deduction for the $30,000 in the year in which it is incurred under section DB 7. If B is a non-corporate or a qualifying company, the $30,000 will be deductible under section DB 6 and the general permission. The general permission is satisfied because the borrowed money was used to purchase the rental property from which assessable income was derived. 6 APPENDIX: LEGISLATION All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Section DA 1(1) and (2) states: Nexus with income (1) A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss, including an amount of depreciation loss, to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is— (a) incurred by them in deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income. General permission (2) Subsection (1) is called the general permission. Section DA 2(1) states: Capital limitation (1) A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a capital nature. This rule is called the capital limitation. Section DB 6(1) and (4) states: Deduction (1) A person is allowed a deduction for interest incurred. ... Link with subpart DA (4) This section overrides the capital limitation. The general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply. Section DB 7(1), (2), and (8) states: Deduction (1) A company is allowed a deduction for interest incurred. Exclusion: Qualifying company (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to a qualifying company. ... Link with subpart DA (8) This section supplements the general permission and overrides the capital limitation, the exempt income limitation, and the withholding tax limitation. The other general limitations still apply. 7 Section DB 11 states: DB 11 Negative base price adjustment Deduction (1) A person who has a negative base price adjustment under section EW 31(4) (Base price adjustment formula) is allowed a deduction for the expenditure to the extent to which it arises from assessable income, under section CC 3 (Financial arrangements), derived by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years. Link with subpart DA (2) This section supplements the general permission and overrides all the general limitations. Section EW 3(2) and (3) states: Money received for money provided (2) A financial arrangement is an arrangement under which a person receives money in consideration for that person, or another person, providing money to any person— (a) at a future time; or (b) on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event, whether or not the event occurs because notice is given or not given. Examples of money received for money provided (3) Without limiting subsection (2), each of the following is a financial arrangement: (a) a debt, including a debt that arises by law: (b) a debt instrument: (c) the deferral of the payment of some or all of the consideration for an absolute assignment of some or all of a person’s rights under another financial arrangement or under an excepted financial arrangement: (d) the deferral of the payment of some or all of the consideration for a legal defeasance releasing a person from some or all of their obligations under another financial arrangement or under an excepted financial arrangement. Section EW 29(3) states: Maturity (3) A party to a financial arrangement must calculate a base price adjustment as at the date on which the arrangement matures. Section EW 31 states: EW 31 Base price adjustment formula Calculation of base price adjustment (1) A person calculates a base price adjustment using the formula in subsection (5). When formula applies (2) The person calculates the base price adjustment for the income year in which section EW 29 applies to them. Positive base price adjustment (3) A base price adjustment, if positive, is income, under section CC 3 (Financial arrangements), derived by the person in the income year for which the calculation is made. However, it is not income to the extent to which it arises from expenditure incurred by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years and for which a deduction was denied in those income years. Negative base price adjustment (4) A base price adjustment, if negative, is expenditure incurred by the person in the income year for which the calculation is made.

INTEREST REPAYMENTS REQUIRED AS A RESULT OF THE EARLY REPAYMENT OF A FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT – DEDUCTIBILITY PUBLIC RULING – BR PUB 10/21 This is a public ruling made under s 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This ruling applies in respect of ss DA 1, DB 6, DB 7, DB 11 and EW 31. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is as follows: • A person places an amount of money on term deposit. • The term deposit is a financial arrangement subject to the financial arrangements rules. • The term deposit contract provides that the rate of interest payable will be reduced in the event of the withdrawal, in part or in full, of the principal sum before the contractual maturity date. • The depositor withdraws the whole or part of the term deposit before the contractual maturity date. • The application of the reduced rate of interest requires the repayment of interest already derived by the depositor or the set-off of interest owed against the principal sum ultimately repaid to the depositor. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the arrangement as follows: Full withdrawal of the term deposit Where the depositor withdraws the full amount of the term deposit before the contractual maturity date the following applies: • A base price adjustment is required. • The amount of repaid interest is included in the “consideration” element of the base price adjustment. • If the base price adjustment gives rise to a negative amount, that amount is expenditure incurred under the financial arrangements rules. • Expenditure incurred under the financial arrangement rules is deemed to be interest. • A deduction may be available under s DB 6 (Interest: not capital expenditure) or s DB 7 (Interest: most companies need no nexus with income). • An automatic deduction is allowed under s DB 11 to the extent the amount arises from assessable income derived by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years. 1 Partial withdrawal of the term deposit Where the depositor withdraws part of the amount of the term deposit before the contractual maturity date the following applies: • A base price adjustment is not required. • Depositors who are not cash basis persons, and cash basis persons who have elected to adopt a spreading method, must apply Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement when the term deposit is varied by the partial withdrawal. The repaid interest is included in the calculation under the determination and an adjustment is made in the year of variation. Cash basis persons • Depositors who are cash basis persons may deduct the repaid interest at the time it is incurred only if the general permission is satisfied. To satisfy the general permission there must be a sufficient relationship between the repayment of the interest and the earning of assessable income. The Commissioner considers the relationship between the repayment and the interest income earned under the term deposit is insufficient to satisfy s DA 1(1)(a). However, the Commissioner considers that a deduction for the repayment may be available under the general permission, if it can be shown that the expenditure was incurred in the course of carrying on a business for the purposes set out in s DA 1(1)(b). • If the amount of the repaid interest is not deductible at the time of repayment, it falls to be dealt with on maturity of the deposit through the base price adjustment. • The amount of repaid interest is included in both the “consideration” and “expenditure” elements of the base price adjustment. • If the base price adjustment gives rise to a positive amount, that amount is income derived. However, it is not income to the extent to which it arises from expenditure incurred under the financial arrangement in earlier income years and for which a deduction was denied. • Therefore, a positive base price adjustment amount in the final year of the term deposit will be reduced by the amount of interest repaid in the year of partial withdrawal. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This ruling will apply for a three year period beginning on 16 December 2010 and ending on 16 December 2013. This ruling is signed by me on 16 December 2010. Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 2 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING – BR PUB 10/21 This commentary is intended to help readers understand and apply the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 10/21 (“the Ruling”). The commentary is not a legally binding statement. This Ruling is a reissue of BR Pub 97/9, which expired on 31 March 2001. The expired ruling took the view that if a partial withdrawal of a term deposit was to pay a business expense or to apply the amount to derive other assessable income, then the amount of repaid interest was deductible under the general permission at the time of the repayment. After reconsidering this reissue, the Commissioner takes the view that there is not a sufficient relationship between the repayment of interest and any income to allow a deduction under s DA 1(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 at the time of the repayment. However, it is accepted that in some cases it may be deductible under s DA 1(1)(b). Legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Relevant legislative provisions are reproduced in the Appendix to this commentary. Summary 1. A depositor who withdraws funds early may have to repay a portion of the interest previously derived under the term deposit. The issue this ruling and commentary deal with is whether and when the repaid amount is deductible. 2. The fact a depositor may have to repay interest if they withdraw a deposit early does not mean interest they receive during the course of the deposit is not derived by the depositor. At the time of receipt or crediting of interest, the depositor has earned that interest and it is theirs to deal with as they wish. The fact a liability to repay some of that interest may arise later, if certain events occur, does not alter the fact derivation has occurred. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the taxation consequences of the repayment of the interest on the full or partial withdrawal of the term deposit amount. 3. The full withdrawal of a term deposit amount before the contractual maturity date will trigger a base price adjustment (BPA). Where the depositor is required to repay interest previously derived, the amount of repaid interest will be included in the “consideration” element of the BPA. This will generally give rise to a negative BPA amount. A negative BPA amount is expenditure incurred under the financial arrangements rules. Expenditure incurred under the financial arrangements rules is deemed to be interest under s YA 1. A deduction may be available under s DB 6 (Interest: not capital expenditure) or s DB 7 (Interest: most companies need no nexus with income). An automatic deduction is allowed under s DB 11 to the extent the amount arises from assessable income derived by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years. 4. If a depositor partially withdraws the deposit, there is no maturity of the financial arrangement. Therefore, no BPA is performed. In these circumstances, the deductibility of the repaid interest depends on whether the depositor is a cash basis person. 5. A depositor who is not a cash basis person, or is a cash basis person who has elected to adopt a spreading method, needs to apply Determination G25: Variations in the terms of a financial arrangement when the term deposit is varied by the partial withdrawal. The repaid interest will be brought into the Determination G25 calculation and an adjustment made in the year of variation. A BPA is done when the term deposit finally matures. 6. Where a cash basis person does not adopt a spreading method, expenditure incurred during the term of a financial arrangement will be deductible at the time it is incurred only if the general permission is satisfied. To satisfy the general permission there must be a sufficient relationship between the repayment of the interest and the earning of assessable income. The Commissioner considers the relationship between the repayment and the interest income earned under the term deposit is insufficient to satisfy s DA 1(1)(a). As the amount of the repaid interest is not deductible at the time of repayment, it falls to be dealt with through the BPA on maturity of the deposit. However, the Commissioner considers that where the expenditure has been incurred in carrying on a business, a deduction may be available under s DA 1(1)(b). Whether the repayment of interest satisfies the nexus test for a business will depend upon the facts of each case. 7. The amount of the repaid interest will be included in both the “consideration” and “expenditure” elements of the BPA calculation. The application of the BPA at maturity will generally result in a positive amount, which reflects the receipt of interest income in the final year of the term deposit. 8. A positive BPA amount is income, except to the extent to which it arises from expenditure incurred under the financial arrangement in earlier income years and for which a deduction was denied. Thus, the amount of interest income derived in the final year of the term deposit will be reduced by the amount of interest repaid in an earlier year. However, an amount of repaid interest for which a deduction was available will not reduce the amount of interest income derived in the final year of the term deposit. This ensures the depositor returns the correct amount of interest income over the full term of the deposit. Introduction 9. A term deposit contract will often include a clause that early withdrawal of the principal sum, in whole or in part, will result in a reduced rate of interest, calculated from the date of the initial deposit. In some cases, this means a depositor who withdraws funds early may have to repay a portion of the interest previously derived under the term deposit. 10. For example, assume that on 1 October 2010 a person invests $10,000 for 12 months at 7%, interest to be credited to the person’s bank account six-monthly. Interest of $350 is paid to the person on 31 March 2011. However, on 1 May 2011 the person decides to withdraw $5,000 from the term deposit. 11. The term deposit contract states that the rate of interest on the $5,000 to be withdrawn is reduced to 5% from the date of deposit, 1 October 2010. Therefore, the amount of interest the person should have received in 4 relation to the $5,000 withdrawn is $146 (seven months interest at 5%). The person has already been credited with $175 in respect of that $5,000. Therefore, the person owes the bank $29. 12. This ruling considers the tax consequences of the depositor’s repayment of the interest to the bank. 13. Note that, in practical terms, it is unlikely the depositor would physically repay the interest previously derived to the bank. The more common scenario would be for the bank to deduct the amount of interest owed to it from the amount of the principal to be repaid by it. For example, in the above example the person would receive $4,971 from the bank on early withdrawal (the $5,000 principal withdrawn less the $29 interest to be repaid). Whether such a set-off occurs or not, the transaction is treated for tax purposes as the repayment of the interest owed by the depositor and the return by the bank of the full amount of the principal withdrawn early. Application of the legislation 14. The tax consequences of the arrangement depend upon whether there is a full or partial withdrawal of the deposit early and whether the depositor repaying the interest is a cash basis person. These scenarios are considered below. However, before turning to these scenarios, it is necessary to consider the preliminary issue of whether the interest under the term deposit is fully derived when received or is only conditionally derived to the extent of the amount liable to repayment. Derivation of interest subject to repayment on early withdrawal 15. The fact a depositor may have to repay interest if the deposit is withdrawn early does not mean interest received during the course of the deposit is not derived by the depositor. At the time of receipt or crediting of interest, the depositor has earned that interest and it is theirs to deal with as they wish. The fact a liability to repay some of that interest may arise later, if certain events occur, does not alter the fact derivation has occurred. 16. Bowcock v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,062 supports this conclusion. Mr Bowcock was an employee who went on study leave but continued to receive his full salary. The terms of the employment bond provided that if he left his employment within four years of the end of his study leave, he would have to repay some of the amount he had received. He did leave within that time, so was required to repay salary in respect of two income years. He tried to deduct these sums from his income tax returns for the two years. In the High Court Mr Bowcock claimed he had never derived the amounts because they were contingent receipts not absolute receipts. 17. Vautier J rejected Mr Bowcock’s argument. He said (at page 61,069): Upon a consideration of the terms of the bond and the course pursued in this case, I am quite unable to come to the conclusion that the moneys which were paid to the objector during the two years in question can be said to have been received by him conditionally in the sense referred to in the judgments in the High Court in \[Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v FCT (1965) 114 CLR 314\]. Those moneys clearly in my view became the absolute property of the objector when they were paid. No conditions or stipulations were attached to those payments themselves. They were 5 clearly received and accepted as of right. Whether or not any liability arose in the future to repay any part of those moneys depended entirely on the course which the objector chose to take. 18. The Bowcock principle supports the view that if a taxpayer is liable to repay an amount previously received (for example, for breaching a bond or for the early withdrawal of funds), the repayment of the amount does not change the nature of the original derivation of the funds from absolute to conditional. 19. Vautier J distinguished the decision in Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v FCT (1965) 114 CLR 314 in Bowcock. Arthur Murray concerned whether income had been derived in the first instance, not the situation where income has been derived but may have to be repaid. It is the latter situation that was covered in Bowcock, where the court found that the possibility of repayment did not affect the derivation of the income. 20. In the present arrangement, the depositor has an absolute entitlement to the interest under the term deposit at the time it is received. If the depositor later chooses to withdraw funds before the contracted maturity date, the fact an obligation to repay some of the interest received may arise does not affect that entitlement. The interest has been derived and the nature of the derivation of the funds is not changed from absolute to conditional as a result of the repayment. 21. As the interest income is absolutely derived by the depositor, it is now necessary to consider the taxation consequences of the repayment of interest on the full or partial withdrawal of the term deposit amount. Full withdrawal of the term deposit amount 22. A term deposit is a financial arrangement under s EW 3. Therefore, the financial arrangements rules apply. When a term deposit is withdrawn in full, the financial arrangement has matured and a BPA is required under s EW 29. 23. Although many depositors are likely to be cash basis persons under the financial arrangements rules and not required to use a spreading method, they are still subject to the financial arrangements rules and must do a BPA if they withdraw the term deposit in full. 24. The formula for calculating a BPA is in s EW 31(5). The formula is: consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted where: consideration is all consideration that has been paid, and all consideration that is or will be payable, to the person for or under the financial arrangement, minus all consideration that has been paid, and all consideration that is or will be payable, by the person for or under the financial arrangement. Non- contingent and non-integral fees are ignored. income is income derived by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years. 6 expenditure is expenditure incurred by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years. amount remitted is an amount that is not included in the consideration paid or payable to the person because it has been remitted by the person or by law. 25. Where a depositor withdraws a term deposit in full before the contracted maturity date and the depositor is required to repay interest derived in a previous income year, the repaid interest will be included in the “consideration” element of the BPA. The result of the BPA calculation will depend on matters such as the time of receipt of the interest payments, the differential in interest rates and the time of the withdrawal of the term deposit amount. 26. Where the BPA calculation gives rise to a negative amount, s EW 31(4) provides that a negative BPA amount is expenditure incurred by a person in the year the calculation is made. Expenditure incurred under the financial arrangements rules is deemed to be interest. 27. A deduction may be available under s DB 6 (Interest: not capital expenditure) or s DB 7 (Interest: most companies need no nexus with income). Section DB 6 overrides the capital limitation and allows a deduction for interest where the general permission is satisfied. Where the requirements of s DB 7 are satisfied, a company is allowed a deduction for interest expenditure incurred whether or not the expenditure satisfies the general permission. Section DB 7 also overrides the capital limitation, the exempt income limitation and the withholding tax limitation. 28. Section DB 11 supplements the general permission and overrides all the general limitations. An automatic deduction is allowed for the negative BPA amount under s DB 11 to the extent that the amount arises from assessable income derived by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years. 29. Where the BPA calculation gives rise to a positive amount, s EW 31(3) provides that the amount is income derived by the person. A positive BPA amount may occur where the depositor derives interest income in the same year as the year in which the withdrawal and repayment of interest occurs. In these circumstances, the BPA calculation ensures that the positive BPA amount is reduced by the amount of the repaid interest. 30. Examples 1 and 2 illustrate the above points: Example 1 On 1 October 2010 Mary (a cash basis person) invests $10,000 for 12 months at 7%, with interest to be credited to her bank account six- monthly. Interest of $350 is paid to Mary on 31 March 2011. However, on 1 May 2011 Mary decides to withdraw the full amount of the term deposit. On the early withdrawal of the $10,000, the term deposit contract states that the rate of interest is reduced to 5% from the date of deposit, 1 October 2010. Therefore, the amount of interest Mary should have received in relation to the term deposit is $292 (seven months interest at 5%). As Mary has already been credited with $350 interest (for the first six months), she owes the bank $58. The bank sets off the amount of 7 interest owed against the amount of the principal to be repaid and Mary receives $9,942. Mary will have to apply the BPA formula to the term deposit in the 2012 income year as follows: consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted The consideration Mary received is the repayment of the principal amount of $10,000 and the interest received of $350. The consideration Mary paid is the original deposit of $10,000 and the repayment of interest of $58. The amount of income Mary derived in earlier income years is $350. There is no expenditure from earlier years. No amount is remitted. Therefore, the BPA is: ($10,350 – $10,058) – $350 + $0 + $0 = $292 – $350 = –$58 The negative BPA amount is expenditure incurred under the financial arrangements rules. Mary has derived income under the financial arrangement in previous income years ($350) and therefore the negative BPA amount of -$58 will be deductible to Mary in the income year ending 31 March 2012. Example 2 On 1 November 2010 Sally invests $10,000 for two years at 7%, with interest to be credited to her bank account six-monthly. Interest of $350 is paid to Sally on 30 April 2011, 30 October 2011 and 30 April 2012. However, on 30 June 2012 Sally decides to withdraw the full amount of the term deposit. Sally has a standard balance date. On the early withdrawal of the $10,000, the term deposit contract states that the rate of interest is reduced to 5% from the date of deposit, 1 November 2010. Therefore, the amount of interest Sally should have received in relation to the term deposit is $833 (20 months interest at 5%). Sally has already been credited with $1,050 interest, so she owes the bank $217. The bank sets off the amount of interest owed against the amount of the principal to be repaid and Sally receives $9,783. Sally will have to apply the BPA formula to the term deposit in the 2013 income year as follows: consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted The consideration Sally received is the repayment of the principal amount of $10,000 and the interest received of $1,050. The consideration Sally paid is the original deposit of $10,000 and the repayment of interest of $217. The amount of income Sally derived in earlier income years is $700. There is no expenditure from earlier years. No amount is remitted. Therefore, the BPA is: 8 ($11,050 – $10,217) – $700 + $0 + $0 = $833 – $700 = $133 The positive BPA amount is income derived for Sally. The $133 for the 2013 income year reflects the receipt by Sally of interest income of $350 on 30 April 2012 and the repayment of interest of $217. Partial withdrawal of term deposit amount 31. If a depositor only partially withdraws the deposit, there is no maturity of the financial arrangement. Therefore, no BPA is performed. In these circumstances, the deductibility of the repaid interest depends on whether the depositor is a cash basis person. 32. Note that this situation assumes the contract between the parties provides that the partial withdrawal of the deposit does not terminate the contract. If the withdrawal results in the existing term deposit contract being terminated and a new term deposit being entered into, a BPA will be required as discussed in paragraph 22 above. Non-cash basis person 33. A depositor who is a non-cash basis person needs to apply Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement when the term deposit is varied by the partial withdrawal. 34. The formula in Determination G25 is: a – b – c + d where: a is the sum of all amounts that would have been income derived by the person in respect of the financial arrangement from the date it was acquired or issued to the end of the income year, if the changes had been known as at the date the financial arrangement was acquired or issued b is the sum of all amounts that would have been expenditure incurred by the person in respect of the financial arrangement from the date it was acquired or issued to the end of the income year, if the changes had been known as at the date the financial arrangement was acquired or issued c is the sum of all amounts treated as income derived of the person in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired or issued to the end of the previous income year d is the sum of all amounts treated as expenditure incurred of the person in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired or issued to the end of the previous income year. 35. The repaid interest will be brought into the Determination G25 calculation and an adjustment made in the year of variation. When the formula in Determination G25 is calculated, a positive amount is deemed to be income, and a negative amount is deemed to be expenditure incurred. A BPA is done when the term deposit finally matures. 9 36. Example 3 illustrates this situation: Example 3 On 1 October 2010 Penny invests $10,000 for two years at 7%, with interest to be credited to her bank account six-monthly. She receives an interest payment of $350 on 31 March 2011. However, on 1 May 2011 Penny decides to withdraw $5,000 from the term deposit. The term deposit contract states that on an early withdrawal the rate of interest is reduced to 5% on the amount of principal withdrawn. The reduced rate applies from the date of the original deposit; in this case, 1 October 2010. Therefore, the amount of interest Penny should have received in relation to the $5,000 withdrawn is $146 (seven months interest at 5%). Penny has already been credited with $175 interest in relation to the $5,000, so she owes the bank $29. The bank sets off the amount of interest owed against the amount of the principal to be repaid, and Penny receives $4,971 on 1 May 2011. The balance of the principal remains in the term deposit and Penny receives interest payments of $175 on 30 September 2011 and 31 March 2012. On 30 September 2012, Penny receives $5,175, being the repayment of the remaining principal and the last interest payment. Penny is not a cash basis person and has a standard balance date. If she has adopted the straight-line method, the results are as follows: For the income year ending 31 March 2011, Penny has returned $350 of income. For the income year ending 31 March 2012, Penny must apply the formula in Determination G25: a – b – c + d Item a is $671. This amount is made up of $525 in respect of the $5,000 not withdrawn (being $5,000 at 7% per annum for the 18 month period from 1 October 2010 to 31 March 2012) and $146 in respect of the $5,000 withdrawn (being $5,000 at 5% per annum for the seven months from 1 October 2010 to 1 May 2011). Item b is nil, because if the changes had been known about at the start of the financial arrangement there would have been no expenditure. There would simply have been less income, which is taken into account in item a. Item c is $350. Item d is nil. Therefore, applying the Determination G25 formula, the adjustment in the 2012 income year is: $671 – $0 – $350 + $0 = $321 As the amount is positive, it is deemed to be income Penny derived for the year ending 31 March 2012. Essentially, the formula takes the $29 of repaid interest and deducts it from the income derived in the 2012 income year. For the income year ending 31 March 2013, Penny will have to perform a BPA by applying the following formula: consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted 10 The consideration Penny received is the $10,000 principal repaid and the interest payments of $875 (being $350 on 31 March 2011 and $175 on 30 September 2011, 31 March 2012 and 30 September 2012). The consideration Penny paid is the $10,000 principal invested and the $29 repaid interest. The amount of income Penny derived in earlier income years is $671 (being $350 in the 2011 income year and $321 in the 2012 income year). There is no expenditure incurred in earlier income years. No amount is remitted. Therefore, the BPA is: ($10,875 - $10,029) – $671 + $0 + $0 = $846 – $671 = $175 As the BPA is positive, it is income derived by Penny. This equates with the interest income received by Penny in the 2013 income year. There is no adjustment for the repaid interest, because it was taken into account in the Determination G25 calculation in the previous income year. Cash basis person 37. A person is a cash basis person if either: • the income and expenditure under all the person’s financial arrangements for the income year does not exceed $100,000, or • the value of all the person’s financial arrangements on every day of the income year does not exceed $1 million, and • the difference between the accrual treatment and the cash treatment of all the person’s financial arrangements does not exceed $40,000 for the income year. 38. A cash basis person is not required to adopt a spreading method, although they may choose to do so. 39. If a depositor is a cash basis person and adopts a spreading method, they need to apply Determination G25 when the term deposit is varied by the partial withdrawal. This is the same as for a non-cash basis person and is covered in paragraphs 33 to 35 above. 40. Where a cash basis person does not adopt a spreading method, expenditure incurred during the term of a financial arrangement will be deductible when it is incurred if the general permission is satisfied. In the present case, this means the repaid interest on a partial withdrawal would be deductible at the time of the withdrawal, rather than taken into account in the BPA on the eventual maturity of the term deposit. 41. However, to be deductible at the time of the withdrawal, the repaid interest must satisfy the general permission and none of the general limitations must apply. 11 42. The general permission in s DA 1 provides that a person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is incurred by the person: • in deriving their assessable income or excluded income or both, or • in the course of carrying on a business for the purposes of deriving their assessable income or excluded income or both. 43. The leading New Zealand cases on the deductibility of expenditure are the Court of Appeal decisions in CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 and Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271. These cases establish that there must be a sufficient nexus between the expenditure incurred and the income earning process in order for the expenditure to be deductible. 44. In delivering the judgment of the court in Banks, Richardson J made the following comments (at pages 61,241 and 61,242): For reasons such as these it seems clear that the application of the first limb must involve an amalgam of considerations. In the Australian cases ... there has been considerable stress on the character of an outgoing in the sense of its being incidental and relevant to the gaining or producing of the assessable income. Statements to that effect emphasise the relationship that must exist between the advantage gained or sought to be gained by the expenditure and the income earning process. They do not, and cannot, specify in concrete terms the kind and degree of connection between the expenditure and the gaining or producing of assessable income required in individual cases for the expenditure to qualify for deduction. ... Putting it positively, Dixon J. said in Amalgamated Zinc (de Bavay’s) Ltd v FC of T (1935) 54 CLR 295, at p. 309 and we respectfully agree: ‘The expression “in gaining or producing” has the force of “in the course of gaining or producing” and looks rather to the scope of the operations or activities and the relevance thereto of the expenditure than to purpose in itself.’ It then becomes a matter of degree, and so a question of fact, to determine whether there is a sufficient relationship between the expenditure and what it provided, or sought to provide, on the one hand, and the income earning process, on the other, to fall within the words of the section. 45. In Buckley & Young, Richardson J stated (at page 61,274): It is not necessary for the purpose of this case to refer in any detail to the principles of deductibility under those provisions. There are two features of sec. 111 \[of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954\] which are of particular importance in this case. The first is that a deduction is available only where the expenditure has the necessary relationship both with the taxpayer concerned and with the gaining or producing of his assessable income or with the carrying on of a business for that purpose. The heart of the inquiry is the identification of the relationship between the advantage gained or sought to be gained by the expenditure and the income earning process. That in turn requires determining the true character of the payment. It then becomes a matter of degree and so a question of fact to determine whether there is a sufficient relationship between the expenditure and what it provided or sought to provide on the one hand, and the income earning process on the other, to fall within the words of the section (C of IR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236, 61,242). The second feature of sec. 111 is that the statutory language contained in the phrase ‘to the extent to which’ expressly contemplates apportionment. 46. In relation to the deductibility of expenditure incurred in carrying on a business, in Cox v CIR (1992) 14 NZTC 9,164, Williams J in the High Court stated (at p 9,168): 12 While in jurisdictional terms para (b) is the narrower of the two limbs, it is generally recognised that for business taxpayers it facilitates deductibility in circumstances where a deduction might otherwise not be available under the first limb. This is so because it has been acknowledged in the authorities that the conduct of a business may require expenditures to be made which cannot be directly linked to the derivation of assessable income in some positive way, but which are made to, say, keep the enterprise on foot or to reduce expenditure: see Europa Oil (supra) at pp 61,196 and 61,197. The inclusion of the word "necessarily" in para (b) might mean that the paragraph is intended to be read in a restrictive sense, for example, disallowing deductions unless they are unavoidable or logically necessary for a business. However, the authorities have taken a more pragmatic and commercially realistic approach to business expenditures. Thus it is established by the cases that when compared to the older test laid down in s 111 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954, s 104 has set a much wider and more commercially realistic test of deductibility of expenditure: de Pelichet McLeod & Co Ltd v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,216, 61,219; (1982) 5 TRNZ 622, 626. Moreover, whether an expenditure can be said to be necessarily incurred in the course of carrying on a business must be decided in each case on the facts and by way of a judgment based on common sense and business realities: Europa Oil (NZ) Ltd (supra) at p 61,196 and at p 61,197. 47. The Commissioner considers these decisions remain relevant to the interpretation of s DA 1(1). Earlier provisions that correspond to s DA 1(1)(b) referred to “expenditure necessarily incurred in carrying on a business”. Section DA 1 preserves that requirement for nexus, notwithstanding that it has removed the word “necessarily”. It is the Commissioner’s considered view that the word “necessarily” did no more than indicate a requirement that there be a sufficient degree of connection between the expenditure and the business. 48. Applying the principles from these cases requires asking whether there is a sufficient relationship between the repayment of the interest and the earning of assessable income. The Commissioner considers there is not a sufficient relationship between the repayment and the interest income earned under the term deposit under s DA 1(1)(a). The interest income is earned as a result of lending money. The advantage gained by the repayment is the ability to withdraw early from the term deposit contract, and therefore to cease earning the interest income. The repayment is not a cost of deriving the interest income; it is a cost of ceasing to derive the income. The repayment is a cost to the depositor of not fulfilling the terms of the contract between the bank and the depositor. 49. The repayment of the interest arises because of the depositor’s decision to withdraw a portion of their funds before the maturity date. It is incurred solely because the depositor chooses to make a partial withdrawal; it is not incidental or relevant to the deriving of the earlier income. 50. The decision of the Commonwealth Taxation Board of Review in Case 50 ((1958) 8 C.T.B.R. (N.S.) 250) supports this approach. In Case 50 the taxpayer was granted leave from his employment to attend university lectures, but he continued to receive his salary for the times he was absent from work, subject to certain conditions. The taxpayer breached those conditions when he later resigned to accept a higher-paid position, so he had to repay some of the salary he had received. The taxpayer claimed a deduction for the amount of salary repaid. 51. The Board of Review denied the deduction. The Board concluded: 7. The liability on the taxpayer to repay the £412 arose directly from his failure to observe the conditions he had agreed to under which he had been paid salary in respect of periods of leave of absence granted to him for the purpose of attending lectures and examinations set down for the course of study undertaken by him. 13 The outgoing was not incurred by the taxpayer in the course of gaining or producing his assessable income.... The outgoing was not incidental or relevant to the gaining or producing of his assessable income but was incurred solely because of his failure to observe the conditions laid down when the leave was granted to him. 52. Where the amount of the repaid interest is not deductible at the time of repayment, it falls to be dealt with through the BPA on maturity of the deposit. 53. However, the Commissioner considers that a deduction may be available where the repayment of the interest was incurred in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income, or excluded income or a combination of both assessable and excluded income: s DA 1(1)(b). The courts take a pragmatic and commercially realistic approach to business expenditure. Whether there is a sufficient nexus under s DA 1(1)(b) will depend upon the facts of each case. In this situation, s EW 31(3) and the BPA formula ensure that no double deduction can occur. 54. The amount of the repaid interest will be included in both the “consideration” and “expenditure” elements of the BPA calculation. Where a depositor partially withdraws a term deposit early and is required to repay interest derived in a previous income year, the application of the BPA at maturity will generally result in a positive amount. This reflects the receipt of interest income in the final year of the term deposit. Section EW 31(3) provides that a positive BPA amount is income derived by a person in the year the calculation is made. However, it is not income to the extent to which it arises from expenditure incurred under the financial arrangement in earlier income years and for which a deduction was denied. Thus, the amount of interest income derived in the final year of the term deposit will be reduced by the amount of interest repaid in an earlier year. However, an amount of repaid interest for which a deduction was available (under s DA 1(1)(b)) will not reduce the amount of interest income derived in the final year of the term deposit. This ensures the depositor returns the correct amount of interest income over the full term of the deposit. 55. Example 4 illustrates this for a non-business cash basis holder: Example 4 On 1 October 2010 Penny invests $10,000 for two years at 7%, with interest to be credited to her bank account six-monthly. She receives an interest payment of $350 on 31 March 2011. However, on 1 May 2011 Penny decides to withdraw $5,000 from the term deposit. The term deposit contract states that on an early withdrawal the rate of interest is reduced to 5% on the amount of principal withdrawn. The reduced rate applies from the date of the original deposit; in this case, 1 October 2010. Therefore, the amount of interest Penny should have received in relation to the $5,000 withdrawn is $146 (seven months interest at 5%). Penny has already been credited with $175 interest in relation to the $5,000, so she owes the bank $29. The bank sets off the amount of interest owed against the amount of the principal to be repaid, and Penny receives $4,971 on 1 May 2011. The balance of the principal remains in the term deposit and Penny receives interest payments of $175 on 30 September 2011 and 31 March 14 2012. On 30 September 2012, Penny receives $5,175, being the repayment of the remaining principal and the last interest payment. These are the same facts as in Example 3 above, except that in the current example Penny is a cash basis person who chooses not to adopt a spreading method. Therefore, in this example, the results are as follows: For the income year ending 31 March 2011, Penny will have returned income of $350. For the income year ending 31 March 2012, Penny will have returned income of $350 (being the interest payments of $175 on 30 September 2011 and 31 March 2012). She will not be able to claim a deduction for the $29 repaid interest on 1 May 2011. For the income year ending 31 March 2013, Penny will have to perform a BPA by applying the following formula: consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted The consideration Penny received is the $10,000 principal repaid and the interest payments of $875 (being $350 on 31 March 2011, and $175 on 30 September 2011, 31 March 2012 and 30 September 2012). The consideration Penny paid is the $10,000 principal invested and the $29 repaid interest. The amount of income derived in earlier income years is $700 (being $350 in each of the 2011 and 2012 income years). The expenditure incurred in earlier income years is $29, being the amount of repaid interest. There is no amount remitted. Therefore, the BPA is: ($10,875 - $10,029) – $700 + $29 + $0 = $846 – $700 + $29 = $175 As the BPA is positive, it is income Penny derived. However, it is not income to the extent to which it arises from expenditure incurred in earlier years and for which a deduction was denied. A deduction was denied for the $29 repaid interest in the 2012 income year, so the positive BPA is reduced by that amount. Therefore, in the 2013 income year, Penny derives income of $146. This amount equates to the interest payment of $175 received on 30 September 2012, reduced by the interest repaid on 1 May 2011. 15 Appendix – Legislation 56. Section DA 1(1) and (2) reads: Nexus with income (1) A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss, including an amount of depreciation loss, to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is— (a) incurred by them in deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income. General permission (2) Subsection (1) is called the general permission. 57.

Exclusion: Qualifying company (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to a qualifying company. ... Link with subpart DA (8) This section supplements the general permission and overrides the capital limitation, the exempt income limitation, and the withholding tax limitation. The other general limitations still apply. 60. Section DB 11 reads: DB 11 Negative base price adjustment Deduction (1) A person who has a negative base price adjustment under section EW 31(4) (Base price adjustment formula) is allowed a deduction for the expenditure to the extent to which it arises from assessable income, under section CC 3 16 (Financial arrangements), derived by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years. Link with subpart DA (2) This section supplements the general permission and overrides all the general limitations. 61. Section EW 3(2) and (3) reads: Money received for money provided (2) A financial arrangement is an arrangement under which a person receives money in consideration for that person, or another person, providing money to any person— (a) at a future time; or (b) on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event, whether or not the event occurs because notice is given or not given. Examples of money received for money provided (3) Without limiting subsection (2), each of the following is a financial arrangement— (a) a debt, including a debt that arises by law: (b) a debt instrument: (c) the deferral of the payment of some or all of the consideration for an absolute assignment of some or all of a person’s rights under another financial arrangement or under an excepted financial arrangement: (d) the deferral of the payment of some or all of the consideration for a legal defeasance releasing a person from some or all of their obligations under another financial arrangement or under an excepted financial arrangement. 62. Section EW 29(3) reads: Maturity (3) A party to a financial arrangement must calculate a base price adjustment as at the date on which the arrangement matures. 63.

When formula applies (2) The person calculates the base price adjustment for the income year in which section EW 29 applies to them. Positive base price adjustment (3) A base price adjustment, if positive, is income, under section CC 3 (Financial arrangements), derived by the person in the income year for which the calculation is made. However, it is not income to the extent to which it arises from expenditure incurred by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years and for which a deduction was denied in those income years. Negative base price adjustment (4) A base price adjustment, if negative, is expenditure incurred by the person in the income year for which the calculation is made. The person is allowed a deduction for the expenditure under section DB 11 (Negative base price adjustment). Formula (5) The formula is— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted Definition of items in formula (6) The items in the formula are defined in subsections (7) to (11). 17 Consideration (7) Consideration is all consideration that has been paid, and all consideration that is or will be payable, to the person for or under the financial arrangement, minus all consideration that has been paid, and all consideration that is or will be payable, by the person for or under the financial arrangement. For the purposes of this subsection, the following are ignored: (a) non-contingent fees, if the relevant method is not the IFRS financial reporting method in section EW 15D: (b) non-integral fees, if the relevant method is the IFRS financial reporting method in section EW 15D.

Section EW 54 reads: EW 54 Meaning of cash basis person Who is cash basis person (1) A person is a cash basis person for an income year if— (a) 1 of the following applies in the person’s case for the income year: (i) section EW 57(1); or (ii) section EW 57(2); and (b) section EW 57(3) applies in the person's case for the income year. Persons excluded by Commissioner (2) A person may be excluded under section EW 59 from being a cash basis person for a class of financial arrangements. 65. Section EW 55 reads: EW 55 Effect of being cash basis person Use of spreading method (1) A cash basis person is not required to apply any of the spreading methods to any of their financial arrangements, but may choose to do so under section EW 61.

Deferral threshold (3) For the purposes of section EW 54(1)(b), this subsection applies if the result of applying the formula in subsection (4) to each financial arrangement to which the person is a party at the end of the income year and adding the outcomes together is $40,000 or less. Formula (4) The formula is— (accrual income – cash basis income) + (cash basis expenditure – accrual expenditure) Definition of items in formula (5) The items in the formula are defined in subsections (6) to (9). Accrual income (6) Accrual income is the amount that would have been income derived by the person under the financial arrangement if the person had been required to use a spreading method in the period starting on the date on which they became a party to the arrangement and ending on the last day of the income year for which the calculation is made. It is calculated using 1 of the following methods, as chosen by the person: (a) the yield to maturity method, whether or not the person may use it, or has chosen to use it, for their financial arrangement; or (b) the straight-line method, whether or not the person may use it, or has chosen to use it, for their financial arrangement; or (c) an alternative method approved by the Commissioner. Cash basis income (7) Cash basis income is the amount that would have been income derived by the person under the financial arrangement if the person had been a cash basis person in the period starting on the date on which they became a party to the arrangement and ending on the last day of the income year for which the calculation is made. Cash basis expenditure (8) Cash basis expenditure is the amount that would have been expenditure incurred by the person under the financial arrangement if the person had been a cash basis person in the period starting on the date on which they became a party to the arrangement and ending on the last day of the income year for which the calculation is made. Accrual expenditure (9) Accrual expenditure is the amount that would have been expenditure incurred under the financial arrangement if the person had been required to use a spreading method in the period starting on the date on which they became a party to the arrangement and ending on the last day of the income year for which the calculation is made. It is calculated using 1 of the following methods, as chosen by the person: 19 20 (a) the yield to maturity method, whether or not the person may use it, or has chosen to use it, for their financial arrangement; or (b) the straight-line method, whether or not the person may use it, or has chosen to use it, for their financial arrangement; or (c) an alternative method approved by the Commissioner. Increase in specified sums (10) The Governor-General may make an Order in Council increasing a sum specified in any of subsections (1) to (3). 67. In s YA 1, the definitions of “interest”, “maturity”, “non-contingent fee”, and “non-integral fee” read: interest,— ... (c) in sections DB 6 (Interest: not capital expenditure), DB 7 (Interest: most companies need no nexus with income), and DB 8 (Interest: money borrowed to acquire shares in group companies),— (i) includes expenditure incurred under the financial arrangements rules or the old financial arrangements rules ... maturity,— (a) in the financial arrangements rules, means,— (i) for an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services or an option, the date on which the agreement or option ends: (ii) for any other financial arrangement, the date on which the last payment contingent on the financial arrangement is made: ... non-contingent fee means a fee that— (a) is for services provided for a person becoming a party to a financial arrangement; and (b) is payable whether or not the financial arrangement proceeds non-integral fee means a fee or transaction cost that, for the purposes of financial reporting under IFRSs, is not an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial arrangement

DEDUCTIBILITY OF BREAK FEE PAID BY A LANDLORD TO EXIT EARLY FROM A FIXED INTEREST RATE LOAN PUBLIC RULING – BR PUB 12/01 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections DA 1, DB 6, DB 7, and EW 31 and the definition of ―interest‖ in section YA 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is where a person has entered into a fixed interest rate loan and the money has been used to acquire a property from which rental income is derived or to refinance another loan used for that purpose. The person subsequently pays a break fee to the lender to repay in full and terminate that loan earlier than its agreed repayment date. It does not matter whether the loan is replaced by further borrowing from either the same or a different lender. This Ruling will not apply where the loan is not used solely for the deriving of rental income, or where the loan is part of or connected with one or more other financial arrangements between the lender and the borrower. This Ruling will also not apply if the taxpayer has adopted the IFRS financial reporting method in section EW 15D or section EW 15G. How the Taxation Law apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the arrangement as follows:  A base price adjustment will be required.  The amount of any break fee will be included in the ―consideration‖ element of the base price adjustment formula for a borrower and will increase the overall negative figure that the base price adjustment provides.  The negative amount under the base price adjustment will be expenditure incurred under the financial arrangements rules and will be interest.  A company (other than a qualifying company or a look through company) is entitled to a deduction for the negative base price adjustment amount as interest under section DB 7.  Other taxpayers, including qualifying companies and look through companies, are entitled to a deduction under section DB 6 and the general permission in section DA 1. 2 The period or tax year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on the first day of the 2012/13 income year.

DEDUCTIBILITY OF BREAK FEE PAID BY A LANDLORD TO VARY THE INTEREST RATE OF AN EXISTING FIXED INTEREST RATE LOAN PUBLIC RULING – BR PUB 12/02 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This ruling applies in respect of sections DA 1, DB 6, DB 7, and EW 31 and the definition of ―interest‖ in section YA 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is where a person has entered into a fixed interest rate loan and the money has been used to acquire a property from which rental income is derived or to refinance another loan used for that purpose. The person then subsequently pays a break fee to the lender for a variation of that loan to adjust the interest rate. This Ruling will not apply where the loan is not used solely for the deriving of rental income, or where the loan is part of or connected with one or more other financial arrangements between the lender and the borrower. This Ruling will also not apply if the taxpayer has adopted the IFRS financial reporting method in section EW 15D or section EW 15G. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the arrangement as follows:  No base price adjustment will be required.  Taxpayers who are not cash basis persons, and cash basis persons who have chosen to adopt a spreading method, will be required to apply Determination G25 in relation to the variation to the terms of the loan. The amount of the break fee will be included in the calculation under the determination. This means an adjustment will be made in the year of variation and the deduction of the break fee will effectively be spread over the term of the loan.  Cash basis persons will be able to deduct the amount of the break fee when it is incurred under the general permission in section DA 1. 4 The period or tax year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on the first day of the 2012/13 income year.

Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 7 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 12/01, BR PUB 12/02 AND BR PUB 12/03 This commentary is not a legally binding statement. The commentary is intended to help readers understand and apply the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 12/01, Public Ruling BR Pub 12/02 and Public Ruling BR Pub 12/03 (―the Rulings‖). Legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Relevant legislative provisions are reproduced in the Appendix to this commentary. Background 1. The Rulings deal with the deductibility of fees charged by banks to permit landlords to repay a fixed interest rate loan early or to vary the existing terms of such a loan. These fees are variously referred to by terms such as ―early repayment fees‖, ―early repayment adjustment charge‖, ―early exit fees‖ or ―mortgage break fees‖. In these Rulings, the term ―break fee‖ is used to refer to all such charges. 2. The amount of the fee and the circumstances that trigger the charging of the fee vary from lender to lender. The fee is generally seen as compensation for the loss the lender may have suffered if their current interest rate for a similar loan for a fixed interest rate period closest to the borrower’s unexpired fixed interest period is lower than the fixed interest rate applying to the borrower’s loan. 3. A break fee is charged in two primary scenarios:  the loan is repaid early (whether replaced by further borrowing from the same or another financial institution or not);  the interest rate of the loan is simply renegotiated during the term of the loan and the existing loan continues. 4. It may be that the loan is repaid early because the rental property is sold and the landlord ceases to derive assessable income from the property. 5. BR Pub 12/01, BR Pub 12/02 and BR Pub 12/03 are re-issues of BR Pub 09/09, BR Pub 09/10 and BR Pub 10/20 respectively, which expired on the last day of the 2011/12 income year. The Rulings are consistent with the conclusions reached in BR Pub 09/09, BR Pub 09/10 and BR Pub 10/20. The Rulings and the commentary required minor adjustments for consistency of wording and were also updated due to legislative amendments. Those amendments do not affect the conclusions. Application of the Legislation 6. The application of the legislation depends on whether the loan is repaid in full and terminated, or the loan remains in existence and there is simply a variation of the interest rate. 8 Loan repaid in full 7. A fixed interest rate loan is a financial arrangement pursuant to section EW 3. The financial arrangements rules (―FA rules‖) will therefore apply. When a loan is repaid in full, a base price adjustment (―BPA‖) is required under section EW 29. 8. Although many landlords are likely to be cash basis persons under the FA rules and not required to use a spreading method, they are still subject to the FA rules and will be required to do a BPA if the loan is repaid in full. 9. The formula for calculating a BPA is in section EW 31(5). The formula for a borrower is: consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted 10. A break fee charged by a bank in respect of the early repayment of the loan will fall within the definition of ―consideration‖ in section EW 31(7) as ―consideration that has been paid ... by the person for or under the financial arrangement‖. The break fee will not be ignored as a ―non-contingent fee‖ because the fee is not ―for services provided for the taxpayer becoming a party to the financial arrangement and payable whether or not the financial arrangement proceeds‖. The fee is payable to allow the taxpayer to cease being a party to the financial arrangement. As the scope of these rulings excludes landlords who have adopted the International Financial Reporting Standard (―IFRS‖) financial reporting method under section EW 15D or section EW 15G, it is unnecessary to consider whether the break fee constitutes a non-integral fee. 11. As part of the consideration paid by a borrower, the amount of the break fee will increase the overall negative figure that the BPA provides in this scenario (see Example 1 below). 12. A negative BPA is expenditure incurred under the FA rules pursuant to section EW 31(4) and, in accordance with that section, is deductible pursuant to section DB 6 or DB 7. 13. Negative BPA expenditure is ―interest‖ for the purposes of sections DB 6 and DB 7 (see the definition of ―interest‖ in section YA 1). A non-corporate taxpayer or qualifying company or look-through company will be able to deduct the amount of the negative BPA as interest under section DB 6, provided the general permission in section DA 1 is satisfied and none of the general limitations (excluding the capital limitation) apply. Section DB 6 specifically provides that the capital limitation will not apply, so it is unnecessary to consider whether the amount is of a capital or revenue nature. 14. Where the borrowed money was used to purchase property from which rental income is derived, the Commissioner’s view is that the general permission will be satisfied and the amount of the negative BPA will be deductible under section DB 6. 15. In the case of a company (other than a qualifying company), the amount of the negative BPA will be deductible under section DB 7 without any requirement to consider the general permission. It is noted that a 9 ―company‖ as defined in section YA 1 does not include a look-through company for these purposes. 16. The Commissioner notes that some commentators have suggested section DB 5 may have application when the loan amount is refinanced. Section DB 5 provides a deduction for expenditure incurred in borrowing money used as capital in deriving income. The Commissioner’s view is that section DB 5 has no application where the FA rules apply. The amount of the break fee is dealt with under the BPA on repayment of the original loan, as set out above. This will be the case whether or not the amount of the loan is refinanced. Interest rate varied 17. Instead of repaying a loan in full and then refinancing with a new loan, a borrower may negotiate with their lender to vary the rate of interest on an existing loan. This is sometimes referred to as an ―interest rate switch‖. A break fee will often be charged in these circumstances. 18. Where the renegotiation of the interest rate is simply a variation of the loan and that same loan continues in existence, a BPA is not required. In these circumstances, the deductibility of the break fee depends on whether or not the taxpayer is a cash basis person. Note that if the change in the interest rate is effected by way of the existing loan being discharged and a new loan agreement being entered into, a BPA will be required as discussed above. 19. A taxpayer who is not a cash basis person will have been required to adopt a spreading method in relation to the loan under the FA rules. As the loan is a fixed interest rate loan at the time of the variation, it will not be a variable rate financial arrangement (as defined in Determination G25: Variations in the terms of a financial arrangement). Therefore, the taxpayer will need to apply Determination G25 when the loan is varied, rather than Determination G26: Variable rate financial arrangements. The break fee will be brought into the Determination G25 calculation. This means an adjustment is made in the year of variation and the deduction of the break fee is effectively spread over the term of the loan (see Example 2 below). 20. A cash basis person is not required to adopt a spreading method, although they may choose to do so. A person will be a cash basis person if:  the income and expenditure under all the person’s financial arrangements for the income year does not exceed $100,000, or  the value of all the person’s financial arrangements on every day of the income year does not exceed $1 million. 21. In addition, the difference between the accrual treatment and the cash treatment of all the person’s financial arrangements cannot exceed $40,000 for the income year. Where a significant break fee is paid, it is possible that these thresholds may be breached and a person may cease to be a cash basis person. In those circumstances the treatment of the break fee set out above for a non-cash basis person will apply. 10 22. Note that as a result of the changes made by the Taxation (Business Tax Measures) Act 2009 with effect from the 2009/10 income year a non-natural person may be a cash basis person. 23. Where a cash basis person does not adopt a spreading method, the deductibility of the break fee is determined outside the FA rules. 24. The break fee will be incurred whether it is actually paid or simply added to the balance of the loan: King v CIR (1973) 1 NZTC 61,107. 25. The break fee will be deductible if it satisfies the general permission and none of the general limitations apply. Where the borrowed money was used to purchase property from which rental income is derived, the Commissioner’s view is that the general permission will be satisfied. Note that if the borrowing was used for a private or domestic purpose, a deduction would be denied under the private limitation in section DA 2(2). 26. Note that section DB 5 will also have no application in these circumstances. Where all that occurs is a variation of the interest rate applicable to a loan, the break fee cannot be said to have been incurred in borrowing money. Rental property sold 27. The Commissioner’s view is the same analysis applies when the loan is repaid in full and terminated regardless of whether the rental property is sold and the landlord ceases to derive assessable income from the property. 28. The BPA is carried out at the time the rental property is sold and the deriving of rental income ceases. The negative BPA amount is deductible as interest as it has a sufficient relationship with the derivation of rental income. Alternative view – general permission not satisfied 29. The Commissioner notes that some commentators have suggested that because the break fee is paid to allow the taxpayer to dispose of the property, and therefore to cease deriving assessable rental income, the break fee does not have a sufficient relationship with the derivation of assessable income and the general permission is not satisfied to the extent of the amount of the break fee. The Commissioner’s view is that the break fee amount is an indivisible part of the negative BPA amount produced by the application of the BPA formula. The BPA provides a net figure at the end of the financial arrangement. This net figure is treated as interest, and it is the deductibility of that interest net figure that must be considered. The individual amounts that go into the BPA formula are not considered separately to determine assessability or deductibility. Relevance of post-cessation business cases 30. It has also been suggested that relevant here is the line of reasoning in the post-cessation of business cases, such as Amalgamated Zinc (de Bavay’s) Ltd v FCT (1935) 54 CLR 295, Case U29 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,273 and Inglis v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,379. 31. The post-cessation cases look at the deductibility of expenditure incurred after a business has ceased. These cases are concerned with how long after 11 a business has ceased that expenditure may be claimed. However, under the present arrangement, the BPA is being performed at the same time as the rental property is sold and the deriving of rental income from it ceases. Therefore, the post-cessation cases are not relevant. Examples 32. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Example 1 – Loan repaid in full 33. At the beginning of year 1, B borrows $200,000 at a flat 10% per annum fixed interest rate to purchase a rental property from which rental income is derived. The loan is interest only. At the end of year 2, B breaks the loan in order to refinance at a lower interest rate with another bank. B repays the loan and pays an additional $10,000 break fee. 34. B will have to calculate a BPA in relation to the loan as follows:  consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted 35. The consideration received by B is the original loan amount of $200,000. The consideration paid by B is the return of the principal, two instalments of interest at $20,000 each, and the break fee of $10,000, or $250,000:  ($200,000 + $20,000 + $20,000 + $10,000). 36. There is no income amount or amount remitted. The expenditure amount is the $20,000 interest incurred under the loan in year 1. 37. The BPA is thus:  ($200,000 – $250,000) – $0 + $20,000 + $0 = –$50,000 + $20,000 = –$30,000 38. The negative BPA amount of $30,000 represents the $20,000 interest expense for year 2 and the amount of the break fee. 39. The negative BPA amount is expenditure incurred under the FA rules and is deemed to be interest. It will be deductible to B in the year in which it is incurred under section DB 7 (if B is a company) or section DB 6 and the general permission (if B is a non-corporate or qualifying company). 12 Example 2 – Interest rate varied 40. A and B are the shareholders in S Ltd. S Ltd owns two residential rental properties. S Ltd borrows $100,000 for three years. Interest is fixed at 10% payable annually in arrears. S Ltd is not a cash basis person. Assuming a straight-line spreading method, the total annual expenditure incurred under the FA rules would be:  ($100,000 + $30,000 – $100,000)/3 = $30,000/3 = $10,000 per annum 41. In year 2 the loan is renegotiated to an 8% interest rate. A break fee of $2,500 is charged. The revised annual finance charges are:  ($100,000 + $26,000 + $2,500 – $100,000)/3 = $28,500/3 = $9,500 pa 42. Determination G25 will apply. The formula is:  a – b – c + d where  a is the sum of all amounts that would have been income derived by the person in respect of the financial arrangement from the date it was acquired or issued to the end of the income year, if the changes had been known as at the date the financial arrangement was acquired or issued;  b is the sum of all amounts that would have been expenditure incurred by the person in respect of the financial arrangement from the date it was acquired or issued to the end of the income year, if the changes had been known as at the date the financial arrangement was acquired or issued;  c is the sum of all amounts treated as income derived of the person in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired or issued to the end of the previous income year; and  d is the sum of all amounts treated as expenditure incurred of the person in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired or issued to the end of the previous income year. 43. Applying the Determination G25 formula, the adjustment in year 2 is:  $0 – $19,000 – $0 + $10,000 = –$9,000 44. This gives total expenditure for years 1 and 2 of $19,000 ($10,000 + $9,000), the equivalent position by the end of year 2 had the revised annual expenditure of $9,500 been claimed from the outset of the financial arrangement. This means the deduction for the break fee is effectively spread over the term of the loan. 13 Example 3 – Rental property sold 45. At the beginning of year 1, B borrows $200,000 at a flat 10% per year fixed interest rate to purchase a rental property from which rental income is derived. The loan is interest only. At the end of year 2, B breaks the loan in order to sell the property. B repays the loan and pays an additional $10,000 break fee. 46. B must calculate a BPA in relation to the loan as follows:  consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted 47. The consideration received by B is the original loan amount of $200,000. The consideration paid by B is the return of the principal, two instalments of interest at $20,000 each, and the break fee of $10,000:  ($200,000 + $20,000 + $20,000 + $10,000) = $250,000. 48. There is no income or amount remitted. The expenditure is the $20,000 interest incurred under the loan in year 1. 49. Therefore, the BPA is:  ($200,000 – $250,000) – $0 + $20,000 + $0 = –$50,000 + $20,000 = –$30,000 50. The negative BPA amount of $30,000 effectively represents the $20,000 interest expense for year 2 and the amount of the break fee. 51. The negative BPA amount is expenditure incurred under the FA rules and is deemed to be interest. If B is a company (other than a qualifying company or a look through company), B will obtain a deduction for the $30,000 in the year in which it is incurred under section DB 7. If B is a non-corporate, a qualifying company or a look through company, the $30,000 will be deductible under section DB 6 and the general permission. The general permission is satisfied because the borrowed money was used to purchase the rental property from which assessable income was derived.

Consideration in particular cases (8) If any of sections EW 32 to EW 48, or EZ 52D applies, the consideration referred to in subsection (7) is adjusted under the relevant section. Income (9) Income is— (a) income derived by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years; and (b) dividends derived by the person from the release of the obligation to repay the amount lent; and (c) income derived under section CF 2(2) and (3) (Remission of specified suspensory loans). Expenditure (10) Expenditure is expenditure incurred by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years. Amount remitted (11) Amount remitted is an amount that is not included in the consideration paid or payable to the person because it has been remitted— (a) by the person; or (b) by law. Section EW 54 provides: EW 54 Meaning of cash basis person Who is cash basis person (1) A person is a cash basis person for an income year if— (a) 1 of the following applies in the person’s case for the income year: (i) section EW 57(1); or (ii) section EW 57(2); and (b) section EW 57(3) applies in the person's case for the income year. Persons excluded by Commissioner (2) A person may be excluded under section EW 59 from being a cash basis person for a class of financial arrangements. Section EW 55 provides: EW 55 Effect of being cash basis person Use of spreading method (1) A cash basis person is not required to apply any of the spreading methods to any of their financial arrangements, but may choose to do so under section EW 61. 17 Calculation of base price adjustment (2) The fact that a cash basis person does not use any of the spreading methods for the financial arrangement does not excuse them from the requirement to calculate a base price adjustment when any of section EW 29(1) to (12) applies to them. Section EW 57(1)–(9) provides: EW 57 Thresholds Income and expenditure threshold (1) For the purposes of section EW 54(1)(a)(i), this subsection applies if the absolute value of the person’s income and expenditure in the income year under all financial arrangements to which the person is a party is $100,000 or less. Absolute value threshold (2) For the purposes of section EW 54(1)(a)(ii), this subsection applies if, on every day in the income year, the absolute value of all financial arrangements to which the person is a party added together is $1,000,000 or less. The value of each arrangement is,— (a) for a fixed principal financial arrangement, its face value: (b) for a variable principal debt instrument, the amount owing by or to the person under the financial arrangement: (c) for a financial arrangement to which the old financial arrangements rules apply, the value determined under those rules. Deferral threshold (3) For the purposes of section EW 54(1)(b), this subsection applies if the result of applying the formula in subsection (4) to each financial arrangement to which the person is a party at the end of the income year and adding the outcomes together is $40,000 or less. Formula (4) The formula is— (accrual income – cash basis income) + (cash basis expenditure – accrual expenditure) Definition of items in formula (5) The items in the formula are defined in subsections (6) to (9). Accrual income (6) Accrual income is the amount that would have been income derived by the person under the financial arrangement if the person had been required to use a spreading method in the period starting on the date on which they became a party to the arrangement and ending on the last day of the income year for which the calculation is made. It is calculated using 1 of the following methods, as chosen by the person: (a) the yield to maturity method, whether or not the person may use it, or has chosen to use it, for their financial arrangement; or (b) the straight-line method, whether or not the person may use it, or has chosen to use it, for their financial arrangement; or (c) an alternative method approved by the Commissioner. Cash basis income (7) Cash basis income is the amount that would have been income derived by the person under the financial arrangement if the person had been a cash basis person in the period starting on the date on which they became a party to the arrangement and ending on the last day of the income year for which the calculation is made. Cash basis expenditure (8) Cash basis expenditure is the amount that would have been expenditure incurred by the person under the financial arrangement if the person had been a cash basis person in the period starting on the date on which they became a 18 party to the arrangement and ending on the last day of the income year for which the calculation is made. Accrual expenditure (9) Accrual expenditure is the amount that would have been expenditure incurred under the financial arrangement if the person had been required to use a spreading method in the period starting on the date on which they became a party to the arrangement and ending on the last day of the income year for which the calculation is made. It is calculated using 1 of the following methods, as chosen by the person: (a) the yield to maturity method, whether or not the person may use it, or has chosen to use it, for their financial arrangement; or (b) the straight-line method, whether or not the person may use it, or has chosen to use it, for their financial arrangement; or (c) an alternative method approved by the Commissioner.

In the circumstances set out in the Rulings, a subdivision of shares does not result in a disposal of any shares for the purposes of s CB 4. This is because when a company subdivides shares, the original shares are not cancelled and the shareholder’s rights are not altered or terminated by the subdivision. 2. When a shareholder who acquired the original shares on revenue account disposes of a subdivided share, s CB 4 will apply to the disposal. This is because the subdivided shares are the same property as the original shares acquired. Therefore, the time of acquisition of the subdivided shares is the time the original shares were acquired. Under s ED 1, a reasonable method to determine the cost of each subdivided share is to divide the cost of an original share equally between the subdivided shares into which the original share was divided. Background 3. A subdivision of shares is variously known as a “share split”, a “share subdivision”, or as a type of “share reorganisation”. One reason that a company might undertake a subdivision of shares is to improve the marketability of that company’s shares. 4. There are at least three ways to achieve an increase in the amount of shares in a company, for no additional consideration, that are described as a subdivision of shares, namely: 2  existing shares can be cancelled or redeemed, and, for no additional consideration, a greater number of shares can be issued to all shareholders in the same proportion as their original shareholdings;  shares in addition to the original shares can be issued, for no additional consideration, to all shareholders in the same proportion as the shares already held;  existing shares can be converted into a greater number of shares for no consideration. 5. The Rulings are concerned with only the third type of subdivision of shares. 6. Section CB 4 provides that an amount derived on the disposal of personal property acquired for the purpose of disposal, is income of the person. A share is a type of personal property: s 35 of the Companies Act 1993 (CA 1993). Therefore, in this context, questions arise as to the application of s CB 4 to a subdivision of shares and to the disposal of a subdivided share. Application of the legislation 7. The Rulings consider two situations. These situations represent two points in time at which s CB 4 could apply to subdivided shares, namely the time at which the:  shares are subdivided;  subdivided shares are disposed of. 8. Whether s CB 4 applies in these situations depends on whether the subdivided shares can be regarded as the same property as the original shares. Can the subdivided shares be regarded as the same property as the original shares? 9. Two broad requirements of s CB 4 must be satisfied. If these requirements are met, an amount that the person derives from disposing of the personal property is income of the person. The first requirement is that a person acquires personal property for the purpose of disposing of it. The second requirement is that the person disposes of the personal property. 10. The grammatical construction of s CB 4 shows that the property disposed of must be the same property as that acquired. When a subdivided share is then disposed of, the question arises as to whether the subdivided shares are the same property as the original shares. The answer to this question will also assist in determining the time of acquisition of the subdivided shares for the purposes of s CB 4. 11. In determining whether the subdivided shares can be regarded as the same property as the original shares, it is helpful to consider:  What is the nature of a share?  Does a subdivision of shares involve an issue of shares?  Have the original shares been disposed of or cancelled?  Have the shareholders’ rights changed as a result of the subdivision of shares? 3  Does the Act provide any guidance? What is the nature of a share? 12. It is generally accepted that a share is a bundle of rights and obligations conferred under a contract between the shareholders and the company: Borland’s Trustee v Steel Brothers & Co Ltd \[1901\] 1 Ch 279 (Ch); Bradbury v English Sewing Cotton Ltd \[1923\] AC 744 (HL); IR Commrs v Laird Group plc \[2003\] UKHL 54. This was confirmed by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Robertson v Bicknell (CA129/01, 25 March 2002). In Robertson, the court also confirmed that the nature of the property in a share is the interest of a person in the company, that interest being comprised of various rights and obligations (at \[23\]). 13. The CA 1993 and the general law on shares suggest that shares are an “aliquot” (meaning a portion of a larger whole) interest in a company; that is, a bundle of rights and obligations representing the shareholder’s proportionate interest in the company. The removal of par and nominal values for shares under the CA 1993 reinforces this approach. 14. Section 35 of the CA 1993 provides that a share in a company is personal property. In addition, s 36 of the CA 1993 sets out the basic rights and powers that attach to shares. These basic rights and powers include the right for the shareholder to vote at a meeting of the company on any resolution, the right to an equal share in dividends authorised by the board, and the right to an equal share in the distribution of surplus assets of the company. It is important to note that the rights and powers conferred by this section may be negated, altered or added to by the constitution of the company. Therefore, in any given situation, the constitution of a company (if it has one) will be an important factor in determining the nature of a share and the rights and powers attached to it. Does a subdivision of shares involve an issue of shares? 15. If a subdivision of shares involves an issue of new shares, this may indicate that subdivided shares are different property from the original shares. Sections 41 to 51 of the CA 1993 provide rules on issuing shares. However, the CA 1993 does not provide any guidance about how to achieve a subdivision of shares. There is only one reference in the CA 1993 to subdivisions of shares and that is in s 48. Section 48 is an exception to the requirements in s 47 of the CA 1993 that apply to the issuing of shares by a company after its registration. One view is that this shows that a subdivision must involve an issue of shares – otherwise there would be no need for the express exclusion. The other view is that this was simply to avoid any doubt in this regard. Apart from this, the CA 1993 is silent about how subdivisions should be effected. It is difficult therefore to draw an inference from the CA 1993 as to whether a subdivision of shares involves an issue of new shares. In practice, a company’s annual return is the method by which the Companies Register is updated to reflect changes in the number of shares held and by whom. 16. By comparison, the Companies Act 1955 (CA 1955) did include a procedure for the subdivision of shares. Sections 70 and 71 of the CA 1955 allowed a company to alter the conditions of its memorandum to, among other things, “subdivide its shares ... into shares of smaller amount” and required the company to notify the Registrar. This process was a separate one from that required to issue shares: see, for example, 4 ss 14, 60, 70(1)(a), 72 and reg 2, Table A, Sch 3. This suggested that subdivisions of shares did not involve an issue of shares. 17. It has been suggested that the issue of shares involves the creation of property: FCT v St Helens Farm (ACT) Pty Ltd (1981) 146 CLR 336. Cases on the issue of shares support the view that a subdivision of shares does not involve an issue of shares. The thrust of these cases is that an issue of shares involves something leaving the company and being provided to the shareholder: Central Piggery Co Ltd v McNicoll (1949) 78 CLR 594; National Westminster Bank plc v IR Commrs (1994) 12 ACLC 3,215 (HL). The Commissioner considers that, in the case of a subdivision of shares, nothing has left the company or been provided to the shareholder. The shareholder has the same bundle of rights before and after the subdivision. 18. The CA 1955 suggested that subdivisions of shares did not involve an issue of shares. As noted, there is no clear process for subdivisions of shares under the CA 1993, but there is also no indication that the CA 1993 was intended to change the position under the CA 1955 in relation to subdivisions of shares. Given that the case law on what it means to issue shares shows that an issue involves something being provided by the company to the shareholder, it would seem that a subdivision of shares does not involve an issue of shares. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the better view is that subdivisions of shares should be viewed as not involving an issue of shares. Have the original shares been disposed of or cancelled? 19. The term “dispose” is not defined in s YA 1 for the purposes of s CB 4. (The term is defined for the purposes of other sections in the Act, but these definitions do not assist in this inquiry.) The courts have held that “disposal” means that the property is “got rid of”, and is no longer in the control or possession of the disposer in any capacity: FCT v Wade (1951) 84 CLR 105; Lyttelton Port Co Ltd v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,556 (HC); Coles Myer Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue (VIC) (1998) ATC 4,537 (VICCA). As a result, the Commissioner considers that a “disposition” and/or “disposing” of property must involve the transfer or alienation of that property by the disposer. 20. Further, the provisions in the CA 1993 dealing with the cancellation of shares do not expressly apply to share subdivisions. This suggests that a subdivision does not involve the cancellation of the shares being subdivided. In addition, the case law shows that a “disposition” and/or “disposing” of property must involve total alienation of that property by the disposer. The absence of the cancellation of the existing shares and the fact the shareholder’s interests in the company are never alienated on a subdivision of shares suggests the original shares continue in existence. 21. In addition, when a company subdivides all the shares in the company, the shareholders do not lose control of their proportionate shares in the company between holding the original shares and holding the subdivided shares. Have the shareholders’ rights changed as a result of a subdivision of shares? 22. As noted above, the basic rights attaching to a share (under the CA 1993) include the right to vote, the right to an equal share in dividends and the right to an equal share in the distribution of surplus assets. It might be 5 argued that a subdivision of shares involves changes to a shareholder’s rights in some way; given, for example, the number of votes held by the shareholder may increase in nominal terms. However, if this is viewed in terms of a share being a bundle of rights, then nothing has changed. The proportionate interest (and rights) that the shareholder had before and after the subdivision of shares remains the same. Said another way, the shareholder has, for example, a greater number of votes but the same proportionate voting interest in the company. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that a subdivision of shares has little effect on shareholders’ rights – the subdivision results in more shares, but the shareholders’ proportionate interest in the company does not change. 23. The cases on subdivisions of shares in other legal contexts generally take the view that a subdivision of shares does not give rise to new property: Whittome v Whittome (No 1) (1994) SLT 114 (OH); Greenhalgh v Arderne Cinemas Ltd \[1946\] All ER 512 (CA). There is also a suggestion that the subdivided shares could be traced back to and identified with the original shares: In re Financial Corp (1866–67) LR 2 Ch App 714 (Ch). In addition, in cases concerned with whether a bequest of shares has “adeemed”, the question is whether the property exists as substantially the same thing at the death of the testator. (A gift will “adeem” – that is, be extinguished – in circumstances where, for example, there is a change in the nature of the gift between the testator making the will and the testator’s death.) In relation to a subdivision of shares, in several cases it has been accepted that the subdivided shares are something that has been changed in name and form only, but that is substantially the same thing as the original shares: Re Greenberry, Hops v Daniell (1911) 55 Sol J 633; In re Faris, Goddard v Overend \[1911\] 1 IR 165 (Ch); In re Clifford, Mallam v McFie \[1912\] 1 Ch 29 (Ch); Guardian Trust and Executors Co of NZ Ltd v Smith \[1923\] NZLR 1,284 (SC). 24. Some support for the view that subdivided shares are the same property as the original shares may also be taken from cases on “identity of property”. These cases show that where the legal rights acquired are different in nature from those sold, then they could not be considered to be the same property: McClelland v FCT (1970) 120 CLR 487; AL Hamblin Equipment Pty Ltd v FCT (1974) 74 ATC 4,310 (HCA). However, cases on “identity of property” also suggest that a mere subdivision of land does not change the nature of the legal rights in the property: Moruben Gardens Pty Ltd v FCT 72 ATC 4,147. In that case Mason J regarded the sale of all of the subdivided units as constituting a disposition of the entire estate in fee simple. He concluded that there was identity of property before and after the subdivision because the nature of the legal rights in the property remained the same. Does the Act provide any guidance? 25. Little guidance can be gained directly from the Act. Only one section of the Act deals with subdivisions of shares directly; that is, s EX 68 (this section uses the term “share split”). The wording of this section might suggest that a new interest arises. However, on balance the Commissioner does not think this is the case. The wording of this section reflects the need to ensure the formulae in the foreign investment fund rules work when the number of shares in a foreign investment fund has increased without any new value being introduced to the foreign investment fund. 6 26. The proposed amendments to the definition of “bonus issue” in the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill, when enacted, will also refer to “subdivisions of shares”. This amendment will clarify that subdivisions of shares are excluded from the dividend rules. The Rulings consider whether s CB 4 applies to subdivisions of shares and the disposal of subdivided shares. This proposed amendment does not affect the reasoning and conclusions in the Rulings. Conclusion 27. In summary, under the CA 1993, it appears that a subdivision of shares in the circumstances set out in BR Pub 13/01 and BR Pub 13/02 does not involve an issue of new shares or the cancellation of the original shares – the original shares are merely reformatted or reorganised. Overall, the Commissioner considers that, when shares are subdivided, in such cases the shareholder’s rights in the company have not changed, even though the form in which those rights are held has changed. As a result, the Commissioner considers that the subdivided shares are the same property as the original shares for the purposes of s CB 4. Does s CB 4 apply at the time the shares are subdivided? 28. When a company subdivides shares, the Commissioner considers that at no point does the shareholder give up or lose their share rights as a result of the subdivision. The Commissioner considers that support for this view can be taken from the decision in Whittome v Whittome (No 1) (1994) SLT 114 (OH). In Whittome, the court considered that a subdivision did not affect the identity of the property held by the shareholders, nor did it affect the proportion of the ownership held by the shareholders. The court considered that the shares were not affected by the subdivision and the shares held following the subdivision were the same property as the shares before the subdivision. 29. Given this, the Commissioner considers that s CB 4 does not apply at the time a person’s shares are subdivided. Does s CB 4 apply at the time subdivided shares are disposed of? 30. An amount derived by a person on the disposal of subdivided shares, where the original shares were acquired for the purpose of disposal, will be income of the person under s CB 4. Conversely, s CB 4 will not apply to an amount derived by a person on the disposal of subdivided shares where the original shares were not acquired for the purpose of disposal. This is because the shares held by the person after a subdivision can be regarded as the same property as the shares held by the person before the subdivision. What is the time of acquisition and cost base of subdivided shares held on revenue account? 31. Given that subdivided shares can be regarded as the same property as the original shares, the Commissioner considers that the time of acquisition of the subdivided shares is the time the original shares were acquired. 32. The cost of the original shares may be used to determine the cost base of the subdivided shares on revenue account for purposes of s ED 1. 7 33. The Commissioner considers that a reasonable method to determine the cost of a subdivided share is to divide the cost of an original share equally between the subdivided shares into which the original share was divided. Example 34. The following examples are included to help explain the application of the law. Example 1 – shares acquired for the purpose of disposal 35. On 21 July 2010, Matiu purchased 500 shares in Barry’s Bananas Ltd (BBL) for $10 per share. On 10 January 2011, Matiu purchased another 500 shares in BBL for $15 per share. BBL has one class of shares with 100,000 shares on issue. Matiu acquired his 1,000 shares for the purpose of disposing of them at a profit in the future. Therefore, Matiu holds these shares on revenue account. 36. The directors of BBL decide to subdivide all the shares in BBL so that there will be 400,000 shares on issue. The directors pass a resolution stating: The Board resolves to subdivide (for nil consideration) each Share in the Company into four Shares of the same type. The subdivision of the Company’s Shares will take effect on 1 May 2011. 37. The rights attaching to BBL’s shares will continue in existence throughout the subdivision process and will not be altered. Each shareholder’s proportionate shareholding in the company will remain the same relative to the other shareholders. In addition, the subdivision will merely represent the reformatting of each shareholder’s interest. 38. When the subdivision takes place, BBL’s share register is updated with the new numbers of shares. BBL also informs the Companies Office of the subdivision and the new number of shares is recorded on the Companies Register. 39. After the shares are subdivided, Matiu has 4,000 shares. However, Matiu still has the same proportionate interest in the company and the same rights under the shares as he did before the subdivision. In addition, at no point during the subdivision did Matiu not hold shares in BBL. Therefore, s CB 4 will not apply at this time because Matiu has not disposed of anything. 40. On 18 May 2011, Matiu sells his 4,000 shares to Wiremu for $5 per share. Matiu receives $20,000 from Wiremu in return for the shares. At this point, the requirements of s CB 4 have been met; that is, Matiu has derived an amount from the disposal of property that he acquired for the purpose of disposal. As a result, Matiu will have derived an amount of income on the sale of the shares. Matiu does not acquire or dispose of any more shares in BBL in 2011. 41. The cost base of the subdivided shares is the cost of each of the original shares divided equally among the number of subdivided shares into which the original share was split. That is, the cost of each original share is divided equally across four subdivided shares. 42. Matiu acquired 500 shares before the subdivision for $10 per share. After the subdivision those 500 shares became 2,000 shares. As a result, the cost per share of each subdivided share is $2.50. 8 43. Matiu also acquired a further 500 shares before the subdivision for $15 per share. After the subdivision those 500 shares became 2,000 shares. The cost per share of each subdivided share is $3.75. 44. In the 2011-12 income year, the amount that Matiu derives on the disposal of the shares will be income. In addition, the opening value of the shares (ie, the cost of the shares) will be allowed as a deduction under the matching rules in s ED 1. Using the cost bases identified above, this is calculated in the following way:  The acquisition cost of the subdivided shares is $5,000 for the first 500 shares acquired, and $7,500 for the second 500 shares acquired. This gives a total acquisition cost for the 4,000 shares of $12,500.  Matiu sold all 4,000 shares to Wiremu for $20,000.  The profit of $7,500 that Matiu derived from the sale of the shares will form part of Matiu’s net income. Example 2 – shares not acquired for purpose of disposal 45. On 18 February 2011, Wei purchased 50 shares in BBL. Wei bought the shares as a long-term investment for his family. On 20 March 2011, BBL announces that it will subdivide its shares. After the subdivision, Wei will have 200 shares. Soon after, Wei is diagnosed with a serious illness. He decides to sell some of his shares to help pay for his treatment. 46. BBL subdivides its shares on 1 May 2011. On 2 May 2011, Wei sells 125 of his shares to Gareth. In this situation, s CB 4 will not apply to the amount that Wei derives on the disposal of the 125 shares. This is because, at the time Wei acquired the shares, he did not acquire the shares for the purpose of disposal.

Many businesses hold money that is owing to another person. In New Zealand, the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 (UMA 1971) sets out rules that apply to holders of this unclaimed money. Generally, after a certain period, unclaimed money becomes payable to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. However, the amount ceases to be unclaimed money (although the owner of the money may still be entitled to repayment) where the amount of unclaimed money:  does not exceed $100 per owner (the person entitled to the money); and  the amount is applied by the holder for their own benefit (or for the benefit of any other person or for any purpose or object) within prescribed timeframes. If the holder does not apply the amount for its own benefit, that amount will continue to be unclaimed money and will be payable to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 2. At issue is the tax treatment of these amounts. In particular, whether they can be business income of a taxpayer. 3. For amounts of unclaimed money of $100 or less, it is concluded that while money is held on trust and cannot be (and has not been) applied by the holder for their own benefit (or for the benefit of any other person or for any purpose or object) it cannot be income of the holder. These amounts remain subject to the UMA 1971 and must be paid to the Commissioner within the specified timeframes. 4. An unclaimed amount (of $100 or less) not held on trust will be derived when it:  has been applied by the holder for its own benefit (or for the benefit of any other person or for any purpose or object); and  is probable that the amount will not have to be repaid (this would include situations that mean the amount is not legally recoverable – for example, a contractual term or limitation period). 5. Whether it is probable that an amount will not be repaid will depend on the particular business. Business records and accounting treatment are likely to be relevant to determining this. 6. If a holder has recognised a previously unclaimed amount as income and subsequently returns that amount to the owner, the holder will be entitled to a deduction under s DA 1(b). Background 7. In the Technical Rulings Manual, paragraph 73.8.2 provided that unclaimed money applied by holders for their own benefit cannot be classified as either receipts or profits arising in the normal course of the holder’s trading activities. 8. The Technical Rulings Manual has not been updated since September 1998 and cannot be relied on as representing the Commissioner’s current view (see ‘Inland Revenue Technical Rulings – now limited to historic value’ Tax Information Bulletin vol 10, no 9 (September 1998)). It appears that since 1998 there has been some doubt about the correct tax treatment of these unclaimed amounts. These Rulings set out the Commissioner’s current view. 5 Application of the Legislation 9. The following analysis starts with a summary of the provisions of the UMA 1971. It then considers relevant case law on the timing of derivation of income and a line of United Kingdom (UK) cases that look at when unclaimed money will be trading profits of the holder. Summary of Unclaimed Money Act 1971 10. Section 4(1)(a)–(d) of the UMA 1971 defines amounts that are “unclaimed money”. This section includes specific types of amounts that are unclaimed money and the period (6 years or 25 years) after which the amounts become unclaimed money. 11. Section 4(1)(e) of the UMA 1971 sets out a general catch–all provision. Broadly, any money that has been owing by any holder for 6 years immediately following the date on which the money has become payable by the holder will be “unclaimed money”. 12. The proviso to s 4(1) of the UMA 1971 states: Provided that money of any of the kinds referred to in this subsection shall cease to be unclaimed money where— (i) In respect of any one owner it does not exceed $100 in total; and (ii) Before the 1st day of June next succeeding the end of the period of 6 years or, as the case may be, 25 years specified in this subsection, that unclaimed money is, without limiting any claim any owner may have thereto, applied by the holder for his own benefit or for the benefit of any other person or for any purpose or object. 13. Consequently, an amount will cease to be unclaimed money where it does not exceed $100 and it is applied for the benefit of the holder (or for the benefit of any other person or for any purpose or object) within the prescribed timeframes. However, this does not affect any claim that the owner of the money may have against the holder for repayment. 14. Section 4(2) of the UMA 1971 also excludes certain amounts from being unclaimed money. These include certain dividends, rebates payable by a mutual society, and benefits payable from any pension or superannuation fund. 15. “Holder” is widely defined in s 5 of the UMA 1971. The term includes any company incorporated in New Zealand and any company or bank carrying on business in New Zealand. It also includes certain holders (who are not companies) who are obliged to account for only particular kinds of unclaimed money (for example, auctioneers in respect of the balance of any proceeds of goods sold at auction and real estate agents in respect of money held in the real estate agent’s trust account). 16. Other persons may elect to be holders and comply with the provisions of the UMA 1971. 17. The UMA 1971 imposes certain obligations on holders of unclaimed money. These obligations include:  keeping a register of unclaimed money in accordance with s 6 of the UMA 1971;  notifying owners and the Commissioner of entries in the unclaimed money register in accordance with s 7 of the UMA 1971; 6  paying the unclaimed money to the Commissioner in accordance with the period specified in s 8 of the UMA 1971 (at this time the holder is relieved of all further liability to any claimant in respect of the money). Failure to comply with these obligations is an offence (s 13 UMA 1971). 18. At issue is the tax treatment of amounts that come within the proviso to s 4(1) of the UMA 1971. In particular, whether these amounts can be business income of a taxpayer. These are amounts that would, in the absence of the proviso, be unclaimed money (and the holder subject to the obligations outlined above). Instead, where an amount does not exceed $100 and it is applied for the benefit of the holder (or for the benefit of any other person or for any purpose or object) within the prescribed timeframes, it will cease to be unclaimed money. Therefore, the UMA 1971 will no longer apply to it. When an amount will be business income 19. Section CB 1 provides: CB 1 Amounts derived from business Income (1) An amount that a person derives from a business is income of the person. Exclusion (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an amount that is of a capital nature. 20. An amount will be income where it is “derived” from a business. The following discussion applies where:  a taxpayer is carrying on a business;  the amounts in question are received in the ordinary course of that business;  the amounts are not capital in nature; and  no specific timing regime applies to deem derivation to be at a particular time. 21. Case law has established two main methods of recognising income for tax purposes: the cash or receipts method, and the accruals or earnings method. The accruals method is generally the most appropriate one for calculating business income. This usually requires the realisation of income on the basis of ordinary commercial principles (unless a more specific provision of the Act applies). 22. It is possible that derivation could occur on receipt or at some point following receipt, or that derivation never occurs. Determining the correct point in time requires consideration of the case law on the meaning of derivation. 23. The leading case in this area is Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v FCT (1965) 114 CLR 314. In Arthur Murray the taxpayer carried on a business of giving dancing lessons. Courses of tuition were available for 5, 15 or 30 hours of private tuition to be taken within a year. Some students contracted for 1,200 hours of tuition to be taken at any time during the student’s lifetime. Payment for a course of lessons was often made in advance. The students were given no contractual right to a refund (the terms of the contract prohibited it). However, refunds were sometimes given. The taxpayer 7 argued that fees received in advance of tuition were not taxable income at the time of receipt. The court agreed, finding (at 318) as follows: \[Income\] refers to amounts which have not only been received but have “come home” to the taxpayer; and that must surely involve, if the word “income” is to convey the notion it expresses in the practical affairs of business life, not only that the amounts received are unaffected by legal restrictions, as by reason of a trust or charge in favour of the payer-not only that they have been received beneficially-but that the situation has been reached in which they may properly be counted as gains completely made, so that there is neither legal nor business unsoundness in regarding them without qualification as income derived. The ultimate inquiry in either kind of case, of course, must be whether that which has taken place, be it the earning or the receipt, is enough by itself to satisfy the general understanding among practical business people of what constitutes a derivation of income. A conclusion as to what that understanding is may be assisted by considering standard accountancy methods, for they have been evolved in the business community for the very purpose of reflecting received opinions as to the sound view to take of particular kinds of items. ... Likewise, as it seems to us, in determining whether actual earning has to be added to receipt in order to find income, the answer must be given in the light of the necessity for earning which is inherent in the circumstances of the receipt. It is true that in a case like the present the circumstances of the receipt do not prevent the amount received from becoming immediately the beneficial property of the company; for the fact that it has been paid in advance is not enough to affect it with any trust or charge, or to place any legal impediment in the way of the recipient’s dealing with it as he will. But those circumstances nevertheless make it surely necessary, as a matter of business good sense, that the recipient should treat each amount of fees received but not yet earned as subject to the contingency that the whole or some part of it may have in effect to be paid back, even if only as damages, should the agreed quid pro quo not be rendered in due course. The possibility of having to make such a payment back (we speak, of course, in practical terms) is an inherent characteristic of the receipt itself. In our opinion it would be out of accord with the realities of the situation to hold, while the possibility remains, that the amount received has the quality of income derived by the company. For that reason it is not surprising to find, as the parties in the present case agree is the fact, that according to established accountancy and commercial principles in the community the books of a business either selling goods or providing services are so kept with respect to amounts received in advance of the goods being sold or of the services being provided that the amounts are not entered to the credit of any revenue account until the sale takes place or the services are rendered: in the meantime they are credited to what is in effect a suspense account, and their transfer to an income account takes place only when the discharge of the obligations for which they are the prepayment justifies their being treated as having finally acquired the character of income. \[Emphasis added\] 24. Several New Zealand cases have followed Arthur Murray. Arthur Murray was cited with approval in A Taxpayer v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,350 (CA) in relation to the principle that an amount needs to be received beneficially by the taxpayer before it will be derived. 25. In CIR v Molloy (1990) 12 NZTC 7,146 (HC) the taxpayer was a life insurance agent. He received commissions in advance subject to terms requiring repayment if the policy was terminated within a certain timeframe. The court found that the commissions were not income at the time of receipt. Thomas J stated at 7,152: In my view the advances made to the agent by the company in this case on account of commission do not have the quality of income derived by the agent at the time of receipt. The possibility or inherent risk that such advances may have to be repaid (only about 5% in the case of the respondent but up to 30% on average for the company's agents as a whole) is significant, and it is an integral part of the advance, or the receipt of the advance, itself. For the very good reason that the company wishes to provide an incentive for the agent to solicit soundly based business and then, if necessary, work to ensure that the policies entered into are sustained for a sufficient period to ensure that they are viable, the arrangement contemplates that he will not have earned his commission unless the policy remains in force for two years. 8 In my opinion, it is these factors which deprive the advances made from having the quality of income earned and derived by the agent at the time they are received. \[Emphasis added\] 26. Bowcock v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,062 (HC) concerned an employee who took study leave. Under the terms of the arrangement, the taxpayer received his normal salary. If he left his employment within a certain time after finishing his course, some of the money had to be repaid. The taxpayer did leave his employment and had to repay certain amounts. He claimed that these amounts were never part of his income. The court distinguished Arthur Murray, finding that the amounts became the absolute property of the taxpayer when they were paid. Whether any liability arose in the future to repay any part of the money depended entirely on the course the objector chose to take. 27. The principles from Arthur Murray were also applied in Case N30 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,266 (TRA). The taxpayer in Case N30 carried on a courier business. As part of its business, the taxpayer sold pre-paid books of tickets of varying denominations. The tickets had no expiry date. There was no contractual right to a refund, although the taxpayer would usually give a refund for unused tickets if asked. Some of the tickets were never redeemed. Amounts received were not returned as income when they were received, but were returned as income when they were redeemed. It was agreed that this was generally the appropriate tax treatment. At issue was the treatment of amounts that were never redeemed and whether these should be returned as income. It was accepted that the amount could not be accurately calculated. Judge Bathgate held that when the taxpayer could say as a matter of probability that a ticket would not be redeemed, the amount should be included as income. 28. The taxpayer in A Elson (Inspector of Taxes) v Prices Tailors Ltd \[1963\] 1 All ER 231 (ChD) carried on business as a tailor making made-to-measure garments. When a customer placed an order, they were required to pay a deposit. If, subsequently, the customer declined to take the garment, the taxpayer would refund the deposit (although contractually it did not have to do so). However, often neither the garment nor the deposit was claimed. At issue was whether the unclaimed deposits were trading receipts in the year in which they were paid. 29. The court found that the payments were true deposits, rather than part- payments (as the taxpayer had argued). Consequently, the amounts belonged to the taxpayer at the time they were paid (as there was no legal requirement to refund them). The court went on to find that the deposit amounts were trading receipts in the year in which they were received. That the taxpayer would always refund the amounts if asked did not change this. 30. It might be suggested that Prices Tailors is inconsistent with the decision in Arthur Murray. Prices Tailors concerned a deposit towards a supply of goods and the court held that the deposit was derived when it was received. On the other hand, Arthur Murray concerned a full payment for the provision of services in the future and the court held that the amount was not derived until the services had been performed. The cases are consistent in that they both look at the legal obligations (the amounts paid were non-refundable) rather than what happened in practice. However, Prices Tailors did not appear to consider the fact that, at the time the deposit was paid, the taxpayer had not fulfilled the requirements of the contract (ie making the suit available to the taxpayer). 9 Summary of principles from the cases 31. The following principles can be taken from the above cases:  The word “income” conveys the notion it expresses in the practical affairs of business life. It is necessary to ask whether what has taken place is enough by itself to satisfy the general understanding among practical business people of what is derivation of income.  An amount will be income when the earning process is complete. In the case of prepaid services, this will usually be when the services have been performed.  Where it is probable that the services will not have to be performed and the amount will not have to be repaid, then the amount should be income.  It is necessary to consider the circumstances of receipt. For example, whether the amount is subject to a contingency of repayment is a relevant factor. Similarly, for an amount to be derived it must have been beneficially received by the taxpayer (ie not be subject to legal restrictions such as a trust or charge that prevent the taxpayer dealing with the amount in their own interests). United Kingdom cases 32. Several UK cases consider whether (and when) amounts received by taxpayers that may be subject to repayment are trading receipts that should be taken into account in calculating the taxpayer’s profits. 33. Lincolnshire Sugar Co Ltd (in liquidation) v Smart (HMIT) \[1937\] 1 All ER 413 (HL) considered “advances” payable to sugar manufacturers. The advances became repayable in the event of imported sugar rising to a certain price, or in certain other events such as a winding up of the company. The appellant company received weekly advances amounting to £17,494 5s 7d. This sum was included as a liability in its balance sheet. No part of the sum ever became repayable. The issue was whether the £17,494 5s 7d was a trading receipt of the company in the year it was received. The company contended that the advances were not trading receipts or, if the advances were trading receipts, they could not be brought into account as such, so long as they remained subject to repayment. 34. Lord MacMillan concluded that the amounts were trading receipts. The fact the payments were called advances and were repayable if certain contingencies occurred was not decisive. Rather he was influenced by the fact the payments were made to the company so that the money could be used in its business. 35. Morley (Inspector of Taxes) v Tattersall \[1938\] 3 All ER 296 (CA) involved a firm of auctioneers. Its conditions of sale provided that vendors should receive the purchase money following the sale, and that no money would be paid without a written order. As a result of the operation of these conditions, large sums of money from time to time remained unclaimed in the hands of the firm. When a new partner was admitted in 1922, £13,022 6s 4d in respect of unclaimed balances for years before 1908 was transferred to the capital account of the old partner. In 1935 when a further partner was admitted, £10,406 10s 1d in respect of unclaimed balances between 1922 and 1928 was transferred partly to the current accounts and partly to the capital accounts of the former partners. A partnership deed in 1936 provided that such liability as subsisted in respect of those sums should be assumed by the partnership and that such unclaimed balances as 10 first arose six years before the taking of each annual account should be transferred at such account to the credit of the partners in accordance with their shares in the partnership. The partnership deed further provided that all liability in respect of the unpaid amounts should be borne by the partnership. 36. Sir Wilfrid Greene MR noted that the Statute of Limitation had not started to run in respect of the balances. Therefore, the taxpayer was still obliged to make payment to a customer at any time if requested (at 298): Many of those balances have remained unclaimed for a considerable number of years, but the Solicitor-General quite properly admitted that the vendors in question were entitled to claim payment of their money at any time, unaffected by the Statute of Limitation, which has not yet begun to run, owing to the absence of any written order as required by the conditions. We are dealing, therefore, with obligations which, as a matter of law, are existing obligations, which the firm can be called on to perform at any moment. That is a matter not without importance in the examination of this case. 37. Sir Wilfrid Greene MR went on to further explain the effect of the agreements between the partners (at 300). In particular, he noted that the agreements did not affect the legal position between the clients and the partnership. Rather the agreements related to the accounting treatment of the unclaimed amounts as well as what was in effect an indemnity between the partners and the partnership in relation to the amounts: Pausing there for a moment, and eliminating, for the purpose of simplicity, the changes in the partnership agreement, it is of the utmost importance in this case to appreciate the real nature of what was being done. I say that because, in the arguments addressed to us on behalf of the Crown, various metaphorical expressions were used, such as “holding a sum,” “changing the capacity in which a sum is held,” “turning a sum into an asset,” and so forth—expressions which, to my mind, are both inaccurate and misleading. What happened was that the partnership, being indebted to outside persons; in respect of sums which it had received, and which had passed into the general mass of its assets, and having carried in its balance-sheet a proper liability item to express that liability, decided at a certain point, and on certain principles laid down, that that liability item should be written down and diminished. That is what happened in 1921, in 1934, and year by year after the provisions of the new partnership agreement came into operation—merely the alteration of a debit item in the balance-sheet by eliminating from it certain liabilities which had previously gone to make it up. If that matter had stayed there, the only result on the balance-sheet would have been to increase the credit balance. It would have shown a greater surplus of assets over liabilities than it had shown prior to that writing down. It so happened that, for domestic reasons of their own, the partners, instead of leaving the matter in that way, with an increased credit balance, decided that that increase in the credit balance should be carried in the balance sheet to the partners’ accounts. That does not alter the reality of the position one jot. The true position is—and I repeat it, because it is only when that is appreciated that what I, with respect, conceive to be the fallacies underlying the Crown's argument are perceived—that the only thing which was done on these occasions was the elimination from the liabilities side of the balance-sheet of something which had previously appeared as a liability therein. \[Emphasis added\] 38. It was generally agreed between the parties that the money was not a trading receipt at the time it was received. However, it was argued that the amounts became trading receipts at the time the partners treated the amounts as their own. Sir Wilfrid Greene MR rejected this argument, finding that the writing down of the amount in the balance sheet did not convert that amount to income (at 301): It might be more convenient to deal with Mr Hills’s argument first, because that is the one which starts off with the perfectly clear admission that the money, when received from the purchasers, was not a trading receipt. That proposition, I should have thought, was, in any case, quite incontestable. The money received was money which had not got any profit-making quality about it. It was money which, in a business sense, was the clients’ money, and nobody else’s. It was money for which Messrs Tattersall were liable to account to the clients, and the fact that Messrs Tattersall paid it into their own account, as they clearly did, and the fact that it remained among their assets until paid out, do not alter that circumstance. It would 11 have been, for income tax purposes, in my judgment, entirely improper to have brought those receipts into the account at all for the purpose of ascertaining the balance of profits and gains. Indeed, as I have said, the Crown did not suggest that that would have been proper. What was said, however, was this. Mr Hills’s argument was to the effect that, although they were not trading receipts at the moment of receipt, they had at that moment the potentiality of becoming trading receipts. That proposition involves a view of income tax law in which I can discover no merit except that of novelty. I invited Mr Hills to point to any authority which in any way supported the proposition that a receipt which at the time of its receipt was not a trading receipt could by some subsequent operation ex post facto be turned into a trading receipt—not, be it observed, as at the date of receipt, but as at the date of the subsequent operation. It seems to me, with all respect to that argument, that it is based on a complete misapprehension of what is meant by a trading receipt in income tax law. No case has been cited to us in which anything like that proposition appears. It seems to me that the quality and nature of a receipt for income tax purposes is fixed once and for all when it is received. What the partners did in this case, as I have said, was to decide among themselves that what they had previously regarded as a liability of the firm they would not, for practical reasons, regard as a liability. That does not mean, however, that at that moment they received something, nor does it mean that at that moment they imprinted on some existing asset a quality different from that which it had possessed before. There was no existing asset at all at that time. All that they did, as I have already pointed out, was to write down a liability item in their balance- sheet, and how by effecting that operation it can be said that a sum received years ago has been converted into something which it never was is a thing which, with all respect, passes my comprehension. \[Emphasis added\] 39. Jay’s the Jewellers Ltd v IRC \[1947\] 2 All ER 762 (KB) involved the tax treatment of proceeds from the sale of pledged property. The Pawnbrokers Act 1872 required a pawnbroker to hold a pledge for 12 months and 7 days. If the pledged article had not been redeemed by then and the loan was no more than 10s, the pledge became the property of the pawnbroker, who could sell it and keep the proceeds. If the loan exceeded 10s, the pawnbroker was entitled to sell the pledged article by auction and to take the amount of the loan, the interest due and the cost of the sale out of the amount realised. Subject to the terms of any special contract, which were permitted if the loan exceeded 40s, at any time within three years of the sale the pledgor had the right to inspect the pawnbroker’s books and demand payment of the surplus. After three years, the pledgor lost that right and the surplus became the property of the pawnbroker. Special contracts entered into by pawnbrokers with pledgors sometimes incorporated the three-year period, but in others the pledgor’s rights to redeem were barred only by the ordinary period of limitation, six years. 40. The issue was whether the proceeds from the sales were subject to excess profits tax. The court held that, as a matter of law, the surpluses when received were not the taxpayers’ monies at all; they belonged to their clients. Based on Tattersall, the court found that the surpluses were not trading receipts in the year that they were received. The court then went on to consider whether a surplus could be treated as a trade receipt in a later year when the taxpayer became entitled to retain it. 41. The court held that a new asset was created automatically by operation of law at the end of the three years (in the case of most of the loans) and common sense would seem to demand that that should be entered in the profit and loss account for the year and be treated as taxable. The court distinguished the decision in Tattersall as follows (at 766): It is, however, argued that I cannot give effect to that view because of Tattersall’s case. Is there anything in Tattersall’s case to indicate that that view is wrong? In that case there had been no change whatever in the character and nature of the money held. The Statute of Limitations had not commenced to run, and the court was dealing merely with the effect of a change in the method in which these sums were dealt with in the company’s books. ... 12 Here the position is different. Here, at the end of three years, the money in question, the three-year-old surplus, did attain a totally different quality. I think there was then a definite trade receipt. At the end of the three years a new asset came into existence, an asset which had arisen out of a trade transaction. 42. The court then considered whether the position should be different for pledges that were subject only to the application of a limitation period. The same conclusion was held to apply (at 767): The position is somewhat different as to pledges for over £10, because the only change which takes place at the end of six years is that the customer’s remedy is barred, but, from the business point of view, I think, it ought to be treated as the same. In practice those amounts would be properly dealt with by the taxpayers as their own. They could not get into difficulties by so doing. They cannot be called on to pay. I do not think any distinction ought to be drawn between the three-yearly surpluses and the six- yearly surpluses, and I am not prepared to differ from the view held by the Special Commissioners. Therefore, both appeals will fail. 43. In holding that the unclaimed deposits were income of the taxpayer in the year received, Prices Tailors (see para 28) distinguished Tattersall and Jay’s the Jewellers on the basis that, in those cases, the amounts in question did not belong to the taxpayers (at the time they were received) (at 235): In Morley v Tattersall, the vendors’ unclaimed balances, in the hands of a firm of auctioneers, of proceeds of sale of horses were held not to be trading receipts; and in Jay’s, The Jewellers Ltd v Inland Revenue Comrs; Inland Revenue Comrs v Jay’s, The Jewellers Ltd, a pawner’s unclaimed balance in the hands of a pawnbroker of the proceeds of sale of an unredeemed pledge, after satisfying the amounts due under the pledge, was held not to be a trading receipt until the pawner’s claim was statute- barred. In these cases, the balances in the traders’ hands were not theirs at all but were held for others, and this fact is fundamental to the decisions. The traders had no beneficial interest in them at the relevant time, and, although it was because they were traders that they received them, they were not receipts of their trade at all. \[Emphasis added\] 44. The taxpayer in Pertemps Recruitment Partnership Ltd v HMRC \[2010\] UKFTT 218 (TC) carried on business as a recruitment agent. Sometimes it would receive overpayments from customers (that is, payments of amounts that were not owing). Where these amounts could not be refunded or applied against a later liability, the taxpayer kept the payments. The court found that receipt of mistaken payments was an inevitable incident of the taxpayer’s business. The court further found that:  when the overpayments were deposited in the taxpayer’s bank account, the taxpayer did not know that they represented an overpayment;  the taxpayer treated the overpayments as its own money (that is, the overpayments were not kept in a separate account);  the taxpayer did not hold the mistaken payments on trust for the customer (Tattersall and Jay’s the Jewellers were distinguished on this basis);  no limitation period would likely apply to the overpayments; and  the amounts paid belonged to the taxpayer unless the customer made a successful claim in restitution, or the claim was settled by agreement. 45. The court held that the payments were profits from the taxpayer’s trade in the year that they were received. The fact the customers had an entitlement to claim the money back did not change this. The Tribunal Judge stated (at paragraphs 43-44): HMRC’s submission, with which we agree, is that an \[sic\] mistaken payment for services has the same characteristic in the hands of the recipient trader as a payment made not in error – if the payment is made because the customer makes a mistake about owing something for services or for a trading transaction, the mistaken payment accrues from the trade of the recipient. This is entirely 13 consistent with the manner in which Pertemps operates its business. At the time payments are deposited into the Pertemps’ bank account, it does not distinguish between overpayments and other receipts. Indeed it could not – as Pertemps banks payments before they are allocated to invoices on ledgers. Even if a receipt is eventually determined to be an overpayment, it will often be applied against other invoices rendered to the customer. ... HMRC submit, and we agree, that the overpayments are a natural consequence of the efficient and lawful way in which Pertemps conducts its business, and that these processes will mean that sometimes it makes more money from the supply of its services than it had anticipated. In doing so, it has supplemented its trading profits, and the receipt is a trading receipt. \[Emphasis added\] 46. In Gower Chemicals v HMRC \[2008\] UKSPC 713 (SpC) the taxpayer carried on business selling chemicals. Chemicals were sold in reusable containers. Customers paid a refundable deposit for a container that remained the property of the taxpayer. When a container was returned in good condition and in a reasonable time, the appellant would issue a credit note or refund the deposit. Sometimes containers were returned but the customer never took the credit or refund. At issue was whether the unclaimed deposits were trading income. The Special Commissioners found that the deposits belonged to the taxpayer as soon as they were received and should be brought into income at that point. This was because the taxpayer knew that in the course of its business, 20 percent of the deposits would not have to be repaid. Special Commissioner, Dr John Avery Jones stated (at paragraph 7): The issue for me turns primarily on the nature of the receipt of the deposit by the Appellant. The Appellant knows that about 20 per cent of deposits will not have to be repaid. In my view this makes it impossible to say that the Appellant is merely holding the deposit for the customer. The straightforward analysis is that the deposit is a trading receipt just as the payment for the goods is a trading receipt but with the difference that about 80 per cent of the deposits will have to be repaid, for which it is right to make a provision. While I agree that factually this distinguishes this case from Prices Tailors, I do not consider that this changes anything. In that case the deposit was security for the completion of the garment that the customer had ordered. Deposits were in fact repaid to customers who did not accept the garment even though there was not contractual obligation to do so. The decision relied on Smart v Lincolnshire Sugar Co 20 TC 643 in which there was a contractual right to repayment of the deposit if a contingency occurred. The need for a provision for this was discussed in the case and it is recorded in Prices Tailors that the same point was raised. In my view the Appellant’s past accounting treatment was correct. The deposit belongs to the Appellant as soon as it is received and should be brought into income at that point. Summary of principles from the United Kingdom cases 47. It may appear that the reasoning in the UK cases is not always consistent. For example, as noted above, in Tattersall, the court found that the nature of a receipt for income tax purposes is fixed at the time it is received. However, the court in Jay’s the Jewellers took the view that a receipt could become income at a later date where its nature was changed by the operation of law. 48. Notwithstanding the apparent inconsistencies, it is considered that the above cases can all be reconciled. Where a later case has reached a different view than an earlier case, the later case has refined and/or expanded the principles set out in the earlier case and adapted them to the facts at issue. Consequently, the following principles can be taken from the above cases:  Where an amount is no longer liable to be repaid (whether by virtue of contractual terms, limitation or other statute), then it will become income (if it was not previously) (Jay’s the Jewellers).  Just because an amount may be subject to repayment does not mean that the amount cannot be income (Lincolnshire Sugar, Pertemps). 14  When an amount is held on trust for a third party, it will not be income (Tattersall).  Changing the accounting treatment of an amount will not, by itself, make that amount income (Tattersall).  Unsolicited overpayments that a taxpayer treats as their own money belong to the taxpayer unless the customer makes a successful claim (Pertemps).  Unsolicited overpayments and unclaimed refundable deposits are income in the year they are received (Pertemps, Gower Chemicals). Application to unclaimed amounts of $100 or less in New Zealand 49. As noted above, for an amount to be derived it must be received beneficially by the taxpayer (ie received free from legal impediments to the taxpayer dealing with the money in its own interests). In the context of unclaimed money, this is most likely to give rise to a question of whether an amount is held on trust or not. Therefore, the treatment of money held on trust is considered below. Money held on trust 50. Most unclaimed money will not be held on trust. For example, where a customer has overpaid an account, the overpayment will not normally be held on trust by the holder. The relationship between a customer and a business will normally be a contractual one. Similarly, the relationship between a bank and depositor will normally be one of debtor-and-creditor and not trust (see DFC New Zealand Ltd v Goddard \[1992\] 2 NZLR 445). However, in certain circumstances, unclaimed money may be held on trust by the holder. Examples include funds held in a real estate agent’s trust account or a solicitor’s trust account. 51. A trust will often (but not always) be evidenced by the existence of a trust deed. A trust will be present where the holder holds the unclaimed money for the benefit of a third party (the “owner” for unclaimed money purposes) and cannot deal with the money in their own interests. Therefore, to determine whether an amount is held on trust, it is necessary to look at the terms on which the money was originally paid and on which it is currently held. 52. As noted above, money held on trust is unlikely to be able to be applied by the holder for their own benefit without breaching the terms of the trust. Consequently, the proviso to s 4(1) of the UMA 1971 will not be satisfied and the amounts will be unclaimed money. This is also likely to be the case for other amounts that are not received beneficially by a taxpayer. If s 4(1) is not satisfied, then the amounts cannot be income as they will be subject to the UMA 1971 and must ultimately be paid to Inland Revenue. If, on the other hand, the money is in fact applied by the holder for its own benefit, it is unlikely that the holder will be able to show that the money is held on trust (or otherwise not received beneficially). 53. The conclusion that money held on trust cannot be income of the holder is consistent with the case law considered above. None of the cases found that money held on trust could be income of the holder. 54. However, if money ceases to be held on trust (for example, by virtue of the terms of the trust or the application of a statutory provision) and the holder applies it for their own benefit, then s 4(1) of the UMA 1971 could apply and 15 the amount could become income of the holder. In this case, the amount should be treated the same as amounts not held on trust. Money not held on trust 55. At issue is when (if at all) amounts of unclaimed money applied by the holder for their own benefit will be derived by the holder. As noted above, it is assumed that the amounts are received by the holder in the ordinary course of their business. 56. New Zealand case law on derivation has followed the Australian decision of Arthur Murray. Therefore, in New Zealand, income will be derived when what has taken place is enough to satisfy the general understanding among practical business people of what is derivation of income. The UK case law may be of assistance in determining this. However, that case law was not considering the meaning of derivation so care needs to be taken when applying the decisions in a New Zealand context. 57. In the case of unclaimed money, it could be argued that derivation occurs on receipt or at some point following receipt, or that derivation never occurs. As no New Zealand case law is directly on point, it is necessary to consider the principles taken from the case law to determine how a court would apply them to resolve this issue. 58. Where a contractual or statutory provision (such as the Limitation Act 1950 or Limitation Act 2010) applies so that the holder of money will no longer be required to repay it if requested by the owner, then the amount will be income. This is consistent with the UK case law. It is also consistent with Arthur Murray and the New Zealand derivation cases, because the holder has to do nothing further to earn the amount and there is no possibility that the amount will be repayable. However, in many cases of unclaimed money, it is unlikely that the relevant Limitation Act will apply and there will be no contractual terms limiting the holder’s liability to repay. Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether these amounts could be income even though they are still subject to the possibility of repayment. 59. As noted above, that an amount may be subject to repayment will not necessarily prevent it being income (see, for example, Lincolnshire Sugar, Pertemps, Gower Chemicals, Case N30, Bowcock). 60. Pertemps is the decision that is closest to the facts being considered. It could be argued that Pertemps should be applied in New Zealand, which would lead to the conclusion that (at least in the case of overpayments) the relevant amounts are income when they are received. However, this is not considered the correct approach for two reasons. First, in New Zealand the UMA 1971 potentially imposes some statutory obligations in respect of the amounts until the proviso to s 4(1) applies to exclude the amount from being unclaimed money. Secondly, Pertemps is arguably inconsistent with the approach taken in Arthur Murray and the subsequent New Zealand cases. This is discussed in more detail below. In summary, it is considered that Pertemps provides support for the proposition that the amounts of unclaimed money are in the nature of income. However, it is not considered good authority in New Zealand for when that income is derived. 61. It could be argued that the fact (in many cases) the holder will always be liable to repay the relevant amounts to the owner (if asked) means applying Arthur Murray would lead to the conclusion that the amounts would never be derived. However, it is considered that the principles from Arthu r Murray need to be interpreted in the context of the facts in that decision. Arthur 16 Murray was considering prepaid services. This meant its analysis was focused on establishing when an amount would be “earned” where there was a future requirement to perform services on request. No consideration was given to what the position would be where there was no (or no longer an) obligation to perform any services. Case N30 expanded the scope of the principles from Arthur Murray. In Case N30 income was held to be derived even though the services paid for had not been performed. The earning process was found to be complete once it was probable that the service would not be required to be performed. 62. In the context of an amount of unclaimed money, that amount will not be “earned” in the sense of goods or services being provided for it. However, it is an amount that is received in the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s business and it is being treated by the taxpayer as its own money (in the sense of having been applied for the holder’s use). As nothing further needs to be done by the taxpayer to earn the money, the only thing stopping it being derived is the fact it is subject to the contingency of repayment. As time passes, that contingency will become more remote. 63. Once it is probable that the unclaimed amount will not need to be repaid, it should be treated as income. The “probable” threshold is based on the test used in Case N30. A different standard may be more appropriate. For example, it could be argued that it is sufficient for an amount to be treated as income where it is “unlikely” that it will need to be repaid. However, on balance, it is considered that the case law better supports the slightly higher “probable” threshold. Practically, there may not be much difference in any event. 64. When it is probable that an amount will not be repaid will depend on the particular business. Business records and accounting treatment are likely to be relevant to determining this. For example, if business records show that once an amount is applied for the benefit of the holder under the proviso to s 4(1) of the UMA 1971, it is probable that it will not be paid back, then this would suggest that the amount should be returned as income at that time. If, on the other hand, the business records show that even after 10 years, customers still successfully request the return of unclaimed amounts (on more than just isolated occasions), then this may suggest that the amounts should not yet be treated as income. This will be a question of fact to be determined in each case. It is not possible to provide more prescriptive factors. 65. In summary, an unclaimed amount will be derived when it:  has been applied by the holder for its own benefit (that is, the proviso to s 4(1) of the UMA 1971 applies); and  is probable that the amount will not have to be repaid (which would include situations (described above) when the amount is not legally recoverable; for example, under a contractual term or the Limitation Act). Amounts subsequently repaid to owners 66. Section DA 1 sets out the general permission for deductibility. In particular, s DA 1(b) allows a deduction for an amount of expenditure to the extent to which it is incurred in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable or excluded income. 67. Th e Rulings apply to amounts of unclaimed money that are received by holders in the ordinary course of their business. The Commissioner’s view is 17 that repayment of these amounts to their owners is also undertaken in the course of the holder’s business. Consequently, if a holder subsequently returns an amount that has previously been recognised as income, the holder will be entitled to a deduction under s DA 1(b). Conclusions 68. For amounts of unclaimed money of $100 or less, while money is held on trust and cannot be (and has not been) applied by the holder for their own benefit (or for the benefit of any other person or for any purpose or object) it cannot be income of the holder. 69. An unclaimed amount (of $100 or less) not held on trust will be derived when it:  has been applied by the holder for its own benefit (that is, the proviso to s 4(1) of the UMA 1971 applies); and  is probable that the amount will not have to be repaid (which would include situations when the amount is not legally recoverable; for example, under a contractual term or the Limitation Act). 70. When it is probable that an amount will not be repaid will depend on the particular business. Business records and accounting treatment are likely to be relevant to determining this. 71. If a holder has recognised a previously unclaimed amount as income and subsequently returns that amount to the owner, the holder will be entitled to a deduction under s DA 1(b). Example: Unclaimed money not held on trust 72. The following example is included to assist in explaining the application of the law. 73. Supaphone Ltd is carrying on business as a telecommunications company. Many of Supaphone’s clients pay their accounts by monthly automatic payment. Sometimes when clients close their accounts with Supaphone, they forget to cancel their automatic payments straight away. This results in overpayments to Supaphone. Supaphone attempts to contact customers to return these overpayments, but these customers are often impossible to locate. Supaphone also receives payment by cheque. Sometimes, despite its best attempts, Supaphone cannot match the cheque received with a particular customer’s account. In both situations, the amounts received are subject to the UMA 1971. 74. Where unclaimed amounts are $100 or less, Supaphone applies them to its business (within the applicable timeframes) under the proviso to s 4(1) of the UMA 1971. At this time, the amounts are no longer subject to the UMA 1971. 75. Supaphone’s business records show that over the past 10 years repayment requests are made for 50 percent of unclaimed amounts within four years of receipt. However, in the past 10 years only two people have requested the return of unclaimed money more than four years after it was received. Therefore, after four years it is probable that the amount will not have to be repaid. 76. Supaphone asks whether (and when) the unclaimed amounts of $100 or less are business income under s CB 1. 18 77. The unclaimed amounts are not held by Supaphone on trust. Therefore, the amounts will be income under s CB 1 when they are derived (assuming that no other timing regime applies). The amounts will be derived when:  Supaphone applies the amounts to its business under the proviso to s 4(1) of the UMA 1971 (which occurs around six years after receipt); and  it is probable that Supaphone will not have to repay the amounts (in this case four years after receipt). 78. As the later of these events is the application of the amounts under the proviso to s 4(1), the amounts are derived and should be returned as business income when Supaphone applies these amounts to its business.

Section 4 of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 provides: Unclaimed money (1) Subject to this section, unclaimed money shall consist of— (a) money, including the interest or any amount in the nature of interest thereon, deposited with any holder so as to bear interest for a fixed term, which has been in the possession of the holder for the period of 6 years immediately following the date of expiry of the term: (b) money, including the interest or any amount in the nature of interest thereon, deposited with any holder so as to bear interest— (i) without limitation of time; or (ii) for a fixed term where, on the expiry of the fixed term, the money, if it is not withdrawn by the customer, is to be treated as reinvested,— where in either case the customer has not operated on the account for a period of 25 years, whether by deposit, or withdrawal, or instruction in writing: (c) money deposited upon current account or otherwise with any holder and not bearing interest, where— (i) in any case where the holder is a savings bank, the customer has not operated on the account for a period of 25 years, whether by deposit, or withdrawal, or instruction in writing; and (ii) in any other case, the customer has not operated on the account for a period of 6 years, whether by deposit, or withdrawal, or instruction in writing: (d) money payable or distributable on or in consequence of the maturity of a policy of life assurance, being money which has been in the possession of any holder for the period of 6 years immediately succeeding the date on which— (i) the policy matured otherwise than by death; or (ii) the holder first had reason to suppose that the policy has matured by death, whether such death has been legally proved or not,— whichever date is the earlier, and notwithstanding that by the terms of the policy the money is not payable or distributable except on proof of death, or on proof of age or any other collateral matter: (e) any other money, of any kind whatsoever, which has been owing by any holder for the period of 6 years immediately following the date on which the money has become payable by the holder: provided that money of any of the kinds referred to in this subsection shall cease to be unclaimed money where— (i) in respect of any one owner it does not exceed $100 in total; and 20 (ii) before the 1st day of June next succeeding the end of the period of 6 years or, as the case may be, 25 years specified in this subsection, that unclaimed money is, without limiting any claim any owner may have thereto, applied by the holder for his own benefit or for the benefit of any other person or for any purpose or object. (2) Unclaimed money shall not include— (a) any dividends, not being dividends payable by a mutual association in relation to money deposited with the association, payable by a company to any of its shareholders: (b) any rebate payable by a mutual association (other than a holder of the kind referred to in paragraph (f) of subsection (1) of section 5 of this Act) to any of its members in relation to the trading transactions of the member with the association, not being a rebate payable in relation to money deposited with the association: (c) any benefits payable from any pension or superannuation fund.

1 Note (not part of the Rulings): These two public rulings, BR Pub 13/05 to BR Pub 13/06, deal with certain aspects of the income tax treatment of the standard form contract for public- private partnerships prepared by the Treasury. These two rulings do not consider the tax implications of any funding agreements or other contracts entered into by the parties. For example, these rulings do not address the potential application of the thin capitalisation rules in subpart FE, goods and services tax (GST), the financial arrangements rules or the general anti avoidance provision in s BG 1. Any person entering into a public-private partnership with the New Zealand Government is strongly advised to apply for a private ruling and a financial arrangements rules determination in respect of its specific structure to provide certainty on issues that are not addressed in these rulings. INCOME TAX – STANDARD PROJECT AGREEMENT FOR A PUBLIC–PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP - COMPANIES PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 13/05 This is a public ruling made under s 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss CB 1, CH 2, DA 1, DA 2, DB 50, EA 2 and EA 3. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the design, construction, operation and maintenance of an asset (the Facility) by a company (the special purpose vehicle – SPV) under a public–private partnership agreement with Her Majesty, The Queen in Right of New Zealand acting by and through a government department (the Crown). The Arrangement is governed by a standard form contract prepared by the Treasury (the Project Agreement). Key clauses of the Project Agreement and relevant definitions have been included in Appendix B to the Commentary of this Ruling. This Ruling will not apply if the clauses of the Project Agreement that are referred to in this Ruling are altered in a material way. The Project Agreement has three main components:  The Design and Construction (D&C) Phase involves the SPV providing design and construction supplies in return for a lump sum design and construction payment (the D&C Payment).  The Facility Lease is the lease into which the SPV and the Crown enter and under which the SPV prepays an amount representing the rental the SPV will pay to the Crown (the Rental Prepayment).  The Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Phase involves the SPV providing operational and maintenance services over a period of approximately 25 years in return for a regular payment (the Unitary Charge). The date on which the O&M Phase starts is referred to as the Service Commencement Date. 2 Each of the three components is summarised below. The Project Agreement details the rights and obligations of the SPV and the Crown. Design and Construction Phase During the D&C Phase, the SPV will design and construct the Facility in accordance with the Project Agreement on behalf of the Crown. The Facility consists of all of the structures that are to be designed, constructed, commissioned and maintained by the SPV in accordance with the terms of the Project Agreement, and includes the entire physical infrastructure, the grounds and all of the fixtures, fit-out, plant and equipment. The SPV will be solely responsible to the Crown for the design and construction of the Facility, including the provision of infrastructure, plant, equipment and other related obligations, to the standard required by the Project Agreement. Throughout the term of the Project Agreement, the SPV will not own the Facility or the land on which the Facility will be built (the Crown Site) (cl 11.1). Under cl 11.2(a) of the Project Agreement, any Fixtures that the SPV supplies before the start of the Facility Lease (whether or not affixed to the land) (the Initial Fixtures) will remain the property, and in the ownership, of the SPV until the date of payment of the D&C Payment. For the purposes of the Project Agreement, Fixtures includes all buildings (including component parts of buildings), other structures, improvements, and roads. If the Crown fails to pay the D&C Payment in full when it is due, the SPV can exercise its ownership rights and remove the Initial Fixtures (cl 11.2(b)). The ownership of the Initial Fixtures retained by the SPV under cl 11.2(a) will be automatically transferred to the Crown on the date of payment of the D&C Payment (cl 11.2(c)). The D&C Payment is a single, contractually fixed, lump sum that the Crown must pay to the SPV on the Service Commencement Date. The D&C Payment is paid to the SPV by the Crown in consideration for the completion of the Facility and the transfer of the ownership in the Initial Fixtures (cl 12.3). No milestone or progress payments are provided for under the Project Agreement. The amount of the D&C Payment is determined by direct reference to the agreed design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding fit-out) together with the SPV’s funding costs during the D&C Phase. Under cl 12.5(c), the Crown and the SPV agree that the D&C Payment includes capitalised interest to the extent that it exceeds the agreed design and construction costs of the Facility. The SPV does not apply a separate margin in respect of the D&C Phase. The D&C Payment is set off against the amount payable by the SPV as the Rental Prepayment for the Facility Lease, as described below. To construct the Facility, the SPV will incur expenditure in connection with designing, obtaining, affixing, constructing and implementing the Initial Fixtures. Other than the costs of fit-out and any funding costs, the expenditure incurred by the SPV on the Facility during the D&C Phase is referred to in this Ruling as the D&C Expenditure. Facility Lease Clause 12.2 of the Project Agreement provides for the Crown and the SPV to enter into a lease in respect of the Facility on or before the date of operational completion. Operational completion is the point at which the SPV has met all the completion criteria specified in the Project Agreement. 3 On the Service Commencement Date, the SPV will be obliged to pay the Rental Prepayment to the Crown, representing the rental to be paid under the Facility Lease (cl 12.3 of the Project Agreement). The Rental Prepayment is (in whole) a payment in the nature of rent that the SPV will make for the use and enjoyment of the land covered by the lease, and substitutes for the rent that the SPV would otherwise need to pay over the term of the lease. Clause 12.4 of the Project Agreement provides for the D&C Payment and the Rental Prepayment to be set off against each other. The total amount of the Rental Prepayment payable by the SPV will equal the amount of the D&C Payment payable by the Crown. Operation and Maintenance Phase During the O&M Phase, the SPV must provide ongoing operational and maintenance services to the Crown as described in the Project Agreement. Broadly, the operational and maintenance services are those services necessary to meet the asset management requirements and will vary depending on the type of asset being constructed. Under cl 49.1 of the Project Agreement, the Crown will pay the SPV a regular payment for the ongoing services provided (the Unitary Charge). The Unitary Charge will be paid following receipt by the Crown of a valid invoice (as defined in cl 49.2) issued by the SPV in accordance with cl 49.3. Payment of the Unitary Charge may be monthly or quarterly, depending on the nature of the Facility. The amount of the Unitary Payment may include incentive payments and will be subject to abatement if the SPV does not meet key performance measures. The total amount of the Unitary Payment over the O&M Phase is expected to recover all of the SPV’s costs in relation to the project and provide for its profit margin. Termination of the Project Agreement The Project Agreement will terminate at the conclusion of the Facility Lease and the O&M Phase, at which time any fit-out will be transferred to the ownership of the Crown for no consideration. The Project Agreement may also be terminated early if either party defaults on its obligations. For the purposes of this Ruling, the Arrangement does not include any early termination that may take place, and this Ruling does not rule on the consequences of early termination. Other contracts To fulfil its obligations under the Project Agreement, the SPV will enter into funding agreements and subcontracts. For the purposes of this Ruling, the Arrangement does not include these other agreements or subcontracts or any ownership structures that may be entered into. These agreements and subcontracts, together with the Project Agreement, will be an “arrangement” as defined in s YA 1 (the wider arrangement. For the avoidance of doubt, this Ruling does not apply where the Project Agreement is part of a wider arrangement that is a “tax avoidance arrangement” (as defined in s YA 1) such that subpart BG applies to void the wider arrangement. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows. 4 D&C Payment  A portion of the D&C Payment will be income under the financial arrangements rules in subpart EW. To the extent that the D&C Payment is not income under the financial arrangements rules: - the D&C Payment will be income of the SPV under s CB 1(1) and will not be of a capital nature under s CB 1(2); and - for the purposes of s CB 1, the SPV will derive the D&C Payment on the Service Commencement Date. D&C Expenditure  The D&C Expenditure is deductible under s DA 1(1), provided that s DA 2(2) to (6) does not apply. The capital limitation in s DA 2(1) does not apply to the D&C Expenditure.  The SPV’s interest in the Initial Fixtures is “revenue account property” as defined in s YA 1. For the purpose of s DB 23, the cost of this revenue account property is equal to the D&C Expenditure.  Section EA 2 applies to the D&C Expenditure, because the D&C Expenditure is the cost of the “revenue account property”. Under s EA 2(2), the deduction for the D&C Expenditure will be allocated to the year in which the Service Commencement Date takes place, because that is when the SPV disposes of the “revenue account property”.  Section GC 1 will not apply to the disposal of the SPV's interest in the Initial Fixtures. Rental Prepayment  The Rental Prepayment is deductible under s DA 1(1). The capital limitation in s DA 2(1) does not apply to the Rental Prepayment.  The accrual expenditure rules (in ss EA 3, CH 2 and DB 50) apply to the Rental Prepayment each year from the Service Commencement Date. To the extent of the unexpired amount (determined under s EA 3(4)) of the Rental Prepayment at the end of an income year, an amount of income is derived by the SPV in that income year and the SPV is allowed a deduction for this amount in the subsequent income year.  The SPV must spread the Rental Prepayment on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease term in order to determine the value of the unexpired portion of expenditure under s EA 3. Unitary Charge  The Unitary Charge will be assessable income of the SPV under s CB 1.  For the purpose of s BD 3, the SPV will derive the Unitary Charge in the income year in which it issues a valid invoice to the Crown. 5 The period or tax year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on 21 October 2013. This Ruling is signed by me on 21 October 2013.

Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss CB 1, CH 2, DA 1, DA 2, DB 50, EA 2 and EA 3. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the design, construction, operation and maintenance of an asset (the Facility) by a partnership (as that term is defined in s YA 1) (the special purpose vehicle – SPV) under a public–private partnership agreement with Her Majesty, The Queen in Right of New Zealand acting by and through a government department (the Crown). The definition of “partnership” in s YA 1 includes a limited partnership and a joint venture that chooses to be treated as a partnership.

How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows. D&C Payment  A portion of the D&C Payment will be income under the financial arrangements rules in subpart EW. To the extent that the D&C Payment is not income under the financial arrangements rules: - each partner’s share of the D&C Payment (calculated in accordance with s HG 2) will be income of the partner under s CB 1(1) and will not be of a capital nature under s CB 1(2); and 9 - for the purposes of s CB 1, each partner will derive the D&C Payment on the Service Commencement Date. D&C Expenditure  Subject to s HG 11 in the case of a “limited partnership” (as defined in s YA 1), each partner’s share of the D&C Expenditure (calculated in accordance with s HG 2) is deductible under s DA 1(1), provided that s DA 2(2) to (6) does not apply. The capital limitation in s DA 2(1) does not apply to the D&C Expenditure.  Each partner’s share of the SPV’s interest in the Initial Fixtures (calculated in accordance with s HG 2) is “revenue account property” as defined in s YA 1. For the purpose of s DB 23, the cost of this revenue account property is equal to the D&C Expenditure.  Section EA 2 applies to the D&C Expenditure, because the D&C Expenditure is the cost of the “revenue account property”. Under s EA 2(2), the deduction for the D&C Expenditure will be allocated to the year in which the Service Commencement Date takes place, because that is when the “revenue account property” is disposed of.  Section GC 1 will not apply to the disposal of each partner’s share of the SPV’s interest in the Initial Fixtures. Rental Prepayment  Subject to s HG 11 in the case of a “limited partnership” (as defined in s YA 1), each partner’s share of the Rental Prepayment (calculated in accordance with s HG 2) is deductible under s DA 1(1). The capital limitation in s DA 2(1) does not apply to the Rental Prepayment.  The accrual expenditure rules (in ss EA 3, CH 2 and DB 50) apply to the Rental Prepayment each year from the Service Commencement Date. To the extent of the unexpired amount (determined under s EA 3(4)) of the Rental Prepayment at the end of an income year, an amount of income is derived by each partner in that income year and the partner is allowed a deduction for this amount in the subsequent income year.  Each partner must spread their share of the Rental Prepayment (calculated in accordance with s HG 2) on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease term in order to determine the value of the unexpired portion of expenditure under s EA 3. Unitary Charge  Each partner’s share of the Unitary Charge (calculated in accordance with s HG 2) will be assessable income of the partner under s CB 1.  For the purpose of s BD 3, each partner will derive the Unitary Charge in the income year in which the SPV issues a valid invoice to the Crown. 10 The period or tax year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on 21 October 2013.

The Treasury has prepared a standard form contract to govern all public– private partnership (PPP) projects in New Zealand (the Project Agreement). Key clauses of the Project Agreement are included in Appendix B. The Project Agreement will form the basis of the agreement between the Crown and the preferred or successful bidder (the special purpose vehicle – SPV) in any future PPP project. 2. The Project Agreement also forms the basis of the Arrangement on which the Public Rulings are issued. The Public Rulings set out the income tax treatment of the main components of the Project Agreement. Tax Administration Act 1994 3. Under Part 5A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), the Commissioner has the ability to make binding rulings. The purpose of this ability is to provide taxpayers with certainty about the way the Commissioner will apply taxation laws and to help taxpayers to meet their obligations under those laws (s 91A). 4. Under s 91D, the Commissioner can make public rulings on how a taxation law applies to any type of person and any type of arrangement. Public rulings interpret how a taxation law applies to a specific type of arrangement that has a wide general application. The Public Rulings are public rulings that set out how the income tax laws apply to the standard form Project Agreement, as the Project Agreement will be used as the basis for all future PPP projects. Provided that the relevant clauses of the Project Agreement are not amended in a material way, the Public Rulings 12 will apply to give certainty to future preferred bidders regarding the application of the taxation laws contained in the Public Rulings. 5. Under s 91E, the Commissioner can make private rulings on how a taxation law applies to a specific person(s) and a specific arrangement on which the ruling is sought. A private ruling can be applied for by a preferred bidder in relation to the specific structure being entered into, to give certainty on the application of the taxation laws to that structure (particularly in relation to taxation laws that are not included in the Public Rulings). For more information on private rulings, see our booklet Binding rulings: How to get certainty on the tax position of your transaction (IR715) which is available from the Inland Revenue website. 6. The term “taxation law” is defined in s 91C, which provides that the Commissioner can make a ruling on most provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007. For current purposes, the key exception is that the Commissioner is unable to make a ruling where the matter is or could be the subject of a determination under s 90AC (which relates to the application of the financial arrangements rules). This means that the Commissioner is unable to provide a binding ruling in respect of many issues relating to the application of the financial arrangements rules in subpart EW, but must instead make a financial arrangements rules determination under s 90AC in order to give taxpayers certainty. 7. Therefore, in order for a bidder to obtain certainty in relation to the application of the taxation laws in any particular PPP project, it is likely that a combination of the Public Rulings, a private ruling and a financial arrangements rules determination will be necessary. 8. Any preferred or successful bidder is strongly advised to apply for a private ruling and a financial arrangements rules determination in respect of its specific structure to provide certainty on any issues that are not addressed in the Rulings. The Crown may require the successful bidder to obtain a favourable private ruling in respect of issues not addressed in the Public Rulings. Application of the Legislation 9. The term SPV is used in this commentary as a generic term to refer to the successful bidder who enters into a Project Agreement with the Crown. It is used in this commentary to refer to either a company or a partner’s share in a partnership, as relevant. SPV is carrying on a “business” 10. The term “business” is defined in s YA 1, and includes “any profession, trade, or undertaking carried on for profit”. The leading New Zealand case on the meaning of “business” is Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682 (CA). 11. In Grieve, Richardson J held that determining whether a business existed involved a two-fold enquiry into the:  nature of the activities carried on; and  intention of the taxpayer in engaging in those activities. 13 12. By entering into the Project Agreement with the Crown, the SPV will be responsible for the design and construction of the Facility and the provision of ongoing operational services to the Crown over a period of approximately 25 years. The SPV will also intend to make a profit from entering into the Project Agreement through the receipt of the Unitary Charge. 13. Therefore, the SPV will have the requisite level of activities and intention to profit and will be carrying on a “business” (as defined in s YA 1). This will be the case even if all of the obligations under the Project Agreement are subcontracted to other persons. Application of the financial arrangement rules 14. The Project Agreement is a “financial arrangement” as defined in s EW 3, and will be part of a wider financial arrangement that also includes any funding agreements and subcontracts the SPV enters into. 15. The Design and Construction (D&C) Phase of the Project Agreement is a financial arrangement as defined in s EW 3. Under the D&C Phase, the SPV will receive consideration from the Crown (in the form of the D&C Payment) and will provide consideration to the Crown (in the form of the Facility). The SPV and the Crown agree that the D&C Payment includes capitalised interest (cl 12.5(c) of the Project Agreement). The effect of cl 12.5(c) will be that part of the D&C Payment will be income under the financial arrangements rules in subpart EW. It is likely that Commissioner would determine that the amount of income will be equal to the capitalised interest that the parties agree is included in the D&C Payment. However, to obtain certainty on this point, the SPV is strongly advised to apply for a financial arrangements rules determination, which will determine the value of the Facility (under s EW 32(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and s 90AC of the Tax Administration Act 1994), the amount of income derived under the financial arrangement rules and how that income should be spread over the term of the D&C Phase. 16. It is likely that no income or expenditure arises under the financial arrangement rules in subpart EW in relation to the Facility Lease and the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Phase of the Project Agreement, for the following reasons:  The Facility Lease is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(9). The Rental Prepayment is solely attributable to that excepted financial arrangement, so is not taken into account under the financial arrangement rules in accordance with s EW 6(2).  The O&M Phase is a “short-term agreement for sale and purchase” (as defined in s YA 1) of services and is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(22). In accordance with s EW 6(3), amounts solely attributable to this excepted financial arrangement are taken into account under the financial arrangement rules. However, because the consideration the SPV pays (that is, the services provided to the Crown) is equal in value to the consideration the SPV receives (the Unitary Charge), there is no amount to spread under the financial arrangement rules. 14 17. Therefore, the SPV must recognise amounts paid and received under the Facility Lease and the O&M Phase of the Project Agreement as income derived or expenditure incurred under the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 (outside the financial arrangement rules) in accordance with the Public Rulings. 18. Any successful bidder is strongly advised to apply for a financial arrangements rules determination in respect of its specific structure. See Special Determination S22: “Application of the financial arrangements rules to a public–private partnership” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 9 (October/November 2012)) for an example of a financial arrangements rules determination issued in respect of a PPP project dealing with similar issues. Design and Construction Payment 19. As noted in para 15, to the extent that the D&C Payment consists of capitalised interest, the financial arrangements rules in subpart EW apply to the D&C Payment. The remainder of the D&C Payment will be an amount that the SPV derives from a business, so will be income under s CB 1(1). The D&C Payment will not be of a capital nature under s CB 1(2). 20. Other than any amount required to be spread under the financial arrangements rules, the SPV will derive the D&C Payment on the Service Commencement Date in consideration for performing its obligations under the Project Agreement and the transfer of the SPV’s ownership interest in the Initial Fixtures. Design and Construction Expenditure 21. Clause 11.2 of the Project Agreement makes it clear that the SPV retains ownership of the Initial Fixtures and disposes of that ownership on the Service Commencement Date in consideration for the D&C Payment. The ownership interest retained by the SPV in the Initial Fixtures (under cl 11.2) is “revenue account property” (as defined in s YA 1). The “cost” of the revenue account property is equal to the D&C Expenditure. Therefore, s DB 23 applies to override the capital limitation in s DA 2(1). 22. As the SPV is in business, the D&C Expenditure will be deductible under s DA 1. The capital limitation in s DA 2(1) will not apply to the D&C Expenditure, because of the application of s DB 23. Whether the other limitations in s DA 2 apply to the D&C Expenditure will depend on the nature of the structure and other arrangements the SPV enters into, which is outside the scope of the Public Rulings. 23. Section EA 2 applies to determine the timing of the deduction for the D&C Expenditure. Section EA 2(2) provides that the SPV will be entitled to a deduction for the cost of revenue account property in the earlier of the income year in which the person disposes of the property or the property ceases to exist. 24. Under the Project Agreement, the SPV will dispose of the “revenue account property” for the D&C Payment on the Service Commencement Date. Therefore, the SPV will be entitled to claim a deduction for the D&C 15 Expenditure in the income year in which the Service Commencement Date occurs. Matching of Design and Construction Expenditure and Payment 25. The effect of the above conclusions are that the D&C Expenditure will be deductible to the SPV in the same income year that the SPV receives the D&C Payment, being the income year in which the Service Commencement Date occurs. Rental Prepayment 26. The courts have held that if a taxpayer incurs rental expenditure as part of their income-earning process that expenditure will be of a revenue nature: FCT v South Australian Battery Makers Pty Ltd (1978) 78 ATC 4,412; Wattie v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,712. 27. The Rental Prepayment is (in whole) a payment in the nature of rent that the SPV will make for the use and enjoyment of the land covered by the Facility Lease, and substitutes for the rent that the SPV would otherwise need to pay over the term of the Facility Lease. That the Lease Prepayment is “prepaid” in one lump sum does not change its character for tax purposes: JP Hancock v General Reversionary and Investment Co Ltd \[1919\] 1 KB 25; J Gadsden & Co v CIR \[1965\] NZLR 385; National Australia Bank Ltd v FC of T (1997) 37 ATR 378. 28. As the SPV is in business and the Facility Lease is part of its income- earning process, the Rental Prepayment will be deductible under s DA 1. The Rental Prepayment will not be subject to the capital limitation in s DA 2(1). 29. Section EA 3 applies in relation to the timing of the deduction for the Rental Prepayment. Where s EA 3 applies, s EA 3(3) states: The unexpired portion of a person’s expenditure at the end of an income year— (a) is income of the person in the income year under section CH 2 (Adjustment for prepayments); and (b) is an amount for which the person is allowed a deduction in the following income year under section DB 50 (Adjustment for prepayments). 30. The Rental Prepayment is made in respect of the Facility Lease, which is a “good” for the purposes of s EA 3 (being an interest in land and therefore real property). The Rental Prepayment is not made in respect of services, a chose in action or an allowance reimbursing employees. Therefore, the unexpired portion must be determined in accordance with s EA 3(4). 31. Section EA 3(4) states that an amount of expenditure on goods is unexpired at the end of an income year if the:  person has not used up the goods in deriving income; and  goods are not destroyed or rendered useless for the purpose of deriving income. 16 32. The term “used” in the context of s EA 3(4) means being expended through being consumed or incorporated into other assets: Thornton Estates Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,577 (CA). 33. In the context of a lease of property, the goods are used up evenly over the term of the lease. The unexpired portion at the end of an income year will cover the portion of the expenditure that relates to the portion of the lease that is yet to take place. 34. Therefore, the “unexpired” portion of the Rental Prepayment, in terms of s EA 3(4), will be the portion that relates to the outstanding term of the lease at the end of each income year. This means the Rental Prepayment will be spread evenly over the term of the lease (on a straight-line basis). Unitary Charge 35. Because the SPV is in business, the Unitary Charge will be income of the SPV under s CB 1. 36. Section BD 3 requires every amount of income to be allocated to the income year in which it is derived. Case law on the meaning of the term establishes that an amount is “derived” when the income-earning process is complete. Once the SPV has undertaken the operational and maintenance services and issued the Crown with a valid invoice (as defined in cl 49.2 of the Project Agreement), the income-earning process will be complete and the Unitary Charge will have been derived. Section BG 1 37. It is the Commissioner’s opinion that the Project Agreement is not a “tax avoidance arrangement” (as defined in s YA 1) for the purposes of s BG 1. However, as noted in the Public Rulings, the Project Agreement is part of a wider arrangement that also consists of any funding agreements and subcontracts that the SPV may enter into. 38. For the purposes of s BG 1, the wider arrangement will be an “arrangement” (as defined in s YA 1) and the Commissioner could potentially conclude that the wider arrangement entered into by the SPV is a “tax avoidance arrangement” that is void pursuant to s BG 1. 39. Although the Commissioner considers it unlikely, if s BG 1 applied to the wider arrangement, any reconstruction under s GA 1 could potentially affect the conclusions reached in the Public Rulings in relation to the income tax treatment of the Project Agreement. The Commissioner is unable to reach a conclusion on the application of s GA 1 and the appropriate reconstruction to make without knowing the full details of the “tax avoidance arrangement” entered into. For this reason, the Public Rulings do not and cannot rule on the potential application of s BG 1. 40. It is the Commissioner’s view that s BG 1 is unlikely to apply to any arrangement where:  the funding agreements are straight-forward loans entered into on an arm’s length basis with third-party lenders on market terms; 17  any related party funding does not have any artificial features and is entered into on an arm’s length basis on market terms; and  any subcontracts are entered into on an arm’s length basis on market terms. 41. However, because each particular PPP arrangement entered into will differ, the Commissioner needs to consider the facts of any arrangement entered into before reaching a definitive conclusion on the potential application of s BG 1. Any successful bidder is strongly advised to apply for a private binding ruling in respect of its specific arrangement if it wants certainty regarding the Commissioner’s view on s BG 1.

Section BD 3 provides: BD 3 Allocation of income to particular income years Application (1) Every amount of income must be allocated to an income year under this section. General rule (2) An amount of income is allocated to the income year in which the amount is derived, unless a provision in any of Parts C or E to I provides for allocation on another basis. Interpretation of derive (3) When the time of derivation of an amount of income is being determined, regard must be had to case law, which— (a) requires some people to recognise income on an accrual basis; and (b) requires other people to recognise income on a cash basis; and (c) more generally, defines the concept of derivation. Income credited in account (4) Despite subsection (3), income that has not previously been derived by a person is treated as being derived when it is credited in their account or, in some other way, dealt with in their interest or on their behalf. Role of Part E (5) Part E (Timing and quantifying rules) contains a number of provisions that— (a) specifically modify the allocation of income or have the effect of modifying the allocation of income; or (b) allocate income as part of the process of quantifying it. Single allocation (6) An amount of income may be allocated only once. 2. Section CB 1 provides: CB 1 Amounts derived from business Income (1) An amount that a person derives from a business is income of the person. Exclusion (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an amount that is of a capital nature. 3.

Income (2) The unexpired amount is income of the person in the income year. 4. Section DA 1 provides: DA 1 General permission Nexus with income (1) A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss, including an amount of depreciation loss, to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is— 19 (a) incurred by them in deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income. General permission (2) Subsection (1) is called the general permission. Avoidance arrangements (3) Section GB 33 (Arrangements involving depreciation loss) may apply to override the general permission in relation to an amount of depreciation loss. 5. Section DB 2 provides: DA 2 General limitations Capital limitation (1) A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a capital nature. This rule is called the capital limitation. Private limitation (2) A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. This rule is called the private limitation. Exempt income limitation (3) A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in deriving exempt income. This rule is called the exempt income limitation. Employment limitation (4) A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in deriving income from employment. This rule is called the employment limitation. Withholding tax limitation (5) A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in deriving non-resident passive income of the kind referred to in section RF 2(3) (Non-resident passive income). This rule is called the withholding tax limitation. Non-residents’ foreign-sourced income limitation (6) A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in deriving non-residents’ foreign-sourced income. This rule is called the non-residents’ foreign-sourced income limitation. Relationship of general limitations to general permission (7) Each of the general limitations in this section overrides the general permission. 6. Section DB 23 provides: DB 23 Cost of revenue account property Deduction (1) A person is allowed a deduction for expenditure that they incur as the cost of revenue account property. No deduction 20 (2) Despite subsection (1), a person is denied a deduction for expenditure incurred as the cost of revenue account property if— (a) Repealed. (b) section CX 55, CX 56B, or CX 56C (which relate to portfolio investment income) applies to income derived by the person from the disposal of the revenue account property. Link with subpart DA (3) Subsection (1) overrides the capital limitation but the general permission must still be satisfied. Subsection (2) overrides the general permission. The other general limitations still apply. 7. Section DB 50 provides: DB 50 Adjustment for prepayments When this section applies (1) This section applies when a person has, under section EA 3 (Prepayments), an unexpired amount of expenditure at the end of an income year. Deduction (2) The person is allowed a deduction for the unexpired amount for the following income year. Link with subpart DA (3) This section supplements the general permission. The general limitations still apply, but not to the extent to which any relevant general limitation was overridden by a provision that initially allowed a deduction for the expenditure, whether in this Act or an earlier Act. 8. Section EA 2 provides: EA 2 Other revenue account property When this section applies (1) This section applies to revenue account property that is not— (a) trading stock valued under subpart EB (Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock)): (b) livestock valued under subpart EC (Valuation of livestock): (c) an excepted financial arrangement valued under subpart ED (Valuation of excepted financial arrangements): (d) a film or a film right to which sections EJ 4toEJ 8 (which relate to films) apply: (e) a specified lease or a lease to which section EJ 10 (Personal property lease payments) applies: (f) property that arises as a result of petroleum development expenditure or petroleum exploration expenditure to which sections EJ 12toEJ 20 (which relate to petroleum mining) apply: (g) a financial arrangement valued under subpart EW (Financial arrangements rules).

Allowances reimbursing employees (7) In the case of expenditure subject to sections CW 17, CW 17B, CW 17C, and CW 18 (which relate to expenditure, reimbursement, and allowances of employees), this section applies on the basis that the relevant services were performed in the income year in which the employee’s expenditure is expected to occur. Commissioner’s discretionary relief (8) The Commissioner may excuse a person from complying with this section under section 91AAC of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 22 10. Section HG 2 provides: HG 2 Partnerships are transparent Look-through in accordance with share (1) For the purposes of a partner's liabilities and obligations under this Act in their capacity of partner of a partnership, unless the context requires otherwise,— (a) the partner is treated as carrying on an activity carried on by the partnership, and having a status, intention, and purpose of the partnership, and the partnership is treated as not carrying on the activity or having the status, intention, or purpose: (b) the partner is treated as holding property that a partnership holds, in proportion to the partner's partnership share, and the partnership is treated as not holding the property: (c) the partner is treated as being party to an arrangement to which the partnership is a party, in proportion to the partner's partnership share, and the partnership is treated as not being a party to the arrangement: (d) the partner is treated as doing a thing and being entitled to a thing that the partnership does or is entitled to, in proportion to the partner's partnership share, and the partnership is treated as not doing the thing or being entitled to the thing. No streaming (2) Despite subsection (1), for a partner in their capacity of partner of a partnership, the amount of income, tax credit, rebate, gain, expenditure, or loss that they have from a particular source, or of a particular nature, is calculated by multiplying the total income, tax credit, rebate, gain, expenditure, or loss of the partners of the partnership from the particular source or of the particular nature by the partner's partnership share in the partnership's income. Expenditure or loss previously incurred (3) A partner of a partnership may be treated as incurring an expenditure or loss which the partnership incurs ignoring this section, despite the partner not being a partner at the time the expenditure or loss is incurred. This subsection does not allow 2 deductions for 1 expenditure or loss. Excluded amounts (4) Subsection (2) does not apply to the following amounts: (a) expenditure or loss that relates to a person entering a partnership by acquiring partner's interests disposed of by another partner, to the extent to which sections HG 5toHG 10 do not apply to the partner's interests: (b) supplementary dividends, to the extent to which subpart LP (Tax credits for supplementary dividends) applies: (c) Repealed. (d) imputation credits, to the extent to which section LE 6 (Partners in partnerships) applies: (e) FDP credits, to the extent to which section LF 4 (Partners in partnerships) applies. 11. Section HG 11 provides: HG 11 Limitation on deductions by partners in limited partnerships When this section applies (1) This section applies for a limited partnership and an income year when, but for this section, a deduction by virtue of section HG 2 or HG 12 is allowed to— (a) a limited partner of the limited partnership: (b) a general partner of the partnership who— 23 (i) was a limited partner of the limited partnership within 60 days of the last day of the income year; and (ii) is or will be a limited partner of the limited partnership within 60 days after the last day of the income year. No deduction (2) The partner is denied the deduction for an income year to the extent to which their limited partnership deduction for the income year is greater than the amount (the partner's basis) calculated using the formula in subsection (3) on the last day of the income year. Partner's basis (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the amount that is the partner's basis is calculated using the following formula: investments − distributions + income − deductions − disallowed amount. Definition of items in formula (4) The items in the formula are defined in subsections (5)to(9). Investments (5) Investments is the total of— (a) the market value of capital contributions made by the partner to the limited partnership at the time the relevant contribution is contributed or agreed to be contributed by them: (b) the amount paid by the partner for the assignment of capital contributions to them: (c) the secured amounts. Distributions (6) Distributions is the total of— (a) the market value of distributions to the partner from the limited partnership: (b) the amount paid to the partner for the assignment of capital contributions by them. Income (7) Income is the total of— (a) income that the partner has by virtue of section HG 2 in the income year and previous income years: (ab) if the partner has FIF income or a FIF loss, an amount under subsection (7B): (b) capital gain amounts under section CD 44(7)(a) (Available capital distribution amount) that the partner would have by virtue of section HG 2 in the income year and previous income years, if the partner were treated as a company for the purposes of section CD 44(7)(a), unless the gain is accounted for under paragraph (a): (c) assessable income that the partner has in previous income years from goods and services they contributed to the limited partnership, if the income is not accounted for under subsection (5) or paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection. Formula (7B) The amount described in subsection (7)(ab) is given by the following formula, but if the calculation returns a negative number, the amount is zero: dividend – FIF amount. 24 Definition of items in formula (7C) In the formula,— (a) dividend is the amount that would be the partner's share of the dividend paid by a FIF to the limited partnership, if section CD 36(1) (Foreign investment fund income) were ignored: (b) FIF amount is— (i) zero, if subparagraph (ii) does not apply: (ii) the amount that is the person's FIF income, for the relevant income year and FIF, if the person has such an amount. Deductions (8) Deductions is the total of— (a) expenditure or loss in previous income years, to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is incurred by virtue of section HG 2 in the partner deriving income by virtue of section HG 2, excluding any deductions denied in those previous years under this section: (b) capital loss amounts under section CD 44(9) that the partner would have by virtue of section HG 2 in the income year and previous income years..., if the partner is treated as a company for the purposes of section CD 44(9), unless the loss is accounted for under paragraph (a): (c) deductions that the partner is allowed in previous income year in relation to assessable income described in subsection (7)(c), if the deduction is not accounted for under subsection (6) or paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section. Disallowed amounts (9) Disallowed amount is the amount of investments, as defined in subsection (5), made by the partner within 60 days of the last day of the income year, if those investments are or will be distributed or reduced within 60 days after the last day of the income year. Exclusion (10) This section does not deny a partner (the exiting partner) a deduction that is equal to or less than the amount of net income that the exiting partner has for the amount paid or payable to the exiting partner for the disposal of their partner's interests, ignoring other transactions.

1 Note (not part of the Rulings): These Rulings are a reissue of BR Pub 10/01 to 10/05 and apply from the beginning of the first day of the 2013/14 income year (ie the date of the expiry of the previous Rulings). These five Public Rulings, BR Pub 14/01 to BR Pub 14/05, deal with the ability of a New Zealand resident partner of an Australian limited partnership to claim foreign tax credits for Australian income tax and dividend withholding tax paid by an Australian limited partnership. The Rulings do not consider any other situations involving foreign income and foreign tax paid. The Rulings discuss Australian limited partnerships that are corporate limited partnerships for Australian tax purposes and are treated under Australian tax law as companies while in New Zealand they retain partnership and flow through tax treatment. A foreign tax credit will be available to the New Zealand partners of an Australian limited partnership for Australian income tax or dividend withholding tax that is paid by the limited partnership in certain situations (detailed below). The amount and timing of the tax credit is determined under subpart LJ of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Foreign tax credits for Australian tax paid by Australian limited partnerships are available to New Zealand resident partners, in proportion to their partnership share, when all the following are met:  the Australian limited partnership is treated as a company for Australian income tax purposes but not for New Zealand tax purposes;  the income on which the tax was paid is assessable in New Zealand; and  the Australian tax paid was paid on the income that is assessable in New Zealand. 2 Background 2. The question being considered is whether a foreign tax credit is available to New Zealand residents that earn Australian source income through a limited partnership registered in a state of Australia (that is an Australian limited partnership). 3. BR Pub 14/01 to BR Pub 14/05 are reissues of BR Pub 10/01 to BR Pub 10/05 published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011). BR Pub 10/01 to BR Pub 10/05 expired on the last day of the 2012/13 income year. 4. The relevant Australian limited partnerships are those that are treated as corporate limited partnerships for Australian income tax purposes, under s 94D of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Aust), but do not meet the definition of “company” in s YA 1 of the New Zealand Income Tax Act 2007. The Australian law on limited partnerships registered in Australia and the Australian tax treatment must be considered before looking at the relevant foreign tax credit legislation in New Zealand. Australian partnerships 5. There are three types of Australian partnerships. The three types are:  (ordinary) partnerships; 1  limited partnerships; and  incorporated limited partnerships. 6. The three different types of partnerships are taxed differently under Australian income tax law. (Ordinary) partnerships 7. The first, and most common, type of Australian partnership is an ordinary partnership. The regulation of ordinary partnerships in Australia falls under state law which includes the:  Partnership Act 1958 (Victoria);  Partnership Act 1892 (New South Wales);  Partnership Act 1891 (Queensland);  Partnership Act 1963 (Australian Capital Territory);  Partnership Act 1891 (South Australia);  Partnership Act 1891 (Tasmania);  Partnership Act 1997 (Northern Territory); and  The Partnership Act 1895 (Western Australia). 8. These Acts provide that an ordinary partnership is the relation between people carrying on a business in common with a view of profit. The partners are jointly and severally liable for the legal actions and debts of the partnership, have management control, share the profits of the partnership in predefined proportions, and have apparent authority as 1 Referred to as “partnerships” in Australian state legislation. 3 agents of the partnership to bind all the other partners in contracts with third parties. An ordinary partnership is not a separate legal entity. Limited partnerships 9. The second type of Australian partnership is a limited partnership. Limited partnerships in Australia can be formed and registered only under:  Part 3, ss 49 – 79 Partnership Act 1958 (Victoria);  Part 3, ss 50A – 81A Partnership Act 1892 (New South Wales);  Chapter 3, ss 48 – 69 Partnership Act 1891 (Queensland);  Part 3, ss 47-84 – Partnership Act 1891 (South Australia);  Limited Partnership Act, 1908 (Tasmania); and  Limited Partnership Act, 1909 (Western Australia). 10. The state laws require a limited partnership to satisfy the general law requirements of a partnership (set out at \[8\] above), as far as they are consistent with the requirements for a limited partnership discussed below. The partnership laws of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory do not allow for limited partnerships; they only allow for incorporated limited partnerships. 11. The provisions, listed above, provide that a limited partnership is one where there are both general partners and limited partners. The general partners have the rights and obligations as in an ordinary partnership. The limited partners are not jointly and severally liable for the debts of the partnership and their exposure is limited to their partnership investments, and a corresponding share of the profits. The limited partners also cannot participate in the management of the partnership or act as an agent for the partnership. Despite the limited liability of the limited partner(s), a limited partnership does not have a separate legal identity (unless it is an incorporated limited partnership). Incorporated limited partnerships 12. The third type of Australian partnership is an incorporated limited partnership. An incorporated limited partnership is a type of limited partnership, but because of its incorporation it is treated differently under Australian law. The Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia allow incorporated limited partnerships. An incorporated limited partnership is a partnership that must have at least one general partner and one limited partner. Under the relevant state laws, the partnership is a separate legal entity with the powers and capacity of a natural person subject to the limitations in the partnership agreement. As discussed below, an incorporated limited partnership is not a partnership under New Zealand’s Income Tax Act 2007 because it is a separate legal entity under Australian state laws. As a result, incorporated limited partnerships are not covered by these Rulings. Australian tax treatment of Australian limited partnerships 13. A “limited partnership” is defined in s 995-1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Aust) 2 as: 2 The definition in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Aust) is the same and referenced to that in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Aust). 4 (a) an association of persons (other than a company) carrying on business as partners or in receipt of ordinary income or statutory income jointly, where the liability of at least one of those persons is limited; or (b) an association of persons (other than one referred to in paragraph (a)) with legal personality separate from those persons that was formed solely for the purpose of becoming a VCLP, an ESVCLP, an AFOF or a VCMP and to carry on activities that are carried on by a body of that kind. 3 Corporate limited partnerships 14. Section 94D of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Aust), Corporate Limited Partnerships, provides that a limited partnership is a corporate limited partnership if:  the year of income is the 1995-96 or later year of income; or  the partnership was formed on or after 19 August 1992; or  the partnership was formed before 19 August 1992 and either it does not pass the continuity of business test set out in Division 5A at s 94E, or there has been a change in composition of the partnership after 19 August 1992 and no election has been made by the partners under s 94F that the partnership not be treated as a corporate limited partnership; and  the limited partnership is not either a foreign hybrid limited partnership 4 in relation to the particular year of income, or a VCLP, an ESVCLP, an AFOF or a VCMP. 15. These rulings only apply to limited partnerships that are also corporate limited partnerships under s 94D of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Aust). Corporate limited partnerships do not have identities separate from their members. Section 94D excludes certain limited partnerships (VCLP, ESVCLP, AFOF, venture capital management partnerships, and foreign hybrid limited partnerships (defined in footnote 3 below)) from being corporate limited partnerships. 16. Division 5A concerns the taxation of limited partnerships. Nothing in Division 5A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Aust) overrides the state partnership laws by recharacterising limited partnerships as companies. Division 5A simply treats a limited partnership that also meets the test for a corporate limited partnership as a company for certain Australian income tax purposes. In particular, subdivision C of Division 5A provides:  company includes a reference to a corporate limited partnership (s 94J);  partnership does not include a reference to a corporate limited partnership (s 94K);  dividend includes a reference to a distribution made by a corporate limited partnership (s 94L). 3 A VCLP is a venture capital limited partnership and defined in s 118-405(2) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Aust); an ESVCLP is an early stage venture capital limited partnership and defined in s 118-407(4) of the 1997 Act; an AFOF is an Australian venture capital fund of funds defined in s 118-410(3) of the 1997 Act and a venture capital management partnership is defined in s 94D(3) of the 1936 Act. In all cases these types of limited partnership must have been registered under Part 2 of the Venture Capital Act 2002 (Aust). 4 A foreign hybrid limited partnership is formed outside Australia as defined in ss 830-10(1) and (2) of Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Aust). 5 17. This is discussed in the explanatory memorandum to the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 6) 1992 (Aust) that accompanied the introduction of subdivision C Division 5A: Under the existing law, limited partnerships are treated as partnerships for taxation purposes. However, the structure of a limited partnership is comparable to that of a limited liability company in that there are "limited partners" who are similar to shareholders in a company; they do not take part in the management of the business, and their liability generally is limited to the extent of their investment. Limited partners are not at risk beyond the limit of their liability. Generally, their liability is limited to their investment. They are not required to make good losses of their partnership, nor are they liable to meet the obligations of the partnership. If limited partners are treated in the same way as partners in any other partnership, however, they may benefit from distributions of losses that exceed their limited liability. Those losses could be used to reduce taxable income, and so tax paid, even though the loss is not one that exposes the partner to any risk of having to meet obligations or make good losses. State legislation enabling the formation of limited partnerships currently exists in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania. Explanation of proposed amendments The Bill will amend the Principal Act to introduce taxation arrangements in new Division 5A of Part III of the Act for taxing limited partnerships ... The object of this new Division is to ensure that limited partnerships will be treated as companies for taxation purposes. This is not confined to the payment of income tax by limited partnerships, but includes all other purposes under income tax law, including the payment of tax by partners in limited partnerships; for instance, imputation and the taxation of dividends to shareholders ... \[Emphasis added\] Australian tax consolidated groups 18. The introduction of Australia’s consolidation rules reinforced that corporate limited partnerships are to be treated as companies for Australian income tax law. The explanatory memorandum to the New Business Tax System (Consolidation) Act (No. 1) 2002 (Aust) makes it clear that corporate limited partnerships can also be head companies within that regime because they are sufficiently equivalent to a company for Australian income tax purposes. 3.29 To qualify as a head company, an entity must be a company as defined in s 995-1 of the ITAA 1997. 3.30 A corporate limited partnership will also satisfy this requirement. This is consistent with the objective of ensuring consolidated groups generally receive a tax treatment like ordinary companies because these partnerships are effectively treated as companies for income tax purposes. 19. The effect of becoming a head company in an Australian consolidated group is that all the income of the group is deemed to have been earned by the head company and not by the individual companies in the group: s 701 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Aust). Application of the Legislation Australian limited partnerships under New Zealand income tax law Legislation 20. As these rulings focus on the ability of New Zealand partners to claim foreign tax credits for tax paid or deducted by an Australian limited partnership, the key provisions in the Act are: 6  the definitions of “company”, “partnership”, and “limited partnership” in s YA 1;  section HG 2, which sets out that partnerships are transparent;  section CB 35, which sets out that income arising from subpart HG is assessable income to the partner;  section BH 1, which sets out the relationship between the Double Taxation Relief (Australia) Order 2010 and subpart LJ. The Schedule to the Double Taxation Relief (Australia) Order 2010 contains the Convention between Australia and New Zealand for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income and fringe benefits and the prevention of fiscal evasion (signed 29 June 2009, entered into force 18 March 2010) (the Australia and New Zealand Double Tax Agreement); and  subpart LJ, which determines the amount and timing of a foreign credit. 21. In addition to the above provisions, articles 1(2) and 23(3) of the Australia and New Zealand Double Tax Agreement provide New Zealand partners in an Australian limited partnership with relief for Australian income tax and dividend withholding tax paid by the limited partnership. 22. These provisions are discussed below. Limited partnerships 23. Section YA 1 sets out the definition of a company: Company - (a) means a body corporate or other entity that has a legal existence separate from that of its members, whether it is incorporated or created in New Zealand or elsewhere: (ab) does not include a partnership: ... (ac) includes a listed limited partnership: (ad) includes a foreign corporate limited partnership: (b) includes a unit trust: ... 24. A listed limited partnership and a foreign corporate limited partnership are also defined in s YA 1. In essence, they are defined respectively as a New Zealand or overseas limited partnership that is listed on a recognised exchange, and an overseas limited partnership that is treated as a separate legal entity under the partnership laws of the country concerned. 25. Unless an Australian limited partnership is listed on a recognised exchange or the underlying state partnership laws give it a separate legal personality, it will not meet the definition of a company in New Zealand. This is irrespective of whether it is treated as a company for Australian income tax purposes. 26. Section YA 1 defines:  “partnership” in paragraph (d) as meaning a limited partnership; and 7  “limited partnership” as including an overseas limited partnership as defined in s 4 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 but excluding a listed limited partnership or a foreign corporate limited partnership. 27. Section 4 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 defines an overseas limited partnership as: a partnership formed or incorporated outside New Zealand with — (a) 1 or more general partners who are liable for all of the debts and liabilities of the partnership; and (b) 1 or more limited partners who have only limited liability for the debts and liabilities of the partnership 28. Therefore, an Australian limited partnership that:  meets the definition of an “overseas limited partnership” under s 4 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008, and  is not listed on a recognised exchange, and  is not treated as a separate legal entity in Australia under Australian state partnership laws, will be treated as a partnership under New Zealand tax law. Partners in limited partnerships 29. The tax treatment of New Zealand partners in Australian limited partnerships that meet the definition of “partnership” in s YA 1 is set out in s HG 2(2): ... for a partner in their capacity of partner of a partnership, the amount of income, tax credit, rebate, gain, expenditure, or loss that they have from a particular source, or of a particular nature, is calculated by multiplying the total income, tax credit, rebate, gain, expenditure, or loss of the partners of the partnership from the particular source or of the particular nature by the partner’s partnership share in the partnership’s income. 30. “Partnership share” is defined in s YA 1 as meaning for a particular right, obligation, or other property, status or thing, the share that a partner has in the partnership. 31. The effect of s HG 2(2) and the definition of “‘partnership share” is that the assessable income of partners in a partnership includes their “partnership share” of the partnership income. Section CB 35 also confirms that this is assessable income of the partner: A person who is a partner has an amount of income to the extent to which an amount of income results from the application of subpart HG (Joint venturers, partners, and partnerships) to them and their partnership. 32. Section HG 2(2) also makes reference to tax credits. Section LA 10 provides that an amount is a tax credit of a person if it is their tax credit under a provision of Part L. Foreign tax credits arise under subpart LJ so are tax credits under s LA 10. Under s HG 2(2), therefore, partners are entitled to foreign tax credits in proportion to their partnership share. Foreign tax credits 33. The Australian tax considered in these rulings is income tax and dividend withholding tax. Section BH 1(4) means the Australia and New Zealand Double Tax Agreement has an overriding effect as to New Zealand income tax, including the income and tax credit sections of the Income Tax Act 2007. The income and tax credit sections, therefore, must be read 8 together with the relevant Australia and New Zealand Double Tax Agreement articles. Where there is any inconsistency between the two, the domestic law must be read subject to the Australia and New Zealand Double Tax Agreement. The combined effect of the Australia and New Zealand Double Tax Agreement, and s BH 1 and subpart LJ of the Income Tax Act 2007 is that a New Zealand tax resident is allowed a tax credit for Australian income tax and dividend withholding tax. Articles 1(2) and 23(3) of the Australia and New Zealand Double Tax Agreement provide a New Zealand partner in an Australian limited partnership with relief for income tax or dividend withholding tax that the limited partnership pays in Australia. The relief is in the form of a tax credit in New Zealand under subpart LJ. Subpart LJ calculates the amount of the tax credit on the basis of a segment of foreign-sourced income under ss LJ 1(1), LJ 1(2)(a), and LJ 2(1): LJ 1 What this subpart does When tax credits allowed (1) This subpart provides the rules for dividing assessable income from foreign- sourced amounts into segments and allows a tax credit for foreign income tax paid in relation to a segment of that income. Limited application of rules (2) The rules in this subpart apply only when— (a) a person resident in New Zealand derives assessable income that is sourced from outside New Zealand; and ... LJ 2 Tax credits for foreign income tax Amount of credit (1) A person described in section LJ 1(2)(a) has a tax credit for a tax year for an amount of foreign income tax paid on a segment of foreign-sourced income, determined as if the segment were the net income of the person for the tax year. The amount of the New Zealand tax payable is calculated under section LJ 5. \[Emphasis added\]. 34. A “segment of foreign-sourced income” is defined in s LJ 4 as: an amount of assessable income derived from 1 foreign country that comes from 1 source or is of 1 nature. 35. Therefore three key elements must be satisfied for a New Zealand resident partner of an Australian limited partnership to be allowed a foreign tax credit under articles 1(2) and 23(3) of the Australia and New Zealand Double Tax Agreement, and ss BH 1, LJ 1 and HG 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007:  A person resident in New Zealand must derive assessable income sourced from outside New Zealand.  Foreign income tax must be paid.  That foreign income tax must be paid on that foreign-sourced assessable income. 36. It follows that a foreign tax credit is not available where:  There is no assessable income calculated under New Zealand tax law.  No foreign income tax has been paid.  The foreign income tax has not been paid on income that is assessable in New Zealand. 9 37. The foreign income tax could be Australian income tax or dividend withholding tax as appropriate. Examples 38. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. 39. This section of the commentary discusses the specific factual scenarios related to each of the five public rulings. In all cases they involve Australian tax being paid, but the issue is whether a foreign tax credit is available to the New Zealand partners. Whether a foreign tax credit is available turns on whether the three key elements set out above at \[35\] are satisfied. 40. In all five examples the Australian limited partnership (“ALP”) has three partners:  one general partner (“GP”) based in Australia having a 1% partnership share; and  two New Zealand resident limited partners (“NZLP 1” and “NZLP 2”) with 50% and 49% partnership shares respectively (the 50% and 49% partners). In examples 1, 2 and 5, NZLP 1 and NZLP 2 may be either a company or a natural person but in examples 3 and 4 are natural persons only. 41. The partners in examples 3 and 4 are limited to natural persons. If the partners were New Zealand resident companies the dividends would generally be exempt income under s CW 9(1), and so foreign tax credits would not be available. \[As an aside, dividends received by a company in New Zealand are not exempt if one of the exclusions in s CW 9(2) applies. The exclusions in s CW 9(2) include dividends paid in relation to rights that are:  a direct income interest in a foreign company that is a non-attributing interest in a FIF because it falls within one of the relevant exclusions in s CW 9(2)(a); or  a fixed-rate foreign equity (s CW 9(2)(b)); or  rights to a deductible foreign equity distribution (s CW 9(2)(c)). The Commissioner acknowledges that a New Zealand partner could hold a non-attributing interest in a FIF through an ALP, and any dividends received by a corporate partner in such circumstances would not be exempt income. If a partner’s interest is an attributing interest in a FIF, s LJ 2(6) and (7) specify which amount of income is to be used for the foreign tax credit provisions.\] 42. The Australian limited partnership is treated as a corporate limited partnership for Australian income tax law but is treated as a partnership for New Zealand income tax law (as discussed above). 43. To avoid currency exchange issues, the reference to “$” is not a reference to any particular currency; it is used simply for illustrative purposes. 10 Example 1: Australian source income 44. ALP earns trading income in Australia of $100 and pays Australian income tax of $30 on it. 45. The trading income is partnership income to the partners, so they must include their partnership share in their New Zealand taxable income. The Australian income tax is allowed as a foreign tax credit in the same proportion as the partner’s partnership share. This is because the three key elements are met:  The partnership income is assessable to the partners under ss HG 2 and CB 35.  The ALP has paid Australian income tax on the income.  The Australian income tax was paid on the trading income of the ALP (which is the income that is assessable in New Zealand). 46. In the specific example, the 50% partner – NZLP 1 – has assessable income of $50 and a foreign tax credit of $15 and the 49% partner – NZLP 2 – has assessable income of $49 and a foreign tax credit of $14.70. These are their respective partnership shares of the trading income and the Australian income tax paid. 11 Example 2: Distribution made by Australian limited partnership 47. The ALP makes an unfranked distribution to the partners of $100. For Australian income tax purposes, this distribution is treated as a dividend and Australian dividend withholding tax of 15% is deducted. The net amount distributed is then $85 in total. 48. In this situation only the second of the three elements has been met. While the Australian income tax – dividend withholding tax of 15% – has been paid, it has not been paid on New Zealand assessable income. This is because, for New Zealand income tax purposes, the distribution from a partnership would be drawings and not subject to New Zealand income tax. 49. Therefore, no foreign tax credit is available to the New Zealand partners. 50. Example 2, therefore, differs from example 1. In example 1, the partners are treated (under s HG 2) as deriving the income derived by the partnership. As a result, the partners in example 1 are treated as directly deriving the income. The income is taxable in the hands of the partners, and a foreign tax credit is available. 51. In example 2, the payment to the partners is a drawing down of the partners’ capital: Case F123 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,117. The payment does not relate to any income derived by the partnership that has flowed through to the partners under s HG 2. As the payment is drawings it is not taxable in the hands of the partners, and so no foreign tax credit is available. 12 Example 3: Distribution made from unit trust 52. In example 3, the ALP owns units in a unit trust and the New Zealand partners are natural persons. As noted above at \[8\] and \[10\], one of the requirements for an ALP is that it is carrying on a business. The above ALP is in the business of managing various investments (including its investment in the unit trust). As seen above at \[23\], a unit trust is included in the definition of “company” for New Zealand income tax purposes. The unit trust distributes income of $100 to the ALP and the ALP pays income tax on the distribution of $30. 5 53. The payment of the distribution from the unit trust to the ALP is a purely domestic transaction in Australia, so article 1(2) of the DTA does not affect Australia’s taxation rights on that transaction. This means that Australia is allowed to tax the ALP in example 3 to the extent allowed under its taxation laws (and so is not limited by the dividend article in the DTA to 15%). In accordance with the Australia and New Zealand Double Tax Agreement, New Zealand is required to provide relief in the form of foreign tax credits for the income tax paid in Australia by the ALP on the income that is assessable in New Zealand. 54. Under New Zealand income tax law the distribution from an Australian unit trust is treated as a dividend under s CD 1. 55. In this case all three elements are met:  The dividend will be assessable income to the partners under ss CD 1 and HG 2. 5 Under Australian tax law, a distribution from a unit trust is taxed as a distribution from a trust or as a dividend from a company (depending on the circumstances of the unit trust). The reference in this example to a distribution includes both situations. 13  Australian income tax has been paid.  The Australian income tax was paid on the distribution. 56. Therefore a foreign tax credit will be allowed in proportion to the partner’s partnership share of partnership income. Under subpart LJ, the foreign tax credit is limited to the notional tax liability that the taxpayer would have paid on the relevant segment of income in New Zealand. 6 In the current example the relevant partners are natural persons, so the tax credit is limited to their marginal tax rate (being 30% in this example). This means that the 50% partner – NZLP 1 – has dividend income of $50 and a foreign tax credit of $15, while the 49% partner – NZLP 2 – has dividend income of $49 and a foreign tax credit of $14.70. 57. If no Australian income tax is paid on the distribution, the New Zealand partners will not be entitled to a foreign tax credit. This example only deals with the situation where the ALP pays Australian income tax on the same segment of income that is taxable to the New Zealand partners (ie, the distribution). The example does not consider whether a foreign tax credit arises where the Australian unit trust pays tax on the income it derives. 58. Example 3 differs from example 2. The difference between the two examples is that there is assessable income in New Zealand in example 3. Specifically, the payment to the partners in example 2 is a drawing down of the partners’ capital and so is not assessable income in New Zealand. In contrast, in example 3 the partners are deemed to derive directly the dividend income derived by the partnership under s HG 2. The dividend is assessable income of the partners in New Zealand. 6 Under s LJ 5, the foreign tax credit is limited by the notional tax liability on the segment of foreign- sourced income determined as if that segment were the person’s net income for the tax year. The notional tax liability may be modified as necessary by s LJ 5(4). This means that the amount of the foreign tax credit cannot exceed the amount of tax that would have been payable on the income had a foreign tax credit not been available. 14 Example 4: Franked dividend received by Australian limited partnership 59. The ALP is treated as owning a subsidiary company under Australian tax law. The company pays a $70 franked dividend to the ALP. The New Zealand partners of the ALP are natural persons. The underlying basis of the franking credit was income tax the subsidiary company had paid previously on its trading income. While dividends received by the ALP are subject to tax in Australia, the attached franking credit offsets any tax liability on this dividend so the ALP does not pay tax on that income. 60. In this case, only the first element is satisfied. The dividend is assessable income to the partners under ss CD 1 and HG 2(2). The second and third elements are not satisfied because no Australian income tax has been paid on the dividend by the ALP. In Australia, a franking credit reduces the amount of income tax that a taxpayer has to pay: s 4-10 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Aust.). As a result, under the arrangement the ALP had a nil income tax liability for the relevant period, and so paid no income tax. Whatever income tax may have been paid by the subsidiary, the tax was not paid on the segment of income that the New Zealand partners are liable for income tax on (namely the dividend income). 61. In terms of New Zealand assessable income, however, there is dividend income of $35 and $34.30 to the 50% partner and 49% partner respectively. The dividend income derived by the New Zealand partners excludes the amount of franking credits used to reduce the amount of Australian income tax payable. 62. The Commissioner acknowledges that there may be situations where an ALP has insufficient franking credits to reduce the Australian income tax liability to nil. The ALP may then be required to pay the residual income tax liability. The second element would be satisfied in that situation to the extent of the residual income tax paid. In other words, where a dividend is only partially franked or not franked at all, then a foreign tax credit may arise for the income tax actually paid. 15 Example 5: Tax paid by Australian limited partnership as “head company” of an Australian tax consolidated group 63. The ALP, as the head company for a consolidated group of companies (COY 1, COY 2 and COY 3), pays tax on all the taxable income of the consolidated group in Australia. This example excludes situations where one or more of the group entities are in a loss position. 64. The taxable income of the consolidated group is $3,200 and the income tax paid is $960. The group income includes income from the subsidiary companies of $3,000 and the fee income derived by the ALP of $200. 65. Under s HG 2(1) the New Zealand partners are treated as deriving the fee income derived by the ALP. The fee income is treated as assessable income of the partners sourced from outside New Zealand (satisfying the first element). The ALP has paid income tax on the fee income (satisfying the second and third elements). As a result, the three elements are met and a foreign tax credit will be available to the partners of the ALP but only to the extent that the tax paid relates to the fee income. 66. As noted above, the first element requires the New Zealand resident partner to derive assessable income sourced from outside New Zealand. 16 The New Zealand partner, therefore, must derive income according to New Zealand tax law. In the case of the income from the Australian consolidated group of companies that income is not derived by the ALP for New Zealand tax purposes. 67. The New Zealand partners must return their share of the income derived directly by the ALP. That is, $100 and $98 for the 50% partner and 49% partner respectively. The New Zealand partners do not need to return income that was derived by the subsidiary companies. 68. A foreign tax credit will be available for the Australian income tax paid on the income earned directly by the ALP (subject to subpart LJ). In this case the foreign tax credit of $30 will be allowed to the 50% partner – NZLP 1 – and $29.40 to the 49% partner – NZLP 2.

DEDUCTIBILITY– INTEREST REPAYMENTS REQUIRED AS A RESULT OF THE EARLY REPAYMENT OF A FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 14/07 This is a Public Ruling made under s 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss DA 1, DB 6, DB 7, DB 11 and EW 31. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is as follows:  A person places an amount of money on term deposit.  The term deposit is a financial arrangement subject to the financial arrangements rules.  The term deposit contract provides that the rate of interest payable will be reduced in the event of the withdrawal, in part or in full, of the principal sum before the contractual maturity date.  The depositor withdraws the whole or part of the term deposit before the contractual maturity date.  The application of the reduced rate of interest requires the repayment of interest already derived by the depositor or the set-off of interest owed against the principal sum ultimately repaid to the depositor. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: Full withdrawal of the term deposit Where the depositor withdraws the full amount of the term deposit before the contractual maturity date the following applies:  A base price adjustment is required.  The amount of repaid interest is included in the ―consideration‖ element of the base price adjustment.  If the base price adjustment gives rise to a negative amount, that amount is expenditure incurred under the financial arrangements rules.  Expenditure incurred under the financial arrangements rules is deemed to be interest. 2  A deduction may be available under s DB 6 (Interest: not capital expenditure) or s DB 7 (Interest: most companies need no nexus with income).  If a deduction is not available under ss DB 6 or DB 7, a deduction is allowed under s DB 11 to the extent the amount arises from assessable income derived by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years. Partial withdrawal of the term deposit Where the depositor withdraws part of the amount of the term deposit before the contractual maturity date the following applies:  A base price adjustment is not required.  Depositors who are not cash basis persons, and cash basis persons who have elected to adopt a spreading method, must apply Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement when the term deposit is varied by the partial withdrawal. The repaid interest is included in the calculation under the determination and an adjustment is made in the year of variation. Cash basis persons  Depositors who are cash basis persons who have not elected to adopt a spreading method may deduct the repaid interest at the time it is incurred only if the general permission is satisfied. To satisfy the general permission there must be a sufficient relationship between the repayment of the interest and the earning of assessable income. The Commissioner considers the relationship between the repayment and the interest income earned under the term deposit is insufficient to satisfy s DA 1(1)(a). However, the Commissioner considers that a deduction for the repayment may be available under the general permission if it can be shown that the expenditure was incurred in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose set out in s DA 1(1)(b).  If the amount of the repaid interest is not deductible at the time of repayment, it falls to be dealt with on maturity of the deposit through the base price adjustment.  The amount of repaid interest is included in both the ―consideration‖ and ―expenditure‖ elements of the base price adjustment.  If the base price adjustment gives rise to a positive amount, that amount is income derived. However, it is not income to the extent it arises from expenditure incurred under the financial arrangement in earlier income years and for which a deduction was denied.  Therefore, a positive base price adjustment amount in the final year of the term deposit will be reduced by the amount of interest repaid in the year of partial withdrawal. 3 The period or tax year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on 17 December 2013. This Ruling is signed by me on 30 September 2014. Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 1 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 14/07 This commentary is not a legally binding statement. The commentary is intended to help readers understand and apply the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 14/07 (the Ruling). Legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Relevant legislative provisions are reproduced in the Appendix to this commentary.

A depositor who withdraws funds early may have to repay a portion of the interest previously derived under the term deposit. The issue this ruling and commentary deal with is whether and when the repaid amount is deductible. 2. The fact a depositor may have to repay interest if they withdraw a deposit early does not mean interest they receive during the course of the deposit is not derived by the depositor. At the time of receipt or crediting of interest, the depositor has earned that interest and it is theirs to deal with as they wish. The fact a liability to repay some of that interest may arise later, if certain events occur, does not alter the fact derivation has occurred. Therefore, the taxation consequences of the repayment of the interest on the full or partial withdrawal of the term deposit amount must be considered. 3. The full withdrawal of a term deposit amount before the contractual maturity date will trigger a base price adjustment (BPA). Where the depositor is required to repay interest previously derived, the amount of repaid interest will be included in the ―consideration‖ element of the BPA. This will generally give rise to a negative BPA amount. A negative BPA amount is expenditure incurred under the financial arrangements rules. Expenditure incurred under the financial arrangements rules is deemed to be interest under s YA 1. A deduction may be available under s DB 6 (Interest: not capital expenditure) or s DB 7 (Interest: most companies need no nexus with income). If a deduction is not available under ss DB 6 or DB 7, a deduction is allowed under s DB 11 to the extent the amount 2 arises from assessable income derived by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years. 4. If a depositor partially withdraws the deposit, there is no maturity of the financial arrangement. Therefore, no BPA is performed. In these circumstances, the deductibility of the repaid interest depends on whether the depositor is a cash basis person. 5. A depositor who is not a cash basis person, or who is a cash basis person who has elected to adopt a spreading method, needs to apply Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement when the term deposit is varied by the partial withdrawal. The repaid interest will be brought into the Determination G25 calculation and an adjustment made in the year of variation. A BPA is done when the term deposit finally matures. 6. Where a cash basis person does not adopt a spreading method, expenditure incurred during the term of a financial arrangement will be deductible at the time it is incurred only if the general permission is satisfied. To satisfy the general permission there must be a sufficient relationship between the repayment of the interest and the earning of assessable income. The Commissioner considers the relationship between the repayment and the interest income earned under the term deposit is insufficient to satisfy s DA 1(1)(a). As the amount of the repaid interest is not deductible at the time of repayment, it falls to be dealt with through the BPA on maturity of the deposit. However, the Commissioner considers that, where the expenditure has been incurred in carrying on a business, a deduction may be available under s DA 1(1)(b). Whether the repayment of interest satisfies the nexus test for a business will depend on the facts of each case. 7. The amount of the repaid interest will be included in both the ―consideration‖ and ―expenditure‖ elements of the BPA calculation. The application of the BPA at maturity will generally result in a positive amount, which reflects the receipt of interest income in the final year of the term deposit. 8. A positive BPA amount is income, except to the extent it arises from expenditure incurred under the financial arrangement in earlier income years and for which a deduction was denied. Therefore, the amount of interest income derived in the final year of the term deposit will be reduced by the amount of interest repaid in an earlier year. However, an amount of repaid interest for which a deduction was available will not reduce the amount of interest income derived in the final year of the term deposit. This ensures the depositor returns the correct amount of interest income over the full term of the deposit. Background 9. BR Pub 14/07 is a reissue of BR Pub 10/21, which expired on 16 December 2013. This Ruling is essentially the same as BR Pub 10/21. However, minor amendments have been made to clarify the order of application of ss DB 6, DB 7 and DB 11, in accordance with an amendment to s EW 31(4). 10. A term deposit contract will often include a clause that early withdrawal of the principal sum, in whole or in part, will result in a reduced rate of interest, calculated from the date of the initial deposit. In some cases, 3 this means a depositor who withdraws funds early may have to repay a portion of the interest previously derived under the term deposit. 11. For example, assume that on 1 October 2015 a person invests $10,000 for 12 months at 7%, interest to be credited to the person‘s bank account six- monthly. Interest of $350 is paid to the person on 31 March 2016. However, on 1 May 2016 the person decides to withdraw $5,000 from the term deposit. 12. The term deposit contract states that the rate of interest on the $5,000 to be withdrawn is reduced to 5% from the date of deposit, 1 October 2015. Therefore, the amount of interest the person should have received in relation to the $5,000 withdrawn is $146 (seven months interest at 5%). The person has already been credited with $175 of interest on the $5,000. Therefore, the person owes the bank $29. 13. This Ruling considers the tax consequences of the depositor‘s repayment of the interest to the bank. 14. Note that, in practical terms, it is unlikely the depositor would physically repay the interest previously derived to the bank. The more common scenario would be for the bank to deduct the amount of interest owed to it from the amount of the principal to be repaid by it. For example, in the above example the person would receive $4,971 from the bank on early withdrawal (the $5,000 principal withdrawn less the $29 interest to be repaid). Whether such a set-off occurs or not, the transaction is treated for tax purposes as the repayment of the interest owed by the depositor and the return by the bank of the full amount of the principal withdrawn early. Application of the Legislation 15. The tax consequences of the Arrangement depend upon whether there is a full or partial withdrawal of the deposit early and whether the depositor repaying the interest is a cash basis person. These scenarios are considered below. However, before turning to these scenarios, the preliminary issue of whether the interest under the term deposit is fully derived when received or is only conditionally derived to the extent of the amount liable to repayment must be considered. Derivation of interest subject to repayment on early withdrawal 16. It may appear that the fact a depositor may have to repay interest if the deposit is withdrawn early indicates that interest under a term deposit is only conditionally derived. However, the Commissioner‘s view is that interest under a term deposit is fully derived at the time of receipt or crediting. At the time of receipt or crediting of interest, the depositor has earned that interest and it is theirs to deal with as they wish. The fact a liability to repay some of that interest may arise later, if certain events occur, does not alter the fact derivation has occurred. 17. Bowcock v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,062 (HC) supports this conclusion. Mr Bowcock was an employee who went on study leave but continued to receive his full salary. The terms of the employment bond provided that if he left his employment within four years of the end of his study leave, he would have to repay some of the amount he had received. He did leave within that time, so was required to repay salary for two income years. He tried to deduct these sums from his income tax returns for the two years. 4 In the High Court, Mr Bowcock claimed he had never derived the amounts because they were contingent receipts not absolute receipts. 18. Vautier J rejected Mr Bowcock‘s argument. He said at 61,069: Upon a consideration of the terms of the bond and the course pursued in this case, I am quite unable to come to the conclusion that the moneys which were paid to the objector during the two years in question can be said to have been received by him conditionally in the sense referred to in the judgments in the High Court in \[Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v FCT (1965) 114 CLR 314 (HCA)\]. Those moneys clearly in my view became the absolute property of the objector when they were paid. No conditions or stipulations were attached to those payments themselves. They were clearly received and accepted as of right. Whether or not any liability arose in the future to repay any part of those moneys depended entirely on the course which the objector chose to take. 19. The Bowcock principle supports the view that if a taxpayer is liable to repay an amount previously received (for example, for breaching a bond or for the early withdrawal of funds), the repayment of the amount does not change the nature of the original derivation of the funds from absolute to conditional. 20. Vautier J distinguished the decision in Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v FCT (1965) 114 CLR 314 (HCA) in Bowcock. Arthur Murray concerned whether income had been derived in the first instance, not the situation where income has been derived but may have to be repaid. It is the latter situation that was covered in Bowcock, where the court found that the possibility of repayment did not affect the derivation of the income. The Commissioner‘s view is that the principles considered in Bowcock apply generally, and are not limited to employment situations. 21. In the present arrangement, the depositor has an absolute entitlement to the interest under the term deposit at the time it is received. If the depositor later chooses to withdraw funds before the contracted maturity date, the fact an obligation to repay some of the interest received may arise does not affect that entitlement. The interest has been derived and the nature of the derivation of the funds is not changed from absolute to conditional as a result of the repayment. In addition, in this situation, the contingency arises from a choice of the investor, not as a result of factors outside the investor‘s control. 22. As the interest income is absolutely derived by the depositor, the taxation consequences of the repayment of interest on the full or partial withdrawal of the term deposit amount must now be considered. Full withdrawal of the term deposit amount 23. A term deposit is a financial arrangement under s EW 3. Therefore, the financial arrangements rules apply. When a term deposit is withdrawn in full, the financial arrangement has matured and a BPA is required under s EW 29. 24. Although many depositors are likely to be cash basis persons under the financial arrangements rules and not required to use a spreading method, they are still subject to the financial arrangements rules and must do a BPA if they withdraw the term deposit in full. 25. The formula for calculating a BPA is in s EW 31(5). The formula is: consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted where: 5 consideration is all consideration that has been paid, and all consideration that is or will be payable, to the person for or under the financial arrangement, minus all consideration that has been paid, and all consideration that is or will be payable, by the person for or under the financial arrangement. Non-contingent and non- integral fees are ignored. income is income derived by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years. expenditure is expenditure incurred by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years. amount remitted is an amount that is not included in the consideration paid or payable to the person because it has been remitted by the person or by law. 26. Where a depositor withdraws a term deposit in full before the contracted maturity date and the depositor is required to repay interest derived in a previous income year, the repaid interest will be included in the ―consideration‖ element of the BPA. The result of the BPA calculation will depend on matters such as the time of receipt of the interest payments, the differential in interest rates and the time of the withdrawal of the term deposit amount. 27. Where the BPA calculation gives rise to a negative amount, s EW 31(4) provides that a negative BPA amount is expenditure incurred by a person in the year the calculation is made. Expenditure incurred under the financial arrangements rules is deemed to be interest. 28. A deduction may be available under s DB 6 (Interest: not capital expenditure) or s DB 7 (Interest: most companies need no nexus with income). Section DB 6 overrides the capital limitation and allows a deduction for interest where the general permission is satisfied. Where the requirements of s DB 7 are satisfied, a company is allowed a deduction for interest expenditure incurred whether or not the expenditure satisfies the general permission. Section DB 7 also overrides the capital limitation, the exempt income limitation and the withholding tax limitation. 29. Where a deduction is not allowed under ss DB 6 or DB 7, a deduction is allowed for the negative BPA amount under s DB 11 to the extent the amount arises from assessable income derived by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years. Section DB 11 supplements the general permission and overrides all the general limitations. 30. Where the BPA calculation gives rise to a positive amount, s EW 31(3) provides that the amount is income derived by the person. A positive BPA amount may occur where the depositor derives interest income in the same year as the year in which the withdrawal and repayment of interest occurs. In these circumstances, the BPA calculation ensures that the positive BPA amount is reduced by the amount of the repaid interest. Examples 1 and 2 31. Examples 1 and 2 illustrate the above points: 6 Example 1 On 1 October 2015 Mary (a cash basis person not carrying on a business) invests $10,000 for 12 months at 7%, with interest to be credited to her bank account six-monthly. Interest of $350 is paid to Mary on 31 March 2016. However, on 1 May 2016 Mary decides to withdraw the full amount of the term deposit. On the early withdrawal of the $10,000, the term deposit contract states that the rate of interest is reduced to 5% from the date of deposit, 1 October 2015. Therefore, the amount of interest Mary should have received for the term deposit is $292 (seven months interest at 5%). As Mary has already been credited with $350 interest (for the first six months), she owes the bank $58. The bank sets off the amount of interest owed against the amount of the principal to be repaid and Mary receives $9,942. Mary will have to apply the BPA formula to the term deposit in the 2017 income year as follows: consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted The consideration Mary received is the repayment of the principal amount of $10,000 and the interest received of $350. The consideration Mary paid is the original deposit of $10,000 and the repayment of interest of $58. The amount of income Mary derived in earlier income years is $350. There is no expenditure from earlier years. No amount is remitted. Therefore, the BPA is: ($10,350 – $10,058) – $350 + $0 + $0 = $292 – $350 = –$58 The negative BPA amount is expenditure incurred under the financial arrangements rules. Mary has derived income under the financial arrangement in previous income years ($350) and therefore the negative BPA amount of -$58 will be deductible to Mary under s DB 11 in the income year ending 31 March 2017. Example 2 On 1 November 2015 Sally invests $10,000 for two years at 7%, with interest to be credited to her bank account six-monthly. Interest of $350 is paid to Sally on 30 April 2016, 30 October 2016 and 30 April 2017. However, on 30 June 2017 Sally decides to withdraw the full amount of the term deposit. Sally has a standard balance date. On the early withdrawal of the $10,000, the term deposit contract states that the rate of interest is reduced to 5% from the date of deposit, 1 November 2015. Therefore, the amount of interest Sally should have received for the term deposit is $833 (20 months interest at 5%). Sally has already been credited with $1,050 interest, so she owes the bank $217. The bank sets off the amount of interest owed against the amount of the principal to be repaid and Sally receives $9,783. Sally will have to apply the BPA formula to the term deposit in the 2018 income year as follows: consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted 7 The consideration Sally received is the repayment of the principal amount of $10,000 and the interest received of $1,050. The consideration Sally paid is the original deposit of $10,000 and the repayment of interest of $217. The amount of income Sally derived in earlier income years is $700. There is no expenditure from earlier years. No amount is remitted. Therefore, the BPA is: ($11,050 – $10,217) – $700 + $0 + $0 = $833 – $700 = $133 The positive BPA amount is income derived for Sally. The $133 for the 2018 income year reflects the receipt by Sally of interest income of $350 on 30 April 2017 and the repayment of interest of $217. Partial withdrawal of term deposit amount 32. If a depositor only partially withdraws the deposit, there is no maturity of the financial arrangement. Therefore, no BPA is performed. In these circumstances, the deductibility of the repaid interest depends on whether the depositor is a cash basis person. 33. Note that this situation assumes the contract between the parties provides that the partial withdrawal of the deposit does not terminate the contract. If the withdrawal results in the existing term deposit contract being terminated and a new term deposit being entered into, a BPA will be required as discussed in \[23\] above. Non-cash basis person 34. A depositor who is a non-cash basis person needs to apply Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement when the term deposit is varied by the partial withdrawal. 35. The formula in Determination G25 is: a – b – c + d where: a is the sum of all amounts that would have been income derived by the person in respect of the financial arrangement from the date it was acquired or issued to the end of the income year, if the changes had been known as at the date the financial arrangement was acquired or issued b is the sum of all amounts that would have been expenditure incurred by the person in respect of the financial arrangement from the date it was acquired or issued to the end of the income year, if the changes had been known as at the date the financial arrangement was acquired or issued c is the sum of all amounts treated as income derived of the person in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired or issued to the end of the previous income year 8 d is the sum of all amounts treated as expenditure incurred of the person in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired or issued to the end of the previous income year. 36. The repaid interest will be brought into the Determination G25 calculation and an adjustment made in the year of variation. When the formula in Determination G25 is calculated, a positive amount is deemed to be income and a negative amount is deemed to be expenditure incurred. A BPA is done when the term deposit finally matures. Example 3 37. Example 3 illustrates this situation: Example 3 On 1 October 2015 Penny invests $10,000 for two years at 7%, with interest to be credited to her bank account six-monthly. She receives an interest payment of $350 on 31 March 2016. However, on 1 May 2016 Penny decides to withdraw $5,000 from the term deposit. The term deposit contract states that on an early withdrawal the rate of interest is reduced to 5% on the amount of principal withdrawn. The reduced rate applies from the date of the original deposit, 1 October 2015. Therefore, the amount of interest Penny should have received for the $5,000 withdrawn is $146 (seven months interest at 5%). Penny has already been credited with $175 interest for the $5,000, so she owes the bank $29. The bank sets off the amount of interest owed against the amount of the principal to be repaid, and Penny receives $4,971 on 1 May 2016. The balance of the principal remains in the term deposit and Penny receives interest payments of $175 on 30 September 2016 and 31 March 2017. On 30 September 2017, Penny receives $5,175, being the repayment of the remaining principal and the last interest payment. Penny is not a cash basis person and has a standard balance date. If she has adopted the straight-line method, the results are as follows: For the income year ending 31 March 2016, Penny has returned $350 of income. For the income year ending 31 March 2017, Penny must apply the formula in Determination G25: a – b – c + d Item a is $671. This amount is made up of $525 of interest on the $5,000 not withdrawn (being $5,000 at 7% per annum for the 18 month period from 1 October 2015 to 31 March 2017) and $146 of interest on the $5,000 withdrawn (being $5,000 at 5% per annum for the seven months from 1 October 2015 to 1 May 2016). Item b is nil, because if the changes had been known about at the start of the financial arrangement there would have been no expenditure. There would simply have been less income, which is taken into account in item a. Item c is $350. Item d is nil. Therefore, applying the Determination G25 formula, the adjustment in the 2017 income year is: $671 – $0 – $350 + $0 9 = $321 As the amount is positive, it is deemed to be income Penny derived for the year ending 31 March 2017. Essentially, the formula takes the $29 of repaid interest and deducts it from the income derived in the 2017 income year. For the income year ending 31 March 2018, Penny will have to perform a BPA by applying the following formula: consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted The consideration Penny received is the $10,000 principal repaid and the interest payments of $875 (being $350 on 31 March 2016 and $175 on 30 September 2016, 31 March 2017 and 30 September 2017). The consideration Penny paid is the $10,000 principal invested and the $29 repaid interest. The amount of income Penny derived in earlier income years is $671 (being $350 in the 2016 income year and $321 in the 2017 income year). There is no expenditure incurred in earlier income years. No amount is remitted. Therefore, the BPA is: ($10,875 - $10,029) – $671 + $0 + $0 = $846 – $671 = $175 As the BPA is positive, it is income derived by Penny. This equates with the interest income received by Penny in the 2018 income year. There is no adjustment for the repaid interest, because it was taken into account in the Determination G25 calculation in the previous income year. Cash basis person 38. A person is a cash basis person if either:  the income and expenditure under all the person‘s financial arrangements for the income year does not exceed $100,000, or  the value of all the person‘s financial arrangements on every day of the income year does not exceed $1 million, and  the difference between the accrual treatment and the cash treatment of all the person‘s financial arrangements does not exceed $40,000 for the income year. 39. A cash basis person is not required to adopt a spreading method, although they may choose to do so. 40. If a depositor is a cash basis person and adopts a spreading method, they need to apply Determination G25 when the term deposit is varied by the partial withdrawal. This is the same as for a non-cash basis person and is covered in \[34\] to \[36\] above. 41. Where a cash basis person does not adopt a spreading method, expenditure incurred during the term of a financial arrangement will be deductible when it is incurred if the general permission is satisfied. In the present case, this means the repaid interest on a partial withdrawal would 10 be deductible at the time of the withdrawal, rather than taken into account in the BPA on the eventual maturity of the term deposit. 42. However, to be deductible at the time of the withdrawal, the repaid interest must satisfy the general permission and none of the general limitations must apply. 43. The general permission in s DA 1 provides that a person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is incurred by the person:  in deriving their assessable income or excluded income or both, or  in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving their assessable income or excluded income or both. 44. The leading New Zealand cases on the deductibility of expenditure are the Court of Appeal decisions in CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 and Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271. These cases establish that there must be a sufficient nexus between the expenditure incurred and the income earning process for the expenditure to be deductible. 45. In delivering the judgment of the court in Banks, Richardson J made the following comments at 61,241 and 61,242: For reasons such as these it seems clear that the application of the first limb must involve an amalgam of considerations. In the Australian cases ... there has been considerable stress on the character of an outgoing in the sense of its being incidental and relevant to the gaining or producing of the assessable income. Statements to that effect emphasise the relationship that must exist between the advantage gained or sought to be gained by the expenditure and the income earning process. They do not, and cannot, specify in concrete terms the kind and degree of connection between the expenditure and the gaining or producing of assessable income required in individual cases for the expenditure to qualify for deduction. ... Putting it positively, Dixon J. said in Amalgamated Zinc (de Bavay’s) Ltd v FC of T (1935) 54 CLR 295, at p. 309 and we respectfully agree: ̳The expression ―in gaining or producing‖ has the force of ―in the course of gaining or producing‖ and looks rather to the scope of the operations or activities and the relevance thereto of the expenditure than to purpose in itself.‘ It then becomes a matter of degree, and so a question of fact, to determine whether there is a sufficient relationship between the expenditure and what it provided, or sought to provide, on the one hand, and the income earning process, on the other, to fall within the words of the section. 46. In Buckley & Young, Richardson J stated at 61,274: It is not necessary for the purpose of this case to refer in any detail to the principles of deductibility under those provisions. There are two features of sec. 111 \[of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954\] which are of particular importance in this case. The first is that a deduction is available only where the expenditure has the necessary relationship both with the taxpayer concerned and with the gaining or producing of his assessable income or with the carrying on of a business for that purpose. The heart of the inquiry is the identification of the relationship between the advantage gained or sought to be gained by the expenditure and the income earning process. That in turn requires determining the true character of the payment. It then becomes a matter of degree and so a question of fact to determine whether there is a sufficient relationship between the expenditure and what it provided or sought to provide on the one hand, and the income earning process on the other, to fall within the words of the section (C of IR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236, 61,242). The second feature of sec. 111 is that the statutory language contained in the phrase ̳to the extent to which‘ expressly contemplates apportionment. 11 47. In Cox v CIR (1992) 14 NZTC 9,164 (HC), Williams J commented on the deductibility of expenditure incurred in carrying on a business, and stated at 9,168: While in jurisdictional terms para (b) is the narrower of the two limbs, it is generally recognised that for business taxpayers it facilitates deductibility in circumstances where a deduction might otherwise not be available under the first limb. This is so because it has been acknowledged in the authorities that the conduct of a business may require expenditures to be made which cannot be directly linked to the derivation of assessable income in some positive way, but which are made to, say, keep the enterprise on foot or to reduce expenditure: see Europa Oil (supra) at pp 61,196 and 61,197. The inclusion of the word "necessarily" in para (b) might mean that the paragraph is intended to be read in a restrictive sense, for example, disallowing deductions unless they are unavoidable or logically necessary for a business. However, the authorities have taken a more pragmatic and commercially realistic approach to business expenditures. Thus it is established by the cases that when compared to the older test laid down in sec 111 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954, sec 104 has set a much wider and more commercially realistic test of deductibility of expenditure: de Pelichet McLeod & Co Ltd v C of IR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,216 at p 61,219. Moreover, whether an expenditure can be said to be necessarily incurred in the course of carrying on a business must be decided in each case on the facts and by way of a judgment based on common sense and business realities: Europa Oil (NZ) Ltd (supra) at pp 61,196 and 61,197. 48. The Commissioner considers these decisions remain relevant to the interpretation of s DA 1(1). Earlier provisions that correspond to s DA 1(1)(b) referred to ―expenditure necessarily incurred in carrying on a business‖. Section DA 1 preserves the requirement for a sufficient nexus, notwithstanding that it has removed the word ―necessarily‖. The Commissioner‘s considered view is that the word ―necessarily‖ did no more than indicate a requirement that there be a sufficient degree of connection between the expenditure and the business. 49. Applying the principles from these cases requires asking whether there is a sufficient relationship between the repayment of the interest and the earning of assessable income. The Commissioner considers there is not a sufficient relationship between the repayment and the interest income earned under the term deposit for s DA 1(1)(a) to apply. The interest income is earned as a result of lending money. The advantage gained by the repayment is the ability to withdraw early from the term deposit contract, and therefore to cease earning the interest income. The repayment is not a cost of deriving the interest income; it is a cost of ceasing to derive the income. The repayment is a cost to the depositor of not fulfilling the terms of the contract between the bank and the depositor. 50. The repayment of the interest arises because of the depositor‘s decision to withdraw a portion of their funds before the maturity date. It is incurred solely because the depositor chooses to make a partial withdrawal; it is not incidental or relevant to the deriving of the earlier income. 51. The decision of the Commonwealth Taxation Board of Review in Case 50 ((1958) 8 CTBR (NS) 250) also supports this approach. In Case 50 the taxpayer was granted leave from his employment to attend university lectures, but he continued to receive his salary for the times he was absent from work, subject to certain conditions. The taxpayer breached those conditions when he later resigned to accept a higher-paid position, so he had to repay some of the salary he had received. The taxpayer claimed a deduction for the amount of salary repaid. 12 52. The Board of Review considered whether the payment satisfied the general deductibility test, and denied the deduction. The Board concluded at \[7\]: The liability on the taxpayer to repay the £412 arose directly from his failure to observe the conditions he had agreed to under which he had been paid salary in respect of periods of leave of absence granted to him for the purpose of attending lectures and examinations set down for the course of study undertaken by him. The outgoing was not incurred by the taxpayer in the course of gaining or producing his assessable income.... The outgoing was not incidental or relevant to the gaining or producing of his assessable income but was incurred solely because of his failure to observe the conditions laid down when the leave was granted to him. \[Emphasis added\] 53. This reasoning was also applied in Case D19 72 ATC 113, Case F70 74 ATC 421 and Case G80 75 ATC 564. While these cases concerned employment contracts, the Commissioner considers that the application of the general deductibility test in those cases is equally applicable in the context of the repayment of interest under a term deposit. 54. Where the amount of the repaid interest is not deductible at the time of repayment, it falls to be dealt with through the BPA on maturity of the deposit. 55. However, the Commissioner considers that a deduction may be available where the repayment of the interest was incurred in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income, or excluded income or a combination of both assessable and excluded income: s DA 1(1)(b). The courts take a pragmatic and commercially realistic approach to business expenditure. Whether there is a sufficient nexus for s DA 1(1)(b) to apply will depend upon the facts of each case. In this situation, s EW 31(3) and the BPA formula ensure that no double deduction can occur. 56. The amount of the repaid interest will be included in both the ―consideration‖ and ―expenditure‖ elements of the BPA calculation. Where a depositor partially withdraws a term deposit early and is required to repay interest derived in a previous income year, the application of the BPA at maturity will generally result in a positive amount. This reflects the receipt of interest income in the final year of the term deposit. Section EW 31(3) provides that a positive BPA amount is income derived by a person in the year the calculation is made. However, it is not income to the extent it arises from expenditure incurred under the financial arrangement in earlier income years and for which a deduction was denied. Therefore, the amount of interest income derived in the final year of the term deposit will be reduced by the amount of interest repaid in an earlier year. However, an amount of repaid interest for which a deduction was available (under s DA 1(1)(b)) will not reduce the amount of interest income derived in the final year of the term deposit. This ensures the depositor returns the correct amount of interest income over the full term of the deposit. Example 4 57. Example 4 illustrates this for a non-business cash basis person: Example 4 On 1 October 2015 Penny invests $10,000 for two years at 7%, with interest to be credited to her bank account six-monthly. She receives an interest payment of $350 on 31 March 2016. However, on 1 May 2016 Penny decides to withdraw $5,000 from the term deposit. 13 The term deposit contract states that on an early withdrawal the rate of interest is reduced to 5% on the amount of principal withdrawn. The reduced rate applies from the date of the original deposit, 1 October 2015. Therefore, the amount of interest Penny should have received for the $5,000 withdrawn is $146 (seven months interest at 5%). Penny has already been credited with $175 interest for the $5,000, so she owes the bank $29. The bank sets off the amount of interest owed against the amount of the principal to be repaid, and Penny receives $4,971 on 1 May 2016. The balance of the principal remains in the term deposit and Penny receives interest payments of $175 on 30 September 2016 and 31 March 2017. On 30 September 2017, Penny receives $5,175, being the repayment of the remaining principal and the last interest payment. These are the same facts as in Example 3 above, except that in the current example Penny is a cash basis person who chooses not to adopt a spreading method. Therefore, in this example, the results are as follows: For the income year ending 31 March 2016, Penny will have returned income of $350. For the income year ending 31 March 2017, Penny will have returned income of $350 (being the interest payments of $175 on 30 September 2016 and 31 March 2017 ). She will not be able to claim a deduction for the $29 repaid interest on 1 May 2016. For the income year ending 31 March 2018, Penny will have to perform a BPA by applying the following formula: consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted The consideration Penny received is the $10,000 principal repaid and the interest payments of $875 (being $350 on 31 March 2016, and $175 on 30 September 2016, 31 March 2017 and 30 September 2017). The consideration Penny paid is the $10,000 principal invested and the $29 repaid interest. The amount of income derived in earlier income years is $700 (being $350 in each of the 2016 and 2017 income years). The expenditure incurred in earlier income years is $29, being the amount of repaid interest. There is no amount remitted. Therefore, the BPA is: ($10,875 - $10,029) – $700 + $29 + $0 = $846 – $700 + $29 = $175 As the BPA is positive, it is income Penny derived. However, it is not income to the extent it arises from expenditure incurred in earlier years and for which a deduction was denied. A deduction was denied for the $29 repaid interest in the 201 7 income year, so the positive BPA is reduced by that amount. Therefore, in the 2018 income year, Penny derives income of $146. This amount equates to the interest payment of $175 received on 30 September 2017, reduced by the interest repaid on 1 May 2016. 14 References Expired Rulings BR Pub 97/9 ―Interest repayments imposed as a result of early repayment of a financial arrangement – deductibility‖ Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 9 (September 1997): 5 BR Pub 10/21 ―Interest repayments required as a result of the early repayment of a financial arrangement – deductibility‖ Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011): 15 Subject references Deductions Financial arrangements rules Term deposits Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007, ss DA 1, DB 6, DB 7, DB 11, EW 31 Case references Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v FCT (1965) 114 CLR 314 (HCA) Bowcock v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,062 (HC) Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA) Case 50 (1958) 8 CTBR (NS) 250 Case D19 72 ATC 113 Case F70 74 ATC 421 Case G80 75 ATC 564 CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 (CA) Cox v CIR (1992) 14 NZTC 9,164 (HC) Other references Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement 15 Appendix – Legislation 1.

Money received for money provided (2) A financial arrangement is an arrangement under which a person receives money in consideration for that person, or another person, providing money to any person— (a) at a future time; or (b) on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event, whether or not the event occurs because notice is given or not given. Examples of money received for money provided (3) Without limiting subsection (2), each of the following is a financial arrangement: (a) a debt, including a debt that arises by law: (b) a debt instrument: (c) the deferral of the payment of some or all of the consideration for an absolute assignment of some or all of a person‘s rights under another financial arrangement or under an excepted financial arrangement: (d) the deferral of the payment of some or all of the consideration for a legal defeasance releasing a person from some or all of their obligations under another financial arrangement or under an excepted financial arrangement. 7. Section EW 29(3) provides: EW 29 When calculation of base price adjustment required ... Maturity (3) A party to a financial arrangement must calculate a base price adjustment as at the date on which the arrangement matures. 8. Section EW 31 provides: EW 31 Base price adjustment formula Calculation of base price adjustment (1) A person calculates a base price adjustment using the formula in subsection (5). When formula applies (2) The person calculates the base price adjustment for the income year in which section EW 29 applies to them. Positive base price adjustment (3) A base price adjustment, if positive, is income, under section CC 3 (Financial arrangements), derived by the person in the income year for which the calculation is made. However, it is not income to the extent to which it arises from expenditure incurred by the person under the financial arrangement in 17 earlier income years and for which a deduction was denied in those income years. Negative base price adjustment (4) A base price adjustment, if negative, is expenditure incurred by the person in the income year for which the calculation is made. The person is allowed a deduction for the expenditure under sections DB 6 to DB 8 (which relate to deductions for interest) or, if none of those sections applies, under section DB 11 (Negative base price adjustment). Formula (5) The formula is— consideration − income + expenditure + amount remitted. Definition of items in formula (6) The items in the formula are defined in subsections (7) to (11). Consideration (7) Consideration is all consideration that has been paid, and all consideration that is or will be payable, to the person for or under the financial arrangement, minus all consideration that has been paid, and all consideration that is or will be payable, by the person for or under the financial arrangement. For the purposes of this subsection, the following are ignored: (a) non-contingent fees, if the relevant method is not the IFRS financial reporting method in section EW 15D: (b) non-integral fees, if the relevant method is the IFRS financial reporting method in section EW 15D. Consideration in particular cases (8) If any of sections EW 32 to EW 48, or EZ 52D applies, the consideration referred to in subsection (7) is adjusted under the relevant section.

Amount remitted (11) Amount remitted is an amount that is not included in the consideration paid or payable to the person because it has been remitted— (a) by the person; or (b) by law. 9. Section EW 54 provides: EW 54 Meaning of cash basis person Who is cash basis person (1) A person is a cash basis person for an income year if— (a) 1 of the following applies in the person's case for the income year: (i) section EW 57(1); or (ii) section EW 57(2); and (b) section EW 57(3) applies in the person‘s case for the income year. 18 Persons excluded by Commissioner (2) A person may be excluded under section EW 59 from being a cash basis person for a class of financial arrangements. 10. Section EW 55 provides: EW 55 Effect of being cash basis person Use of spreading method (1) A cash basis person is not required to apply any of the spreading methods to any of their financial arrangements, but may choose to do so under section EW 61. Calculation of base price adjustment (2) The fact that a cash basis person does not use any of the spreading methods for the financial arrangement does not excuse them from the requirement to calculate a base price adjustment when any of section EW 29(1) to (12) applies to them. 11. Section EW 57 provides: EW 57 Thresholds Income and expenditure threshold (1) For the purposes of section EW 54(1)(a)(i), this subsection applies if the absolute value of the person‘s income and expenditure in the income year under all financial arrangements to which the person is a party is $100,000 or less. Absolute value threshold (2) For the purposes of section EW 54(1)(a)(ii), this subsection applies if, on every day in the income year, the absolute value of all financial arrangements to which the person is a party added together is $1,000,000 or less. The value of each arrangement is,— (a) for a fixed principal financial arrangement, its face value: (b) for a variable principal debt instrument, the amount owing by or to the person under the financial arrangement: (c) for a financial arrangement to which the old financial arrangements rules apply, the value determined under those rules. Deferral threshold (3) For the purposes of section EW 54(1)(b), this subsection applies if the result of applying the formula in subsection (4) to each financial arrangement to which the person is a party at the end of the income year and adding the outcomes together is $40,000 or less. Formula (4) The formula is— (accrual income − cash basis income) + (cash basis expenditure – accrual expenditure). Definition of items in formula (5) The items in the formula are defined in subsections (6) to (9). Accrual income (6) Accrual income is the amount that would have been income derived by the person under the financial arrangement if the person had been required to use a spreading method in the period starting on the date on which they became a party to the arrangement and ending on the last day of the income year for which the calculation is made. It is calculated using 1 of the following methods, as chosen by the person: (a) the yield to maturity method, whether or not the person may use it, or has chosen to use it, for their financial arrangement; or (b) the straight-line method, whether or not the person may use it, or has chosen to use it, for their financial arrangement; or 19 (c) an alternative method approved by the Commissioner. Cash basis income (7) Cash basis income is the amount that would have been income derived by the person under the financial arrangement if the person had been a cash basis person in the period starting on the date on which they became a party to the arrangement and ending on the last day of the income year for which the calculation is made. Cash basis expenditure (8) Cash basis expenditure is the amount that would have been expenditure incurred by the person under the financial arrangement if the person had been a cash basis person in the period starting on the date on which they became a party to the arrangement and ending on the last day of the income year for which the calculation is made. Accrual expenditure (9) Accrual expenditure is the amount that would have been expenditure incurred under the financial arrangement if the person had been required to use a spreading method in the period starting on the date on which they became a party to the arrangement and ending on the last day of the income year for which the calculation is made. It is calculated using 1 of the following methods, as chosen by the person: (a) the yield to maturity method, whether or not the person may use it, or has chosen to use it, for their financial arrangement; or (b) the straight-line method, whether or not the person may use it, or has chosen to use it, for their financial arrangement; or (c) an alternative method approved by the Commissioner. Increase in specified sums (10) The Governor-General may make an Order in Council increasing a sum specified in any of subsections (1) to (3). 12. In s YA 1, the definitions of ―interest‖, ―maturity‖, ―non-contingent fee‖ and ―non-integral fee‖ relevantly read: interest,— ... (c) in sections DB 6 (Interest: not capital expenditure), DB 7 (Interest: most companies need no nexus with income), and DB 8 (Interest: money borrowed to acquire shares in group companies),— (i) includes expenditure incurred under the financial arrangements rules or the old financial arrangements rules ... maturity,— (a) in the financial arrangements rules, means,— (i) for an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services or an option, the date on which the agreement or option ends: (ii) for any other financial arrangement, the date on which the last payment contingent on the financial arrangement is made: ... non-contingent fee means a fee that— (a) is for services provided for a person becoming a party to a financial arrangement; and (b) is payable whether or not the financial arrangement proceeds non-integral fee means a fee or transaction cost that, for the purposes of financial reporting under IFRSs, is not an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial arrangement
1  This is a reissue of an expired ruling BR Pub 04/06 Trading stock – tax treatment of sales and agreements to sell. For more information about the history of this ruling see the background in the commentary. INCOME TAX — TIMING OF DISPOSAL AND DERIVATION OF INCOME FROM TRADING STOCK PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 14/08 This is a public ruling made under s 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss CB 1, CB 2, EB 2, and YA 1 (definition of ―trading stock‖). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is a sale or disposal of property (including a contract of sale of, and an agreement to sell, property) that is part of the trading stock of a business owned or carried on by the vendor. This includes the disposal of trading stock together with other assets of a business. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows:  When a person sells trading stock in the ordinary course of business, s CB 1 applies to include amounts that are ―derived‖ from the sale within the income of the person. Amounts are derived when the income is earned, being when a legally enforceable debt arises, or the right to be paid otherwise crystallises.  If trading stock is sold outside the ordinary course of business, or to put an end to the business or part of it, s CB 2 applies to include all amounts received from the ―disposal of‖ the trading stock within the income of the person. The date of disposal differs, depending on whether a clearly expressed intention of the parties exists as to when property in the trading stock is to pass:  The date of disposal will be the date the parties intended property in the goods to pass if a clearly expressed intention as to the time of passing of property is evident from the terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the case. Circumstances of the case that may be relevant include whether the contract includes a reservation of title or Romalpa clause.  If no clearly expressed intention as to the time of passing of property can be determined, the date of disposal will be decided according to the appropriate statutory rule in s 20 of the Sale of Goods Act 1908 as follows: 2 o If there is an unconditional contract for goods that are specific and in a deliverable state—the date the contract becomes unconditional. o If the vendor must do something to make such goods deliverable— the date such action is completed, and the buyer is notified. o If the vendor must weigh, measure, or test such goods to ascertain the selling price— the date such action is completed and the buyer is notified. o If goods are delivered to a buyer on ―sale or return‖ or similar terms— the time at which the buyer signifies their approval or retains the goods without notifying rejection within an agreed or reasonable timeframe. o If unascertained or future goods are sold by description— when the goods are in a deliverable state and unconditionally appropriated to the contract by either party with the assent of the other.  Where s CB 2 applies to a disposal of trading stock, s CB 2(3) provides that the purchaser is treated as acquiring the trading stock for the amount that is treated as income of the vendor. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on the first day of the 2014/15 income year. This Ruling is signed by me on 30 September 2014. Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 14/08 This commentary is not a legally binding statement. The commentary is intended to help readers understand and apply the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 14/08 (the ruling).

This commentary considers the key issues:  Whether s CB 1 or s CB 2 applies when trading stock is sold.  When receipts from the sale of trading stock are ―derived‖.  When trading stock is ―disposed of‖. 2. Whether s CB 1 or s CB 2 applies depends on whether the trading stock has been sold in the ordinary course of business. Sections CB 1 and CB 2 operate in tandem to ensure all disposals of trading stock give rise to income for tax purposes. However, the timing of when the income arises differs depending on which section applies. Where the trading stock has been disposed of in the ordinary course of business, s CB 1 will apply. This means income arises when it has been derived. Section CB 2 will apply where the trading stock is disposed of outside the ordinary course of business or to put an end to the business or part of it. If s CB 2 applies, income arises at the time the trading stock is disposed of. 3. Income from the sale of trading stock in the ordinary course of business is derived when the income is earned, being when a legally enforceable debt arises or the right to be paid otherwise crystallises. 4. Where s CB 2 applies, trading stock is disposed of when property in the trading stock passes. When property passes depends on whether the parties have clearly expressed their intention as to when property is to pass between them. If they have, property passes and trading stock is disposed of at the date the parties intended. Otherwise, trading stock is disposed of on the date determined according to the appropriate statutory rules in ss 20 or 21 of the Sale of Goods Act 1908 (SGA). 5. The ruling and commentary do not consider the effects of the financial arrangements rules in Part EW of the Act. 4 Background 6. This ruling is a reissue of BR Pub 04/06 that applied until the end of the 2008 income year and was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 5 (June 2004): 17. BR Pub 04/06 was a reissue of an earlier ruling BR Pub 98/8 Trading stock – tax treatment of disposals published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 1 (January 1999): 3. 7. The previous ruling, BR Pub 04/06, set out when ss CD 3 and FB 3 of the Income Tax Act 1994 applied because these sections appeared to overlap in their application. This ambiguity was clarified in the Income Tax Act 2007. 8. The previous ruling also included analysis of when an amount from the sale or disposal of trading stock was ―derived‖ under s CD 3 and when trading stock was ―sold or disposed of‖ under s FB 3. The previous ruling included this analysis because there had been some confusion about when income arises where a business disposes of trading stock. 9. Sections CB 1 and CB 2 are the provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 that correspond to the former ss CD 3 and FB 3 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The 2007 Act did not alter the timing of when income is derived from trading stock. There has been a minor change in s CB 2, which now refers to trading stock ―disposed of‖ rather than ―sold or disposed of‖. The Commissioner considers that this change does not alter the timing of when trading stock is disposed of. The issues 10. The key issues are:  Whether s CB 1 or s CB 2 applies.  When receipts from the sale of trading stock are ―derived‖.  When trading stock is ―disposed of‖. Whether s CB 1 or s CB 2 applies 11. As stated, the Income Tax Act 2007 has clarified whether s CB 1 or s CB 2 applies where there has been a disposal of trading stock. Section CB 1 includes within a person’s income an amount they derive from a business. If sales of trading stock occur in the ordinary course of business, s CB 1 will apply to include such amounts within income. 12. However, s CB 2(5) provides that s CB 2 overrides s CB 1. So, s CB 2 will apply instead of s CB 1 to sales of trading stock outside the ordinary course of business or sales that put an end to the business or part of it. Generally, s CB 2 applies to larger transactions involving other assets and/or multiple items of trading stock where the sale is more akin to the sale or disposal of a group of business assets. 13. It is important to establish which section applies to determine the timing of income from sales of trading stock. This is because s CB 1 includes in income receipts from the sale of trading stock when they are ―derived‖. In contrast, s CB 2 includes in income such receipts when the trading stock is ―disposed of‖. These two points in time can be different. In practice, the difference is most likely to matter when a transaction straddles a balance date. 5 Section CB 1 – when receipts from the sale of trading stock are ―derived‖ 14. Amounts received from the sale of trading stock sold in the ordinary course of business will give rise to business income that becomes the income of the person under s CB 1 when the business income is ―derived‖. 15. It is settled law that the word ―derived‖ means more than merely received. It connotes the source or origin rather than the fund or place from which the income was taken, and means flowing, springing, or emanating from, or accruing: CIR v NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken \[1955\] NZLR 868 (CA). 16. It is also settled law that the timing of derivation and the method of accounting for income ―should be that which is calculated to give a substantially correct reflex of the taxpayer’s true income‖: Commissioner of Taxes (SA) v The Executor Trustee and Agency Co of South Australia Ltd (1938) 63 CLR 108 (HCA) (Carden’s Case); Philips; CIR v Farmers’ Trading Co Ltd \[1982\] 1 NZLR 449, (1982) 5 NZTC 61,200 (CA). 17. For most business taxpayers, the most appropriate method of accounting to give a substantially correct reflex of their business income will be the accrual method of accounting. This means income could be derived even if payment has not yet been received or an invoice rendered. 18. The general principle is that income is derived when it is earned and has ―come home‖ to the taxpayer. This will be the point at which a legally enforceable debt arises or the right to be paid otherwise crystallises. In looking at whether a debt has been created, case law tends to show that this is in effect a two-stage enquiry. The first stage is to establish whether the parties have agreed, or a statute has imposed, when a debt is created. When this is clear, the income in question is derived for income tax purposes at that time. If there is no such agreement between the parties or statutory imposition, the general law must be considered to determine when a debt is created and when the income is derived. 19. The leading New Zealand case on the relevance of accounting principles and derivation is Farmers’ Trading. This case dealt with when business profits were derived from trading stock sold where the customer paid the purchase price over a period of five months by way of monthly instalments. The issue was whether the income was derived at the time the stock was sold or whether a ―profit emerging‖ approach could be used to spread the income over a period. It was held that the sales were fundamentally different to hire purchase sales. This was because the title and the property passed with the possession of the goods and the vendor could only sue for unpaid instalments. It was also held that the business profits were derived when the stock was sold and a debt in favour of the vendor was created. 20. Richardson J cited Carden's Case with approval. In particular, he restated that ―the foundation of the accrual system is the view that the accounts should show at once the liabilities incurred and the revenue earned, independently of the date when payment is made or becomes due‖. His Honour stated at 61,208: The real question in this case is when trading profits are derived. Where a sale is made in the course of trade during the year any profit on sale must be recognised. That involves having regard to the debt arising in favour of the vendor and bringing it into account if it is practicable to do so. ... On sale of trading stock a debt arises in favour of the vendor. The stock leaves his account and prima facie the debt for which it was exchanged should be brought into 6 account in its place. It is implicit in the legislation that trading debts cannot be ignored in the calculation of business profits and must be brought into account on a proper basis if that is feasible. ... \[T\]here may be no realistic way to reflect the debts in the trader’s account. But in principle debts arising from sale of trading stock during an income year must be recognised in arriving at the profits derived in that year. 21. See, also, the Australian High Court case of J Rowe and Son Pty Ltd v FCT 71 ATC 4157, which is consistent with the principles expressed in Farmers’ Trading in its rejection of the ―profit emerging‖ approach. 22. The general principle that income is derived when it is earned, and that this is when there is an entitlement to payment or a legally enforceable debt, was also applied in Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,226 (CA). In that case, Richardson P delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which essentially agreed with Goddard J’s conclusion in the High Court, that the taxpayer’s income was derived when electricity was supplied by the taxpayer and used by its customers. The Court of Appeal considered that the income earning process was complete on supply and sale of the electricity to the consumer. Section CB 2 – when trading stock is ―disposed of‖ 23. Section CB 2 applies where a business disposes of trading stock either outside of the ordinary course of business or to put an end to the business, or a part of it. Where trading stock is disposed of together with other assets of a business, s EB 24 requires the total amount received to be apportioned between the trading stock and the other assets in a way that reflects their respective market values. 24. The question of when stock is ―disposed of‖ becomes important when s CB 2 applies. This is a different question to when income is ―derived‖. Section CB 2(4) defines ―disposal‖ as including ―the passing of property by an exchange, gift, distribution under a will or on intestacy‖. A disposal under ss FC 3 to FC 8 (which relate to distributions after death) that is not at market value is not included. The definition is silent on the timing of a disposal, but some guidance is given by case law and the SGA. Sale of Goods Act 1908 25. Section CB 2(4)(a) states that disposal includes the passing of property by various means. The ―passing of property‖ is a concept also used in the SGA. The SGA shows that a disposal or a sale of goods occurs when property in those goods passes to the purchaser. 26. Note that the SGA recognises a distinction between a ―contract of sale of goods‖ and an ―agreement to sell‖. There is a ―contract of sale of goods‖ when a seller agrees to transfer property in the goods for a consideration called the ―price‖. A sale occurs once the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer. In contrast, there is an ―agreement to sell‖ when the transfer of property in the goods is to take place either at some future time or is subject to the fulfilment of some condition. A sale occurs either when the time elapses or the conditions are fulfilled. 27. The timing of when property in goods passes to a purchaser under the SGA depends on whether the goods are specific or unascertained. The 7 term ―unascertained goods‖ is not defined in the SGA, but Commercial Law in New Zealand (online looseleaf ed, LexisNexis) states at \[11.2\]: ... it is clear that unascertained goods are those which are not identified and agreed on at all. Unascertained goods become ascertained goods once they are identified and agreed on in accordance with the contract. 28. Under s 18 of the SGA, no property is transferred in unascertained goods unless and until the goods are ascertained. Goods may be unascertained because they are:  generic goods sold by description: Re Gold Corp Exchange Ltd (In Rec) \[1994\] 3 NZLR 385 (PC); or  not yet severed from part of a larger bulk: Re Wait \[1927\] 1 Ch 606. 29. Specific goods are defined in s 2(1) of the SGA as ―goods identified and agreed on at the time a contract of sale is made‖. The timing when the parties agree 30. Sections 19(1) and (2) of the SGA provide that where there is a contract for the sale of specific or ascertained goods, the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer at the time the parties to the contract intended property to be transferred. When finding out the intention of the parties, regard should be had to the terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties, and the circumstances of the case. Accordingly, any explicit intention of the parties as to when property in the goods passes will be recognised as the date the sale occurs. 31. Other factors, such as whether the agreement for sale includes a reservation or retention of title clause, commonly known as a Romalpa clause, may be relevant. These clauses are designed to ensure that property in the goods is kept with the vendor until payment is received. Section 21 of the SGA sets out the rules for when property passes in these cases: 21 Reservation of right of disposal (1) Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods, or where goods are subsequently appropriated to the contract, the seller may, by the terms of the contract or appropriation, reserve the right of disposal of the goods until certain conditions are fulfilled. (2) In such case, notwithstanding the delivery of the goods to the buyer, or to a carrier or other bailee for the purpose of transmission to the buyer, the property in the goods does not pass to the buyer until the conditions imposed by the seller are fulfilled. (3) Where goods are shipped, and by the bill of lading the goods are deliverable to the order of the seller or his agent, the seller is prima facie deemed to reserve the right of disposal. (4) Where the seller of goods draws on the buyer for the price, and transmits the bill of exchange and bill of lading to the buyer together to secure acceptance or payment of the bill of exchange, the buyer is bound to return the bill of lading if he does not honour the bill of exchange, and if he wrongfully retains the bill of lading the property in the goods does not pass to him. The timing when the parties’ agreement is not evident 32. Where the parties either have not formed an intention as to when property passes, or have not clearly expressed their intention, s 20 of the SGA sets out five rules for determining when the property in the goods will be deemed to have passed. The first of these rules is considered the most common and relevant to trading stock. Section 20 states: 8 Rules for ascertaining intention Unless a different intention appears, the following are rules for ascertaining the intention of the parties as to the time at which the property in the goods is to pass to the buyer: Rule 1. Where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods, in a deliverable state, the property in the goods passes to the buyer when the contract is made, and it is immaterial whether the time of payment or the time of delivery, or both, is postponed. Rule 2. Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods, and the seller is bound to do something to the goods for the purpose of putting them into a deliverable state, the property does not pass until such thing is done, and the buyer has notice thereof. Rule 3. Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, but the seller is bound to weigh, measure, test, or do some other act or thing with reference to the goods for the purpose of ascertaining the price, the property does not pass until such act or thing is done, and the buyer has notice thereof. Rule 4. Where goods are delivered to the buyer on approval, or on sale or return or other similar terms, the property therein passes to the buyer— (a) when he signifies his approval or acceptance to the seller, or does any other act adopting the transaction: (b) if he does not signify his approval or acceptance to the seller, but retains the goods without giving notice of rejection then, if a time has been fixed for the return of the goods, on the expiration of such time, and if no time has been fixed, on the expiration of a reasonable time. What is a reasonable time is a question of fact. Rule 5.(1) Where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained or future goods by description, and goods of that description and in a deliverable state are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent of the buyer or by the buyer with the assent of the seller, the property in the goods thereupon passes to the buyer. Such assent may be expressed or implied, and may be given either before or after the appropriation is made. (2) Where, in pursuance of the contract, the seller delivers the goods to the buyer, or to a carrier or other bailee (whether named by the buyer or not) for the purpose of transmission to the buyer, and does not reserve the right of disposal, he is deemed to have unconditionally appropriated the goods to the contract. \[Emphasis added\] Date of disposal for s CB 2 33. There is no New Zealand case law on the effect of the SGA on s CB 2 (or its predecessors). The Australian Commonwealth Taxation Board of Review referred to the Australian Sale of Goods Act when deciding in Case 18 (1946) 12 CTBR 120 that property had been disposed of by way of sale when the contract became unconditional. The issue in Case 18 was whether the taxpayer’s property had been ―disposed of by sale or otherwise howsoever...‖ for s 36(1) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (now s 70-85 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997). The Chairman of the Board of Review noted, in relation to the sale of goods, at 126: The ownership of the goods will be transferred by the contract itself (in which case, the contract is the sale) if the parties express that intention but where the parties form no intention as to the time when the property is to pass, or fail to express their intention, the time when the property passes is determined by certain statutory presumptions. Of these presumptions the only one which deems the property in the goods to pass when the contract is made arises where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state. In view of these principles (... and most which are embodied in the Sale of Goods Act) it appears to me to be quite clear that the property in the goods which were included in the assets which were the subject of the contract under consideration did not pass from the taxpayer to the purchasers until 25 August 1943, when the last of the three necessary consents was given. 34. There is a similarity between the Australian and New Zealand Sale of Goods Acts that reflects their common United Kingdom origins. Also, the 9 trading stock provisions in the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 are similar in both their wording and treatment of trading stock to the equivalent New Zealand provisions. This means that, when dealing with the disposal of personal property, Case 18 is authority for looking at non-tax legislation for guidance on when property is disposed of for tax purposes. 35. In Hansen v CIR \[1972\] NZLR 193, the Court of Appeal considered the precursor to s EB 24 (Apportionment on disposal of business assets that include trading stock). The issue was whether the Commissioner could determine the value of sheep sold as trading stock along with the other assets of the business, regardless of the parties having agreed a price for the sheep. Relevantly, the court gave effect to the intentions of the parties for when property in the stock passed. The purchaser was not allowed to shear the sheep before settlement. This suggested that the purchaser did not own the stock until settlement. The court concluded that settlement date was the appropriate date to value the sheep for the purposes of calculating their sale price. This was the date the parties intended property to pass to the purchaser and when the sheep were sold. 36. The general principle is that the date of sale (and, therefore, disposal) occurs when property in the goods passes. When an express intention of the parties as to when property passes can be found, that will be the date of sale. If no intention is expressed or can be found, the date of sale will be decided according to the statutory rules or presumptions contained in s 20 of the SGA (commonly the date an unconditional contract exists). Although not in the context of s CB 2, this general approach has also been upheld in tax cases that have referred to ss 19 and 20 of the SGA to decide when property has passed: CIR v International Importing Ltd \[1972\] NZLR 1,095 (CA); Verryt v CIR (1990) 12 NZTC 7,107 (HC). 37. Accordingly, for s CB 2, trading stock is ―disposed of‖ when property in the goods passes. This will occur when the parties intend property to pass, where an express intention can be found. If no intention can be found, the statutory presumptions contained in Rules 1 to 5 of s 20 of the SGA will decide when property passes, and therefore when a sale or disposition occurs. Section 21 of the SGA may also be relevant where the contract includes a Romalpa clause. 38. Where s CB 2 applies to a disposal of trading stock, s CB 2(3) provides that the purchaser is treated as acquiring the trading stock for the amount that is treated as income of the vendor. When a contract is unconditional 39. As Rule 1 of s 20 of the SGA relates to unconditional contracts, it is important to understand when a contract becomes unconditional. 40. An agreement becomes a binding contract when both parties to the contract have entered into binding obligations. A contract becomes unconditional when a binding contract is not subject to any conditions that may prevent the performance of the contract and the parties could sue for specific performance. A useful summary of the current state of New Zealand law on conditional contracts is in Laws of New Zealand Contract (online ed) at \[154\]: New Zealand Courts have developed a body of law concerning conditional contracts in which the term ―condition‖ refers to a contingent condition; this is a provision in an agreement that contemplates that the legal effect of, or the parties’ obligations under, the agreement will be altered in some way on the occurrence or 10 non-occurrence of the contemplated contingency. In many older cases conditions were simply classified as ―conditions precedent‖ or ―conditions subsequent‖, a practice which led to real confusion in case law. The term ―condition subsequent‖ is still commonly used without such a reference point and generally refers to a contingency which is to occur, or not, at some point after a binding contract has been entered and on which the continuation of contractual obligations depend; this means that a failure to fulfil the condition will bring the contract to an end at that point or will give to one or both parties the option to bring the contract to an end. The term ―condition precedent‖ was particularly productive of confusion since a condition might be a contingency required to occur before an agreement came to have contractual force or alternatively a contingency which was to occur after the contract was entered into but before some aspect of performance was required. There has been judicial criticism of the use of the terms ―condition subsequent‖ and ―condition precedent‖ unless the discussion of the condition in question makes it clear what precisely it is that the condition is precedent to or subsequent to. It is therefore now more common for the Courts to concern themselves with the effect of the particular condition before them on the particular contract; however, it is possible to formulate general rules which indicate the likely effect of such common conditions as making agreements subject to contract or subject to finance or subject to solicitor’s approval. \[Footnotes omitted\] See also Laws of New Zealand Sale of Goods (online ed) \[80\] for a discussion of unconditional contracts under the SGA. Financial arrangements rules 41. The ruling does not consider any potential operation of the financial arrangements rules in subpart EW. If the financial arrangements rules apply, the approach in the ruling will apply to any consideration that is effectively attributed as the value of the trading stock sold, as opposed to the total amount paid (where any difference is treated as interest under the financial arrangements rules). Examples 42. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Example 1 – Ordinary course of business – payment with possession 43. A customer enters a sporting goods store and purchases a tennis racquet, which comes with a 30 day money-back guarantee if not completely satisfied. The customer pays and leaves in possession of the goods. 44. The income from the sale is derived by the store in terms of s CB 1 on the day the customer purchases the tennis racquet. The tennis racquet is sold in the ordinary course of business and the income has been earned (and therefore derived), regardless of whether the customer returns at a later date seeking a refund under the guarantee. Example 2 – Ordinary course of business – two instalments 45. On 12 March, a large appliance store and a customer sign a sale and purchase agreement for the sale of a refrigerator. The agreement allows for the refrigerator to be delivered that day on payment of a 25% deposit. The contract provides that risk passes to the customer on delivery of the refrigerator, but property does not pass until payment of the balance of the purchase price. Payment of the balance of the purchase price occurs one month later. 11 46. The income from the sale is derived in terms of s CB 1 on 12 March, as it is a sale of trading stock in the ordinary course of business. On that day, the income has been earned and a legally enforceable debt arose when the purchaser took delivery of the refrigerator. Example 3 – Ordinary course of business – mail order 47. A customer makes a bulk order for photocopiers from an office equipment supplier by way of mail order from a catalogue description. The order is posted on 12 September and received by the vendor on 15 September. The photocopiers are taken from the vendor’s warehouse and shipped on 20 September, with delivery to the customer taking place the next day. 48. The standard terms of sale are that risk, title and property in the goods pass when the goods are put onto the delivery truck. The photocopiers are delivered with an invoice showing payment is due on 20 October, which is when the customer pays for the photocopiers. 49. As this sale is made in the ordinary course of operating an office equipment supply business, the income from the sale is taxed under s CB 1. The income is derived on 20 September, when the trading stock is shipped. On that day the income has been earned and a debt has become due and enforceable under the terms of the sale. 50. If the sale conditions were that risk, title and property in the goods did not pass until delivery, the income would be derived on 21 September. In that situation, no debt is enforceable until delivery occurs. Example 4 – Sale in course of closing down business 51. As in example 3, a customer places an order with the same standard terms of sale that property in the goods passes when the goods are put onto the delivery truck. However, for the purpose of this example, assume that the vendor is making the sale in the course of closing down the part of its business relating to office equipment, so that s CB 2 applies. As s CB 2 applies, the time of disposal of the trading stock is relevant, rather than when income from the sale of the trading stock would otherwise have been derived under s CB 1. 52. The order is for generic items that are unascertained goods at the time the order is made. The goods do not become specific goods until the particular photocopiers are identified as the customer’s. Without any clear contractual intention to the contrary, this would occur on 20 September. On that day, the photocopiers are appropriated to the order or contract, property passes and a disposal occurs. Example 5 – Sale in course of closing down business – reservation of title 53. As in example 4, a customer places an order in circumstances where it is assumed the vendor is making the sale in the course of closing down the part of its business relating to office equipment, so that s CB 2 applies. In this example, the terms of sale include a reservation of title clause that ensures the property in the goods does not pass until the goods are paid for in terms of s 21 of the SGA. 54. Despite the goods becoming specific goods when the photocopiers are appropriated to the order and are shipped on 20 September, property does not pass and a disposal does not occur until 20 October, when payment is made. 12 References Expired Ruling BR PUB 04/06 ―Trading stock – tax treatment of sales and agreements to sell‖ Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 5 (June 2004): 17 Subject references Derivation of income Time of sale Trading stock Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007 ss CB 1, CB 2, EB 2, EB 24, and YA 1 (definition of ―trading stock‖) Sale of Goods Act 1908 ss 2, 3, 18, 19, 20 and 21 Case references Case 18 (1946) 12 CTBR 120 CIR v Farmers’ Trading Co Ltd \[1982\] 1 NZLR 449, (1982) 5 NZTC 61,200 (CA) CIR v International Importing Ltd \[1972\] NZLR 1,095 (CA) CIR v NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken \[1955\] NZLR 868 (CA) Commissioner of Taxes (SA) v The Executor Trustee and Agency Co of South Australia Ltd (1938) 63 CLR 108 (HCA) (Carden’s Case) Hansen v CIR \[1972\] NZLR 193 (CA) Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,226 (CA) J Rowe and Son Pty Ltd v FCT 71 ATC 4157 (HCA) Re Gold Corp Exchange Ltd (In Rec) \[1994\] 3 NZLR 385 (PC) Re Wait \[1927\] 1 Ch 606 Verryt v CIR (1990) 12 NZTC 7,107 (HC) Other References Commercial Law in New Zealand (online looseleaf ed, LexisNexis ) Laws of New Zealand (online ed) 13 Appendix — Legislation 1.

INCOME TAX – MEANING OF “ANYTHING OCCURRING ON LIQUIDATION” WHEN A COMPANY REQUESTS REMOVAL FROM THE REGISTER OF COMPANIES PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 14/09 This is a public ruling made under s 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of para (b)(i) of the definition of ―liquidation‖ in s YA 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the liquidation of a company when a request is made under s 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993 that the company be removed from the New Zealand register of companies. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows:  When a request is made to the Registrar of Companies to remove a company from the New Zealand register of companies under s 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993, the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation is a resolution by the shareholders or board of directors or, where applicable, another overt decision- making act provided for in a company‘s constitution to adopt a course of action that will end in removal from the register.  That first step starts the period specified in para (b)(i) of the definition of ―liquidation‖ in s YA 1. Anything done after that first step to enable liquidation occurs ―on liquidation‖ for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007. The period or tax year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on 1 January 2015. This Ruling is signed by me on 20 November 2014.

The purpose of this Ruling is to clarify the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation when a request is made to the Registrar of Companies to remove a company with surplus assets from the New Zealand register of companies under s 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993. 2. In the Commissioner‘s view, liquidation of a company is a process. Therefore, the phrase ―anything occurring on liquidation‖, in particular the words ―on liquidation‖, refer to a period. That period starts with the occurrence of the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation. The Commissioner considers that, when a removal request is made under s 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993, the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation will ordinarily be the passing of the resolution to cease business, pay all creditors, distribute surplus assets and to then request removal from the register. Alternatively, the first step legally necessary may be another overt decision-making act that is provided for in a company‘s constitution to adopt a course of action that will end in the removal of the company from the register. 3. That step starts the period specified in para (b)(i) of the definition of ―liquidation‖ in s YA 1. Anything done after that step to enable liquidation occurs ―on liquidation‖ for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007. 4. Therefore, on a short-form liquidation, any capital distributions a company makes after the passing of a resolution to enable liquidation will be made ―on the liquidation of the company‖ and may be excluded from being dividends under s CD 26. Background 5. BR Pub 14/09 is a reissue of BR Pub 10/06, which expired on 31 December 2014. This Ruling is essentially the same as BR Pub 10/06. 2 6. The Ruling concerns the meaning of the phrase ―anything occurring on liquidation‖ in para (b) of the definition of ―liquidation‖ in s YA 1 when a request for removal from the register of companies is made under s 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993. 7. Paragraph (a) of the definition of ―liquidation‖ includes the removal of a company from the register of companies. The removal of a liquidated company from the register occurs under the Companies Act 1993 in a number of circumstances, including after the full liquidation process or after the shorter, alternative process provided by s 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993. The alternative process under s 318(1)(d) is sometimes referred to as a ―short-form liquidation‖. 8. A short-form liquidation is cheaper and simpler than a full liquidation. A short-form liquidation involves a request for the company‘s removal from the register by:  an authorised shareholder; or  the board of directors; or  any other person required or permitted to do so by the constitution of the company. 9. Relevant to this Ruling, such a request can be made to the Registrar of Companies only after the company has ceased to carry on business, paid its debts and distributed its surplus assets to its members: s 318(2)(a) of the Companies Act 1993. 10. Paragraph (b) of the definition of ―liquidation‖ in s YA 1 prescribes the period during which an action or event will be considered to be occurring ―on liquidation‖. This definition is important because specific tax consequences flow from acts that occur ―on liquidation‖. Paragraph (b) of the definition of ―liquidation‖ provides that the period known as ―on liquidation‖ starts with ―a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation‖. 11. Paragraph (b)(i) includes two examples of steps that are legally necessary to achieve liquidation:  the appointment of a liquidator; or  a request for removal under s 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993. 12. The second example has given rise to uncertainty, which is why the Commissioner has issued this Ruling. 13. The issue is whether a request for removal under s 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993 is the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation. If so, on a short-form liquidation the period known as ―on liquidation‖ will not begin until the request for removal from the register has been made under s 318(1)(d). Under the Companies Act 1993, that request cannot be made until any surplus assets have been distributed. 14. Such an interpretation would mean that companies that follow the short- form liquidation process may be unable to make tax-free distributions ―on liquidation‖ under s CD 26(2). If a request for removal is the start of the ―on liquidation‖ period, then all surplus assets must have been distributed before the request is made. Therefore, the purpose of this Ruling is to determine the correct interpretation of the phrase ―anything occurring on liquidation‖ in the context of a short-form liquidation. In particular, the Ruling considers the meaning of the words ―on liquidation‖. 3 Application of the Legislation 15. A request to remove a company from the register of companies under s 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993 can be made by:  a shareholder authorised by shareholders‘ special resolution; or  the board of directors; or  any other person required or permitted by the constitution to do so. 16. It is clear from s 318(2) of the Companies Act 1993 that at the time a request for removal is made any surplus assets must have already been distributed. 17. The function of para (b) of the definition of ―liquidation‖ is to set out the period when anything may occur on liquidation. Paragraph (b)(i) defines the period. The beginning of the period is most important and para (b)(i) provides that it starts with ―a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation‖. This puts the focus on the first steps. Paragraph (b)(ii) limits ―anything occurring on liquidation‖ to things occurring within that period that are ―for the purpose of enabling liquidation‖. Things that occur for another purpose will not occur ―on liquidation‖. 18. The importance of determining the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation is highlighted when determining the tax treatment of capital distributions made on a short-form liquidation. Capital distributions may not be dividends for tax purposes when they are made ―on the liquidation‖ of a company under s CD 26. 19. Under s CD 3, the term ―dividends‖ includes a wide variety of payments, distributions and transactions that essentially transfer value to shareholders. Sections CD 26(1) and (2) exclude from being a dividend any amounts distributed to shareholders that are essentially subscribed capital (―available subscribed capital per share‖) and capital gains (―available capital distribution amount‖) where the amounts are distributed ―on the liquidation of the company‖. What is meant by “a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation”? 20. The phrase ―a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation‖ distinguishes between:  steps that are legally necessary and any other steps; and  steps that are to achieve liquidation and steps that are taken for another purpose. 21. The ordinary meaning of the word ―step‖ implies an ―action‖. Therefore, the focus is on overt acts rather than, for example, the existence of circumstances or beliefs. 22. Some steps necessary to achieve liquidation in practice may not be legally necessary. For example, a step that is necessary in practice for a liquidation by special resolution of shareholders is to decide who the liquidator will be. That decision is not a legally required step even though it must have occurred. The closest legally necessary step would be appointing the liquidator or obtaining the liquidator‘s written consent to appointment. 4 23. The words ―to achieve liquidation‖ further narrow the range of steps that can start the period. Some steps legally necessary to achieve liquidation may be taken for a purpose other than to achieve liquidation. For example, paying all creditors is necessary before making a request under s 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993. However, those payments may be made in the ordinary course of business rather than for the purpose of enabling liquidation. 24. Other steps undertaken may not reach the required threshold ―to achieve liquidation‖. For each liquidation procedure, the series of steps involved will largely be settled by the governing legislation, usually the Companies Act 1993. However, for each procedure, some preliminary steps will usually occur before any decision to liquidate is made, with the final preliminary step being the making of the decision to liquidate. The decision to liquidate is then followed by a further series of steps that achieve the liquidation and removal of the company from the register of companies. 25. The word ―achieve‖ requires an end or goal to have been established and committed to. In para (b) of the definition of ―liquidation‖, the words ―to achieve liquidation‖ mean the steps must be taken with liquidation as the established end. Therefore, the Commissioner‘s view is that steps cannot be said to have been taken ―to achieve liquidation‖ until the decision to liquidate is established and committed to. 26. This emphasis on the established goal of liquidation means some steps that are preparatory to the removal of the company from the register (for example, the exercise by the liquidator of his or her functions) are capable of being the first step to achieve liquidation. However, a decision to liquidate must have been made. 27. While a decision to liquidate has to be made in practice, the step required by law in relation to a company‘s decision is usually the passing of a resolution. The silent making of a decision is not an overt act, so it is not a ―step‖ as required by para (b)(i) of the definition of ―liquidation‖. The Commissioner‘s view is that the passing of a resolution is an overt act – a ―step‖ – and will, in most cases, be the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation. The passing of such a resolution will also satisfy para (b)(ii) as being for the purpose of enabling liquidation. What is the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation on a short- form liquidation? 28. One of the two grounds in s 318(2) of the Companies Act 1993 must be satisfied before a request for removal from the register of companies under s 318(1)(d) can be made. However, only the first ground applies where the company has surplus assets to distribute. Therefore, the first ground is the only ground considered in this Ruling. The first ground requires the company to have ceased business, paid its creditors and distributed its surplus assets in accordance with its constitution and the Companies Act 1993. 29. Therefore, it follows that in those circumstances the first step that is legally necessary when a request is made to remove the company from the register should relate to ceasing business, paying all creditors and distributing surplus assets. Section 318(2)(a) of the Companies Act 1993 does not specify the order in which these events must occur. 5 30. Accordingly, the Commissioner accepts that the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation, when a request is made to remove a company from the register of companies under s 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993, is a resolution to:  cease business,  pay all creditors,  distribute surplus assets, and  then request removal from the register of companies. 31. Other steps may be taken that could also be the first step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation. For example, a company may act less formally than by passing a resolution to carry out the requirements in s 318(2) of the Companies Act 1993. If the step is overt and carried out with the aim of achieving removal from the register, it may still be the first step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation. However, a company taking a less formal course of action may be required to produce evidence establishing that the taking of the step was carried out with the aim of achieving liquidation. What is the significance of the examples in para (b)(i) of the definition of “liquidation” in s YA 1? 32. After the phrase ―a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation‖, para (b)(i) of the definition of ―liquidation‖ in s YA 1 sets out two examples: ―including the appointment of a liquidator or a request of the kind referred to in section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993‖. 33. The examples can be read as being the first steps of the relevant processes, which Parliament put in the section as specific illustrations of first steps that start the period. However, in the Commissioner‘ view, the wording of para (b)(i) is ambiguous. The steps could be examples of:  a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation; or  the first step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation. 34. Possibly, the more obvious meaning is that the examples are of first steps – suggested by the immediate context and the emphasis in the section. The focus of para (b)(i) is on determining ―the period‖ and its commencement, which suggests the examples are of first steps rather than any steps of the processes to which they are relevant. However, this is not conclusive. Whether the examples should be taken to be the first steps or just any steps in the processes they are relevant to becomes clearer when the examples are examined. 35. The first example refers to the appointment of a liquidator. In the processes of liquidation, the appointment of a liquidator is not the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation. For example, where the shareholders of a company resolve to appoint a liquidator, obviously the resolution is a legally necessary step that precedes the appointment. 36. Regarding the second example, when removal from the register is requested under s 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993, the request is also not the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation. As noted above, before removal from the register can be requested, the company must have ceased business, paid its creditors and distributed its surplus assets. These steps must all have occurred before requesting removal 6 from the register. The Commissioner‘s view, therefore, is that passing a resolution to cease business, pay all creditors, distribute surplus assets and to then request removal will usually be the first step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation. The Commissioner considers that any other interpretation would leave s CD 26(2) ineffective, which would not have been the intention of Parliament. 37. Therefore, the Commissioner‘s view is that the better interpretation of para (b)(i) is that the steps given as examples are not the first steps legally necessary to achieve liquidation in the liquidation processes they relate to. Instead, they are examples of steps (in fact, fundamental steps) in those processes. The Commissioner considers that a step other than one of the two examples included in para (b)(i) could be the first step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation. And, as noted above, the Commissioner considers that step will usually be the passing of a resolution to cease business, pay all creditors, distribute surplus assets and then request removal. What is the tax treatment of capital distributions made on a short-form liquidation? 38. Capital distributions may not be dividends for tax purposes when they are made ―on the liquidation‖ of a company under s CD 26. 39. Paragraph (b) of the definition of ―liquidation‖ in s YA 1 provides that the period known as ―on liquidation‖ starts with the first step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation. As discussed above, the Commissioner‘s view is that the first step is not the making of the request to remove the company from the register. The first step will ordinarily be the passing of the resolution to cease business, pay all creditors, distribute surplus assets and then request removal. 40. Therefore, any capital distributions made after the passing of such a resolution will be made ―on the liquidation of the company‖ and may be excluded from being dividends under s CD 26. 41. In some cases, there may be an extended period between the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation and the removal of the company from the register. The period may even span different tax years, so that a distribution is made in a period preceding the removal of the company from the register. The Commissioner will assume that such distributions are made pursuant to a genuine intention to liquidate. However, if the liquidation is not completed, then such a distribution will not have occurred ―on liquidation‖ and the exclusion under s CD 26 (and this Ruling) will not apply. 42. Taxpayers making distributions should ensure they keep adequate records of relevant resolutions or other decision-making acts. This is so they can demonstrate that the resolution or other act was genuine, that the resolution or act preceded the distribution of the company‘s assets, and that the distributions were for the purpose of enabling liquidation.

FRINGE BENEFIT TAX – PROVISION OF BENEFITS BY THIRD PARTIES – SECTION CX 2(2) PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 14/10 This is a public ruling made under s 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of s CX 2(2) and the definition of ―arrangement‖ in s YA 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the receipt of a benefit by an employee from a third party where there is an arrangement between the employer and the third party and where the benefit would amount to a ―fringe benefit‖ if it had been provided by the employer. The Arrangement does not include situations where the remuneration given by an employer to an employee is reduced because a benefit has been received from the third party, or otherwise takes the receipt of a benefit provided by a third party into account (including salary sacrifice situations). There cannot be any trade-off between the benefits provided and the remuneration that would otherwise have been received by the employee, or any difference between the remuneration levels of employees who receive benefits and those who do not. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: (a) For the purposes of s CX 2(2), there will be an arrangement for the provision of a benefit to an employee where: (i) consideration passes from the employer to the third party for the benefit being provided; or (ii) the employer requests (other than merely initiating contact), instructs or directs the third party to provide the benefit; or (iii) there is negotiation or discussion between the employer and the third party that (explicitly or implicitly) involves the threat or suggestion that the employer would withhold business or other benefits from the third party unless a benefit is provided to the employee; or (iv) the third party and the employer are associated parties and there is a group policy (whether formal or informal), or any other agreement between the associated parties, that employees of the group will be entitled to receive benefits from the other companies in the group. 2 (b) Where the benefit has not been provided in circumstances within any of the categories identified above, s CX 2(2) will not apply where the benefit is provided in any of the following circumstances: (i) there is negotiation or discussion between the employer and the third party that results in no more than: (A) the employer granting the third party access to the premises or work environment to discuss the benefit with employees; and/or (B) agreement between the parties as to the level of benefit that is to be offered by the third party to employees; and/or (C) the employer agreeing to advertise or make known the availability of the benefit; or (ii) the employer has done no more than initiate contact or discussions with the third party; or (iii) there is no significant contact between the employer and the third party. The period or tax year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on the first day of the 2014/2015 income year.

A benefit will be treated as having been provided to an employee under s CX 2(2) where an ―arrangement‖ is made between their employer and another person ―for‖ the ―benefit‖ to be ―provided‖. 2. ―Arrangement‖ is defined in s YA 1 and encompasses various degrees of formality and enforceability. An ―arrangement‖ may be a legally enforceable contract, a less formal agreement or plan, or an informal, unenforceable understanding. An ―arrangement‖ may exist even if no consideration is given by the employer to the third party so as to create a legally binding contract. 2 3. Section CX 2(2) provides that the arrangement made between the employer and another party must be ―for the benefit to be provided‖. These words mean that the arrangement must be made ―for the purpose‖ or ―with the object‖ of providing a benefit to an employee. This requires consideration of the purpose or object of the employer and third party in making the arrangement. 4. Where the employer and the third party have a different purpose or object in making the arrangement, s CX 2(2) will apply only if the employer‘s purpose or object in making the arrangement was to provide a benefit to an employee. 5. In determining the employer‘s purpose or object, the relevant consideration is the subjective purpose or object of the employer in making the ―arrangement‖. For s CX 2(2) to apply, the employer must have, at least, a more than incidental purpose or object of providing a benefit to an employee in making the arrangement. 6. An employee-third party arrangement for a benefit to be provided does not prevent the same benefit being considered as having been provided through an employer-third party arrangement to which s CX 2(2) applies. 7. A ―benefit‖ for s CX 2(2) purposes is an advantage that is sufficiently clear and definite that it can reasonably, practically and sensibly be understood as a tangible benefit. 8. For s CX 2(2) to apply, the benefit must have been ―provided‖ to an employee by a third party. The word ―provided‖ requires that the benefit must have been supplied, furnished or made available to the employee. 9. The Commissioner considers that these requirements will be met and s CX 2(2) will apply where:  consideration passes from the employer to the third party for the benefit being provided;  the employer requests (other than merely initiating contact), instructs or directs the third party to provide a benefit;  there is negotiation or discussion between the employer and the third party that (explicitly or implicitly) involves the threat or suggestion that the employer would withhold business or other benefits from the third party unless a benefit is provided to the employee; or  the third party and the employer are associated parties and there is a group policy (whether formal or informal), or any other agreement between the associated parties, that an employee of the group will be entitled to receive benefits from the other companies in the group. 10. Where the benefit has not been provided in circumstances within any of the categories identified above, s CX 2(2) will not apply where the benefit is provided in any of the following circumstances:  there is negotiation or discussion between the employer and the third party that results in no more than: - the employer granting the third party access to the premises or work environment to discuss the benefit with employees; and/or 3 - agreement between the parties as to the level of benefit that is to be offered by the third party to employees; and/or - the employer agreeing to advertise or make known the availability of the benefit; or  the employer has done no more than initiate contact or discussions with the third party; or  there is no significant contact or arrangement between the employer and the third party. 11. A benefit may be provided in circumstances that fall within both of the above categories. In such cases, the Commissioner considers the requirements of s CX 2(2) have been satisfied. For example, if a benefit is provided in circumstances that come within the ―requests ..., instructs or directs‖ category in \[9\] above, s CX 2(2) applies even if it can be argued that those circumstances also come within the ―agreement ... as to the level of benefit that is to be offered‖ subcategory in \[10\]. 12. A consequence of this Ruling may be that the employer is required to put into place systems to enable them to obtain the relevant information required to fulfil their fringe benefit tax (FBT) obligations. In the Commissioner‘s opinion, where the employer is involved in the types of arrangements contemplated in \[9\] above, the employer will generally have a sufficient relationship with the third party to obtain the information they require to fulfil their obligations. The onus is on employers who are involved in arrangements for the provision of benefits in any of these ways to ensure that they can comply with their obligations (for example, by requiring record keeping by the third party). 13. This Ruling does not consider or rule on the taxation implications of salary sacrifice situations. Different considerations may apply to determine the tax treatment. For example, the benefit may have been provided by the employer in such a situation, or there may be other relevant aspects of the arrangement. These considerations may affect whether or not s CX 2(2) will have any application. Background 14. BR Pub 14/10 is a reissue of BR Pub 09/07, which expired on the last day of the 2013/2014 income year. This Ruling is essentially the same as BR Pub 09/07. However, the analysis under the heading ―What is the meaning of ―benefit‖?‖ has been amended to ensure consistency with other statements made by the Commissioner. The Commissioner considers that these changes do not affect the outcome of this Ruling. 15. This Ruling considers the scope of s CX 2(2) and what will be an ―arrangement‖ that falls within the scope of that provision. Application of the Legislation Introduction 16. Under the Act, an employer may be liable to pay FBT on fringe benefits that it provides to an employee. ―Fringe benefit‖ is defined in s CX 2(1) as follows: Meaning (1) A fringe benefit is a benefit that— 4 (a) is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment; and (b) either— (i) arises in a way described in any of sections CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, or CX 12 to CX 16; or (ii) is an unclassified benefit; and (c) is not a benefit excluded from being a fringe benefit by any provision of this subpart. 17. This definition is broad and intended to include all non-cash payments made by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment. 18. As a rule, an employer will not be liable to pay FBT on a benefit provided to an employee by a third party. However, under s CX 2(2) an employer may be liable to pay FBT on a benefit provided to an employee by a third party if that benefit is provided through an ―arrangement‖ made between the employer and the third party. 19. Section CX 2(2) provides: Arrangement to provide benefit (2) A benefit that is provided to an employee through an arrangement made between their employer and another person for the benefit to be provided is treated as having been provided by the employer. 20. Section CX 2(2) is an anti-avoidance provision. Its purpose is to prevent an employer avoiding a liability for FBT by arranging for a third party to provide a benefit to an employee in circumstances where FBT would have been payable had that benefit been provided by the employer directly. If s CX 2(2) applies, the benefit provided by the third party is treated as if it were provided by the employer to the employee directly. This enables the other provisions of subpart CX to be applied to determine whether FBT is payable on the benefit. 21. This Ruling considers only what will be an ―arrangement‖ that comes within the scope of s CX 2(2). It does not consider whether FBT will be payable on a benefit that is provided through an arrangement to which s CX 2(2) applies. An arrangement may satisfy the requirements of s CX 2(2), but no FBT will be payable because of the other provisions of subpart CX or the operation of the valuation rules in subpart RD. Issue 22. A benefit will be treated as having been provided by an employer to an employee under s CX 2(2) where an ―arrangement‖ is made between the employer and another person ―for‖ the ―benefit‖ to be ―provided‖. 23. The wording of s CX 2(2) is broad and would apply where any form of consideration passes from an employer to a third party to compensate for the third party providing a benefit to an employee. However, where there is no direct or indirect consideration (in any form) provided by the employer to the third party, the issue is in what circumstances the provision will apply. 24. In considering this issue, the analysis below will consider:  What is meant by ―arrangement‖?  What is the meaning of ―for‖? - Is it the purpose of the arrangement or purpose of the parties? 5 - Which party‘s purpose is relevant? - Is it an objective or subjective test? - Which purpose test should be applied? - Can s CX 2(2) apply where there is an employee–third party arrangement?  What is the meaning of ―benefit‖?  What is the meaning of ―provided‖? What is meant by “arrangement”? 25. ―Arrangement‖ is defined in s YA 1 as follows: arrangement means an agreement, contract, plan, or understanding, whether enforceable or unenforceable, including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect 26. This definition makes it clear that ―arrangement‖ is very wide in its application, and that it encompasses not only legally binding contracts, but also unenforceable understandings. It is clear that what is required for an arrangement to exist is less than that required for a binding contract. 27. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary ( 12th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) defines the individual words contained in the s YA 1 definition as follows:  ―Agreement‖ – a negotiated and typically legally binding arrangement.  ―Contract‖ – a written or spoken agreement intended to be enforceable by law.  ―Plan‖ – a detailed proposal for doing or achieving something.  ―Understanding‖ – an informal or unspoken agreement or arrangement. 28. The above definitions show that the words used to describe an ―arrangement‖ in s YA 1 all appear to be slightly different concepts. 29. The courts have not considered the definition of ―arrangement‖ in the context of s CX 2(2), nor have they considered the application of s CX 2(2) in its entirety. However, the courts have considered the definition of ―arrangement‖ contained in s YA 1 in the context of the general anti-avoidance rule in s BG 1. 30. The predecessor to the s YA 1 definition was discussed by Richardson P in CIR v BNZ Investments Ltd (2001) 20 NZTC 17,103 (CA). His Honour considered the definition of ―arrangement‖ in s 99(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 at \[45\] as follows: The words contract, agreement, plan and understanding appear to be in descending order of formality. A contract is more formal than an agreement, and in ordinary usage is usually written while an agreement is generally more formal than a plan, and a plan more formal or more structured than an understanding. And it is accepted in the definition of arrangement that the contract, agreement, plan or understanding need not be enforceable. Section 99 thus contemplates arrangements which are binding only in honour. 31. Richardson P cited with approval the statement by the High Court of Australia in Bell v FCT (1953) 87 CLR 548, 573 that ―arrangement‖ in an 6 earlier Australian general anti avoidance provision extended beyond contracts and agreements ―so as to embrace all kinds of concerted action by which persons may arrange their affairs for a particular purpose or so as to produce a particular effect‖ (at \[46\]). His Honour noted that statements to similar effect were made in Newton v Commissioner of Taxation \[1958\] AC 450, 465 (PC), where Lord Denning stated that the word ―arrangement‖ under the then Australian general anti-avoidance provision: ...is apt to describe something less than a binding contract or agreement, something in the nature of an understanding between two or more persons – a plan arranged between them which may not be enforceable at law. 32. The definition of ―arrangement‖ in s 99(1) of the 1976 Act, considered by Richardson P in BNZ Investments, differs from the definition of ―arrangement‖ in s YA 1. The order of the words has been changed to be listed alphabetically in the 2007 Act (ie, ―agreement‖ precedes ―contract‖). Despite this, the same observation can be made that the inclusion of the words ―agreement, contract, plan, or understanding‖ mean that ―arrangement‖ provides for varying degrees of enforceability and formality. As defined in s YA 1, an ―arrangement‖ may be a legally enforceable contract, a less formal agreement or plan that may or may not be legally enforceable, or an informal, unenforceable understanding. Accordingly, ―arrangement‖ is defined widely to include all kinds of concerted action by which persons seek to bring about the fulfilment of a particular purpose or the production of a particular effect. It includes agreements, contracts, plans or understandings that are not intended to be legally binding, and arrangements that are unenforceable at law, for example, contracts unenforceable due to reasons of public policy, contractual incapacity or illegality. 33. In the context of s BG 1, the courts have considered whether ―arrangement‖ requires a consensus or meeting of minds. This issue was considered by the Court of Appeal in BNZ Investments. In that decision, Thomas J dissented, holding that no such requirement existed. His Honour held that ―arrangement‖ does not require that one party knew of, or agreed to, all the steps and transactions undertaken by the other party to discharge its obligations under the ―agreement, contract, plan or understanding‖. Thomas J‘s approach was later endorsed by the majority of the Privy Council in Peterson v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,098 (at \[34\]). 34. However, in s CX 2(2), an ―arrangement‖ is qualified by the words ―made between their employer and another person for the benefit to be provided‖. As will be discussed, these words mean that s CX 2(2) applies only if the employer‘s purpose or object in making the arrangement is for a benefit to be provided to an employee (see \[66\]–\[71\] below). For this purpose or object to exist, the employer must have authorised the third party to provide a benefit to an employee. 35. The case law on the meaning of ―arrangement‖ as used in commerce- related legislation (for example, the Commerce Act 1986) is also useful. This case law makes clear the following:  An ―arrangement‖ exists where each party intentionally creates in the other party an expectation that the first party will act in a certain way. In so doing, the parties agree to mutual rights and obligations in respect of the course of action to be undertaken.  An ―arrangement‖ is unlikely to exist when only one party makes a commitment to the proposed course of action. 7 (See Apple Fields Ltd v New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board \[1991\] 1 NZLR 257 (PC); Re British Basic Slag Ltd’s Agreements \[1963\] 2 All ER 807 (CA); Trade Practices Commission v Email Ltd (1980) 31 ALR 53 (FCA)). 36. In the context of s CX 2(2), ―arrangement‖ will include situations where the employer arranges with the third party to provide a benefit, where the employer agrees to allow the third party to approach an employee, or where the employer agrees to allow an employee to join a scheme promoted by the third party. Where this type of significant contact does not occur, the parties will not have entered into an arrangement for the purposes of s CX 2(2). 37. However, for an ―arrangement‖ to be caught under s CX 2(2), it must be an arrangement ―for‖ a benefit to be ―provided‖ to an employee. This means that not every ―arrangement‖ that exists between an employer and a third party will be caught by s CX 2(2). Similarly, not every instance where a benefit is provided to an employee by a person who is not their employer will be caught by the section. What is the meaning of “for”? 38. Section CX 2(2) provides that the ―arrangement‖ made between the employer and another party be ―for‖ the benefit to be provided. 39. The word ―for‖ can have a wide variety of meanings depending on its context. The Court of Appeal in Wilson & Horton v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 stated at 12,330: Reference to any standard dictionary brings home the wide variety of senses in which the preposition ―for‖ may be employed. The Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed) identifies 11 separate categories of meaning and many distinct usages within particular categories. The discussion in the text extends over 9 columns in the dictionary. Again the Tasman Dictionary, which as its name suggests is directed to Australian English and New Zealand English, lists 33 meanings of the word. The particular meaning intended necessarily hinges on the context in which the word is used and how it is used in that context. \[Emphasis added.\] 40. The use of the word ―for‖ was interpreted in Patrick Harrison & Co v AG for Manitoba \[1967\] SCR 274 (CASCC) as imposing a purpose test. In this case, the court held that ―for the extraction of minerals‖ meant ―with the object or purpose of extracting minerals‖. 41. In G v CIR \[1961\] NZLR 994 (SC), McCarthy J held that the word ―for‖ points to intention, which is similar to looking at a person‘s purpose. McCarthy J stated at 999: ―For‖ points to intention ... the essential test as to whether a business exists is the intention of the taxpayer as evidenced by his conduct, and that the various tests discussed in the decided cases are merely tests to ascertain the existence of that intention. I think that it conforms with this approach to construe the word ―for‖, when considering a phrase such as ―carried on for pecuniary profit‖ used in relation to an occupation, as importing intention. 42. These cases show that in several statutory contexts the courts have interpreted ―for‖ to mean ―for the purpose‖ or ―with the object of‖ something. It is noted that, in this context, a person‘s purpose is similar to their intention. However, to determine the meaning of ―for‖ in s CX 2(2), the rest of the wording must be looked at. 43. As already noted, s CX 2(2) requires the benefit to be provided to the employee through an arrangement made between the employer and another person ―for‖ the benefit to be provided. The use of ―for‖ in this 8 context can mean that the ―arrangement‖ must have been made ―for‖ the provision of a benefit to an employee. 44. In the Commissioner‘s opinion, based on the case law and dictionary definitions, an ―arrangement‖ will satisfy s CX 2(2) if it is made ―for the purpose‖ or ―with the object‖ of providing such a benefit to an employee. Purpose of the arrangement or purpose of the parties? 45. Given that the words ―for the benefit to be provided‖ mean for the purpose or with the object of providing the benefit, the issue arises as to who or what must have this purpose or object. This requires interpreting the words ―an arrangement made between their employer and another person for the benefit to be provided‖. 46. There are two possible interpretations of these words:  First, ―for the benefit to be provided‖ could be read as relating to the word ―arrangement‖. Under this interpretation, s CX 2(2) applies if the arrangement has the purpose or object of providing a benefit to an employee of the employer. This would require an objective inquiry into the arrangement itself, and would not consider the purpose or object of the parties to the arrangement.  Second, ―for the benefit to be provided‖ could be read as relating to the word ―made‖. Under this interpretation, s CX 2(2) applies if the purpose or object of the parties in making the arrangement was for a benefit to be provided to an employee of the employer. 47. Under the first interpretation, s CX 2(2) could have a wider scope than under the second interpretation. It could be possible that, objectively, an arrangement has the purpose or object of providing an employee of the employer with a benefit in circumstances where, subjectively, the parties did not make the arrangement for the purpose or object of providing a benefit to an employee. 48. The meaning of a section must be determined from its text and in the light of its purpose (s 5, Interpretation Act 1999). In determining purpose, the immediate and general legislative context must be considered, as well as the objective of the enactment (Commerce Commission v Fonterra Co- operative Group Ltd \[2007\] NZSC 36). Therefore, the purpose of s CX 2(2) must be considered to determine the best interpretation. 49. An argument favouring the first interpretation of s CX 2(2) above, is that this interpretation is consistent with s BG 1. Under s BG 1, only the objective purpose or effect of the ―arrangement‖, and not the intention of the parties to the arrangement, is relevant to whether there is a ―tax avoidance arrangement‖ (Newton v FCT; Glenharrow Holdings Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 116; Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures v CIR, Accent Management v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 115). Arguably, it is appropriate that s CX 2(2) is interpreted consistently with s BG 1, given they both have an anti-avoidance purpose and share the same definition of ―arrangement‖. 50. However, the second interpretation, requiring consideration of the purpose or object of the parties, could be seen as consistent with the FBT rules. The FBT rules apply where there is a ―fringe benefit‖, which is defined in s CX 2(1)(a) as being a benefit that ―is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment‖. This indicates that the focus of the FBT rules is on benefits that the employer has chosen to give its employees. Understood in this way, the purpose of s CX 2(2) appears to be to prevent employers from deliberately avoiding a 9 liability for FBT by arranging for a third party to provide the benefit instead. 51. The second interpretation is not inconsistent with s BG 1. Unlike s CX 2(2), the wording in s BG 1 is unambiguous in requiring consideration of the purpose or effect of the arrangement. 52. Moreover, the first interpretation, requiring consideration of the purpose or object of the arrangement, arguably creates the potential for overlap with s GB 31. Section GB 31 provides an anti-avoidance rule that applies when ―a purpose or effect of the arrangement \[entered into by two or more persons\] is to defeat the intent and application of any of the FBT rules‖. Section CX 2(5)(a) provides that a benefit may be treated as having been provided by an employer to an employee under s GB 31. 53. Section GB 31(1) is clear that it concerns the purpose or effect of the arrangement and not the purpose or object of the parties to the arrangement. If the drafters had intended the purpose or object of the arrangement to be relevant under s CX 2(2), it would be reasonable to expect that the drafters would have adopted language similar to that used in ss BG 1 and GB 31. 54. The background to s 336N(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976, the earliest predecessor to s CX 2(2), also provides some assistance in understanding the purpose of s CX 2(2) and the FBT rules generally. 55. The FBT rules were enacted in light of the recommendations in the Report of the Task Force on Tax Reform (Wellington, Government Printer, 1982) (the McCaw report). Before the enactment of the FBT rules, fringe benefits were generally not taxed. The McCaw report considered that the non-taxable status of fringe benefits was unsatisfactory because it increased the inequity in the tax system and narrowed the tax base (at \[6.185\]). 56. In the third reading debate of the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No 2), which introduced the FBT rules, the Minister of Finance stated that the purpose of fringe benefit tax was to ―close ... off loopholes that are a major source of unfairness in income distribution‖, and that ((22 March 1985) 462 NZPD 3920): In the Government‘s view it is fair to tax the employers, the basic reason being that it is the employers which have been using fringe benefit payments to lower the cost structures of their business. I gave the example in the Committee of an employer who might want to put together a package of $100,000. He could pay $40,000 in terms of salary, then put together a fringe benefit package of about $20,000 in various forms, which was the equivalent of tax paid income of $60,000. In other words, for $60,000 in terms of cost structure to the business the employer was able to put together a salary package equivalent of $100,000. In those circumstances the Government believes it is fair and equitable to tax the employer. 57. The Minister of Finance‘s speech indicates that the mischief Parliament sought to remedy by enacting the FBT rules was the ability of employers to decrease the costs of employment by substituting assessable income with non-assessable fringe benefits. While the Minister did not specifically discuss the clause of the Bill that became s 336N(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976, his comments suggest that s 336N(2) was intended to cover the specific situation of an employer that knowingly seeks to avoid a liability for FBT by arranging for a benefit to be provided to an employee by a third party. 58. Therefore, the Commissioner‘s view is that the scheme of the FBT rules and the legislative history suggest that s CX 2(2) requires the 10 determination of the purpose or object of the parties (that is, the employer and the third party) in making the arrangement. Which party’s purpose? 59. It is the parties‘ purpose or object in making the arrangement that is relevant. Where both the employer and third party share the same purpose, then determining whether s CX 2(2) applies will be straightforward. However, in some situations the employer and third party may each have a different purpose or object in making the arrangement. 60. For example, where the third party agrees to provide the benefit because the employer has stated it will withhold business from the third party unless it does so, arguably the third party has not made the arrangement for the purpose or with the object of providing a benefit to an employee. Instead, the third party arguably made the arrangement for the purpose or with the object of preserving its business with the employer. The issue then arises as to whose purpose should be considered determinative when deciding whether s CX 2(2) applies. 61. The Commissioner‘s view is that the scheme of the FBT rules supports the employer‘s purpose being determinative in these situations. 62. A liability for FBT is imposed on benefits provided by employers to their employees. The FBT rules are not, as a rule, concerned with benefits provided to employees by persons who are not their employers. Section CX 2(2) is an exception to this rule. Section CX 2(2) has an anti- avoidance purpose. It seeks to prevent employers from avoiding a liability for FBT by arranging for third parties to provide benefits to their employees. 63. The scheme of the FBT rules supports s CX 2(2) applying where the employer, but not the third party, makes the arrangement with the purpose of providing a benefit to an employee. In such cases, a liability for FBT is avoided where it would have arisen if the benefit had instead been provided by the employer directly. Moreover, the third party is not seeking to avoid its liability for FBT, because it has no liability. At most, the third party might be a knowing participant in the employer‘s arrangement. More likely, perhaps, the third party would be pursuing their own commercial non-tax objectives and may be ignorant of, or indifferent to, the employer‘s purpose. 64. By contrast, the scheme of the FBT rules does not support s CX 2(2) applying where the third party, but not the employer, makes the arrangement with the purpose of providing a benefit to an employee. If s CX 2(2) were to apply in such cases because of the third party‘s purpose, then FBT would be imposed despite the employer not having the purpose of providing a benefit to its employee. The imposition of FBT in these circumstances seems unfair and illogical. 65. In summary, where the employer and the third party each have a different purpose or object in making the arrangement, s CX 2(2) will apply only if the employer‘s purpose or object in making the arrangement was to provide a benefit to an employee. Objective or subjective test? 66. The above conclusions combine to show that, for an ―arrangement‖ to be caught under s CX 2(2), the purpose or object of the employer must have 11 been to provide the employee with a benefit. This part of the commentary considers whether the test should be a subjective or an objective one. 67. In the current context, a subjective test would look at what the particular employer had in mind when the arrangement with the third party was entered into. An objective test, however, would consider what a reasonable person in the position of the employer should have had in mind. 68. Case law, particularly in the area of GST, indicates that the correct test for determining purpose is a mixed test, considering both subjective and objective factors in reaching a conclusion as to a taxpayer‘s purpose. In several cases, the courts have held that the test for purpose is dependent on the statutory context in which it is found (see, for example, CIR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,198 (CA)). 69. Therefore, the wording of s CX 2(2) must be looked at closely. Section CX 2(2) does not contain the word ―purpose‖ or ―object‖. It requires that the ―arrangement‖ be ―made between‖ the employer and the third party ―for the benefit to be provided‖. 70. The Commissioner‘s view is that s CX 2(2) requires a consideration of the reason the employer ―made‖ the ―arrangement‖ with the third party. This means the test to determine the employer‘s purpose or object in making the arrangement should be subjective, looking at the particular reasons the employer had in mind (see, for example, G v CIR). However, the employer‘s reasons should be tested in light of the surrounding circumstances (CIR v National Distributors Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346 (CA)). 71. For s CX 2(2) to apply, therefore, the reason the employer made the arrangement must have been to provide a benefit to its employee. Which purpose test should be applied? 72. A number of tests could be used to determine the purpose or object of the employer in making the arrangement with the third party. 73. At one end of the spectrum is a sole purpose test. This test requires that the provision of a benefit to an employee is the sole or only purpose of the employer in making the arrangement. The Commissioner considers this would be an unduly restrictive test for s CX 2(2) because it would not apply in any situation where another purpose existed, no matter how secondary or minor. 74. At the other end of the spectrum, is the test that the section will apply if any one of the purposes of the employer in making the arrangement is that the employee be provided with a benefit. The Commissioner considers this is also an inappropriate test in the context of s CX 2(2). This is because the section would catch all benefits that were provided to employees even if the employer had only an incidental relevant purpose. If the provision of the benefit is truly incidental to the purpose of the employer, then the section should not apply. 75. Between these two extremes are the dominant purpose test and the more than incidental purpose test. 76. The dominant purpose test would require that the main reason the employer made the arrangement with the third party was for the benefit to be provided to the employee. This test would allow the employer to have other purposes in making the arrangement but, for the section to 12 apply, the main purpose of the employer in making the ―arrangement‖ needs to be the provision of the benefit. 77. Several cases have determined that the word ―purpose‖ used on its own in statutory language without any apparent qualifier means the dominant purpose of the taxpayer; for example, in s CB 4 (Personal property acquired for the purpose of disposal) (and predecessor provisions) and in s 108 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (the former s BG 1). 78. The Commissioner considers it would not be appropriate to apply a dominant purpose test in determining whether s CX 2(2) applies. The words of s CX 2(2) do not indicate that a dominant purpose test is necessary. This can be contrasted with s CB 4, where the section clearly refers to ―the purpose‖ \[Emphasis added\]. 79. The final option is a more than incidental purpose test. This test would be similar to the test applied for s BG 1, where the section will apply as long as the purpose of tax avoidance is more than merely incidental to any other purpose in entering the arrangement. In the context of s CX 2(2), this means that if the provision of the benefit is incidental to other purposes of the ―arrangement‖, such as the provision of credit cards to employees or obtaining a good package deal for the employer, then the section would not apply. 80. The use of this test could be seen as supported by s CX 2(2) being an anti-avoidance provision and it being appropriate to have a similar test to other avoidance provisions. Alternatively, it could be argued that a more than incidental test is not appropriate, because the language of s BG 1 explicitly provides for the test of more than merely incidental in the legislation itself, whereas s CX 2(2) does not. 81. Overall, the Commissioner considers that the more than incidental test is the appropriate test to be adopted in s CX 2(2). A more than incidental test means that the purpose of the employer must be significant in order for the benefit to be caught within the section, but does not need to be the most important (or dominant) reason or purpose of the employer in making the ―arrangement‖. 82. If an employer has more than one purpose when they made the ―arrangement‖ with the third party, a significant, but not dominant, purpose of providing a benefit to employees should be caught by the section. If , however, the provision of a benefit is no more than incidental to some other purpose of the employer in making the arrangement with the third party, then s CX 2(2) will not apply. 83. In determining the employer‘s purpose or object, therefore, the relevant consideration is the subjective purpose or object of the employer in making the ―arrangement‖. For s CX 2(2) to apply, the employer must have, at least, a more than incidental purpose or object of providing a benefit to an employee in making the arrangement. Can s CX 2(2) apply where there is an employee–third party arrangement? 84. In some cases, where a benefit is provided to an employee by a third party, it might be argued that there are two arrangements ―for‖ that benefit to be provided – one arrangement between the employer and third party and another between the employee and third party. In such cases, the issue may arise whether the presence of an arrangement between the employee and third party for the provision of a benefit means that same 13 benefit cannot have been provided under an arrangement between the employer and third party. 85. For instance, an employer makes an arrangement with a local gym under which the gym agrees to provide free membership to the employer‘s employees. To obtain this free membership, employees must undertake the gym‘s membership process (including agreeing to its standard terms and conditions of use). In this situation, it might be argued that s CX 2(2) cannot apply because the gym membership has been provided through an arrangement between the gym and the employee and, therefore, not through the arrangement between the employer and the gym. 86. The Commissioner‘s view is that an employee-third party arrangement for a benefit to be provided does not prevent the same benefit from being provided through an employer-third party arrangement to which s CX 2(2) applies. Section CX 2(2) does not expressly or implicitly exclude itself from applying because the benefit concerned may also have been provided through an employee-third party arrangement. Accordingly, s CX 2(2) may apply even if the benefit may also have been provided through an employee-third party arrangement. What is the meaning of “benefit”? 87. As noted above, a fringe benefit is defined in s CX 2(1) as ―a benefit that... is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment‖. 88. The term ―benefit‖ is not defined in the Act. Therefore, the ordinary meaning of the word must be considered. The Concise Oxford Dictionary relevantly defines the word ―benefit‖ to mean ―an advantage or profit gained from something.‖ The meaning of ―benefit‖ is, therefore, very wide. 89. In Case M9 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,069, Bathgate DCJ considered the meaning of the word ―benefit‖ when considering whether the provision of a motor vehicle was subject to FBT. He stated at 2,074: A feature of the definition of ―fringe benefit‖ is the rather involved detail used to specify what is a fringe benefit and what is not a fringe benefit, particularly the latter. A ―fringe benefit‖ is however a ―benefit‖, including the availability for the private use or enjoyment of any person of a motor vehicle, as defined. The section itself to an extent explains what is a benefit, for the purposes of a fringe benefit; so long as something is provided by an employer to an employee that can be reasonably, practically and sensibly understood as a benefit to the employee in itself and is not expressly excluded, would be sufficient for it to be a benefit for the purposes of the definition of “fringe benefit” as provided by the section. \[Emphasis added\] 90. While the legislative provision considered in Case M9 was a predecessor to s CX 2, the principles remain relevant as the definition of ―fringe benefit‖ still requires that a benefit be provided by an employer to an employee. 91. Based on Case M9, a ―benefit‖ is something provided by an employer that can be ―reasonably, practically and sensibly understood as a benefit to the employee‖. Whether a fringe benefit is provided does not depend on whether employees consider that they have received an advantage or benefit. This conclusion is consistent with the analysis on the meaning of ―benefit‖ in QB 12/06 ―Fringe benefit tax – ̳Availability‘ benefits‖ (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 4 (May 2012): 32). 14 92. Further assistance as to the meaning of the term ―benefit‖ can be obtained from a review of the purpose of the FBT rules. The purpose of the rules can be ascertained from the McCaw report which recommended the introduction of FBT. 93. In setting out the case for taxing fringe benefits, the report states at \[6.181\] to \[6.182\]: Fringe benefits do not, under existing legislation, generally represent assessable income of the recipient. Some benefits provided in kind, such as accommodation and food, are assessable in terms of the existing tax law. The courts have held that other benefits provided in kind are not assessable unless they can be converted into cash by the recipient. Cash payments are assessable except to the extent that they can be demonstrated to be reimbursement of expenses incurred in gaining or producing assessable income. The Task Force does not consider that such reimbursement allowances constitute a fringe benefit and therefore does not propose any change to the current tax exempt status. ... Fringe benefits that reduce an employee’s need to meet private outgoings from income clearly increase a taxpayer’s capacity to pay in just the same way as does the payment of additional salary or wages in cash. Those who receive part of their remuneration in this form do not bear their fair share of the tax burden. Furthermore employers who provide non-taxable benefits in lieu of salary or wages are in a favoured position as their total labour cost is reduced. 94. From this, it can be seen that fringe benefits are benefits that provide an economic advantage to an employee because they reduce an employee‘s need to meet private expenditure from their income. In economic terms, benefits of this type are equivalent to the payment of additional salary or wages in money to the employee. 95. The meaning of ―benefit‖ was also considered in Case M59 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,339. In Case M59 Bathgate DCJ stated at 2,343: The fringe benefit by way of the provision of the overseas travel and accommodation was provided by the objectors as the employers before 1 April 1985, when they paid the costs of the employees' proposed travel with the travel agents or firms consulted by the employees. Although that benefit may not have been used or enjoyed by the employees until after 1 April 1985, that was not, in my view, a ―fringe benefit‖, because a fringe benefit as defined by the Act requires two steps and not just one, namely the provision of the benefit by the employer and the use or enjoyment of the benefit by the employee. The enjoyment of the fact of travel by the employees may well be a benefit, but without the provision of that by the employer it is not a ―fringe benefit‖ for FBT purposes. \[Emphasis added\] 96. However, Case M59 was considered in the context of the language used in the Income Tax Act 1976, which defined ―fringe benefit‖ as a ―benefit that is used, enjoyed, or received ...‖. The rewritten definition of ―fringe benefit‖ does not include any element of use or enjoyment (by the employee of the benefit provided). In terms of the rewritten definition, all that is required is that the employer has provided a benefit to an employee. 97. Given that s CX 2(2) is an anti-avoidance provision, and essentially treats a benefit provided by a third party to be a fringe benefit provided by an employer, a further issue exists as to whether what the employee receives from the third party needs to be a benefit that the public is unable to receive. 98. The Commissioner considers that, given the conclusion as to the broad meaning of the term ―benefit‖, a fringe benefit can include something the employee could receive on their own account, or that the public could 15 receive. This conclusion is consistent with ―The meaning of ̳benefit‘ for FBT purposes‖ (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 2 (March 2006): 26), which considers whether an employer provides a benefit where an employee pays for goods or services obtained from their employer, or where the employer also benefits from the employee‘s receipt of the goods or services. What is the meaning of “provided”? 99. Section CX 2(2) requires that a benefit be ―provided to an employee through an arrangement‖. For a benefit to be caught under s CX 2(2), the third party must provide it to the employee. An ―arrangement‖ between the parties for access to the employees is insufficient. The ―arrangement‖ must be for the ―provision‖ of a benefit for s CX 2(2) to apply. 100. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines the term ―provide‖ as ―make available for use; supply‖. 101. Several cases have discussed the meaning of the word ―provide‖. These cases show that the meaning of ―provide‖ depends on the facts and circumstances of each case (see for example Ginty v Belmont Building Supplies Ltd \[1959\] 1 All ER 414 (QBD) at 422). 102. In Norris v Syndi Manufacturing Co Ltd \[1952\] 1 All ER 935 (CA), an employee had removed the safety guard from a machine to carry out tests. His employer was aware that the employee took the guard off to test the machine and had told him to replace it ―after testing and before operation‖. The employee inadvertently injured himself while working without the guard one day. The Court of Appeal found that the guard had been ―provided‖ by the employer, and that the duty to provide the guard did not require that the employer should have to order the workers to use it. Romer LJ stated at 940: The primary meaning of the word “provide” is to “furnish” or “supply”, and, accordingly, on the plain, ordinary interpretation of s. 119 (1), a workman‘s statutory obligation is to use safety devices which are furnished or supplied for his use by his employers. \[Emphasis added\] 103. See also Tranz Rail Ltd (TIA Interisland Line) v New Zealand Seafarers’ Union \[1996\] 1 ERNZ 216 (EC), and Pierce v FCT 98 ATC 2240 (AAAT). 104. Accordingly, for something to have been ―provided‖ to an employee by a third party in the context of s CX 2(2), it must be supplied, furnished, or made available to that employee. Salary sacrifice situations 105. This Ruling does not consider or rule on the taxation implications of salary sacrifice situations. Different considerations may apply to determine the tax treatment. For example, the benefit may have been provided by the employer in such a situation, or there may be other relevant aspects of the arrangement. These considerations may affect whether or not s CX 2(2) will have any application. 106. In the context of the Ruling, salary sacrifice situations include situations where the remuneration given by an employer to an employee is reduced because of a benefit being received by the employee from a third party (or because of the possibility of a benefit being received), or where the remuneration of the employee otherwise takes the receipt of a benefit provided by a third party into account. 16 Examples 107. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. They consider whether the requirements of s CX 2(2) are satisfied. The examples do not consider whether FBT will be payable on a benefit provided through an arrangement to which s CX 2(2) applies. Section CX 2(2) may apply but FBT will not be payable because of the other provisions in subpart CX or the operation of the valuation rules contained in subpart RD. 108. These examples all assume that there has been no sacrifice of salary by the employee receiving the benefit. Example 1 109. ABC Bank wishes to offer the employees of XYZ Ltd a low interest loan facility. ABC approaches XYZ, which agrees to ABC‘s offer and agrees to pay ABC the difference between the interest rate offered to employees and the current market interest rate. 110. On the facts of this example, the requirements of s CX 2(2) are clearly satisfied. An ―arrangement‖ exists between ABC and XYZ, and the purpose of the employer in making the arrangement is for the provision of a benefit to XYZ‘s employees. This is evidenced by the fact consideration has been passed between the employer and the third party for the benefit being provided. Example 2 111. A credit card company approaches the manager of BCE Ltd, and asks whether BCE would allow it to approach BCE‘s employees to offer them credit cards (for the employees‘ personal use). The credit card company proposes that all staff members who choose to receive cards would be allowed to join the credit card company‘s loyalty scheme (which has no joining fee, but is available only to selected cardholders). BCE agrees to this request, but suggests that the credit card company might wish to provide a slightly discounted interest rate to the employees, so that the offer does not waste the employees‘ time. The credit card company agrees to this change. BCE provides no consideration to the credit card company. The credit card company is keen to secure BCE employees as customers and is happy to agree to offer the employees the additional benefits. 112. In this example, there is an ―arrangement‖ between the employer and the third party. BCE and the credit card company have agreed to the credit card company undertaking a particular course of action. However, s CX 2(2) will not apply in this situation. The agreement does not include the provision of a benefit, but merely allows the credit card company access to BCE‘s employees to offer them a benefit. The main purpose of BCE in entering into the arrangement is to allow the credit card company to offer a benefit to BCE‘s employees that will be of potential interest to the employees. The provision of a benefit, if it is a purpose of BCE, will be incidental to this. Therefore, s CX 2(2) will not apply to this arrangement. Example 3 113. A local retailer approaches MNO Ltd and asks permission to display advertising brochures on MNO‘s premises and for MNO to place an advertisement on the company‘s intranet. After a cursory inspection of 17 the brochures and advertisement, MNO agrees. MNO also agrees to allow the retailer to email interested staff with updated specials (staff are given the opportunity not to receive the email updates). The brochures and subsequent email messages invite the employees to join a loyalty programme, which gives them the possibility of receiving rewards. 114. In this example, there will be an ―arrangement‖ between MNO and the local retailer, as they have agreed on a future course of action. However, the arrangement will not be ―for‖ the provision of a benefit. MNO has agreed only to allow the local retailer access to its employees, and this is its main purpose in entering into the arrangement. Any purpose MNO may have of benefiting its employees is incidental to this purpose. The ―arrangement‖ is ―for‖ access to MNO‘s premises or to allow the local retailer to communicate with the employees directly or by electronic means, not to provide a benefit to employees. Therefore, s CX 2(2) will not apply to this arrangement. Example 4 115. BB Ltd is a large company with several high net worth employees. BB contacts its bank and asks the bank to offer a low interest mortgage facility to BB‘s employees, which would also permit employees to obtain a mortgage with a smaller deposit than would usually be required. BB believes the bank will agree to this request because BB has a lot of business with the bank. Additionally, it is expected that the bank will get a great deal of business from the employees of BB, because BB has told the bank it is aware of a reasonable number of staff members who would be interested in such a facility. The bank is attracted by the level of business it might achieve with the employees and is also keen to maintain the good relationship it has with BB, so it puts together a proposal, which it presents to BB. BB considers that the proposal is worthwhile, so asks the bank to make the facility available to employees. BB also agrees to help promote the facility by putting up posters and making brochures available in the workplace, and by sending an email message to staff informing them of the facility. 116. In this example, there is an ―arrangement‖ between BB and the bank that is ―for‖ the provision of a benefit to employees. The course of action agreed to by the parties involves the provision of a benefit to employees. BB has not simply entered into the arrangement with the purpose of allowing the bank access to the employees. Rather, BB has entered into the arrangement with a more than incidental purpose of providing employees with a benefit. This is evidenced by the fact BB has an expectation that the bank would comply with its request and because it is aware of staff members who would be interested in the facility. Therefore, s CX 2(2) will apply to this arrangement. Example 5 117. STU Ltd and VWX Ltd are companies in the same group of companies. The group has a widely understood policy that all companies in the group will provide discounted products or services to all employees of companies in the group, although this policy has never been put into writing. STU, therefore, provides interested VWX employees with discounts on its products. 118. In this example, there will be an ―arrangement‖ for the provision of a benefit, and VWX will be liable to FBT on any benefits received by its employees from STU. There is a group policy that each company will 18 provide the employees of the other companies in the group with benefits. Therefore, there is an understanding between VWX and STU that each will act in a particular way, that understanding extending to the provision of a benefit, and the purpose of the policy is to allow employees to be provided with benefits by STU. Therefore, s CX 2(2) will apply to this arrangement. Example 6 119. DFG, a travel agent, employs several staff and enters into a scheme with YTR, an airline, to strengthen its relationship with YTR. The scheme involves YTR agreeing to give a certain number of free domestic flights per year to employees of DFG who excel in promoting and selling YTR flights. In return, DFG agrees to have its employees promote YTR flights and convert flights to YTR wherever possible. To determine which employees are entitled to free flights, DFG awards its staff with points for outstanding customer service. Once a staff member has accumulated the required number of points, they are entitled to a free flight from YTR. There is no cost to DFG for those flights. 120. In this example, s CX 2(2) will apply. There is an ―arrangement‖ between the parties, as the course of action agreed to by DFG and YTR involves the provision of a benefit to employees. One of the main purposes of DFG in entering into the arrangement is to provide the staff with free flights. Although DFG has another significant purpose in entering into the arrangement, which is to strengthen its relationship with YTR, the purpose of providing a benefit to employees is not incidental to that purpose. Example 7 121. HJK is a large nationwide employer with many staff. A senior manager of HJK approaches LMN, a nationwide chain of retail stores, and suggests that LMN might like to consider offering a discount to HJK employees. LMN agrees to consider this idea and decides to allow a 10% discount to all HJK staff at all of its stores. This is achieved by providing all employees with a discount card. HJK does not give any consideration for this, has made no suggestion that it will do business with LMN if a discount is permitted, and has not been involved in discussions about the level of the discount or any other details of the offer. LMN has decided to offer the employees the discount because it believes LMN will obtain a substantial amount of business. 122. Section CX 2(2) will not apply in this situation. There is no ―arrangement‖ between the parties that encompasses the provision of the benefit, as the only course of action agreed to by the parties is that LMN will consider the idea. HJK has done no more than initiate discussions with LMN, and the decision to offer a benefit to employees was made unilaterally by LMN. Although the purpose of HJK could be argued to be the provision of a benefit, there is no ―arrangement‖ with LMN that is ―for‖ such provision. Example 8 123. An employee works for a company. She obtains a personal credit card and joins its associated points reward scheme. Under that scheme, she can accumulate points as goods and services are charged on the credit card. After the employee accumulates 10,000 points, she can transfer those points, at her option, to any one of several airlines‘ frequent flyer schemes affiliated to the credit card company‘s points reward scheme. Once she accumulates a specified number of points on the airline frequent flyer scheme, she can exchange them for free or discounted travel. 19 124. In the course of the employee‘s work, she incurs several employment- related charges on the credit card as well as private expenditure. The employee accumulates points on the credit card points reward scheme for both types of expenditure. She soon reaches the specified threshold of points and transfers them to a particular airline‘s frequent flyer scheme, exchanging them for a free trip to Fiji. 125. Section CX 2(2) will not apply on the facts of this example. The receipt of the points under the credit card company‘s points reward scheme is because of the contractual arrangement between the credit card company and the employee. There has been no significant contact between the employer and the credit card company. No arrangement exists between the employer and the credit card company to provide the employee with entitlements under its points reward scheme or the associated airline‘s frequent flyer scheme. It does not matter that some of the points that give the entitlement result from employment-related expenditure. Example 9 126. Following from example 8, in the following year the employee is promoted in the company and receives a corporate charge card on which she is specified as the cardholder. The charge card is from a different company to that which issued her personal card. This particular charge card company also allows cardholders to join its points reward scheme. The employee joins the points reward scheme as an individual member and pays the membership fee personally. The employee‘s employer is not involved in encouraging the employee to join the scheme. This scheme also allows an accumulation of points as goods and services are charged on the card and a transfer of points, subject to certain conditions, to a participating airline‘s frequent flyer scheme. 127. Section CX 2(2) will not apply on the facts of this example. There has been no significant contact between the employer and the credit card company. There is no arrangement between the employer and the credit card company to provide entitlements to the employee under the points reward scheme. The employee receives those entitlements because of her contractual relationship with the credit card company. Example 10 128. QRS purchases motor vehicles for business purposes from a motor vehicle dealer. As a result of QRS‘ substantial custom, the dealer states that it will discount QRS‘ future purchases. It also informs QRS that the more vehicles purchased, the greater the discount. To increase the discount, QRS asks the dealer to offer the same discount to the employees of QRS. QRS tells the dealer that many of its employees would like to purchase vehicles and it expects that they would be induced to buy vehicles from the dealer if they were offered the same discount. The dealer agrees to offer the employees the same discount as it provides to QRS. 129. In this example, QRS has requested that the dealer provide its employees with a discount on any vehicles they purchase. Because of QRS‘ substantial custom, the dealer agreed to offer the discount to the employees. There is an arrangement between the dealer and QRS that is for the provision of a benefit (ie the discount) to the employees. Although the dominant purpose of QRS may be to obtain a higher discount on its future vehicle purchases, a significant purpose of it entering into the arrangement is so that the same discount is offered to its employees. 20 Therefore, s CX 2(2) will apply, because QRS made the arrangement with a more than incidental purpose to provide its employees with a benefit.

The Rulings consider whether GST input tax deductions are available to registered persons who acquire fishing quota, coastal permits or certificates of compliance from unregistered persons. For a registered person to claim an input tax deduction, fishing quota, coastal permits and certificates of compliance must be “secondhand goods”. The term “goods” is defined as including all kinds of real and personal property, but excludes choses in action. 2. Fishing quota is property. However, fishing quota is also a chose in action. Therefore, fishing quota is excluded from the definition of “goods” and cannot be “secondhand goods” for the purposes of the GSTA. 3. The Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) makes it clear that coastal permits and certificates of compliance are not personal or real property. Therefore, coastal permits and certificates of compliance are not “goods” and cannot be “secondhand goods” for the purposes of the GSTA. 4. Given fishing quota, coastal permits and certificates of compliance are not “secondhand goods”, a registered person cannot claim a secondhand goods input tax deduction for them. Background 5. BR Pub 15/01 and BR Pub 15/02 are reissues of BR Pub 09/04 and BR Pub 09/05, which expired on 30 June 2014. These Rulings are essentially the same as BR Pub 09/04 and BR Pub 09/05. However, they have been amended to reflect the new “use, or available for use” test in 6 the GSTA. The Commissioner considers that this change does not affect the outcome of the Rulings. 6. While most fishing quota, coastal permits and certificates of compliance are held by large organisations that are registered for GST, unregistered persons still hold some of these rights. Some of these unregistered persons may not make supplies in excess of $60,000 in a 12-month period, so are not required to register for GST under s 51. However, one of these unregistered persons may sell their fishing quota, coastal permits or certificates of compliance to a person who is registered for GST. The Rulings consider whether the registered person may claim a secondhand goods input tax deduction. Application of the GST legislation 7. The starting place to determine whether a GST input tax deduction is available to a registered person who acquires fishing quota, coastal permits or certificates of compliance from an unregistered person is s 20(3). 8. Section 20(3) provides that a person, in calculating the amount of output tax payable, may deduct input tax paid in relation to the supply of secondhand goods to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period. The GSTA provides similar tests for claiming an input tax deduction for supplies of secondhand goods irrespective of the basis of registration (ie, invoice, payments or hybrid basis). 9. “Input tax” is defined in s 3A. For secondhand goods, the relevant provision is s 3A(1)(c), which refers to subss (2) and (3) of s 3A. Five relevant requirements need to be satisfied under subs (2) before the amount of the input tax deduction for a secondhand good can be calculated under subs (3). These requirements are that:  there is a supply by way of sale;  the supply is not a taxable supply;  the supply is made to a GST-registered person;  the supply is of secondhand goods; and  the secondhand goods are situated in New Zealand at the time of supply. 10. In addition, under s 20(3C) a person’s input tax deduction is limited by “the extent to which the goods or services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies”. 11. All but one of these requirements are specified in the Arrangement considered by the Rulings to ensure they will be satisfied in every instance in which the Ruling applies. The exception is the requirement that the supply be of secondhand goods. The issue considered by these Rulings, therefore, is whether fishing quota, coastal permits and certificates of compliance can be “secondhand goods”. “Secondhand goods” 12. The definition of “secondhand goods” in s 2 does not define the term, but prescribes a list of things that are not included in the meaning of “secondhand goods”. Fishing quota, coastal permits and certificates of 7 compliance are not excluded under the definition. Because the definition gives little indication as to the meaning of the term “secondhand goods”, it is necessary to look at the ordinary meaning. 13. “Secondhand goods” is a composite term. It relates to items that are first of all “goods” and then the subset of those goods that can be described as “secondhand”. “Goods” 14. “Goods” is defined widely in s 2 as including all kinds of real and personal property, but excluding choses in action, money and electronic products. 15. The meaning of “property” is discussed in Garrow and Fenton’s Law of Personal Property (7th ed, vol 1, Lexis Nexis, Wellington, 2010) at 2: The term “property” has varying usages within the law of Commonwealth countries including New Zealand. One common usage has a narrow meaning – that, in a legal sense, title has passed. ... A related but more general usage signifies a thing owned, that over which title is exercised. For example, when it is said that a person’s property includes cars, books, royalty rights, and other property it is frequently the second sense of the word “property” that is intended. In the first sense a person has property in a particular item; in the second sense, it is said that a person owns certain items of property. The context generally indicates which form is used. 16. From this, it can be seen that the term “property” is used to describe a wide variety of things, both tangible and intangible. Its fundamental characteristics are that it is capable of being owned and that the rights of ownership are capable of being transferred. “Property” also needs to be defined and identified, and have a degree of permanence or stability (National Provincial Bank Ltd v Ainsworth \[1965\] 2 All ER 472 (HL) at 494). 17. All “property” can be categorised as real property (ie interests in land) or personal property (see Garrow and Fenton’s Law of Personal Property (7th ed, vol 1, Lexis Nexis, Wellington, 2010) at 10). As there are only two categories of “property”, a determination that an item is “property”, will mean that it will satisfy the first part of the definition of “goods” in the GSTA without the need to determine whether it is real or personal property. 18. Once it is determined that an item is “property” it is necessary to determine whether it is excluded from the definition of “goods” in s 2 by virtue of being a “chose in action” (the other exclusions do not apply to fishing quota, coastal permits or certificates of compliance). 19. The term “chose in action” was described in Torkington v Magee \[1900–3\] All ER 991 (KB) at 994: Chose in action is a known legal expression used to describe all personal rights of property which can only be claimed or enforced by action, and not by taking physical possession. 20. This definition was also stated by the Court of Appeal in Re Marshall (deceased), CIR v Public Trustee \[1965\] NZLR 851 (CA) at 861. 21. The fundamental characteristics of a chose in action, therefore, are that a person cannot take the right into physical possession, and that court action is necessary to enforce the advantages of ownership. 8 “Secondhand” 22. There have been few cases on the meaning of the term “secondhand goods” in the GST context. In Case N16 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,142 Judge Barber had to consider whether deer velvet purchased direct from producers by means of commission agents was a secondhand good when it was subsequently acquired by a distributor and exporter of deer velvet. 23. Judge Barber concluded that the deer velvet was not a secondhand good. Judge Barber accepted that the two key concepts underlying whether something is secondhand are previous ownership and previous use. He stated at 3,148: I agree with counsel that the concept of secondhand relates to pre-ownership or pre- use. I agree ... that the emphasis is on pre-use. I consider that there is quite some commonsense flexibility in ascertaining whether a good is still new or has become secondhand. I do not regard second ownership as necessarily rendering an item secondhand. Many goods pass from manufacturer to wholesaler or retailer to customer or consumer (with other levels of distributors sometimes also involved), and yet are not regarded as secondhand at the consumer purchaser level, even though the item has been used as stock-in-trade at the various distribution levels. The good is not usually regarded as secondhand until it has been used for its intrinsic purpose. 24. Judge Barber considered that previous ownership of goods is not in itself necessarily sufficient to meet the test of secondhand in the GSTA. Usually, a previous owner must have also used the goods for their intrinsic purpose. 25. Subsequently, the Court of Appeal considered the meaning of secondhand goods in LR McLean & Co Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,211. McKay J at 11,219 expressly referred to and agreed with Judge Barber’s comments in Case N16 as to the ordinary meaning of the term “secondhand”. Richardson J stated at 11,213: The short point of the appeal is whether wool purchased by registered persons from unregistered persons is secondhand goods for the purposes of the 1985 Act. If the expression secondhand goods is given its ordinary and natural meaning it is common ground that it is not within that description. In ordinary usage the expression refers to goods which have been used, although depending on the context it may apply to goods which are no longer new or even in some contexts goods which have simply been previously owned. Mr Harley for the appellants did not seek to draw any distinction based on “use” of the wool by the sellers. The argument for the appellants is that to accord with the scheme and purpose of the legislation the expression has to be given the meaning of any goods which have been purchased by a registered person. 26. The judgments of the Court of Appeal state that the term “secondhand” should be given its ordinary or normal meaning. While “secondhand” can mean pre-owned or pre-used, the Court concluded that it is not sufficient that the goods were previously owned. If an item were “secondhand” simply through being previously owned, the term “secondhand” would be deprived of any practical meaning according to Richardson J. Therefore, the Court of Appeal concluded that the more relevant factor is whether the goods have been previously used. 27. The effect of this is that the courts have not extended the meaning of the term “secondhand goods” to goods that have been previously owned but not previously used for their intrinsic purpose. 9 Conclusion 28. For a secondhand goods input tax deduction to be available to a registered person who acquires fishing quota, coastal permits or certificates of compliance from an unregistered person, the fishing quota, coastal permits or certificates of compliance must:  be real or personal property;  not be choses in action; and  be secondhand. 29. The following analysis considers the nature of fishing quota, coastal permits and certificates of compliance to determine whether they satisfy these criteria. Nature of fishing quota 30. The fishing quota considered by this commentary are individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements as defined in s 2 of the Fisheries Act 1996 (FA 1996). 31. Individual transferable quota were established and allocated in 1986 under the Fisheries (Quota Management Areas, Total Allowable Catches, and Catch Histories) Notice 1986, which was issued under the Fisheries Act 1983 (FA 1983). They appear to have been allocated based on a person’s commercial fishing history. No charge was made for the quota initially allocated. However, individual transferable quota do not provide “free” rights because an annual levy must be paid. These levies are typically significant. 32. Under the FA 1983, the fundamental rights acquired by the holder of individual transferable quota (as determined from the legislation) were that the quota holder had the right to catch and take away for their own purposes:  a specified quantity,  of a particular fish species,  from a particular area (the quota management area),  in a specific period (in a year, although a quota is issued in perpetuity). 33. These rights could be dealt with in ordinary commercial dealings; they could be bought and sold, used as security and have interests registered against them. 34. The FA 1996 introduced the concept of an “annual catch entitlement”. Instead of the individual transferable quota providing a right to catch a specified amount of fish, the individual transferable quota now “generates” an annual catch entitlement on the first day of the fishing year under s 66 of the FA 1996. Section 74 of the FA 1996 provides that the annual catch entitlement confers the immediate right to catch fish in a given year. Sections 132 and 133 of the FA 1996 provide that the individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlement may be transferred. For holders of an individual transferable quota, the annual catch entitlement is separately tradable, so that for a particular year a quota owner may sell their annual catch entitlement while retaining the individual transferable 10 quota that will generate another annual catch entitlement the following year. 35. Individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are not the same, but they are both unique rights that may be bought, be sold and, in the case of individual transferable quota, have interests registered against them. Is fishing quota “property”? 36. There is no definitive statement in any of the fisheries legislation as to the nature of fishing quota. The expression “individual transferable quota” was not defined in the FA 1983. Although the term is defined in the FA 1996, the definition appears to have been added to ensure all quota allocated under the different Acts are regarded as fishing quota for the purposes of the FA 1996. 37. Tipping J commented on the nature of fishing quota issued under the FA 1983 in NZ Fishing Industry Association (Inc) v Minister of Fisheries (CA 82/97, 22 July 1997) at 16: While quota are undoubtedly a species of property and a valuable one at that, the rights inherent in that property are not absolute. They are subject to the provisions of the legislation establishing them. That legislation contains the capacity for quota to be reduced. If such reduction is otherwise lawfully made, the fact that quota are a “property right”, to use the appellants’ expression, cannot save them from reduction. That would be to deny an incident integral to the property concerned. \[Emphasis added\] 38. The Court of Appeal also stated that fishing quota issued under the FA 1996 is a “property right” in Sanford Ltd v NZ Recreational Fishing Council Inc \[2008\] NZCA 160 (CA). 39. The courts have confirmed, therefore, that both individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are property. They are definable and identifiable through being granted under a statutory regime. Both are capable of being owned and specific legislative provisions in the FA 1996 deal with the ability of individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements to be transferred. On this basis, the Commissioner accepts that fishing quota are “property”. Are fishing quota “choses in action”? 40. Case law indicates that the fundamental characteristic of a chose in action is that a person cannot take the right into physical possession. 41. Both individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements appear to possess this characteristic. The right to catch fish directly or indirectly cannot be taken into possession. While an argument could be made that a person could simply catch the fish under the quota, this seems to confuse the fish (which could be taken into possession) with the right to catch those fish (which cannot be taken into possession). 42. This conclusion is supported by Antons Trawling Co Ltd v Smith \[2003\] 2 NZLR 23 (HC) where Baragwanath J stated at \[5\] that individual transferable quota are statutory choses in action: The root of title is the issue under the quota management system ... of individual transferable quota (ITQ) which is a statutory chose in action comprising a fraction of the total of exclusive rights to fish commercially a particular species of fish within one of the ten quota management areas into which the exclusive economic zone is divided. Rights to ITQ are codified by the relevant legislation, 11 especially the Fisheries Amendment Act 1986 and the Fisheries Act 1996. \[Emphasis added\] 43. Therefore, both individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are choses in action. Conclusion 44. Given that individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are choses in action, they are excluded from being “goods”. Because they are not “goods”, they cannot be “secondhand goods”. Therefore, a registered person who acquires fishing quota from an unregistered person is not entitled to a GST input tax deduction. Nature of coastal permits and certificates of compliance 45. Section 87 of the RMA defines a “resource consent” to include a consent to do something in a coastal marine area that otherwise would contravene certain provisions of the RMA and calls this kind of consent a “coastal permit”. 46. Section 88 of the RMA provides that resource consents are to be obtained from the local or regional council by application. Section 139 of the RMA provides that where an activity may be lawfully carried out without a resource consent, a certificate of compliance must be applied for instead. Section 139(10) of the RMA deems a certificate of compliance to be a resource consent with the result that the provisions of the RMA are to apply accordingly. 47. Section 122(1) of the RMA states that “a resource consent is neither real nor personal property”. As noted above, all property is either real or personal property. By making this statement, therefore, Parliament has created a legal fiction. It appears Parliament did not want all of the common law and other rights that would automatically attach to property of this nature to attach to resource consents. 48. The definition in s 122(1) of the RMA is not a standard definition. It is not contained in s 2 of the RMA with the other definitions that apply “for the purposes of this Act”. Therefore, it appears Parliament intended s 122(1) of the RMA to have an application wider than simply the RMA. 49. Section 122 of the RMA goes on to deal with the characteristics of resource consents for the purposes of other legislation. After making the initial statement that a resource consent is not real or personal property, the section provides specific exceptions where resource consents are to be regarded as having the characteristics of personal property for the purposes of several specific Acts (including for example the Personal Property and Securities Act 1999) and circumstances. The GSTA is not included as one of the exceptions in s 122 of the RMA. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that s 122(1) of the RMA would apply for the purposes of the GSTA. Conclusion 50. Under s 122 of the RMA coastal permits and certificates of compliance are deemed not to be “personal or real property”. The Commissioner considers this definition is intended to apply for the purposes of other enactments, including the GSTA. 12 51. Therefore, coastal permits and certificates of compliance are not “goods” for the purposes of the GSTA. Because they are not “goods”, they cannot be “secondhand goods”. Therefore, a registered person who acquires coastal permits or certificates of compliance from an unregistered person is not entitled to a GST input tax deduction.

INCOME TAX — INTEREST DEDUCTIBILITY—ROBERTS AND SMITH— BORROWING TO REPLACE AND REPAY AMOUNTS INVESTED IN A BUSINESS OR OTHER INCOME-EARNING ACTIVITY INTEREST DEDUCTIBILITY—FUNDS BORROWED BY A PARTNERSHIP TO RETURN CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO A PARTNER PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 15/04 This is a public ruling made under s 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law Legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of s DB 6 . Specifically, this Ruling applies the replacement and repayment principle in FC of T v Roberts; FC of T v Smith 92 ATC 4,380 (the Roberts and Smith principle). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the borrowing of funds by a partnership where: • the borrowed funds are used to return capital to a partner who previously invested that capital in the partnership; • interest is incurred on the borrowed funds at an arm’s length rate; • the partnership derives assessable and/or excluded income, or carries on a business for the purpose of deriving such income; • the partnership derives the income or carries on the business both at the time the funds are borrowed and when interest is incurred; and • the interest is not deductible to the partner under s DB 7 (Interest: most companies need no nexus with income). The Arrangement does not include arrangements where, or to the extent that, the partnership uses the borrowed funds to make a payment to the partner: • of current year income; • relating to unrealised asset revaluations; or • relating to internally generated goodwill. For the avoidance of doubt, the Arrangement does not include arrangements where subpart BG (Avoidance) applies to void the arrangement. 1 How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: • The partner can deduct their share of interest incurred on the borrowed funds to the extent that the borrowed funds replace the partner’s capital contributions and those capital contributions were: - directly used in carrying on the partnership’s business for the purpose of deriving income; or - directly used in deriving the partnership’s income; or - used to repay other funds borrowed by the partnership and interest incurred on those funds had been deductible. This Ruling is subject to subpart FE (Interest apportionment on thin capitalisation). The purpose of subpart FE is to ensure that worldwide interest expense is apportioned appropriately to a New Zealand taxpayer. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on 24 May 2015. This Ruling is signed by me on 30 April 2015.

Grant Haley Manager, OCTC 11 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR PUB 15/04-15/09 This commentary is not a legally binding statement. It is intended to help readers understand and apply the conclusions in Public Rulings BR Pub 15/04- 15/09 (“the Rulings”). The Rulings and commentary express the Commissioner’s view of the principle set out in the Australian Full Federal Court decision FC of T v Roberts; FC of T v Smith 92 ATC 4,380 ( the Roberts and Smith principle). BR Pub 15/04–15/08 specifically concern deductibility under the Roberts and Smith principle and do not purport to be the Commissioner’s view on all aspects of interest deductibility. However, BR Pub 15/09 is of broader application and considers interest deductibility under s DB 6 more generally. BR Pub 15/04 to 15/08 apply to Arrangements involving the replacement and repayment of existing funding. These Rulings apply to five specific situations where the Commissioner is satisfied that interest incurred on borrowings will be deductible under the Roberts and Smith principle. There may be other fact situations not covered by these Rulings where interest may potentially be deductible (either under the Roberts and Smith principle or s DB 6 more generally). However, such considerations are outside the scope of these binding Rulings. Legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Relevant legislative provisions are reproduced in the Appendix to this commentary.

The purpose of the Rulings is to clarify the test for interest deductibility under s DB 6 in specific fact situations where funds are borrowed to replace and repay existing funding. Other than BR Pub 15/09 (subvention payments), the Rulings apply the principle established in Roberts and Smith and do not focus on interest deductibility generally. 2. Expenditure incurred by a person is generally deductible where a sufficient nexus exists with deriving income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving income. In the interest deductibility context, the Commissioner considers this nexus is established where the borrowed funds are directly used to derive income or are used in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving income. 3. The Roberts and Smith principle provides that a sufficient nexus will also exist where: • a partnership or taxpayer incurs interest on borrowed funds; • the borrowed funds are used to replace existing funding and to repay that funding to the person who invested or lent the funds; and • the existing funding had been used by the partnership or taxpayer to deriv e income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving income. 4. The nexus is established through the new funding replacing existing funding. The existing funding must have had a sufficient connection with income, or interest must have otherwise been deductible under other provisions (such as ss DB 7 or DB 8). 5. Capital contributions, past years’ profits and debt are all forms of existing funding that the Commissioner is satisfied are capable of being replaced. This is not to say that these are the only situations where interest may be deductible, or that interest would not otherwise be deductible under general principles. The Rulings apply the Commissioner’s view of how the Roberts and Smith principle applies to the specific Arrangements covered by each Ruling. Background 6. The Rulings are reissues of BR Pub 10/14–10/19, which expire on 23 May 2015. BR Pub 10/14–BR Pub 10/19 were published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 11 (December 2010) and applied for the period beginning on 23 May 2010 and ending on 23 May 2015. Scope of the Rulings and commentary 7. The Rulings and commentary are intended to have the same scope and effect as the previous Rulings and commentary in BR Pub 10/14–10/19. 2 BR Pub 15/04–15/08 apply to a partnership, company or other taxpayer, and consider the deductibility of interest in specific fact situations under s DB 6 and the Roberts and Smith principle. BR Pub 15/09 states that interest on borrowed funds used to make a subvention payment to a group company (under s IC 5) is not deductible under s DB 6. 8. The Rulings do not apply to look-through companies. A look through company is generally not a “company” under s YA 1 for tax purposes so BR Pub 15/06, 15/07 and 15/09 will not apply. Additionally, the Rulings relating to partnerships (BR Pub 15/04 and 15/05) will not apply. BR Pub 15/08 could potentially apply to the look through owners, each of whom may be a “taxpayer” (given that look through companies a re transparent under s HB 1). Look through companies have not been expressly included in the Rulings because, at the time of publishing the Rulings, the tax rules for closely-held companies and look-through companies were under review. However, the Commissioner has issued specific public items on interest deductibility and look-through companies. These are: • QB 11/03: “Income Tax — look-through companies and interest deductibility” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 10 (December 2011): 16. • QB 12/08: “Income Tax — look-through companies: interest deductibility on funds borrowed to repay shareholder current accounts” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 6 (July 2012): 70. • QB 12/09: “Income Tax — look-through companies: interest deductibility where funds are borrowed to make a payment to shareholders to reflect an asset revaluation” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 6 (July 2012): 72. 9. The Rulings do not apply to arrangements where interest is deductible to a company under s DB 7. This is because s DB 7 provides an automatic deduction for interest incurred by most companies. A company does not need to apply these Rulings if s DB 7 applies. However, some companies cannot apply s DB 7 and so the Rulings are still relevant for those companies. 10. For the avoidance of doubt, the Rulings do not apply to arrangements that are subject to subpart BG. Subpart BG applies to a tax avoidance arrangement, which is void as against the Commissioner for income tax purposes. 11. The deductibility of interest is subject to the thin capitalisation rules in subpart FE. Therefore, the application of the Rulings is also subject to the application of those rules. The application of the thin capitalisation rules is outside the scope of the Rulings and commentary. 12. The Rulings are concerned with the deductibility of interest under the Roberts and Smith principle. Understanding the application of the Roberts and Smith principle does not require revisiting the reason for the deductibility of interest on the existing funding. Therefore, this commentary does not consider the reasons for the deductibility of the interest on the existing funding in any detail. 3 Application of the Legislation 13. The purpose of the following analysis is to provide guidance for understanding and applying the conclusions reached in the Rulings. 14. The analysis does not consider general interest deductibility principles in detail. It is intended to provide guidance for certain specific situations (set out in the Arrangements described in BR Pub 15/04 – 15/08) which the Commissioner is satisfied are covered by the Roberts and Smith principle. 15. The analysis will first briefly set out the general statutory provisions and case law on interest deductibility in New Zealand. The analysis will then consider the application of Roberts and Smith in New Zealand and explain how the Roberts and Smith principle applies to the specific Arrangements in the Rulings. Interest deductibility – relevant provisions Section DA 1 16. A person is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred if the expenditure has a sufficient nexus with income. Section DA 1(1) allows a deduction to the extent that expenditure was incurred in deriving assessable and/or excluded income or in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving such income. Section DA 1(1) is known as the “general permission”. 17. For ease of reference, this commentary refers to the nexus requirement in s DA 1(1) as a sufficient connection with “deriving income” or “carrying on a business”. 18. The general permission is subject to the general limitations in s DA 2. These include limitations for expenditure of a capital or private nature. Section DB 6 19. The Rulings specifically concern interest deductibility under s DB 6, in certain situations. 20. Section DB 6(1) provides that a person is allowed a deduction for interest incurred. Section DB 6(4) provides that the general permission in s DA 1(1) must be satisfied. However, the capital limitation in s DA 2(1) is overridden. 21. Therefore, a deduction is available where a person incurs interest (whether or not it is of a capital nature) and: • the interest was incurred in deriving income or in carrying on a business; • the general limitations in s DA 2(2)–(6) do not apply; and • the deduction is not denied under s DB 1 (interest on unpaid taxes). Section DB 7 22. Under s DB 7 certain companies are allowed a deduction for interest incurred. 23. Unlike s DB 6, the company does not need to satisfy the nexus requirement in s DA 1(1). Therefore, most companies will rely on s DB 7 4 to obtain deductions for interest. Section DB 6 and the Roberts and Smith principle will not be relevant for such companies. 24. However, certain companies cannot use s DB 7. Section DB 7 does not apply to: • Qualifying companies. • Companies that derive exempt income or that are part of a wholly- owned group where a company in the group derives exempt income. This does not include exempt income that is dividends, a disposal of a company’s own shares or that relates to stake money and a breeding business. • Non-resident companies, unless interest is incurred in the course of carrying on a business through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. • Interest on unpaid tax under s DB 1. • Expenditure related to certain assets under subpart DG (ie, mixed-use assets). 25. Although s DB 7 does not refer to look-through companies, a look-through company is not included in the definition of a “company” in s YA 1 for tax purposes. 26. The effect of s DB 7 is discussed in more detail in a discussion on the Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 in Tax Information Bulletin Vo l 13, No 11 (November 2001): 34. Interest deductibility – general principles 27. The general principles for interest deductibility in New Zealand are established in Pacific Rendezvous Ltd v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,146 (CA), Eggers v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5,153 (CA) a nd CIR v Brierley (1990) 12 NZTC 7,184 (CA). The deductibility of interest requires a sufficient connection between the borrowed funds and deriving income or carrying on a business. In most cases, the test is satisfied when borrowed funds are directly used to derive income, in that the funds are used to acquire income-earning assets. 28. In Roberts and Smith and Public Trustee v CIR \[1938\] NZLR 436 (CA), the courts held that interest may be deductible in limited cases where borrowed funds were not directly used in deriving income. 29. Roberts and Smith and Public Trustee concern situations where borrowed funds were used “in relation to” income-earning assets, but we re not “directly used” in deriving income. Public Trustee is discussed in IS0082: “Interest Deductibility—Public Trustee v CIR” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 6 (July 2006): 9. The Roberts and Smith principle is relevant for determining whether interest is deductible when borrowed funds are used to replace and repay existing funding. The Roberts and Smith principle 30. Roberts and Smith concerned interest incurred by a partnership. The partnership borrowed funds so it could repay capital contributions to existing partners. This was because new partners were joining the partnership, but the cost of contributing an equal amount of capital was too high. The partners decided to decrease the amount of the existing partners’ capital. They did this by borrowing funds and using the funds to 5 repay the capital contributions to the partners. The Australian Full Federal Court held that the interest incurred on this borrowing was deductible. 31. The case is relevant in New Zealand given the similarity in the wording of the general deductibility provisions. The Australian provision that applied at the time was s 51(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. That section provided that losses or outgoings were deductible to the extent that they were incurred in gaining or producing assessable income, or were necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. 32. Hill J considered that interest was deductible irrespective of how the partner used the funds that were repaid to them. This is because the new funding t akes on the character of the existing funding that is replaced. The existing funding had been employed in the partnership’s business for the purpose of deriving income. Hill J stated at 4,388-4,389: ...let it be assumed that there are undrawn partnership distributions available at any time to be called upon by the partners. The partnership borrows from a bank at interest to fund the repayment to one of the partners who has called up the amount owing to him. That partner uses the moneys so received to purchase a house. A tracing approach, if carried beyond the payment to the partner, encourages the argument raised by the Commissioner in the present case that the funds were used for the private purpose of the partner who received them. But that fact will not preclude the deductibility of the outgoing. The funds to be withdrawn in such a case were employed in the partnership business; the borrowing replaces those funds and the interest incurred on the borrowing will meet the statutory description of interest incurred in the gaining or production by the partnership of assessable income. In principle, such a case is no different from the borrowing from one bank to repay working capital originally borrowed from another; the character of the refinancing takes on the same character as the original borrowing and gives to the interest incurred the character of a working expense. Both these cases would equally satisfy the second limb of s. 51(1). In no sense could the interest outgoing in either case be characterised as private or domestic. Similarly, where moneys are originally advanced by a partner to provide working capital for the partnership, interest on a borrowing made to repay these advances will be deductible, irrespective of the use which the partner repaid makes of the funds. \[Emphasis added\] 33. Hill J considered that the deduction was limited to the extent that the borrowed funds replaced the amount of capital actually contributed into the partnership by the partners. Hill J explained this limitation at 4,390: Let it be assumed that the original partnership capital in the Lord Lindley sense \[i.e. contributed capital\] was $10 and that the balance in the account designated as “the capital account” of the partnership was $125,000, which included goodwill. That would mean that the equity of each partner in the partnership, assuming five partners, was $25,000. But it could not be said that each partner had invested funds totalling $25,000 as capital in the partnership. A cheque for $25,000 drawn on the partnership bank account would not operate to repay the partner any funds invested. The partnership capital would remain as $10, and all that would happen is that there would be a borrowing which was used to pay the partner $25,000. That borrowing would reduce the partner’s equity in the partnership, but it could not represent a repay ment of capital invested. The partnership assets would remain constant. The goodwill would still be worth $125,000; it would not have been distributed to the partners, nor could it be. On those facts, there could be no question of there being a refund of a pre-existing capital contribution. Rather, looking at the facts objectively, the only purpose of the borrowing would be the provision of funds to the partners to which they were not entitled during the currency of the partnership (save of course by agreement among themselves). The provision of funds to the partners in circumstances where that provision is not a repayment of funds invested in the business, lacks 6 the essential connection with the income producing activities of the partnership or, in other words, the partnership business. ... ... If at least $125,000 of the amount in that account represents partnership capital in the Lord Lindley sense, undrawn profit distributions, advances by the partners or other funds which have actually been invested in the partnership and which the partners were entitled to withdraw in June 1984, then in my view the taxpayer is entitled to succeed. \[Emphasis added\] 34. Hill J considered that interest was only deductible in circumstances where the borrowed funds were replacing funds invested in the partnership business by a partner. The types of existing funding Hill J considered could be replaced include partnership capital, undrawn profit distributions and advances by the partners. The element of replacement of existing funding invested by the partner is critical. Otherwise, the repayment of funds to the partner would lack the essential connection with the partnership’s income producing activities or business. 35. Hill J explained that the principle only applies to the repayment of funds to the person who invested the funds in the business (or other income deriving activity). Types of funding that cannot be said to have been invested by a person include internally generated goodwill and asset revaluations. A payment relating to these types of funding is not a replacement and repayment of funds to the person who invested the funds into the business. 36. This replacement and repayment principle is referred to in this commentary and the Rulings as the “Roberts and Smith principle”. The Roberts and Smith principle applies where: • borrowed funds are used to replace existing funding; • the existing funding is repaid to the person who invested it; and • the existing funding had a sufficient connection with deriving income or carrying on the business. 37. Capital contributions, undrawn profits from previous years and advances are all existing funding that is capable of being replaced. 38. There are two aspects of the Roberts and Smith principle that require further discussion. The first concerns the use of the borrowed funds. The second concerns the requirement that the funds replace and repay existing funds to the person who invested those funds. The use of the borrowed funds 39. The deductibility of interest under s DB 6 generally requires that the borrowed funds are d irectly used in deriving income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving income. Three questions arise regarding the use of the borrowed funds in the context of the Roberts and Smith principle. These are: • If borrowed funds are paid directly to a partner, how can this be said to be used in carrying on the partnership’s business for the purpose of deriving income? • If a partner uses the repaid funds for a private use, how can interest incurred on those funds be deductible to the partner? • How can one particular debt, with its own parties, conditions and direct uses, inherit the deductibility status of a different debt? 7 If borrowed funds are paid directly to a partner, how can this be said to be used in carrying on the partnership’s business for the purpose of deriving income? 40. This question concerns situations where the borrowed funds are paid directly to a partner, such as in repayment of a capital contribution. 41. The Commissioner considers that there is a replacement of the existing funding in the partnership’s accounts or financial statements. That is, equity is reduced (through reducing the capital contributions) and debt is increased (through the new borrowings replacing those contributions). The new borrowings can be said to replace the capital contributions that were invested into the partnership by the partner, and the capital contributions had been used in the partnership’s business. 42. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that, even though borrowed funds may be paid directly to a partner to repay the partner’s capital contributions, the borrowed funds replace those contributions in the partnership’s accounts and can be said to be used in carrying on the partnership’s business for the purpose of deriving income. If a partner uses the repaid funds for a private use, how can interest incurred on those funds be deductible to the partner? 43. This question relates to the nature of partnerships. A partnership is transparent for tax purposes under s HG 2. This means that the partners deduct their share of the partnership’s expenditure. 44. If a partner’s capital contributions are repaid through borrowed funds and the partner uses the repaid funds for a private or domestic use, it could be argued that the borrowed funds can be traced to a private use. Therefore, it could be argued that s DA 2(2) could limit the deductibility of private or domestic expenditure in such a case. 45. However, for the purpose of a partner’s obligations in their capacity as a partner in a partnership, s HG 2 provides that the partner is treated as carrying on the partnership’s activity. The partner is treated as having the partnership’s status, intention and purpose. So , it is the use of the borrowings by the partnership that is relevant (and not the partner’s secondary use of the funds repaid to them). Further discussion on the nature of partnerships and the ownership of partnership property is set out at \[70\] to \[79\] below. 46. The Commissioner considers that, under the Roberts and Smith principle, the relevant use of the borrowed funds is to return capital to the partners. Because that capital had been used in carrying on the partnership’s business, its replacement is also considered to be used in carrying on the business. The Commissioner considers that the partners’ use of the funds paid to them is not relevant for the purposes of determining deductibility under the Roberts and Smith principle. How can one particular debt, with its own parties, conditions and direct uses, inherit the deductibility status of a different debt? 47. This question relates to a basic principle of deductibility, which is that the deductibility of an expense depends on the circumstances in which that expense is incurred. In Roberts and Smith, Hill J simply states that interest on a debt that replaces another debt is deductible. However, that statement is not an explanation, and it is not entirely clear that a debt replacing another debt necessarily inherits its deductibility status. 8 48. A contrary approach was taken in Canada, in Interior Breweries Ltd v Minister of National Revenue \[1955\] CTC 143; 55 DTC 1090. Cameron J of the Exchequer Court held that interest was not deductible where borrowed funds were used to repay a bank loan. Cameron J considered that the borrowed money was not used to earn income, but was “used entirely to pay off the bank loan...” (at 148). However, legislation was introduced in Canada to reverse the effect of that decision, and it appears that the decision has not been applied in any later cases. 49. The Commissioner considers it likely that Interior Breweries would not be followed by the courts in New Zealand or Australia. Nevertheless, the New Zealand and Australian courts have generally been cautious about allowing deductions relating to indirect uses of borrowed funds (particularly in the lower courts in situations where there has been private use of funds). However, the courts have allowed deductions for certain indirect uses of funds in particular circumstances in cases such as Roberts and Smith and Public Trustee. Public Trustee concerned the deductibility of interest on funds that were borrowed to pay death duties and to avoid a sale of income-earning assets. Nexus with income existed in the particular circumstances through the use of the funds to pay the debts and, therefore, to retain income-earning assets. 50. Cases such as Public Trustee and Roberts and Smith are examples of the limited situations and p articular circumstances where courts have accepted that interest may be deductible when borrowed funds are not directly used to derive income. In the Roberts and Smith context, this is when borrowed funds replace and repay existing funding to the person who invested those funds, and the existing funding had the sufficient nexus with income. The borrowed funds must replace and repay existing funds to the person who invested those funds 51. A further aspect of the Roberts and Smith principle is that the borrowed funds must replace existing funding and repay the person who invested those existing funds in the business. 52. Hill J said at 4,390 of Roberts and Smith: The provision of funds to the partners in circumstances where that provision is not a repay ment of funds invested in the business, lacks the essential connection with the income producing activities of the partnership or, in other words, the partnership business. 53. Where borrowed funds are used to replace and repay existing funds to the person who invested or lent those funds to the business (or other income- producing activity), the borrowed funds will take on the deductibility status of the existing funds. So, if the existing funds had a sufficient connection with the carrying on of the business or the derivation of income, the borrowed funds that take the place of the existing funds will also take on that connection. The Roberts and Smith principle will not apply without this aspect of replacement and repayment to the person who invested or lent funds to the business (or other income-producing activity). 54. This is not to say that interest on other borrowed funds is not otherwise deductible, but such considerations are outside the scope of these Rulings and this commentary. For example, a business might borrow to acquire new income-earning assets. While interest on such borrowings may be deductible under s DB 6, this is under the operation of general interest deductibility principles and not through the application of the Roberts and 9 Smith principle. Similarly, a business might borrow funds to make a nil interest loan, to invest in a company that was barred from making distributions or to pay criminal fines. In such cases, no underlying connection with income exists and so interest would not be deductible under s DB 6 in any circumstance. The Roberts and Smith principle would not apply to make such interest deductible. Sole traders 55. Individuals, who do not operate their business (or otherwise derive income) through a company, partnership or other structure, do not have a separate entity in which to invest their funds. In such a case, no change in the ownership of those funds occurs. The Commissioner considers that the Roberts and Smith principle does not apply in these circumstances. 56. Sole traders or individuals may consider that borrowed funds have the effect of returning capital or past years’ profits to them. However, it is artificial for a person to describe a transaction with themself as a “replacement and repayment” of an investment. 57. However, a sole trader or individual can deduct interest on borrowed funds where the borrowed funds replace and repay a debt owed to a third party lender and the debt had been used directly in deriving income or in carrying on a business. The Commissioner considers that, as the funds in such a situation are repaid to a separate person, the Roberts and Smith principle can apply. Relevant New Zealand cases 58. To date, Roberts and Smith has not been applied by a New Zealand court. There are two Taxation Review Authority (TRA) cases on similar issues, but these were decided prior to Roberts and Smith. 59. The approach of the TRA in Case P56 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,386 is similar to the Commissioner’s interpretation of Roberts and Smith. In Case P56, partners in a partnership borrowed funds to withdraw more than they had invested in the partnership. Judge Willy concluded that the interest was not deductible. Judge Willy said at 4,396 that if the partners had replaced capital investments they would have been entitled to interest deductions. 60. A different conclusion was reached by the TRA in Case M127 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,817. In Case M127, partners in a partnership required money for personal reasons. The partners had invested $76,000 of equity into the business. The partnership paid $70,000 to the partners, putting the partnership account into overdraft. The partnership borrowed to repay the overdraft. The effect on the partnership’s balance sheet was that the capital contributed by the partners was replaced by the borrowed funds. The partners argued that the borrowed funds were used in producing income. However, the TRA concluded that the use of the funds was for the partners’ private use, and interest was not deductible. It appears that the partners did not argue that the borrowed funds replaced and repaid their equity contributions. It also appears that such a principle was not considered by the TRA. 61. As previously stated, the general test for interest deductibility, as established in cases such as Pacific Rendezvous, Eggers and Brierley, requires borrowed funds to be directly used or “traced” to income. The Roberts and Smith principle effectively applies an “indirect” tracing test. That is, the borrowed funds must replace existing funds that were invested 10 in the business, a nd those existing funds must have had the sufficient connection with income. However, this principle does not require that the borrowed funds are also traced to the use of the person who was repaid. In Roberts and Smith, Hill J said at 4,388: A tracing approach, if carried beyond the payment to the partner, encourages the argument raised by the Commissioner in the present case that the funds were used for the private purpose of the partner who received them. But that fact will not preclude the deductibility of the outgoing. The funds to be withdrawn in such a case were employed in the partnership business; the borrowing replaces those funds and the interest incurred on the borrowing will meet the statutory description of interest incurred in the gaining or production by the partnership of assessable income. 62. A strict tracing approach was applied by the TRA in Case M127. This approach indicated that the loan was used to repay a business overdraft, and the overdraft was traced to private use by the partners. However, under the approach taken in Roberts and Smith, the loan could be seen as replacing the overdraft and the overdraft replaced the partners’ equity invested in the business. The partners’ equity was directly used to fund the partnership’s business. Therefore, a sufficient connection with income would exist under this approach. In the absence of such a principle at the time Case M127 was decided, Judge Bathgate held that the borrowed funds were used for private purposes. 63. The Commissioner considers that a decision of the Full Federal Court of Australia, based on legislation that had similar wording to the New Zealand legislation at the time, would be treated as more persuasive by New Zealand courts. The Commissioner considers that a New Zealand court is likely to follow Roberts and Smith rather than Case M127. Conclusion – the application of Roberts and Smith in New Zealand 64. The Commissioner considers that the New Zealand courts would apply the Roberts and Smith principle in situations where: • borrowed funds are used to replace existing funding; • the existing funding is repaid to the person who invested it; and • the existing funding had a sufficient connection with deriving income or carrying on the business. 65. The Roberts and Smith principle provides that, in such situations, interest incurred on the new funding will take on the deductibility status of the existing funding. 66. This commentary will now discuss how this principle applies to the specific Arrangements in BR Pub 15/04—15/08. The commentary will also go on to discuss certain situations including the Arrangement in BR Pub 15/09 where the Commissioner considers that the principle will not apply. Arrangements to which the Roberts and Smith principle applies 67. The following analysis explains t he Commissioner’s position on interest deductibility under the Roberts and Smith principle in the context of the specific Arrangements to which the Rulings apply. Returns of capital to partners: BR Pub 15/04 68. BR Pub 15/04 applies where borrowed funds are used by a partnership to return capital to a partner who previously invested that capital into the partnership. 11 69. Roberts and Smith specifically concerned this situation. The Roberts and Smith principle applies where borrowed funds are used by a partnership to repay capital contributions to partners. Interest is deductible to the extent that the capital that was repaid to partners had been used by the partnership in carrying on its business. 70. An issue that arises concerns ownership of partnership property. For example, it could be argued that a partnership is not able to repay a partner’s contributions to the partner. This is on the basis that a partnership is not a legal entity, and the ownership of partnership property already vests in the partners. Ownership of partnership property 71. A key concept of partnership law is that partners do not have individual rights to partnership property. This point has been made in several cases, including Hadlee & Sydney Bridge Nominees Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,106 (PC), CIR v Boanas (2008) 23 NZTC 22,046 (HC) and Crowe v C of T (1958) 100 CLR 532 (HCA). It was also confirmed by Webb and Molloy in Principles of the Law of Partnership (Butterworths, Wellington, 6th edition, 1996). 72. In Hadlee (PC) Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle stated at 10,110: ... First of all as a matter of general law, to quote the words of Richardson J \[in Hadlee and Sydney Bridge Nominees Ltd v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,116 (CA)\] he “does not have title to specific partnership property but has a beneficial interest in the entirety of the partnership assets and in each and every particular asset of the partnership. (Lindley on Partnership 15th Edition, page 516)”. He can enforce this interest against his co-partners to the extent of seeing that the partnership assets are used for the benefit of the partnership but he cannot assign it to a non-partner. This beneficial interest, expressed in terms of its realisability, is in the nature of a future interest taking effect in possession on (and not before) the determination of the partnership (Lindley and Banks on Partnership, 16th Edition, p 457). \[Emphasis added\] 73. In the Court of Appeal (Hadlee and Sydney Bridge Nominees Ltd v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,116 (CA)), Richardson J had referred to a share in a partnership as being a fractional interest in the future profits of the partnership business (at 8,126). In Boanas, Dobson J noted at \[65\] that Richardson J’s judgment in Hadlee was consistent with s 23(1) of the Partnership Act 1908. 74. Section 23(1) of the Partnership Act 1908 states: All property and rights and interests in property ... must be held and applied by the partners exclusively for the purposes of the partnership and in accordance with the partnership agreement. 75. Section HG 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that partnerships are transparent for income tax purposes (unless the context requires otherwise). This means that, for the purposes of calculating their obligations and liabilities under the Act, the partners are generally treated as: • carrying on activities and having the status, intention and purpose of the partnership; and • holding property that a partnership holds, being party to an arrangement to which the partnership is party, and doing or being entitled to a thing that the partnership does or is entitled to, in proportion to their partnership share. 12 76. Section HG 2 does not alter the principle that partnership income is derived, and partnership property is owned, jointly by the partners. Section HG 2 applies “\[f\]or the purposes of a partner’s liabilities and obligations under this Act in their capacity of partner of a partnership”. This makes it clear that s HG 2(1) applies to calculating a partner’s tax obligations and liabilities. Section HG 2 does not affect the partners’ individual rights to partnership property under general law. 77. In summary, partners own an undivided interest in partnership property and do not have individual title to any particular items of partnership property. Therefore, a partnership can validly transfer property to a partner because the nature of the legal ownership would change from joint ownership to ownership by a single person. 78. Roberts and Smith specifically applied to partners in a partnership. The above analysis shows that the application of the Roberts and Smith principle in a partnership situation would be consistent with the treatment of partnership property in New Zealand. 79. It is noted that a return of capital, whether by a partnership or a company, does not itself have a sufficient connection with deriving income or carrying on a business simply because it is an ordinary part of running a business. A return of capital is generally not part of the income-earning process of the business, but relates to the structure of the business. However, a sufficient connection with deriving income or carrying on a business exists in this Arrangement. This is because borrowing to return capital to partners has the effect of replacing and repaying an amount that was invested into the business by the partner. The initial amount invested into the business had a connection with carrying on the business or deriving income. In these circumstances, the borrowed funds will continue that connection with deriving income or carrying on a business. Payments of past years’ profits to partners: BR Pub 15/05 80. BR Pub 15/05 applies where borrowed funds are used to repay past years’ partnership profits to partners. Interest is deductible under the Roberts and Smith principle to the extent that the borrowed funds are used to repay past years’ profits to partners, and those profits had been used directly in the partnership’s business (or to repay funds borrowed by the partnership where interest had been deductible). 81. In Roberts and Smith, Hill J referred to past years’ profits as “undrawn profit distributions”. These can be viewed as amounts contributed by partners to the partnership. Partnership profits are allocated to partners equally or in accordance with the divisions in the partnership agreement. If profits are not withdrawn, the accounting treatment might be to carry profits to the credit of the partners’ current accounts by book entry, calculated at the end of the accounting period. Although there may not be any active reinvestment by the partners themselves, this process can reasonably be seen as an investment of capital into the business. 82. The Commissioner considers that retaining and using past years’ profits in the partnership’s business can be seen as a reinvestment by partners in the partnership. Interest is deductible on borrowings used to repay past years’ profits to partners, to the extent that the profits were used in the partnership’s business. 13 83. However, BR Pub 15/04 and 15/05 do not apply to the extent that borrowed funds are used to pay current year income to partners. The reasons for this will now be considered. Why the Ruling does not apply to the payment of current year income to partners 84. The Commissioner’s opinion is that the Roberts and Smith principle does not extend to borrowings that return current year income to partners. A distinction is made here between current year income and net income or profits that are finally determined. Current year income has generally not been identified as net income or profits of the partnership, which the partners are entitled to withdraw from the partnership. 85. The issue with current year income is whether the partners can be said to have invested the amount back into the partnership. The Commissioner considers that, generally, current year income is not an amount that can be finally determined as being an amount “invested” into the partnership by the partners, and so is not an amount that is “repaid” to partners. The amount can only have been invested in the partnership if someone other than the partnership has had an entitlement to it at some time. Therefore, the issue is whether partners can be said to have become individually entitled to current year income at a point in time before repayment is made. 86. The legal nature of current year partnership income is relevant to answering this question. As previously discussed in this commentary, a distinction exists between partnership property and property of individual partners. If current year partnership income is determined and a share of the net income or profits is allocated to individual partners at any point during the year, it could in theory be said to have been invested by partners in the partnership business (and, therefore, would be “repayable” to the partners). 87. The Partnership Act 1908 is silent on the treatment of current year income. Section 27 provides for the division of profits as follows: 27 Rules as to interests and duties of partners The interests of partners in the partnership property, and their rights and duties in relation to the partnership, shall be determined, subject to any agreement (express or implied) between the partners, by the following rules: (a) all the partners are entitled to share equally in the capital and profits of the business, and must contribute equally towards the losses, whether of capital or otherwise, sustained by the firm: ... (d) a partner is not entitled, before the ascertainment of profits, to interest on the capital subscribed by him: 88. Partners are entitled to share in partnership profits (subject to an agreement to the contrary). However, the concept of “profits” is not defined. There is no particular guidance in the Partnership Act 1908 as to when the division and allocation of profits occurs. 89. The amount that forms part of each partner’s share of profits from a partnership is ascertained after the partnership accounts have been prepared. In FC of T v Galland 86 ATC 4,885, the High Court of Australia held that, in the absence of an agreement otherwise, partnership accounts would be taken each year as at 30 June. A partner’s share of the 14 partnership’s profits or net income would be distributed to the partner at that time. Mason and Wilson JJ said at 4,887: ...although a partner is not usually entitled to call for a distribution of profits or net income until accounts have been prepared, he has an individual interest in the net income of the partnership, notwithstanding that the precise amount of his interest cannot be determined until the accounts are prepared in respect of the relevant period. 90. The High Court of Australia’s view is that partners have an individual interest in the net income or profits of the partnership, but not an immediate entitlement to the net income or profits until accounts have been prepared. 91. Galland was cited by Hill J in Roberts and Smith as authority for the proposition that, in the absence of agreement, a partner’s share of the partnership’s income is derived by the partner once annual partnership accounts have been prepared. Hill J said at 4,390: In the absence of agreement, accounts of the partnership would be required to be taken each year as at 30 June and a partner’s share of the partnership income would be derived by him as at that date: FC of T v Galland... 92. Further, the nature of “profits” is that they have to be identified before anyone can become entitled to them. As cited in Galland, a definition of “profits” was provided in Re Spanish Prospecting Co. Ltd \[1911\] 1 Ch 92 (CA) by Fletcher Moulton LJ at 98-99: “Profits” implies a comparison between the state of a business at two specific dates usually separated by an interval of a year. The fundamental meaning is the amount of gain made by the business during the year. This can only be ascertained by a comparison of the assets of the business at two dates. ... We start, therefore, with this fundamental definition of profits, viz, if the total assets of the business at the two dates be compared, the increase which they show at the later date as compared with the earlier date (due allowance, of course, being made for any capital being introduced into or taken out of the business in the meanwhile) represents in strictness the profits of the business during the period in question. 93. Profits can be calculated once the total amounts of income and expenses for the relevant fiscal period are known. Although income will come in that may, in due course, form part of the “profits”, the finally determined amount cannot be known until the relevant fiscal period has ended and accounts prepared. In the Commissioner’s opinion, it follows that a legal entitlement to partnership profits cannot arise until the amount can be finally determined, and this is at the end of the relevant fiscal period (which is generally annual but may depend on the particular facts). 94. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that, generally, a partner does not have an individual entitlement to current year partnership income until the accounts for the relevant fiscal period have been prepared, an amount of profit has been finally determined, and partners are entitled to their share of the resulting profits. Generally, current year income is owned by all of the partners jointly. Individual partners have an ownership interest in that income (in common with the other partners), but the Commissioner considers that no entitlement to an individual share exists until profits have been calculated and allocated for a fiscal period. This means that current year income is generally not an investment that can be “repaid” to partners. 95. The Commissioner’s opinion that current year income is not generally an amount that can be repaid to partners is consistent with Hill J’s reasoning at 4,389 to 4,390 in Roberts and Smith. Hill J considered that amounts 15 that can be repaid and replaced are funds that have actually been invested in the partnership and that the partners ar e entitled to withdraw. Hill J listed the types of capital represented in the partnership’s accounts. Of these amounts, he considered the types of capital that could be replaced and repaid to an investor. Hill J did not include internally generated goodwill, asset revaluations and profits of the year not yet distributed as amounts able to be replaced and repaid to an investor. Hill J considered that undrawn distributions that have been allocated to partners but not paid (such as past years’ profits) can be replaced with borrowings, and the interest relating to such amounts would be deductible. Summary 96. Past years’ profits that remain in the partnership are viewed as an advance from the partners to the partnership, or as new investments of capital. Hill J considered that a partnership’s past years’ profits could be viewed as amounts invested into the partnership by the partners, and that they could be repaid to the partners. Therefore, interest incurred on funds that are borrowed to repay past years’ profits to a partner is deductible under the Roberts and Smith principle. 97. It is essential for the application of the Roberts and Smith principle that the borrowings replace existing funding, and are repaid to the person who invested that funding. In the Commissioner’s opinion, current year income has not been invested by anyone, so the principle does not generally apply. 98. The Commissioner considers that, for the purposes of the Roberts and Smith principle, partners do not generally have rights to current year income as it arises during the year. Partnership profits or net income are generally determined at the end of the relevant fiscal period (presumed to be the financial year for the purposes of the relevant Rulings) and, until this happens, the partners are not entitled to a share of the income arising during that year. Although a partner might take drawings out of the current year income during the year, this is generally only an anticipated share of the profits or net income that is finally established at the end of the financial year. Current year income is not an amount that can be seen as being invested into the partnership by the partners. While there may be scope to argue that current year profits are an investment made by partners into the partnership, the Commissioner considers that the nature of such profits is too uncertain to be able to include them within the scope of a binding ruling. 99. Past years’ profits can be distinguished from current year income because the partners have become entitled to their share of those past years’ profits. The entitlement occurs at a time specified under the partnership agreement or, in the absence of a partnership agreement, when the partnership accounts are taken and the profits notionally allocated to partners. Share repurchases: BR Pub 15/06 100. BR Pub 15/06 applies where borrowed funds are used by a company to repurchase shares from its shareholders (as authorised by the Companies Act 1993). 101. Note that interest may be deductible to the company under s DB 7. BR Pub 15/06 is only of relevance to companies to which s DB 7 does not apply. 16 102. The repurchase of a company’s shares involves a payment made by the company to its shareholders of amounts previously contributed by the shareholders. The repurchase of bonus share issues that were funded by past years’ profits can also be seen as involving a payment by a company to its shareholders of amounts previously contributed by shareholders. The effect of the company’s payment will reduce the shareholder’s capital holding in the company. Therefore, this Arrangement is analogous to a return of capital or past years’ profits to partners in a partnership (discussed above). 103. In the Commissioner’s view, the Roberts and Smith principle may apply to share repurchases (including repurchases of bonus issue shares). Interest is deductible on borrowings used to repay share capital or past years’ profits to shareholders, to the extent that the capital or profits were used by the company in deriving income or in carrying on its business. Payments of dividends: BR Pub 15/07 104. BR Pub 15/07 applies where borrowed funds are used by a company to pay dividends to shareholders that relate to past years’ profits (ie, retained earnings). As with the previous Arrangement, the interest may be deductible to the company under s DB 7. BR Pub 15/07 is only of relevance to companies in situations where s DB 7 does not apply. 105. There is some conceptual difficulty in bringing a company’s retained earnings within the Roberts and Smith principle. The difficulty is in equating retained earnings with amounts “invested” into the company by shareholders. This is because, unlike a partnership, a company’s profits are not allocated to shareholders at the end of each year. Rather, any retained earnings are added to the company’s existing retained earnings. Company directors may or may not decide to distribute some of these retained earnings as a dividend. Therefore, shareholders have no immediate entitlement to retained earnings in the way that partners are entitled to a share in partnership profits. 106. Nevertheless, there are similarities between a partnership’s past years’ profits and a company’s retained earnings, such that comparisons can be drawn (although it is acknowledged that there are differences). For example: • Both amounts have been finally settled for the year, and the theoretical amount each shareholder or partner is entitled to can be established. • In a sense, retained earnings and past years’ profits that remain in the business can be seen as an amount that a shareholder or partner has “invested” into the business. • Retained earnings and partnership profits are at the disposal of the business until a decision is made to pay them out to the shareholders or partners. Just as partners may not necessarily make an active decision to invest past profits into the partnership, a company’s shareholders would not make a decision to invest profits into the company as retained earnings. 107. The Commissioner considers that funds borrowed by a company to pay dividends to shareholders that relate to retained earnings are somewhat analogous to funds borrowed by a partnership to pay past years’ profits to 17 partners. The Commissioner considers that the Roberts and Smith principle should apply in such situations. 108. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that interest is deductible on borrowings used by a company to pay dividends to shareholders relating to past years’ profits, to the extent that those profits had been used by the company in deriving income or in carrying on its business. If company profits are distributed as bonus issue shares, then, similarly, the amount represented by the shares can be seen as capital that is able to be replaced and repaid. 109. As concluded earlier, the Commissioner considers that the Roberts and Smith principle does not generally apply where a partnership uses borrowed funds to pay current year income to partners. Similarly, shareholders in a company do not have an immediate entitlement to the company’s current year income, and they cannot be considered to have invested that income into the company. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the Roberts and Smith principle does not apply where borrowed funds are used to pay current year income to a shareholder. Replacement of debt: BR Pub 15/08 110. The Arrangement considered in BR Pub 15/08 is broader than the previous Arrangements. BR Pub 15/08 applies where borrowed funds are used by a partnership or taxpayer to replace existing debt and to repay the amounts to the person who lent the funds to the taxpayer or partnership. 111. The Commissioner considers that the Roberts and Smith principle applies where borrowed funds repay another debt that was directly used in deriving income or in carrying on a business. In Roberts and Smith, Hill J considered that there is no difference (for interest deductibility purposes) between repaying one debt with another and borrowing to return capital. Hill J considered that both situations should be similarly treated. Hill J said that where borrowings are used to repay existing debt, and the existing debt had been used in an income-earning business, the refinancing will take on the character of the existing debt. 112. In addition, if new borrowings take on the character of existing debt that is replaced, then logically subsequent refinancing should also inherit that character. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that interest is deductible on borrowings used to repay existing borrowings to the extent that existing borrowings can be traced to a use that gave rise to deductible interest. 113. There are three further issues to consider when borrowed funds are used to replace existing debt. These are: • whether interest is deductible if the interest on the existing debt w as deductible under a provision that did not require nexus with income, such as ss DB 7 and DB 8; • whether interest is deductible where the lender’s right to be repaid is assigned to another person; and • whether direct tracing is required. Deductibility where no nexus was required 114. The general principle from Roberts and Smith is that interest on borrowings may inherit the deductibility status of interest on funds the 18 borrowings replace and repay. In some situations, the interest incurred on the existing debt may have been deductible under a specific interest deductibility provision, rather than the general permission. Section DB 7 provides for automatic deductions for most companies. Section DB 8 provides for deductions for companies investing in shares in a group company. 115. The Commissioner considers that deductibility status under ss DB 7 and DB 8 should also be inheritable by replacement funding. If it were not, and refinancing meant that interest that had been deductible was no longer deductible (as a matter of law rather than fact), Parliament’s intention for ss DB 7 and DB 8 would seem to be defeated. 116. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the Roberts and Smith principle applies when interest on the funding that is replaced had been deductible under ss DB 7 or DB 8. Deductibility where the lender’s right to be repaid is assigned 117. The Commissioner considers that the Roberts and Smith principle requires the repaid funds to be returned to the person who invested the funds. However, an exception to this is where the right to receive repayments has been assigned to someone else. The Commissioner considers that interest is still deductible in this situation because there has been a repayment of funds invested. The amounts can be traced back to the original investor through the assignee. Whether deductibility requires direct tracing 118. In several cases that have considered interest deductibility, the courts held that the funds must be directly used in, or traced to, deriving income: see Pacific Rendezvous Ltd and Bri erley. 119. The Commissioner considers that the Roberts and Smith principle is consistent with a tracing approach to interest deductibility. The Roberts and Smith principle requires identifying both that the new borrowings replace and repay existing funds, and that the existing funds were used in carrying on a business or in deriving income. The existing funding must have had a sufficient connection with (or be traced to) the derivation of income. 120. In the previous issue of these Rulings, the Commissioner considered the compliance costs that may arise for some taxpayers if tracing is required. It was recognised that, for some taxpayers who have daily changes to their borrowings, the tracing requirement may be difficult to fulfil. Although two potential solutions were canvassed, the Commissioner considered them to be impractical. 121. One approach considered was to allow a deduction in situations where borrowings are taken out and the initial funding repaid at about the same time. However, the Commissioner considers that, in practice, an “about the same time” requirement could not be limited to Roberts and Smith situations. This could result in interest on any borrowings qualifying for deductibility. This would be inconsistent with the requirement for a nexus with income under s DB 6. 122. An other approach considered was to accept that all borrowings are a replacement of existing funds, unless used solely for a private or exempt use. However, that would also seem to be too wide as any use of 19 borrowings could potentially satisfy such a test. Further, this approach would also be inconsistent with the Roberts and Smith principle, which requires that funds are returned to those who invested them. Without this element of replacement, in sufficient nexus with income exists. 123. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that a tracing approach is required for deductibility in the context of the Roberts and Smith principle. 124. Nevertheless, the Commissioner considers that problems regarding tracing are unlikely to arise in most cases. This is because t axpayers with few borrowings should usually be able to trace their funding. Taxpayers with more complicated borrowing practices are, in most c ases, likely to be companies that can claim interest deductions under s DB 7. Arrangements to which s DB 6 and/or the Roberts and Smith principle do not apply 125. The following paragraphs discuss the types of arrangements where the Commissioner considers that interest is not deductible under s DB 6 and/or the Roberts and Smith principle. Subvention payments: BR Pub 15/09 126. BR Pub 15/09 applies to an Arrangement where a company borrows funds to make a payment under s IC 5 to another company that has a net loss and is in the same group of companies. This type of payment is commonly referred to as a “subvention payment”. The Ruling provides that interest incurred on those borrowed funds will not be deductible under s DB 6. 127. A subvention payment is a payment between companies in a group to reduce the overall tax burden of the group. It is not a replacement of an amount previously advanced by the recipient company, or an amount that is paid to shareholders in repayment of amounts they invested in the company. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the use of borrowed funds to pay a subvention payment does not satisfy the Roberts and Smith principle. Interest incurred on borrowed funds used to pay a subvention payment is not deductible under that principle. 128. Unlike the other related Rulings, BR Pub 15/09 is not limited to deductibility under the Roberts and Smith principle. BR Pub 15/09 states that interest on borrowed funds used to make a subvention payment will not be deductible under s DB 6. 129. This wider application of BR Pub 15/09 is necessary because the Commissioner considers that a subvention payment will not have a sufficient connection with deriving income or carrying on a business under the general permission. This is because: • The relevant payment is made when a company’s annual profits have been determined. This occurs after the company has already derived its income for the year, and so the payment cannot be an amount of expenditure incurred in deriving its income. • Further, the Commissioner considers that such a payment is not made by the company in the course of carrying on its business for the purpose of deriving income. The payment is made to reduce the overall tax burden of the group, when there are both loss and profit- making companies within that group. 20 130. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that interest incurred on borrowed funds that are used to make a subvention payment under s IC 5 to a group company will not satisfy the general permission and so will not be deductible under s DB 6 . 131. The Commissioner notes that this issue is unlikely to arise in practice. Interest incurred by most companies will be deductible under s DB 7, regardless of the use of the funds. However, BR Pub 15/09 will be relevant in situations where s DB 7 does not apply. 132. The Commissioner acknowledges that the treatment of such borrowings differs between companies that can apply s DB 7 and companies that cannot. However, this is through the operation of the interest deductibility provisions in ss DB 6 and DB 7, and not through the application of the Roberts and Smith principle. Payments relating to internally generated goodwill and asset revaluations 133. The Arrangements described in BR Pub 15/04—15/08 do not include arrangements where, or to the extent that, borrowed funds are used to make a payment that relates to unrealised asset revaluations or internally generated goodwill. 134. In Roberts and Smith, Hill J singled out internally generated goodwill as an amount in the partnership capital account that could not be replaced and repaid to partners. This was because it is not an amount that has been invested by the partners into the business. Hill J explained that a payment of goodwill is not a “refund of a pre-existing capital contribution” (at 4,390). 135. Further, Susan Glazebrook and Jan James in Taxation Implications of Company Law Reform (1995) 1 NZJTLP 132 at 157 explained that goodwill cannot be distributed because, even after any purported distribution, it would still remain in the business. 136. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that internally generated goodwill is not an amount that can be replaced and repaid to partners or shareholders. The Rulings do not apply to such payments. 137. The situation will be different if goodwill is purchased. In that situation, funds (either equity or debt) will be used to purchase the goodwill. These funds can be repaid and replaced with other borrowed funds. Therefore, interest on replacement borrowings would be deductible under the Roberts and Smith principle if the existing funding used to purchase that goodwill is repaid to the person who lent or invested those funds. However, if purchased goodwill is revalued internally, the extent of the internal revaluation cannot be said to be an amount invested in the business by a partner or shareholder. 138. Therefore, interest incurred on borrowed funds that are purporting to replace internally generated goodwill will not be deductible under the Roberts and Smith principle. 139. For the same reasons, the Roberts and Smith principle does not apply to amounts that are attributable to asset revaluations. This is because these amounts do not relate to an amount invested or lent by a person to the business, and they cannot be replaced and repaid to a person who invested those amounts. 21 Australian Taxation Office’s view on Roberts and Smith 140. The Australian Taxation Office issued a ruling on its interpretation of Roberts and Smith. See TR 95/25 Income Tax: deductions for interest under subsection 51(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 following FC of T v Roberts; FC of T v Smith, issued 29 June 1995. The Australian Taxation Office’s view is similar to the Commissioner’s view in these Rulings. Two addenda have been added to TR 95/25, primarily to update the references in the ruling to the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. 141. A consistent interpretation of Roberts and Smith was also applied in TR 2005/12 Income tax: deductibility of interest expenses incurred by trustees on funds borrowed in connection with the payment of distributions to beneficiaries, issued 6 July 2005. TR 2005/12 relates to borrowings used to repay amounts to beneficiaries.

Section HG 2 provides that partnerships are transparent for income tax purposes: HG 2 Partnerships are transparent Look-through in accordance with share (1) For the purposes of a partner’s liabilities and obligations under this Act in their capacity of partner of a partnership, unless the context requires otherwise,— (a) the partner is treated as carrying on an activity carried on by the partnership, and having a status, intention, and purpose of the partnership, and the partnership is treated as not carrying on the activity or having the status, intention, or purpose: (b) the partner is treated as holding property that a partnership holds, in proportion to the partner’s partnership share, and the partnership is treated as not holding the property: (c) the partner is treated as being party to an arrangement to which the partnership is a party, in proportion to the partner’s partnership share, and the partnership is treated as not being a party to the arrangement: 26 (d) the partner is treated as doing a thing and being entitled to a thing that the partnership does or is entitled to, in proportion to the partner’s partnership share, and the partnership is treated as not doing the thing or being entitled to the thing. No streaming (2) Despite subsection (1), for a partner in their capacity of partner of a partnership, the amount of income, tax credit, rebate, gain, expenditure, or loss that they have from a particular source, or of a particular nature, is calculated by multiplying the total income, tax credit, rebate, gain, expenditure, or loss of the partners of the partnership from the particular source or of the particular nature by the partner’s partnership share in the partnership’s income. Expenditure or loss previously incurred (3) A partner of a partnership may be treated as incurring an expenditure or loss which the partnership incurs ignoring this section, despite the partner not being a partner at the time the expenditure or loss is incurred. This subsection does not allow 2 deductions for 1 expenditure or loss. Excluded amounts (4) Subsection (2) does not apply to the following amounts: (a) expenditure or loss that relates to a person entering a partnership by acquiring partner’s interests disposed of by another partner, to the extent to which sections HG 5 to HG 10 do not apply to the partner’s interests: (b) supplementary dividends, to the extent to which subpart LP (Tax credits for supplementary dividends) applies: (c) \[Repealed\] (d) imputation credits, to the extent to which section LE 6 (Partners in partnerships) applies: (e) FDP credits, to the extent to which section LF 4 (Partners in partnerships) applies. 9. Section IC 5 provides for when a company may make a subvention payment to another group company: IC 5 Company B using company A’s tax loss Requirements (1) Company A may make a tax loss available to company B to subtract from its net income under section IA 3(2) (Using tax losses in tax year) only if— (a) company A and company B have minimum common ownership for the relevant period as set out in sections IC 2(2) and IC 6; and (b) company A meets the residence requirements of section IC 7; and (c) company A has the required continuity of ownership under section IC 2(1) and, if it applies, section IC 10(2)(a); and (d) the amount falls within the limits set by section IC 8(1) and (2); and (e) the payment and notification requirements of section IC 9 are met. Method: election or subvention payment (2) Having met all the requirements set out in subsection (1), company A may— (a) choose to make a tax loss that it has in a tax year available to company B to use in the tax year, notifying the Commissioner as described in section IC 9; or (b) agree with company B that company B should bear the amount of company A’s tax loss, or take a share in it, in return for a payment by company B to company A by the date set out in section IC 9; or (c) apply both paragraphs (a) and (b) in relation to the tax loss. Amounts used in tax year (3) Company B must subtract the amount of the tax loss referred to in subsection (2)(a) or the payment referred to in subsection (2)(b), as applicable, from its net income for the tax year in relation to which company A makes the amount available or receives the payment. 27 When decisions made (4) If company A chooses to make the amount available to company B under subsection (2)(a), the decision is irrevocable. Nature of payment (5) To the extent to which an amount of tax loss is subtracted from net income, a payment from company B to company A under subsection (2)(b) is not a dividend. Part-year tax losses (6) Sections IP 4 and IP 5 (which relate to losses in part-years) modify this section for part-year calculations. Tax years before 1981–82 and between 1981–82 and 1991–92 (7) Section IZ 7 (Grouping tax losses for tax years before 1981–82 and between 1981–82 and 1991–92) modifies the requirements of— (a) subsection (1)(a) for a tax loss component that arises in tax years between 1981–82 and 1991–92; and (b) subsection (1)(b) for a tax loss component that arises in tax years before the 1991–92 tax year; and (c) subsection (1)(a) for a tax loss component that arises in tax years before the 1981–82 tax year.

The Ruling and Commentary also consider whether a company engaging a director is entitled to claim input tax deductions for fees paid to that director . 2.T his Ruling and Commentary sets out the GST treatment for fees paid to a director in two broad situations. The first is where the director contract s e ither directly with a company or through a third party. The second i s where a director is either an employee of a third party or a partner in a partnership. 3.A director must charge GST on their supply of services when the following requirements are satisfied: •the director is registered or liable to be registered in respect of a taxable activity that they undertake; and •the director accepts the office in carrying on that taxable activity. 4.A director is not required to charge GST on their supply of services as a dir ector where: •they are engaged as a director in their capacity as an employee of a third party employer; or •they are engaged in their capacity as a partner in a partnership. WITHDRAWN 5.Essentially, if a registered person accepts an office as a director in carrying on their taxable activity, the fees that person receives for providing their services will be subject to GST. 6.A flowchart that illustrates the GST treatment of directors’ fees from a director’s perspective can be found in Appendix 1 to this Commentary. 7.Where the director has been engaged in their capacity as an employee, they may be required to account for their fees to their employer. In this situation, the employer is deemed to make the supply of services, rather than the director. If the employer is registered, or liable to be registered, for GST, the employer will be required to account for GST on the supply of the director’s services to the company. 8.Where the director has been engaged in their capacity as a partner in a partnership, the partnership is deemed to make the supply of services, rather than the director. If the partnership is registered, or liable to be registered, for GST, the partnership will be required to account for GST on the supply of the director’s services. 9.From the perspective of a company that engages a director, the company may claim an input tax deduction for the fees it pays, if: •the company is registered; and •GST was charged on the directors’ fees and the company holds a ta x i nvoice for those fees. 10.Other requirements of the Act may also need to be satisfied depending on individual circumstances. Background 11.BR Pub 15/10 sets out the Commissioner’s view on the GST treatment of directors’ fees. The Commentary to this Ruling explains the reasoning adopted. The previous Ruling, BR Pub 05/13, was issued on 1 April 2005 for an indefinite period. However, s 6 of the Act was amended with effect from 30 June 2014 by s 187 of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014. BR Pub 05/13 was withdrawn from 30 June 2015. 12.Two amendments were made to s 6 that relate to the GST treatment of fees paid to directors. The first amendment moved the former proviso t o s 6(3)(b) to a new s 6(5). Before the amendment, the proviso to s 6(3)(b) treated services performed by directors as being supplied in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity when the director accepted the office in carrying on that taxable activity. 13.The second amendment introduced a new s 6(4). Section 6(4) provides that when an employee is engaged by a company to be a director and the employee is required to account for any fees received to their employer, the employer will be treated as supplying the services to the company . T he employer will therefore return GST output tax and the company will be able to claim input tax on the payment for these services. The Ruling has been updated to reflect the new structure of s 6 and to explain the effect of s 6(4). 14.The previous Ruling and Commentary (BR Pub 05/13) replace d B R Pub 00/11 from 1 April 2005 for an indefinite period (see Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 7 (September 2005): 9). BR Pub 00/ 11 a pplied for the period 26 October 2000 to 31 March 2005 (see Ta x WITHDRAWN Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 11 (November 2000): 3). BR Pub 00/11 replaced BR Pub 00/09, which contained an application period that was seen to be retrospective. BR Pub 00/09 was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000): 9, to replace the policy items on “GST on Directors’ Fees” contained in Public Information Bulletins 164 and 175. Summary of the Legislation 15.This part of the Commentary summarises the legislation relevant to tw o i ssues: •whether directors’ fees are subject to GST; and •whether a company is entitled to claim input tax deductions for fees paid to a director who is also an employee of a third party employer . S cheme of the GST Act 16.Section 8(1) provides that GST is charged on the supply (but not an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by tha t p erson. GST is regarded as a transactions tax because it is imposed on supplies of goods and services. On this basis, it is the contractual relationship between the parties (founded on a genuine basis) tha t d etermines the GST treatment of the relevant transactions (Wilson & Horton v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 (CA)) . 17.G ST is imposed on supplies made by registered persons. A “registered person” is a person that is registered, or liable to be registered, for GST. A person may be liable to be registered for GST if the value of their total supplies in New Zealand in a 12-month period exceeds the threshold amount in s 51. However, to be liable to account for GST, a registered person must carry on a “taxable activity”. Requirements of a “taxable activity” 18.Section 6 defines the term “taxable activity” for the purposes of the Act. Section 6(1) defines a “taxable activity” as an activity that is carried on continuously or regularly, and involves, or is intended to involve, the supply of goods and services to another person for a consideration. Therefore, a person conducts a taxable activity when all of the following characteristics are present: •There is some form of activity. •The activity is carried on continuously or regularly. •The activity involves, or is intended to involve, the supply of good s a nd services to another person for a consideration. 19.The section also includes within the term “taxable activity” the activities of any public or local authority. 20.Under s 6(2) anything done in connection with the commencement or termination of a taxable activity is deemed to be carried out in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. 21.Section 6(3) provides certain exclusions from the term “taxable activity”. Relevantly, for the purposes of this Ruling and Commentary, any WITHDRAWN engagement, occupation or employment of a person as a director is excluded from the definition of “taxable activity”: s 6(3)(b). 22.However, in certain circumstances, a director can be deemed to provide their services as part of a taxable activity under s 6(5). Section 6(5) applies where a person, in carrying on a taxable activity, accepts an office as director. Section 6(5) applies to persons appointed as a director under s 6(3)(b). In this situation, any services provided by the director are deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of the director’s taxable activity. Therefore, if a GST-registered sole trader accepts a directorship in carrying on their taxable activity, s 6(5) applies and the sole trader is liable to return GST on any director’s fees received. Deemed supplies by employers 23.A company may engage a person as director who is an employee of a third party employer. An employer may agree to an employee being engage d a s a director of a company on the condition that the employee accounts t o t he employer for any directors’ fees received. In this situation, the company would ordinarily be precluded from claiming any GST input tax deductions on director’s fees paid to the employee of a third party employer. The reason for this is that, generally, the employee would not be carrying on a taxable activity. This is because the term “taxable activity” excludes any engagement, occupation or employment under any contract of service: s 6(3)(b). 24.Section 6(4) was introduced to allow a company to claim input tax deductions for fees paid to a director who is an employee of a third party employer. Section 6(4) provides that when an employee of a third party employer is engaged by a company to be a director and the employee is required to account for any fees received to their employer, the employer is deemed to supply the services to the company. The employer will therefore be liable for GST output tax on the supply of the services an d t he company will be able to claim input tax on the payment for those services. For more information on the introduction of this subsection, see Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 26, No 7 (August 2014): 96. Application of the legislation 25.This Ruling considers the GST treatment of the supply of services as a director. The following analysis explains the GST treatment of supplies of services provided by a director in the following circumstances: •a person (with or without a taxable activity) is engaged in their personal capacity as a director of a company; •a person (with or without a taxable activity) is contracted as a director of a company by a third party; •an employee of a third party employer is engaged as a director of a company; and •a partner in a partnership is engaged as a director of a company. Director engaged in their personal capacity Director Company WITHDRAWN 26.A person may accept an office as a director in their personal capacity and not as part of carrying on any taxable activity. Alternatively, a person may accept an office as a director as part of carrying on that person’ s ta xable activity. 27.If the person accepts an office in their personal capacity and not as part of carrying on a taxable activity, then the activity of supplying services as a director falls within the exclusion in s 6(3)(b). Section 6(5) does not apply because the person has not accepted the office as part of carrying on a taxable activity. 28.However, if the director has accepted the office as part of carrying on a taxable activity, s 6(5) overrides the exclusion in s 6(3)(b) and deems the services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. If the director is registered, or liable to be registered, for GST, the director will be required to account for GST output tax on the fees received for the services they supply. Example 1 – Director engaged in their personal capacity and does not have taxable activity Claudius, who is not registered for GST, is an employee of a marketing agency. Fortinbras Ltd engages Claudius as a director and pays him fees for his services. Claudius’ appointment as a director is not connected with his employment, nor has he accepted the directorship as part of carrying on a taxable activity. He retains the fees, having received them in his personal capacity. Claudius is engaged as a director of a company, an activity that is excluded from the term “taxable activity” by s 6(3)(b). Section 6(5) does not apply, because Claudius did not accept the directorship as part of carrying on a taxable activity. Claudius is not required to account for GST on the fees received for directorship services. Fortinbras Ltd cannot claim input tax deductions on the fees paid to Claudius because no GST was charged on those fees. Example 2 – Director engaged in their personal capacity and has a taxable activity Ophelia is a human resources consultant in business on her own. She is registered for GST. Ophelia accepts a position as a director of Reynaldo Ltd as part of carrying on her taxable activity. She receives fees for her services. Because Ophelia has accepted the directorship as part of carrying on her taxable activity, s 6(5) deems her services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of her taxable activity. Ophelia should therefore provide Reynaldo Ltd with a tax invoice and account for GST output tax on the fees she is paid. Reynaldo Ltd may claim input tax deductions for the fees paid to Ophelia, provided the requirements of the Act, such as s 20(2), are met . WITHDRAWN Director contracted to company by third party Company Third Party 2 1 Director 29.A third party may agree to provide the services of a director to a company. In this situation there are two relevant supplies for GST purposes. The first supply is the director providing their services to the third party. The second supply is the third party providing the director’s services to the company. 30.The director may accept the office in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. If the office is not accepted in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, the director’s engagement is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under s 6(3)(b). Section 6(5) would not apply because the director’s services are not supplied as part of carrying on a taxable activity. Therefore, there can be no supply for GST purposes between the director and the third party. 31.However, if the director accepts the office in carrying on a taxable activity, s 6(5) deems the director’s services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity. This is the first supply. In thi s s ituation, the director will invoice the third party for providing the director’s services. The director will therefore be required to account for GST output tax on the fees they receive for these services. 32.In relation to the second supply, the third party invoices the company for the third party’s services in providing the director’s services. If the third party is registered, or liable to be registered, for GST, they will be required to account for GST output tax on the fees received for the supply of the director’s services. Section 6(3)(b) will not apply because the third party is not engaged as a director of a company. Example 3 – Director contracted to company by third party an d d oes not have taxable activity A GST-registered financial management company, Polonius Ltd, agrees to supply Osric Ltd with the services of a director. Polonius Ltd supplies the services of Marcellus, one of its specialist employees, to Osric Ltd . D irectors’ fees are paid by Osric Ltd to Polonius Ltd for the services provided by Marcellus. The engagement of Marcellus as a director is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under s 6(3)(b). Section 6(5) does not apply as Marcellus has not accepted the office as part of carrying on a taxable activity. Marcellus has accepted the office as part of his employment with Polonius Ltd. Therefore, Marcellus is not required to account for GST on the supply of his directorship services. Section 6(3)(b) does not apply to the activity of Polonius Ltd because tha t c ompany is not engaged as a company director. The fees are paid in WITHDRAWN consideration of Polonius Ltd providing the services of Marcellus to Osric Ltd. This is a supply in the course or furtherance of Polonius Ltd’s taxable activity and that company will be required to account for GST output tax on the fees received for this supply. If Osric Ltd is registered for GST, it may claim input tax deductions for the fees paid to Polonius Ltd, provided the requirements of the Act, such as s 20(2), are met. Example 4 – Director contracted to company by third party and has taxable activity Horatio is a GST-registered accountant in business on his own. A consulting firm, Voltimand Ltd, agrees to supply another company, Yorick Ltd, with the services of a director to monitor Yorick Ltd’s financial systems. Horatio agrees with Voltimand Ltd to provide his services as a director of Yorick Ltd. There are two supplies involved in this arrangement. First, Horatio provides his services to Voltimand Ltd. Second, Voltimand Ltd supplies the services of Horatio to Yorick Ltd. Horatio’s engagement as a director of Yorick Ltd is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under s 6(3)(b). However, as Horatio has accepted the office as part of carrying on his taxable activity as an accountant, s 6(5) deems his services as a director to be supplied in the course or furtherance of his taxable activity. In relation to the first supply, Horatio will therefore be required to account for GST output tax on the fees he receives from Voltimand Ltd for these services. In relation to the second supply, Voltimand Ltd’s supply of Horatio’s services to Yorick Ltd does not fall within s 6(3)(b) because Voltimand Ltd is not engaged as a director of a company. Provided Voltimand Ltd is registered, or liable to be registered, for GST, it will be required to account for GST output tax on the fees received for the supply of Horatio’s services. If Yorick Ltd is registered for GST, it may claim input tax deductions for the fees paid to Voltimand Ltd, provided the requirements of the Act, such as s 20(2), are met. Employee engaged as a director Employer Company Director 33.A company may engage a person as director who is also an employee of a third party employer. In this situation, either the employee holds the office as part of their employment duties, or the employee holds the office WITHDRAWN outside of their employment. In this type of scenario, there is no contract between the employer and the company. 34.If the employee holds the office outside of their employment, they will be a director in their personal capacity (see Examples 1 and 2 above). Because the director is also an employee, it is unlikely that they will have a taxable activity, but this will depend on the circumstances of each case. 35.Sometimes an employer will permit an employee to accept an office, provided the employee accounts to the employer for the fees received. If the employee holds the office as part of their employment, the engagement of the employee as a director is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under s 6(3)(b). Section 6(5) does not apply as the director has not accepted the office as part of carrying on a taxable activity—the director is merely carrying out his or her employment duties. 36.Section 6(4) provides that when an employee is engaged as a director of a company and the employee is required to account for any fees received t o th eir employer, the employer will be treated as supplying services to the company. This is illustrated by the following diagram: Employer Company Director 37.The employer (provided it is registered, or liable to be registered, for GST) will therefore return GST output tax on the supply of the services by the employee and provide a tax invoice to the company. The company wil l t hen be able to claim input tax on the payment for these services. Example 5 – Employee engaged as a directo r G uildenstern Ltd agrees to one of its employees, Laertes, taking up a directorship with Cornelius Ltd on the proviso that Laertes accounts for the fees he receives to Guildenstern Ltd. There is no contract between Guildenstern Ltd and Cornelius Ltd. Cornelius Ltd is not GST-registered. The engagement of Laertes as a director is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under s 6(3)(b). Section 6(5) does not apply as Laertes has not accepted the office as part of carrying on a taxable activity. Therefore, Laertes is not required to account for GST on the supply of the directorship services. Guildenstern Ltd is treated as making the supply of directorship service s u nder s 6(4). If Guildenstern Ltd is registered, or liable to be registered, for GST, it is required to account for GST on the supply of the services. Cornelius Ltd cannot claim any input tax deductions on the directors’ fee s i t pays, because it is not GST-registered. WITHDRAWN Partner in a partnership engaged as a director Company Partnership Director 38.A partner in a partnership may be engaged as a director of a company as part of the partnership’s business. 39.Section 2(1) defines “unincorporated body” to include a partnership. Section 57(2)(b) provides that where an unincorporated body carries on a taxable activity, any supply of goods and services made as part of carrying on that taxable activity is deemed to be supplied by the unincorporated body. If the unincorporated body is a partnership, any supply of goods and services made as part of carrying on its taxable activity is deemed to be supplied by the partnership and not by any of the partners. 40.The engagement of the partner as a director is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under s 6(3)(b). Section 6(5) does not apply because , a lthough the partner may be carrying on the taxable activity of the partnership, the services are deemed to be supplied by the partnership, and not the partner, under s 57(2)(b). Therefore, the partner is not required to account for GST on the supply of their services. 41.Section 6(3)(b) does not apply in the case of the partnership as the partnership is not engaged as a director. The partnership supplies the services of one of its partners to another person as part of its taxable activity. The partnership will therefore be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the partner’s services as a director. The partnership should also provide the company with a tax invoice. 42.While s 6(4) does not apply in this situation, the company will still be able to claim input tax on the payment for the director’s services. This i s be cause the partnership is deemed to supply the partner’s services under s 57(2)(b) in much the same way as s 6(4) deems an employer to provide an employee’s services as a director to a company . E xample 6 – Partner in a partnership engaged as director of company A GST-registered legal partnership provides legal advice to Rosencrantz Ltd. A partner in the partnership, Gertrude, is elected on to the board of directors of Rosencrantz Ltd as a representative of the partnership. Rosencrantz Ltd is GST registered. The engagement of Gertrude as a director of a company falls within s 6(3)(b) and is therefore excluded from the term “taxable activity”. Section 6(5) does not apply as, although Gertrude may be providing the directorship services, the services are deemed to be supplied by the WITHDRAWN partnership under s 57(2)(b). Therefore, Gertrude is not required to account for GST on the supply of the directorship services. The provisions of s 6(3)(b) do not apply to the partnership as it is not engaged as a director of a company. The partnership will therefore be required to account for GST output tax on the fees it receives from the company. Rosencrantz Ltd may claim an input tax deduction on Ge rtrude’s directorship services that the partnership invoices it for, provided the requirements of the Act, such as s 20(2), are met. When the company may claim an input tax deduction for fees it pays 43.A person can accept an office of director in different capacities. Depending on the capacity in which the director accepted the office, the company may receive a tax invoice from the director, the director’s employer, the director’s partnership, or a third party. It is not up to the company to determine the capacity in which the director accepted the office. 44.Section 6(4) applies where a director of a company is also employed by a third party employer and the director must account for their fees to that employer. In this situation, s 6(4) deems the supply of directorship services to have been made by the director’s employer. If the director’s employer is registered for GST, they will be able to provide a tax invoice to the company for the supply of directorship services. 45.Essentially, the company may claim an input tax deduction for the fees it pays if: •the company is registered; and •the company holds a tax invoice for the directors’ fees. 46.Other requirements of the Act may also need to be satisfied depending on individual circumstances. Application date 47.This Ruling applies from 30 June 2014. This is the date that the changes to s 6 came into force. The previous Ruling, BR Pub 05/13, was issued on 1 April 2005 for an indefinite period. BR Pub 05/13 is withdrawn from 30 June 2015. As a result, there is a period from 30 June 2014 to 30 June 2015 where this Ruling and the parts of BR Pub 05/13 that were not superseded by the changes to s 6 will apply at the same time. In this regard, the Rulings are consistent. The Commissioner has set the application date for this Ruling as 30 June 2014 to provide certainty for taxpayers in relation to the new legislation and because the Commissioner’s view has not changed.

Certain benefits provided by employers to employees are not subject to fringe benefit tax (FBT) if they are used or consumed by an employee on the premises of the employer. This is referred to as the “on-premises” exclusion from FBT. BR Pub 15/11 and BR Pub 15/12 address how the on - premises exclusion applies to car parking owned or leased by an employer. 2. BR Pub 15/11 sets out that car parks provided by an employer to an employee will be exempt from FBT where the car park is on premises that the employer owns or leases. BR Pub 15/12 sets out the rule where the car parking is on the premises of a company that is part of the same group of companies as an employer. (As appropriate in this commentary “employer” should be read as including a “group company”. A “group company” means a company that is part of the same group of companies as the employer of the employee.) 1 3. Parking provided to employees on land owned by the employer, on land leased by the employer, or in car parks leased by the employer will usually be excluded from FBT because it is a benefit provided on the premises of the employer for FBT purposes. It is not necessary for the employer to carry on business activities on or near those premises for the exclusion to apply. 4. However, the premises of an employer will not usually include a car park that an employer is merely licensed to use, unless the employer can show they have a right to use the car park that is in fact or effect substantially exclusive. 5. To establish whether an employer’s use of a car park is substantially exclusive, account needs to be taken of what is actually occurring between the parties and the actual effect of any agreement between the parties. It does not matter if an employer’s use of the car park does not amount to “legal” possession at common law, but the use must be substantially exclusive. 6. In the Commissioner’s view an employer’s use of a car park will be substantially exclusive when no one else (including the owner or car park operator) uses, or controls the overall use of, the car park preventing the employer from enjoying a substantially exclusive right to use the car park. 7. Deciding whether a car park is employer’s premises may involve weighing a number of factors before deciding, on balance, whether the employer can be said to: • own, • lease, or • enjoy substantially exclusive use of that car park. For example, merely stating that the employer is to have exclusive use of the car park will not on its own be sufficient to establish the car park as the premises of the employer but, when considered alongside other factors, it may be persuasive. 8. In forming her view, the Commissioner considers it is significant that the term “licence” was not explicitly included in the definition of “premises of a person” in s CX 23(2)(a), in para (a) of the definition of “lease” or in the related definitions of “leasehold estate”, “estate in relation to land, interest in relation to land, estate or interest in land, estate in land, interest in land, and similar terms”, “interest” or “possession” in s YA 1 . This indicates to the Commissioner that Parliament never intended s CX 23(2)(a) to be interpreted as enabling all premises that are licenced by an employer to be treated as the employer’s premises. 9. BR Pub 15/11 and BR Pub 15/12 focus on the application of the on - premises exclusion and, in particular, on the scope of para (a) of s CX 23(2) (ie, the first limb of the definition of “premises of a person”). The Rulings do not consider whether FBT may apply to car parking provided by employers under any other provision of the FBT Rules. Practical considerations 10. To help establish whether a car parking arrangement falls within the definition of a “lease” for the purposes of s CX 23 listed below are some common examples of the types of features the Commissioner might expect to find where an employer has a right to use a car park that is in fact or 2 effect substantially exclusive. Sometimes in an arrangement there might be conflicting features, and in those circumstances an assessment needs to be made of the nature of the overall arrangement, keeping in mind it is essentially a question of the degree of control granted to the employer under the arrangement. The more control an employer has, the more likely it is that the car parking spaces are the employer’s premises. 11. The list below is not definitive and there may be other features that indicate the employer has a use of the car parking space that is substantially exclusive: • the owner or car park operator acknowledges that the employer and their employees have the exclusive use of the employer’s car parking spaces and no one else (including the owner or car park operator) can park cars on the parking spaces; • the car parking spaces are allocated exclusively to the employer and cannot be re-allocated at the discretion of the owner or car park operator without a variation of the arrangement or a new arrangement being agreed; • the employer has unrestricted access to the car park; • the car parking spaces remain unoccupied if not being used by the employer (or someone authorised by the employer); • the employer may permit others to use the employer’s car parking spaces; • if an unauthorised person parks in an employer’s car parking space, the employer may take steps to have the unauthorised vehicle towed; and • the employer may decide how the car parking space is used (eg, if desired, the employer may park a trailer in the car parking space). 12. The Commissioner accepts that a car parking arrangement for fixed hours (eg, during business hours) can be an employer’s premises so long as the employer can demonstrate a right to use the car park that is in fact or effect substantially exclusive for those fixed hours. 13. To help establish whether a car parking arrangement falls within the definition of a “lease” for the purposes of s CX 23 listed below are some common examples of the types of features that might suggest a car parking arrangement is not a “lease”. The list is not definitive: • the employer is not allocated any particular car parking spaces within the car park; • where the employer is allocated particular car parking spaces, the owner or car park operator retains the ability to reallocate car parking spaces at their discretion; • the owner or car park operator may alter the car park’s operating hours or restrict access to the car park at their discretion; • the employer cannot remove unauthorised vehicles from the car park or otherwise enforce rights over the car park against third parties, including bringing any action for trespass; and 3 • there is no signage showing the employer’s car parking spaces as being “reserved”. 14. Examples illustrating the Commissioner’s application of the Rulings are provided at \[152\] to \[168\] below. Background 15. A benefit provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment is a fringe benefit and subject to the FBT rules unless it is excluded (s CX 2). An employee’s use of a car park provided by an employer is on the face of it a benefit and is subject to FBT. These Rulings are based on the assumption that the provision by an employer of a car park to an employee is a benefit for FBT purposes. While Parliament could have excluded all car parks from the FBT regime, it has not done so. Nonetheless car parks might still be exempt from FBT if any one of the exclusions in the FBT rules applies to the benefit. Section CX 23 excludes from FBT benefits provided to an employee on an employer’s premises. Therefore if an employer can establish a car park is on its premises the benefit will not be subject to FBT. 16. FBT and car parks was the subject of an expired Public Ruling BR Pub 99/6 issued in 1999. (BR Pub 99/6 was not re-issued when it expired in 2002 but was extended to apply until 31 March 2005.) In BR Pub 99/6, the Commissioner established that for the purposes of the FBT exclusion “premises” were those land and buildings that an employer owned or leased (in a common law sense), and so had exclusive possession of. Land and buildings that were merely licensed to an employer were not considered to be the employer’s “premises”. The distinction relied on the established land law concept of “exclusive possession”, which determines the difference between a lease and a licence – leases being an estate in land akin to ownership, and licences being simply a personal permission to enter and use the land for a particular purpose. A licence to use or occupy land does not create a legal estate or interest in the land. As a result, a licensee cannot sue in trespass or register a caveat against the title of land in the way that a lessee can. 17. With effect from 1 April 2005, changes were made to the FBT legislation as a result of the re-writing of the Income Tax Act. Further legislative changes were made to the on-premises exclusion in 2006. Work on re- issuing BR Pub 99/6 was undertaken with the release of an exposure draft for external consultation in August 2009. However, due to policy considerations the 2009 draft was never finalised. Issues concerning FBT and car parks were addressed by Policy & Strategy in the issues papers Streamlining the Taxation of Fringe Benefits ( government discussion document, Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, December 2003) and Recognising Salary Trade-offs as Income ( officials’ issues paper, Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue and the Treasury, April 2012). Legislative amendments to the FBT treatment of car parks were proposed in the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill 2013. These proposed amendments did not proceed. 18. As a result of BR Pub 99/6 expiring, and legislative changes being made to the on-premises exclusion, it was identified that aspects of the Commissioner’s position on the application of the FBT on-premises exclusion to car parks needed clarification. 4 Application of the Legislation 19. The main issue addressed by these Rulings is the application of the FBT on-premises exclusion in s CX 23, and in particular the scope of the first limb of the definition of “premises of a person” in s CX 23(2)(a), to car parking provided by an employer to an employee. This issue is addressed by considering: • the scheme and purpose of the FBT rules, • the scheme of the on -premises exclusion in s CX 23, and • the wording and interpretation of the first limb of the definition of “premises of a person” in s CX 23(2)(a) and any related definitions in s YA 1. Scheme and purpose of the fringe benefit tax rules 20. The purpose of the FBT rules is to tax non-monetary benefits provided by employers to employees. The regime was introduced to ensure this form of remuneration did not escape the tax net. Car parking can be a benefit when provided to employees. 21. When FBT was introduced, Parliament decided it should apply only to fringe benefits for which the tax was practical to administer. Parliament agreed that the administrative and taxpayer-compliance cost of valuing benefits provided to an employee on an employer’s premises were excessive. For this reason, benefits an employee uses or consumes (subject to some limited exceptions) on an employer’s premises are expressly excluded from FBT. This includes the benefit of car parking provided to employees on an employer’s premises. On-premises exclusion 22. In essence, the on -premises exclusion in s CX 23 provides that a benefit (other than free, discounted, or subsidised travel, accommodation, or clothing) is not a fringe benefit, if it is provided to an employee by an employer and used or consumed on the premises of the employer: CX 23 Benefits provided on premises When not fringe benefit (1) A benefit, other than free, discounted, or subsidised travel, accommodation, or clothing, is not a fringe benefit if the benefit is— (a) provided to the employee by the employer of the employee and used or consumed by the employee on the premises of— (i) the employer: (ii) a company that is part of the same group of companies as the employer: (b) provided to the employee by a company that is part of the same group of companies as the employer of the employee and used or consumed by the employee on the premises of— (i) the employer: (ii) the company that provides the benefit. 23. Section CX 23(1)(a)(ii) extends the on -premises exclusion to also include a benefit an employer provides to an employee that is used or consumed by the employee on the premises of a group company. Section CX 23(1)(b) further extends the exclusion to include a benefit a group 5 company provides to an employee, either on the premises of the employer or on the group company’s premises. 24. To establish whether a benefit is used or consumed on the premises of the employer (or on the premises of a group company) there is a definition of “premises of a person” in s CX 23(2): Premises of person (2) In this section, the premises of a person— (a) include premises that the person owns or leases: (b) include premises, other than those referred to in paragraph (a), on which an employee of the person is required to perform duties for the person: (c) do not include premises occupied by an employee of the person for residential purposes. Definition of “p remises of a person” 25. The definition of “premises of a person” was added to the FBT rules as part of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act in 2004. Initially, a definition for “employer’s premises” was added but it was later changed to “premises of a person” when the rules for group companies were added in 2006. 26. Before 1 April 2005, the on–premises exclusion operated without a definition of “premises”. The Commissioner’s stance was that car parks provided on land or in car parks that an employer owned or leased at common law would be covered by the on-premises exclusion. Car parks that were licensed to an employer were not the employer’s premises and fell outside the on-premises exclusion. 27. With the addition of the definition of “premises of a person” the Commissioner now seeks in these Rulings to clarify the scope of s CX 23(2)(a) as it applies to car parking: Premises of person (2) In this section, the premises of a person— (a) include premises that the person owns or leases: \[Emphasis added\] 28. For the purposes of these Rulings “person” is read as employer but it could also be a group company. Commissioner’s approach to this analysis 29. The key interpretative issues to be resolved to clarify when car parks provided by employers to employees are exempt from FBT are the meanings to be given to the words “include”, “premises”, “owns” and “leases” as these words are used in the definition of “premises of a person” in s CX 23(2)(a). This analysis will determine the Commissioner’s view on the scope of s CX 23(2)(a) and the situations she considers will be excluded from FBT under the section. The analysis is fairly complex because of the potential layers of definitions that may apply. 30. The Commissioner’s approach to the analysis of these issues is to: • consider the meaning of the word “premises” as it is used in the definition; • interpret the meaning to be given to the word “‘include” in the context of the definition – to decide whether the first limb of the definition is limited to car parks that the employer owns or leases; 6 • address the application of the relevant s YA 1 definitions to the words “owns” and “leases”; • consider the meaning of the s YA 1 definitions of the terms “own” and “lease”; • consider the application, meaning and effect of the related s YA 1 definitions of “estate” and “possession”; and • consider the first limb of the definition as a whole and its application to the on-premises exclusion in s CX 23. 31. This approach is summarised as follows: “Premises of a person” include premisesthat the person ownsor leases What are “premises”? How should “inc lude” be interpreted in this c ontext? What is the meaning of “own”? What is the meaning of “lease”? S Y A 1 definit ion of “own” S Y A 1 definit ion of “lease” S Y A 1 definit ion of “leasehold estate” S Y A 1 definit ion of “est ate” S Y A 1 definit ion of “possession” S Y A 1 definit ion of “estate” S YA 1 definit ion of “interest” 32. Examples at \[ 152\] to \[168\] illustrate the Commissioner’s interpretation. Meaning of “premises” 33. To understand the definition of “premises of a person” it is necessary to consider the meaning of the word “premises” as it is used in the definition. 34. The term “premises” is not defined. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (12 th ed, Oxford University Press, 2011) defines “premises” as: A house or building, together with its land and outbuildings, occupied by a business or considered in an official context. 7 35. The ordinary meaning of “premises” has a wide meaning that includes houses and buildings together with their land. This meaning includes land and buildings occupied by a business. 36. Case law indicates that the word “premises” is difficult to interpret because it is capable of many shades of meaning: Northern Hotel IUOW v Bay of Islands College Board of Trustees \[1991\] 1 ERNZ 710. Case law also suggests “premises” should take its meaning from the context in which it is used: Maunsell v Olins \[1975\] 1 All ER 16. In some contexts “premises” may mean land, buildings on land (including the land surrounding the buildings) and any easements granted as appurtenant to the land and buildings: Grandi v Milburn \[1966\] 2 All ER 816; Whitley v Stumbles \[1930\] AC 544. In other contexts premises might be restricted to simply mean buildings situated on the land: McKenna v Porter Motors Ltd \[ 1955\] NZLR 832. 37. In Gardiner v Sevenoaks Rural District Council \[1950\] 2 All ER 84, Lord Goddard said (at 85): “Premises” is, no doubt, a word which is capable of many meanings. How it originally became applied to property is, I think, generally known. It was from the habit of conveyancers when they were drawing deeds of conveyance referring to property and speaking of “parcels”. They set out the parcels in the early part of the deed, and later they would refer to “the said premises”, meaning strictly that which had gone before, and gradually by common acceptance “premises” became applied, as it generally is now, to houses, land, shops, or whatever it may be, so that the word has come to mean generally real property of one sort or another. There is no doubt that from time to time the word “premises” has been given different meanings, either extended or more restricted. \[Emphasis added\] 38. His Lordship said that the word “premises” generally means real property of one sort or another, although at different times it has been given different meanings, either extended or restricted. 39. Applying this approach to the word “premises” as it is used in the definition of “premises of a person” in the on–premises exclusion, the Commissioner considers that “premises” should be interpreted as including land, buildings, and parts of land or buildings. This is consistent with both the ordinary meaning and the common law meaning of “premises”. The Commissioner considers it is also consistent with the scheme and purpose of the FBT rules. In the explanatory commentary to the FBT legislation published when the rules were first introduced in 1985 (see Public Information Bulletin No 136, Part 1 (May 1985) at 22) it was stated: The term “premises” refers to land, buildings or \[appurtenances\] thereto. 40. Further, in the Commissioner’s view, the definition of “premises of a person” is not limited to “business” premises. Unlike in other jurisdictions (such as Australia) the definition does not use the word “business” premises and does not include a business-type test. The Commissioner considers her view to be consistent with the stated intention of the FBT rules for car parks when the rules were introduced (also set out in the commentary mentioned above at 22): The term ”premises” refers to premises owned by, or rented or leased by, the employer for use in the carrying on of a business. In the case of car parks, parking provided on land owned by the employer, land leased by the employer, or in respect of car parks over which the employer has a long term lease will be eligible for the exemption. It is not necessary that the employer also carry on normal business activities on or near those premises. 41. For these reasons, the Commissioner considers that the better view is that the term “premises” was intended by Parliament to be a physical concept 8 that refers to land, buildings, and parts of land or buildings owned or leased by the employer for use in the carrying on of a business and is not to be interpreted as being restricted to premises from which the employer carries out its normal business operations. Meaning of “include” 42. The word “include” is used within the definition of “premises of a person”. Its use raises the question as to whether Parliament intended for the “premises of a person” to be something broader than simply land and buildings that the employer or group company owns or leases. Depending on the meaning given to the word “include” in the first limb of the definition of “premises of a person”, an employer’s premises may arguably extend beyond premises that an employer “owns” or “ leases” (as those terms are defined in s YA 1). 43. The use of the word “include” raises a number of interpretative questions. In some statutory contexts the word “include” is indicative of a non- exhaustive definition; in other contexts it may be read as equivalent to the narrower “means and includes” construction: Dilworth v Commissioner of Stamps (1899) NZPCC 578 (PC). 44. When “include” is used to enlarge the meaning of a defined word (ie, where it is non-exhaustive), as it generally is , it may not extend the meaning to something that was not intended in the scheme of the Act: Harley v CIR \[1971\] NZLR 482 (CA). 45. Other case law indicates that the scope of the word “include” depends on the genus or class of items already defined in the definition: Whitsbury Farm and Stud Ltd v Hemens (Valuation Officer) \[1988\] AC 601 (HL). 46. If the word “include” is given a non-exhaustive meaning in the context of s CX 23(2)(a), then arguably an employer’s premises are not restricted to car parks that an employer “owns” or “leases” but might also include other car parks, such as any car parks licensed by an employer. The Commissioner disagrees with this interpretation (although, as discussed below, the Commissioner accepts that some licenced car parks may satisfy the extended statutory definition of “lease” and therefore qualify as employer premises in that way.) 47. While it is not free from doubt, the Commissioner considers the better view, in this context, is to interpret “include” in the definition of “premises of a person” exhaustively. In the Commissioner’s view such an interpretation is supported by: • the intended purpose of the FBT rules; • the construction of the definition of “premises of a person” in s CX 23(2); • the nature of the “class” of items in s CX 23(2)(a); and • the implication that if Parliament had intended the class to be broader than premises that an employer “owns” or “leases” (eg, to include all licences) it could have explicitly provided for it. \[This is discussed in more detail below.\] 48. As noted above the Commissioner considers that the original commentary to the FBT legislation indicates that the purpose of the on -premises 9 exclusion was that it applied to land an employer owns or leases or to car parks an employer leases. 49. This interpretation is arguably further supported by the construction of the definition in s CX 23(2). Paragraphs (a) and (b) of s CX 23(2) distinguish between premises an employer owns and leases and premises of an employer, other than those it owns or leases, on which an employee is required to perform duties for the employer. 50. Further, in the Commissioner’s view the class of items in the first limb of the definition of “premises of a person” (ie, “owned” or “leased” premises) indicates an intention that an employer’s premises will include only premises that are essentially in the nature of an estate in the land. At common law, an estate in land exists when a person owns or leases land so that they have exclusive possession of the land. An estate in land does not exist when a person merely has a licence to use the land or is granted permission to enter the land for some specified purpose. 51. The Court of Appeal in Fatac Ltd (in liq) v CIR \[2002\] 3 NZLR 648 (which followed the House of Lords’ decision in Street v Mountford \[1985\] 2 All ER 289) considered whether a licence creates an estate in land. In his judgment, Fisher J said (at 658): A licence is a mere permission to be on the land, with or without additional permission to perform additional specified acts there. The former creates an estate in the land; the latter does not. 52. This shows that a licence does not create an estate in land, in the same way that owning or leasing land does. Therefore, premises that are licenced arguably are not in the same class of items specified in the first limb of the definition of “premises of a person” (ie, “owned” or “leased” premises). 53. By Parliament not explicitly adding premises that are licensed to the first limb of the definition of “premises of a person”, it can be inferred they are to be excluded. This conclusion is supported by the application of the expressio unius est exclusio alterius (to express one thing is to exclude another) p rinciple of statutory interpretation. Section CX 2 3(2)(a) expressly states the definition of “premises of a person” includes premises of the type that employers own or lease. T his implies premises held under some other arrangement such as a licence are excluded from the definition. 54. When the definition of “premises of a person” was added to the on- premises exclusion in 2004 the intention was for the definition to reflect the existing position with respect to the scope of the exclusion by preserving the accepted boundary between leases and licences. 55. Finally, since FBT was introduced in 1985 there has been much discussion about and opportunities for amendments to the FBT legislation, yet Parliament has refrained from making any express exclusion from FBT for car parks that are licensed to employers or from excluding all car parks from the on-premises exclusion. 56. The Commissioner considers all these factors support the view that “include” in s CX 23(2)(a), in the context of the definition o f “premises of a person”, the exclusion and the FBT rules, should be read as equivalent to the narrower “means and includes” construction. This means s CX 23(2)(a) is to be read as being limited to premises an employer “owns” or “leases”. 10 Application of s YA 1 definitions to “premises of a person” 57. Having established that the definition of “premises of a person” is to be read as being limited to premises that an employer owns or leases, it is now appropriate to consider the s YA 1 definitions of “own” and “lease”. 58. “Own” means to have an “estate” or “interest” in land. An “interest” in land is defined under the definition of “ estate”. A “lease” is any “estate” in land, other than a freehold estate. The definition of “lease” expressly includes licences i n some circumstances; but not for the purposes of the FBT rules. The second limb of the definition of “estate” extends the general meaning of “estate” to include a right to the possession of the land. “Possession” is in turn defined as including a use of the land that is, in fact or effect, substantially exclusive. 59. The relevant parts of the s YA 1 definitions are as follows: own,— (a) for land, means to have an estate or interest in the land, alone or jointly or in common with any other person: interest,— (d) in relation to land, interest in land, estate or interest in land, and similar terms are defined under the definition of estate lease— (a) means a disposition that creates a leasehold estate leasehold estate includes any estate, however created, other than a freehold estate. estate in relation to land, interest in relation to land, estate or interest in land, estate in land, interest in land, and similar terms– – (a) mean an estate or interest in the land, whether legal or equitable, and whether vested or contingent, in possession, reversion, or remainder; and (b) include a right, whether direct or through a trustee or otherwise, to— (i) the possession of the land (for example: a licence to occupy, as that term is defined in section 121A(1) of the Land Transfer Act 1952): ... possession includes a use that is in fact or effect substantially exclusive. 60. On the face of it, Parliament may not have intended the s YA 1 definitions of “own” and “lease” (and the other related definitions in s YA 1 like “estate” and “possession”) to apply in the context of the definition of “premises of a person”. Instead Parliament might have intended for the definitions in s YA 1 to be disregarded in the context of the definition of “premises of a person” and for the common law meanings to apply in their place. Applying the s YA 1 definitions to s CX 23(2)(a) arguably broadens the scope of the on-premises exclusion. 61. However, on balance, the Commissioner does not accept this argument. 62. When Rewriting the Income Tax Act 1994 (exposure draft, Inland Revenue, 2001) was released for consultation “employer’s premises” were defined in s CX 27(2)(a) as “includes premises to which the employer has a right of possession”. The term “possession” in s YA 1 was included in the list of defined terms for that section. Although the definition of “employer’s premises” was subsequently changed and, in time, became the definition of “premises of a person”, the link to the definitions in s YA 1 (including indirectly the link to the definition of “possession”) were retained. 11 63. The courts impose a high threshold before a definition can be disregarded for the purposes of interpreting a defined word in an Act. There need to be strong indications to the contrary in the context: Police v Thompson \[1966\] NZLR 813. 64. The Commissioner does not think that after initially including the term “possession” in the first draft of the rewritten Act, it can be argued that it was intended that the s YA 1 definitions be disregarded in the context of s CX 23. 65. However, as noted above, the Commissioner does think it is significant that the word “licence” was not added to the new definition of “premises of a person” in s CX 23(2)(a) or to the existing definition of “lease” or “estate” in s YA 1 for these purposes. This indicates to the Commissioner that Parliament never went so far as to necessarily intend licences in general to be included within the on-premises exclusion. Meaning of “owns” and “leases” 66. Accepting that the relevant s YA 1 definitions are intended to be applied in the context of s CX 23, the starting point is the meaning of the defined terms “own” and “lease”: own  (a) for land, means to have an estate or interest in the land, alone or jointly or in common with any other person: (b) for the ownership of depreciable property, is defined in sections EE 2 to EE 5 (which relate to depreciation) lease  (a) means a disposition that creates a leasehold estate: (b) in sections DZ 9 (Premium paid on land leased before 1 April 1993) and EZ 8 (Premium paid on land leased before 1 April 1993), (i) means a disposition by which a leasehold estate is created; and (ii) includes a licence: (c) for the purposes of subpart EE (Depreciation), includes a licence to occupy: ... (d) (iii) includes a licence to use intangible property; and ... (f) in the financial arrangements rules, means (i) a lease as described in paragraph (d): (ii) an arrangement that would be a lease as described in paragraph (d) if the arrangement did not relate to real property, livestock, or bloodstock 67. “Own” is defined for land as “to have an estate or interest in the land”. 68. The definition of “lease” in s YA 1 has six limbs, three of which (paras (b), (c), and (d)) directly, and one (para (f)) indirectly, include a reference to some form of licence. However, para (a), which sets out the general meaning of “lease” for the purposes of the Act ( including for the purposes of the FBT rules), does not refer to licences. The general meaning of “lease” in para (a) is “a disposition that creates a leasehold estate”. A “leasehold estate” is defined to include “any estate ... other than a freehold estate”. 12 Definition of “estate” 69. In s YA 1, the definition of “estate” in relation to land includes definitions of interest in relation to land, estate or interest in land, estate in land, interest in land, and similar terms. Those terms are each defined to mean an estate or interest in the land ... and include a right to the possession of the land: estate in relation to land, interest in relation to land, estate or interest in land, estate in land, interest in land, and similar terms– – (a) mean an estate or interest in the land, whether legal or equitable, and whether vested or contingent, in possession, reversion, or remainder; and (b) include a right, whether direct or through a trustee or otherwise, to— (i) the possession of the land (for example: a licence to occupy, as that term is defined in section 121A(1) of the Land Transfer Act 1952): (ii) the receipt of the rents or profits from the land: (iii) the proceeds of the disposal of the land; and (c) do not include a mortgage 70. For ease of reference, the above definition is referred to in this analysis as the definition of “estate”. 71. At common law an estate includes freehold estates (such as a fee simple, stratum estates and life interests) that give rise to a bundle of rights to the person who owns that estate and also leasehold estates. A profit-à- prendre is an example of an interest in land because it creates property rights that can be enforced in rem even though it does not grant exclusive possession. However, at common law, an arrangement that is a licence is never an estate or interest in land. 72. The definition of “estate” is a “means and includes” type definition. Where the words “means” and “includes” are used together within a provision the standard approach is for the “included” matters to extend the meaning of the generally defined term. Paragraph (a) of the definition provides that the term means an “estate or interest in the land, whether legal or equitable, and whether vested or contingent, in possession, reversion, or remainder”. It appears the purpose of para (a) is to establish a meaning of “estate” by recognising the many different types of estates or interests in land at common law. 73. Paragraph (b) of the definition then extends that meaning by listing three other rights in respect of land. In the Commissioner’s view, the three rights listed in para (b) are separate rights, any one of which may qualify as an estate. 74. The Commissioner considers that Parliament intended these three rights in para (b) to broaden the definition of “estate”. The rights listed in para (b) usually arise from the ownership or control of land, but that ownership or control may not necessarily be “legally” recognised as ownership or akin to ownership. (For example, para (b)(i) of the definition of “estate” includes the example of a licence to occupy as that term is defined in section 121A(1) of the Land Transfer Act 1952. This refers to rights arising from a shareholding in a flat or office owning company. While a shareholding in a flat or office owning company may not be an estate in land at common law, it is still recognised as creating a registrable interest for land transfer purposes.) 13 75. The definition of “estate” (and the definitions of “lease”, “leasehold estate” and “possession”) originated in response to the avoidance of land tax and were enacted into New Zealand tax legislation in 1912 before being rewritten in 1916. It appears they were intended to extend the common law to include situations where a person artificially divested themselves of the legal ownership of land while still retaining one or more of the key features of ownership, such as possession, the right to receive rents and profits or the right to sale proceeds. The definition could also be applied to long term purchase agreements where a purchaser obtained one or more of the benefits of ownership but to avoid being “named” as the owner delayed obtaining legal title. The rules were designed to apply equally to freehold and leasehold estates. 76. The definition of “estate” was included in s 2 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1916, the general definition section. The definition applied for the purposes of the whole Act, not only for the land tax provisions of the 1916 Act. Since 1916 the definition of “estate” has continued to be used in New Zealand tax legislation without substantive amendment. 77. The Commissioner considers para (b) of the definition of “estate” in s YA 1 should be read as extending the definition of “estate” beyond its meaning in para (a). Definition of “possession” 78. Accepting that para (b) of the definition of “estate” extends the general definition of “estate” in para (a), it is next necessary to consider the effect that the definition of “possession” may have on the meaning of the words in para (b)(i) of the definition of “estate”. 79. Paragraph (b)(i) of the definition of “estate” includes a right to the possession of the land: (b) includes a right, whether direct or through a trustee or otherwise, to - (i) the possession of the land (for example: a licence to occupy, as that term is defined in section 121A(1) of the Land Transfer Act 1952): 80. “Possession” is defined in s YA 1 as including a use that is in fact or effect substantially exclusive: possession includes a use that is in fact or effect substantially exclusive 81. Therefore reading-in the definition of “possession”, it follows that the general definition of “estate” is broadened to include a right to a use of the land that is in fact or effect substantially exclusive. Taking this to the next level, for the purposes of the definition of “lease” as it applies for FBT purposes, this means an agreement will be a lease if it is a disposition that creates a use of the land that is in fact or effect substantially exclusive. Therefore, if an employer has an agreement with a third party that creates a use of the land that is in fact or effect substantially exclusive, then that land will be the premises of the employer for the purposes of the on- premises exclusion. 82. Determining the meaning of the words in the definition of “possession” is therefore important to understanding the scope of the definition of “premises of a person” in s CX 23(2)(a). Section 5(1) of the Interpretation Act 1999 provides: (1) The meaning of an enactment must be ascertained from its text and in the light of its purpose. 14 83. The requirements of s 5(1) of the Interpretation Act 1999 were explained by the Supreme Court in Commerce Commission v Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd \[2007\] NZSC 36; \[2007\] 3 NZLR 767 at \[22\] and \[24\]: 22. It is necessary to bear in mind that s 5 of the Interpretation Act 1999 makes text and purpose the key drivers of statutory interpretation. The meaning of an enactment 10 must be ascertained from its text and in the light of its purpose. Even if the meaning of the text may appear plain in isolation of purpose, that meaning should always be cross checked against purpose in order to observe the dual requirements of s 5. In determining purpose the court must obviously have regard to both the immediate and the general legislative context. Of relevance too may be the social, commercial or other objective of the enactment. 11 ... 24. Where ... the meaning is not clear on the face of the legislation, the court will regard context and purpose as essential guides to meaning. \[Footnotes: 10 “Enactment” means “the whole or a portion of an Act or regulations”: see s 29 of the Interpretation Act 1999; 11 See generally Auckland City Council v Glucina \[1997\] 2 NZLR 1 at p 4 (CA) per Blanchard J for the Court, and Burrows, Statute Law in New Zealand (3rd ed, 2003), p 146 and following.\] 84. Therefore, when ascertaining the meaning of the definition of “possession” it is necessary to consider not only its plain meaning but also its purpose. Meaning of “a use” of the land 85. The plain meaning of the words “a use” is arguably quite broad when the words are considered in isolation, distinct from the whole of the definition. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (12 th ed, Oxford University Press, 2011) defines “use” (when used as a noun) as: The action of using something or the state of being used for a purpose The ability or power to exercise or manipulate one’s mind or body A purpose for or way in which something can be used 86. This suggests the words “a use” refers to a use of land for some purpose created by or allowed pursuant to some legal right. For example, “a use of the land” might include a right to use the land for a particular purpose, such as with an easement. It might also include a right to use the land by occupying it or deriving income from it (although this latter type of “use” is covered by para (b)(ii) of the definition of “estate”). Importantly it may also include a personal permission “to use” land in a certain way. 87. The decision in Merrill v Wilson \[1900\] 1 QB 35 (CA) considered whether ship-owners had “ actual use” of a portion of a quay within the meaning of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1895 (UK), so were “undertakers” in respect of a factory and liable to pay compensation to the dependants of a workman who died. The Court of Appeal held (at 43) that the use of the quay by the ship-owners was something less than legal occupation, but was an “actual use”: I think that full effect is given to the words of the Act by holding them to apply to the exclusive use of part of the quay by the shipowners as regards the purposes of unloading and loading, which practically involves the exclusion of most other persons, though not necessarily of all. At the time when the accident happened to the deceased man, the respondents appear to have had substantially the full enjoyment of a definable portion of the quay, namely, that beside which the ship lay, for the essential purpose for which the quay was intended, to the exclusion of any use of it by others for that purpose. \[Emphasis added\] 15 88. This case is interesting because it brings together some of the different elements from the definition of “possession”. However, it also demonstrates that in the context of land the term “a use” is a right to enjoy land for a particular purpose. This is consistent with the dictionary definitions of “a use” as being a way in which something can be used. Meaning of “in fact or effect” 89. The Act does not define “in fact or effect”. When the definition of “possession” was added to the income tax legislation in 1916, there were many large landowners. Land tax was payable annually on land owned on 31 March each year. To reduce their liability for land tax, some large landowners would enter into dummy sales - they “sold” portions of their land while still effectively retaining the benefits of ownership. In other situations, purchasers would enter into long-term lease agreements with compulsory acquisition clauses designed to delay the transfer of legal title to the purchaser. The definitions of “estate” and “possession” were drafted to ensure these “dummy sales” were not an effective means of avoiding land tax by broadening the definitions of “own” and “lease” to include land over which the landowners or purchasers had de facto control. 90. This legislative purpose was explained by the Supreme Court in Yule v Commissioner of Taxes \[1918\] NZLR 890. This case concerned the application of land tax to a property that was leased for seven years to a purchaser under a long term lease agreement before eventually being sold. It was held the purchaser/lessee was liable for the land tax because he was in possession, and the owner/lessor was not liable: To give effect to the object of preventing dummy sales possession ought to be given a wide rather than a narrow meaning which might lead to evasion. It is in this spirit doubtless that the Act itself now defines possession as including any use which is in fact or effect substantially exclusive, whether by virtue of exclusive occupation or not. 91. The phrase “in fact or effect” i s disjunctive in nature and relates to the use of the land. It supports the view that the intended purpose of the definition of “possession” was to include as estates in land uses of land that only “in fact or effect” gave rise to possession (ie, possession enjoyed by the landowner or purchaser that may not have been considered “legal possession”). Possession “in fact” 92. The courts have made a distinction between factual and legal possession. For land law purposes, legal possession has traditionally been decisive in deciding whether an estate in land is created. For instance, in Western Australia v Ward \[2002\] 213 CLR 1 the High Court of Australia held that: When the cases talk of exclusive possession, they speak of legal possession. It is the right to legal possession that constitutes a lease ... It is the legal right to possession, not the physical fact of exclusive ‘possession’ or occupation, that is decisive. That is why a lessee can bring an action for ejectment although driven from the premises and why at common law a lessee could bring an action for ejectment although he or she had not yet entered upon the land. \[Emphasis added\] 93. Similarly, in Radaich v Smith (1959) 101 CLR 209, Windeyer J stated (at 223): ... persons who are allowed to enjoy sole occupation in fact are not necessarily to be taken to have been given a right of exclusive possession in law. If there be any decision which goes further and states positively that a person 16 legally entitled to exclusive possession for a term is a licensee and not a tenant, it should be disregarded for it is self-contradictory and meaningless. \[Emphasis added\] 94. Windeyer J recognises that sometimes a person who is in sole occupation (and who therefore has de facto possession of land) is not necessarily going to be recognised as being the person in legal possession of the land for land law purposes. 95. Lord Templeman in Street v Mountford also recognised that there can be circumstances where an arrangement may still only be a licence notwithstanding that de facto exclusive possession can be established. For example, an owner can sometimes have a genuine need to continue to have access to land for some reason (eg, to provide services or to repair), and occupancy by the “tenant” can sometimes be referable to another legal relationship (such as employment or a mortgage) or where a purchaser is let into occupation before settlement. These legal relationships are the reason for the exclusive occupation rather than demonstrating the existence of a lease. 96. The approach taken in Street v Mountford was followed by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Fatac. The decision in Fatac concerned Puhinui Quarries Ltd’s sale of land in 1996 to a third party, Mt Wellington Nurseries Ltd, subject to what was described as a “licence”. The licence was a right to operate the quarry granted by Puhinui to Atlas Consolidated Ltd in 1991. If the quarry right was a licence (rather than a lease), then there was a liability for GST as the sale could not be zero-rated as a sale of a tenanted property. 97. The Court of Appeal discussed the history of the lease/licence distinction in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. The court noted that New Zealand had over time adopted a broader approach than had the United Kingdom. The Court of Appeal took the opportunity to reject that broader approach in favour of a return to the United Kingdom’s approach as set out in Street v Mountford. The Court of Appeal held (at \[38\] and \[39\]): \[38\] In our view first principles support the right to exclusive possession as the litmus for tenancies. Exclusive possession allows the occupier to use and enjoy the property to the exclusion of strangers. Even the reversioner is excluded except to the extent that a right of inspection and/or repair is expressly reserved by contract or statute. A tenant enjoys those fundamental, if temporary, rights of ownership that stem from exclusive possession for a defined period. Stipulated reservations stem from that premise. The reverse is true for a licensee. Lacking the right to exclusive possession, a licensee can merely enter upon and use the land to the extent that permission has been given. It is this reversal of starting point that provides the rationale for recognising an estate in the land, in the one case, and a mere personal right or permission to enter upon it, in the other: see further Street v Mountford, supra, at 816B-D. \[39\] Because the tenancy/licence distinction turns on those substantive rights granted to the occupier, it remains unaffected by the label which the parties choose to place upon their transaction. It has sometimes been said that the distinction between tenancies and licences turns on the intention of the parties. This can be misleading unless it is appreciated that the only intention that matters is intention as to substantive rights, not intention as to legal classification. \[Emphasis added\] 98. The Court of Appeal went on to discuss several refinements to the exclusive possession test that adopted the approach laid down in Street v Mountford ( at \[40\]–\[42\]): \[40\] Analysis of the case law reveals a series of ancillary principles for the purpose of distinguishing tenancies from licences. None of these, however, undermines 17 exclusive possession as the fundamental test. Exclusive possession terminable by the owner at will would, at least as against the owner, be possession in name only. Accordingly a necessary incident of a meaningful right to exclusive possession is a defined term, whether fixed or periodic (see further Street v Mountford, supra, at 816G). The same is true of an intention to be legally bound (ibid at 819-822). \[41\] Rent would seem relevant to the presence or absence of an intention to be legally bound but not a precondition for a tenancy per se. .... \[42\] Limitations upon the purposes to which the occupier can put the land do not negate a tenancy: Glenwood Lumber Co Ltd v Phillips, supra, at 408-409 (PC). Exclusive possession is not synonymous with an unqualified range of permitted uses. Equally consistent with the critical role of exclusive possession is the refusal to recognise a tenancy where the owner is prevented by statute from granting a tenancy (Street v Mountford at 821), where the landlord’s right of entry to provide services is inconsistent with exclusive possession (ibid at 818, 824-825), or where the right to exclusive possession can be terminated pursuant to some legal relationship extraneous to that of landlord and tenant. \[Emphasis added\] 99. The examples in \[42\] are situations where a court may overlook the decisive fact of a person’s exclusive possession and find that the arrangement is not a lease. 100. The Court of Appeal (at \[45\]) then discussed how de facto possession can be used as a guide to whether a person has exclusive possession: \[45\] Equally consistent with the exclusive possession test are the many decisions concerned with interpretation of the contract or grant conferring the right to occupation. The fundamental question here is whether the parties intended that the occupier would have the right to exclusive possession. On that subject de facto exclusive possession can be an important guide to contractual intentions. That would seem the best explanation for the significance often attached to possession in fact - see, for example, Isaac v Hotel de Paris Ltd at p 245; Street v Mountford at p 823; and Daalman v Oosterdijk \[1973\] 1 NZLR 717. \[Emphasis added\] 101. This decision demonstrates that the courts recognise the concept of de facto possession. However, for the purposes of the common law distinction between leases and licences de facto possession is only an indicator and not decisive. In contrast, for the purposes of the definition of “possession” in s YA 1, de facto (substantially exclusive) possession is a decisive factor. Possession “in effect” 102. The courts have also discussed situations where the effect of an agreement is decisive as to its true nature rather than the descriptions used in the form of the agreement. In Radaich v Smith Menzies J held (at 220): 2. The deed is called a "license" (sic) and the parties thereto "licensors" and "licensee", and it was argued that not only did these descriptions in a formal document show the intention of the parties but also that the substance of its provisions justified these descriptions. When looked at as a matter of both form and substance, the deed seems to me to speak with two voices, but what I regard as decisive in favour of its creating the relationship of landlord and tenant is that it gives the "licensee" the right of exclusive possession of the premises for the term granted thereby. \[Emphasis added\] 103. Furthermore, Lord Davey in Glenwood Lumber Co Ltd v Phillips \[1904\] AC 405 held (at 408): In the so-called licence itself it is called indifferently a licence and a demise, but in the Act it is spoken of as a lease, and the holder of it is described as the lessee. It is not, however, a question of words but of substance. If the effect of the instrument is to give the holder an exclusive right of occupation of the land, though subject to 18 certain reservations or to a restriction of the purposes for which it may be used, it is in law a demise of the land itself ... \[Emphasis added\] 104. As noted above, in Fatac the New Zealand Court of Appeal stated (at \[39\] and \[46\]): \[39\] Because the tenancy/licence distinction turns on those substantive rights granted to the occupier, it remains unaffected by the label which the parties choose to place upon their transaction. It has sometimes been said that the distinction between tenancies and licences turns on the intention of the parties. This can be misleading unless it is appreciated that the only intention that matters is intention as to substantive rights, not intention as to legal classification. As Lord Templeman put it in Street v Mountford, supra, at p 819: ... The consequences in law of the agreement, once concluded, can only be determined by consideration of the effect of the agreement. If the agreement satisfied all the requirements of a tenancy, then the agreement produced a tenancy and the parties cannot alter the effect of the agreement by insisting that they are only creating a licence. The manufacture of a five- pronged implement for manual digging results in a fork even if the manufacturer, unfamiliar with the English language, insists that he intended to make and has made a spade. Windeyer J made the same point in Radaich v Smith, supra, when he said at p 222: Whether the transaction creates a lease or a licence depends upon intention only in the sense that it depends upon the nature of the right which the parties intend the person entering upon the land shall have in relation to the land. \[46\] Terminology traditionally used to describe a tenant's right of occupation (eg the right “to enter upon, use, and enjoy” the land) is significant only if and to the extent that it indicates an intention that the occupier enjoy exclusive possession (Addiscombe Garden Estates Ltd & Anor v Crabbe & Ors \[1957\] 3 All ER 563 (CA) at p 567). 105. In National Car Parks Ltd v Trinity \[2001\] 2 EGLR 43 the agreement included a provision that stated the agreement did not give any proprietary interest to the occupier in the premises. Judge Rich QC considered the real issue to be the effect the agreement actually had and not what the agreement was that the parties expressed themselves as intending to make (at 44): This indicates the intention of the parties, and it is not to be assumed that they failed in such intention, although the need to express it raises a question, and that is, what is the effect of the agreement that they actually made, and not, what was it that they expressed themselves as intending to make? There is no issue between the parties as to the proper approach to that question. It is thus expressed in Hill and Redman's Law of Landlord and Tenant at para A-5632: In deciding whether a grant amounts to a lease, or is only a licence, regard must therefore be had to the substance rather than the form of the agreement, for the relationship between the parties is determined by the law and not by the description which they choose to put on it. To put it another way, it is the effect of the agreement in law which determines its category and not what the parties say their intention was –– still less the label they put on the agreement. One must look at the transaction as a whole and at any indications one finds in the terms of the contract between the two parties to find whether in fact it is intended to create a relationship of landlord and tenant or that of a licensor and licensee. \[Emphasis added\] 106. These cases demonstrate that the courts consistently consider the rights a person actually has in the land to determine whether an estate in land exists. If the person is found to have rights to legal exclusive possession – howsoever the arrangement is described, the arrangement will be treated as, in effect, being an estate in land. 19 Conclusions on “in fact or effect” 107. In the Commissioner’s view the words “in fact” in the definition of “possession” extend the concept of possession for the purposes of the Act to include situations where the user is actually occupying or using the land without the requisite legal exclusive right to possession of the land. This is broader than the common law concept of “possession”. 108. The Commissioner considers the reference to “in effect” in the definition of “possession” emphasises the need to have regard to the substance of the arrangement in law between the parties. These words do not extend but reflect the common law in this regard. The words “in effect” may also cover the situation where a lessee may not in fact be exercising their right to possession, despite being legally entitled to do so. 109. In summary, the words “in fact or effect” in the definition of “possession” mean that in limited circumstances a person who is, in fact, in occupation or has use of the land may be considered to be in “possession” of the land even though they may not satisfy the requirements for legal possession of the land. Also, a person who is not in occupation or is not actually using the land may still be considered to be in possession of the land, if they in effect have a right to use the land. These words give effect to the purpose of the definition as it was explained by the court in Yule. Meaning of “substantially exclusive” 110. As explained above (at \[92\]), the common law approach to possession turns on the substantive rights granted to the occupier. Anything less than exclusive possession is insufficient for an estate or interest in land at common law. (It is recognised that sometimes a lessor will reserve certain rights or impose restrictions on a lessee but it is generally accepted that this need not disturb a lessee’s exclusive possession.) 111. In contrast, the definition of “possession” in s YA 1 provides that a use that is “substantially exclusive” is sufficient for tax purposes. The Act does not define when a use will be “substantially exclusive”. The courts have not tested this phrase. 112. The ordinary meaning of “substantially” in the Concise Oxford Dictionary (12 th ed, Oxford University Press, 2011) is: 1 To a great or significant extent 2 For the most part; essentially 113. Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed, West Publishing, 1990) defines the term “substantially” as : without material qualification; in the main; in substance; materially. 114. In case law, the meaning given to the term “substantially” depends on the context in which it is used and the facts. For example in R v Lloyd \[1965\] 1 QB 175 and Troon Place Investments Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,175 “s ubstantially” refers to something less than totally or wholly but more than trivial or minimal (see also Jolly v Palmer \[1985\] 1 NZLR 658). The meaning falls somewhere in between. It is a word of degree with the cases suggesting it is closer to the “totally or wholly” end of the spectrum than to the “trivial or minimal” end. The courts have found that “substantially” may refer to a significant part of something (Lloyd). In this context the Commissioner considers “significant” means a relatively large amount so as to be important or noteworthy. The meaning of 20 “substantially” has also been equated with the words significant, real and considerable when used as a negative test (Plato v Ashton ( CA 25/84, 1 October 1984)). 115. When “substantially” is used to qualify an unambiguous term (such as “full-time”), “substantially” has been interpreted by equating it to phrases such as “to all intents and purposes”, and “in the main”. In Troon Place Investments Tompkins J considered that in the context of s 190 of the Income Tax Act 1976, which limited a deduction for excessive remuneration paid to a director of a company who was employed substantially full-time in the business of a company, “substantially” meant “to all intents and purposes, in the main” and that to be employed substantially full time, a person need not be employed full time. 116. Tompkins J commented (at 12,180) on the meaning of the phrase “employed substantially full time”: The phrase is one of degree. A person does not have to be employed full time - it is sufficient if the employment is “substantially” full time. In my view, in the phrase and in the context of the section, the word is used in the sense given to it by the New Shorter Oxford Dictionary as meaning “to all intents and purposes, in the main”. If the person is to all intents and purposes employed full time or is in the main employed full time, then such a person would be employed substantially full time. 117. In the Commissioner’s view the decision in Troon Place Investments is helpful. This is because the word “substantially” is being considered in the context of the Income Tax Act and modifies an otherwise “definite” word (that is, the words “full-time” and “exclusive” are similarly definite in their scope). 118. Simpson v ACC (Decision 206-2009, AI 250-04), is an Accident Compensation Corporation decision that attempted to identify the cause of a person’s ill health. Although the decision is not factually relevant to the matters being addressed in the Rulings, Judge Barber’s discussion does offer a contextual example of the words “substantially” and “ exclusive” being used together. In the case, age-related degeneration was not found to be the exclusive cause of the appellant’s symptoms; nor was degeneration found to be substantially the cause of the symptoms. This was because the appellant could point to an earlier injury that had a significant causal connection with the symptoms. 119. Applying Judge Barber’s thinking to the words in the definition of “possession”, a use of land by a person may not be “substantially exclusive” if there is another person with a competing right to also use the land. 120. Based on the dictionary meanings and the limited case law, on balance, the Commissioner considers the better view is that, in the context of the definition of “possession” in s YA 1, the words “substantially exclusive” are referring to a use of the land by a person that is, to all intents and purposes, or in the main, exclusive. In other words, no other person has (or retains) a competing right to use the same land such that it could be said that the first person is prevented from having a use of the land that is substantially exclusive. Similarities with English cases on occupiers 121. Various United Kingdom cases included reference to the term “substantially exclusive” in the context of the occupation of land. Although not directly relevant to the definition of “possession”, these cases offer 21 some insights into the expression “substantially exclusive” as it is used in the context of land. 122. The Court of Appeal in Hutt Valley Electric-Power Board v Lower Hutt City Corp \[1949\] NZLR 611 discussed the rights that power companies are granted over land in respect of poles and power lines. The Court of Appeal (at 616) referred to the English decision of Newcastle-under-Lyme Corp v Wolstanton, Ltd \[ 1946\] 2 All ER 447: In the case of a right-of-way, there is merely the right of passage, but here is a de jure occupation—physical occupation of a piece of land—and no inference is permitted in respect of the poles or power lines, the right being statutory. The plaintiff Board is a licensee with substantially exclusive rights to part of the soil; and occupation is a question of fact .... \[Emphasis added\] 123. The decision in Newcastle-under-Lyme concerned whether a gas company had an exclusive right of occupation of the land through which its pipes or cables passed that would enable it to sue for nuisance. It was held that the company did. In reaching its decision, the court considered (at 454) the status of gas companies (and the like) as occupiers of the land for rating purposes: It is to be observed that in all the rating cases the question before the court was whether the subject sought to be rated was an “occupier of lands” within the meaning of the Poor Relief Act, 1601. As regards the word “lands” the effect of the cases has been to give a wide interpretation to it; and as regards the word “occupier” the effect has been to establish that the question is one of fact— whether (to state the matter briefly and without attempting a definition) the subject sought to be rated was in de facto possession to the substantial exclusion of any enjoyment of the land by others and in circumstances importing some degree of permanence. It has been clearly laid down that the question is not a matter of title and does not depend upon title. In the words of Lord Russell of Killowen (\[1936\] 2 All ER 322, at p 329), in the Westminster City case: '... it is immaterial whether the title to occupy is attributable to a lease, a licence, or an easement.' I cite also the language of Wightman J (1 E & E 716, at p 720) in the West Middlesex Waterworks case, which was quoted with approval by Lord Davey (\[1895\] AC 117, at p 132) in the Halkyn Drainage case: '... the first question is whether the company are rateable for their mains, which are laid under the surface of the highway, without any freehold or leasehold interest in the soil thereof being vested in the company. We think they are. These mains are fixed capital vested in land. The company is in possession of the mains buried in the soil, and so is de facto in possession of that space in the soil which the mains fill, for a purpose beneficial to itself. The decisions are uniform in holding gas companies to be rateable in respect of their mains, although the occupation of such mains may be de facto merely, and without any legal or equitable estate in the land where the mains lie, by force of some statute.' \[Emphasis added\] 124. This decision makes it clear that to be an occupier for rating purposes it was not necessary for the occupier to have a legal estate in the land. Instead it was sufficient to be in de facto possession to the substantial exclusion of any enjoyment of the land by others. In the Commissioner’s view this is essentially the same test as is provided for in the definition of “possession”. 125. The court in Newcastle-under-Lyme followed the approach to rating occupiers of land as it was explained by Lord Russell of Killowen in the House of Lords decision of Westminster City v Southern Railway Co \[1936\] 2 All ER 322. That case concerned premises at Victoria Station in London. The question was whether the premises (including shops, stalls, a bank, kiosks, and the like) were “so let out as to be capable of separate assessment” for rates purposes. It was held that the occupiers of the 22 premises had sufficient de facto and exclusive occupation of the premises to be assessed for rates as occupiers. 126. Lord Russell of Killowen commented that sometimes more than one person may have claims to the use or occupancy of premises (eg, a landlord and a tenant). He said (at 326): The question in every such case must be one of fact, - namely, whose position in relation to occupation is paramount, and whose position in relation to occupation is subordinate; but, in my opinion, the question must be considered and answered in regard to the position and rights of the parties in respect of the premises in question, and in regard to the purpose of the occupation of those premises. 127. He gave the example of a lodger in a lodging house not being treated as an occupier for rating purposes. While Lord Russell acknowledged that this was a pragmatic result, he noted sound legal reasons also existed for the decision (at 327): But it can I think be justified and explained when we remember that the landlord, who is the person held to be rateable, is occupying the whole premises for the purpose of his business of letting lodgings, that for the purpose of that business he has a continual right of access to the lodgers’ rooms, and that he, in fact, retains the control of ingress and egress to and from the lodging house, notwithstanding that the power of ingress and egress at all hours, is essential to the lodger. The general principle applicable to the cases where persons occupy parts of a larger hereditament seems to be that if the owner of the hereditament (being also in occupation by himself or his servants) retains to himself general control over the occupied parts, the owner will be treated as being in rateable occupation; if he retains to himself no control, the occupiers of the various parts will be treated as in rateable occupation of those parts. \[Emphasis added\] 128. Lord Russell then noted that this principle had been applied in cases other than lodgers. He referred to cases involving ships using wharves to load and unload cargo. He noted that each case depends on its facts and an examination of the degree of control the landlord or owner can exercise to interfere with the occupier’s enjoyment of the premises. 129. It is interesting to consider the similarities between the issues addressed by Lord Russell and those being considered in these Rulings. Lord Russell of Killowen’s analysis can be read as suggesting that an occupier for rating purposes is a person who is in fact or effect enjoying the use of the relevant land to the substantial exclusion of all others, and in particular the owner. When read this way, it is similar to the definition of “possession” in s YA 1. The English cases clarify that when an owner (or landlord) occupies the land along with a “tenant”, then the dominant occupier needs to be established for rating purposes. This is determined by considering whether the owner retains such a degree of control over the land that it interferes with the tenant’s enjoyment of the land so the tenant is prevented from enjoying a use of the land that is substantially exclusive. Reading definition of “possession” as a whole 130. Having considered the separate elements of the definition of “possession”, it is now appropriate to consider the definition of “possession” in s YA 1 as a whole: ... a use that is in fact or effect substantially exclusive 131. In the Commissioner’s view a person’s use of the land will be substantially exclusive when to all intents and purposes, or in the main, no other person (including the owner) has (or retains) a competing right to use the same land. 23 132. In the context of car parks and the FBT on -premises exclusion, in most situations “possession” will be established by determining whether, in granting a right to use the land for parking, anyone else, including the owner of the land or car park operator has (or retains) a degree of control over the land such that it prevents the employer from having, to all intents and purposes, exclusive use of the land. If someone else, including the owner or car park operator, does have or retain such a degree of control over the parking spaces then the employer will not have a substantially exclusive right to use the land and the car parks will not be the premises of the employer. 133. When establishing whether a use of land is substantially exclusive account is to be taken of what is actually occurring between the parties and to the actual effect of any agreement between the parties. It does not matter whether the employer’s use does not satisfy the concept of “legal possession” at common law, but it must be substantially exclusive. 134. In the Commissioner’s view this interpretation of the definition of “possession” is consistent with the purpose of the definition as explained by the Supreme Court in Yule. 135. The Commissioner also thinks her interpretation of the definition of “premises of a person” when read as a whole is consistent with the natural and ordinary meaning of the words “premises of the employer”. The Supreme Court of Western Australia considered the phrase “premises of an employer” in Molina v Zaknich (2001) 125 A Crim R 401. Molina concerned, among other things, access by union officials to an employer’s premises. Hasluck J held that the natural and ordinary meaning of the phrase “premises of an employer” refers to a site under the control of the employer. The Commissioner considers this is consistent with her interpretation of the definition. Absence of word “licence” from definitions 136. In forming her view, the Commissioner considers it is significant the term “licence” is not explicitly included in s CX 23, in para (a) of the definition of “lease” (although it is expressly included in other parts of the definition of “lease”), or in the related definitions of “leasehold estate”, “estate”, “interest” or “possession”. (I t is noted that para (b)(i) of the definition of “estate” includes an example of a licence to occupy arising from a share in a flat or office owning company. The Commissioner does not consider this very specific example to be in any way suggestive that licences to occupy in general are included within the definition of “estate”.) 137. It is generally acknowledged for common law purposes that a clear distinction exists between a lease and licence, and that legally the two concepts are mutually exclusive. If Parliament had intended for all licences to be treated as leases, then it would have explicitly provided for this as it has in other situations. Alternative views 138. The Commissioner is aware of possible counter-arguments suggesting that all car parking spaces provided by an employer for employees should be treated as being the employers “premises” under s CX 23(2)(a). 139. There is an argument that the word “include” in the definition of “premises of a person” in s CX 23(2)(a) should be interpreted non-exhaustively, so that any car parks that are licenced by employers can be included as an 24 employer’s premises. The Commissioner accepts that the word “include” normally indicates an inclusive definition. However, as noted above, the Commissioner considers the better view, in this context, is to interpret “include” in the definition of “premises of a person” exhaustively. In the Commissioner’s view such an interpretation is supported by: • the intended purpose of the FBT rules; • the construction of the definition of “premises of a person” in s CX 23(2); • the nature of the “class” of items in s CX 23(2)(a); and • the implication that if Parliament had intended the class to be broader than premises that are owned or leased it could have explicitly provided for it. 140. Another counter-argument is that the definition of “lease”, as extended by the definition of “possession”, supports all licences being included as “leases”. However, in the Commissioner’s view, when the definition of “possession” is interpreted in light of its text and its purpose, an employer will only have substantially exclusive use of the car park when they have a substantial degree of control over the car park. Without such a degree of control, the Commissioner does not consider that the car park is “leased” for the purposes of the definition of “premises of a person”. Conclusions 141. The premises of an employer include car parks owned or leased by the employer. The premises of an employer are not restricted to business premises of the employer. 142. When determining whether premises are leased by an employer, regard must be had to the relevant definitions in s YA 1 of “lease”, “estate”, “leasehold estate” and “possession”. 143. At common law (and for the purposes of the general definition of “estate” in para (a) of the definition), land is leased when the employer has legal possession of the land to the exclusion of all others, including the owner. Where an employer is granted something less than exclusive possession of the land (such as a licence to occupy the land) there is no lease at common law or for the purposes of the general definition of “estate”. 144. Paragraph (b) of the definition of “estate” extends the general definition of “estate” to include a right to possession of the land. “Possession” is defined as a right to use the land that is in fact or effect substantially exclusive. 145. The premises of an employer will not usually include a car park that an employer is merely licensed to use, unless the employer’s right to use the car park is in fact or effect substantially exclusive. 146. An employer will have a right to use a car park that is in fact or effect substantially exclusive when no-one else (including the owner, the car park operator, or any third party) has a competing right to use the car park premises that could be said to prevent the employer from enjoying a use that is substantially exclusive. 147. Sometimes when an owner or landlord is operating their business from the land that they have granted rights over, they will seek to retain some degree of control over the land (eg, the owner of a lodging house or a port 25 company over its wharves). In the context of car parking, if the owner or the car park operator retains a degree of control over the relevant car park that might be sufficient to prevent the employer from enjoying substantially exclusive use of that park. 148. In the Commissioner’s view the words “in fact” in the definition of “possession” extend the common law concept of “possession” to include situations where the user is actually controlling the land without the requisite legal exclusive right to possession. 149. The Commissioner considers the reference to “in effect” in the definition of “possession” emphasises the need to have regard to the substance of the arrangement in law between the parties. These words do not extend but reflect the common law in this regard. The words “in effect” may also cover the situation where a lessee may not in fact be exercising their right to possession, despite being legally entitled to do so. 150. Therefore, when determining whether an employer has substantially exclusive use of the land it is not the legal form of the arrangements that is decisive but the substance of the arrangements demonstrated either through the fact of what is actually occurring or through the effect of the true arrangements between the parties. 151. The Commissioner accepts that the definition of “lease” for the purposes of s CX 23 is wider than the common law meaning of “lease” as it includes a car park which the employer has a right to use that is in fact or effect substantially exclusive. However, the Commissioner does not consider this to mean every right to use a car park will be a “lease” for tax purposes. Many car parking arrangements will continue to fall outside the definition of “lease” for the purposes of s CX 23. Examples 152. The following examples illustrate the way in which an employer’s overall arrangement with a car park owner or operator needs to be considered to determine if the employer has a right to use a car park that is in fact or effect substantially exclusive. The conclusions in the examples are based on the facts as stated. It is important to bear in mind that every situation is different, and the different features of parking arrangements may result in different FBT outcomes. In each example it is assumed that the provision of a car park by the employer to its employee is a benefit for FBT purposes. Example 1 – Leased car parks on vacant land adjacent to business 153. Diane provides some of her employees with car parks on vacant land across the road from the property from which she carries on her business. Diane is the lessee of that land under an enforceable and written lease agreement with the owner of the land. 154. Because the rights granted to Diane under the agreement are enforceable against third parties, she has exclusive possession of the land, and the definition of “lease” for the purposes of establishing the “premises of a person” is satisfied. The car parks Diane provides to her employees are excluded from being a “fringe benefit” by s CX 23, and so no FBT is payable in respect of the car parks. Diane does not have to carry on her business on the leased land for the exclusion to apply. 26 Example 2 – Allocated parking under a lease agreement with a group company 155. Eastern City Limited, a company in the same group as Eastern Port Limited, enters into a deed of lease with Wharf St Developments Limited, a company that provides parking in a car parking building. Under the arrangement, Eastern City is granted a lease of 12 parking spaces. The parking spaces are identified on a plan of the car park, and the plan is attached to the lease agreement. The parking spaces cannot be changed unless a new deed of lease or a variation of lease is executed. 156. Under the deed of lease Eastern City is responsible for monitoring and requesting removal of any unauthorised cars that park in its parking spaces. Eastern City is restricted to using the car parks for parking cars, but can approach Wharf St Developments to make improvements to the car parks, or arrange for other types of vehicles to use the parks, which Wharf St Developments cannot unreasonably deny. 157. The Commissioner considers that in these circumstances the car parks are the premises of Eastern City, because Eastern City in fact and effect has a right to use the car parks that is substantially exclusive. 158. Employees of Eastern Port, a company in the same group as Eastern City, use the car parks for parking while at work. The car parking benefit provided by Eastern Port to its employees will be used or consumed on the premises of Eastern City, a company in the same group as Eastern Port, so the exclusion in s CX 23 applies and no FBT is payable in respect of the car parks. Example 3 – Allocated parking in a commercial car park 159. Southern City Limited wants to provide parking in a commercial car park for 50 of its employees. It enters into a standard month-by-month agreement with a commercial car park operator close to Southern City’s office. 160. Under the agreement 50 parking spaces in the commercial car park are allocated to Southern City’s employees for them to park in from 7am to 7pm Monday to Friday. These car parks are each marked with a sign that reads “Reserved for Southern City 7am to 7pm Mon-Fri ”. Southern City is issued with 50 access cards enabling the cardholders to access the car park between those hours. Under the terms of the agreement, if an unauthorised person parks in one of Southern City’s car parking spaces during those hours, Southern City has the right to request the car park operator remove the vehicle. The car park operator is only able to re- allocate Southern City’s car parks or alter the hours of access with Southern City’s prior agreement. 161. The Commissioner considers that in these circumstances the car parks are the premises of Southern City. This is because the employer in fact has a right to use the car parks that is substantially exclusive during the agreed period. No-one else, including the car park operator, has a competing right to use the reserved car parks at those times. As a result the exclusion in s CX 23 applies and no FBT is payable in respect of Southern City’s car parks. The Commissioner considers the same result would apply regardless of the number of car parks “leased” by Southern City. 27 Example 4 – Allocated parking floor 162. Coastal City Limited has many employees who use parking facilities provided by a nearby commercial car park. It decides there are enough employees that need parking that it could use the whole top floor of the car park. The proprietor of the commercial car park agrees to install a card access gate so that only Coastal City’s employees can use the top floor. A car parking agreement is prepared using the proprietor’s standard-form licence agreement. Signage is erected identifying the floor as being reserved for Costal City’s employees’ use. 163. The Commissioner considers that in these circumstances the top floor of the car parking building is the premises of Coastal City even though under the agreement Coastal City is only licensed to use the parks. This is because the employer in fact has a right to use the top floor of the building that is substantially exclusive. The car park proprietor retains only a minimal degree of control over the floor. No-one else has a competing right to use the floor. As a result the exclusion in s CX 23 applies and no FBT is payable in respect of the parking on the top floor. Example 5 – Unallocated parking in commercial car park 164. Northern City Limited wants to provide parking in a commercial car park for three of its employees. It enters into a one year agreement with a commercial car park operator close to Northern City’s office. The agreement is described as a lease however no particular parking spaces are designated for Northern City’s employees. Instead the car park operator has set aside some parking spaces in a reserved area of the car park to be shared with other businesses. Three parking spaces will always be available for Northern City’s employees in the reserved area, although not the same spaces every time. 165. The Commissioner considers that neither the car park, nor any part of it, is the premises of Northern City. Despite the agreement being called a lease, the parking spaces are not owned or leased by Northern City, because Northern City (and its employees) cannot be said to have in fact or effect a use of specific parking spaces that is substantially exclusive. Other authorised business users of the car park can also park in the reserved area, sharing the same spaces at the same time they are made available to Northern City. Northern City simply has permission to enter and use the reserved area of the car park with no substantially exclusive right to use any particular car parking space. Northern City has no right to arrange for vehicles to be removed from the car parking spaces in the reserved area. 166. The provision of car parking by Northern City to its three employees is not excluded from being a “fringe benefit” by s CX 23(2)(a). As a result FBT may be payable in respect of the car parks. Example 6 – Prepaid parking in a public car park 167. Sunny Gifts, a retail store in a busy tourist town, provides parking for two of its employees in an open air public car park behind the town’s main street. The car park is open to the public on an hourly fee-basis, however store owners can purchase parking permits for workers. The permits are displayed in the front windscreen of the car and entitle the holder to all- day parking every day. There are no designated spaces in the car park for parking permit holders. 28 168. The provision of car parking by Sunny Gifts to its two employees is not excluded from being a “fringe benefit” by s CX 23(2)(a). The Commissioner considers neither the car park, nor any part of it, to be the premises of Sunny Gifts. As a result FBT may be payable in respect of the car parks. 29 References Expired Ruling(s) BR Pub 99/6 Car parks provided by employers - fringe benefit tax exemption Subject references Car park; fringe benefit; fringe benefit tax; possession; premises Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007, ss CX 2, CX 23, YA 1 Case references Dilworth v Commissioner of Stamps (1899) NZPCC 578 (PC) Fatac Ltd (in liq) v CIR \[2002\] 3 NZLR 648 Gardiner v Sevenoaks Rural District Council \[1950\] 2 All ER 84 Glenwood Lumber Co Ltd v Phillips \[1904\] AC 405 Grandi v Milburn \[1966\] 2 All ER 816 Harley v CIR \[1971\] NZLR 482 (CA) Hutt Valley Electric-Power Board v Lower Hutt City Corp \[1949\] NZLR 611 (CA) Jolly v Palmer \[1985\] 1 NZLR 658 Maunsell v Olins \[1975\] 1 All ER 16 McKenna v Porter Motors Ltd \[1955\] NZLR 832 Merrill v Wilson \[1900\] 1 QB 35 (CA) Molina v Zaknich (2001) 125 A Crim R 401 (SC WA) Newcastle-under-Lyme Corp v Wolstanton Ltd \[1946\] 2 All ER 447 National Car Parks Ltd v Trinity \[2001\] 2 EGLR 43 Northern Hotel IUOW v Bay of Islands College Board of Trustees \[1991\] 1 ERNZ 710 Police v Thompson \[1966\] NZLR 813 Plato v Ashton (CA 25/84, 1 October 1984) R v Lloyd \[1965\] 1 QB 175 Radaich v Smith (1959) 101 CLR 209 Simpson v ACC (Decision 206-2009, AI 250- 04) Street v Mountford \[1985\] 2 All ER 289 (HL) Troon Place Investments Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,175 Western Australia v Ward \[2002\] 213 CLR 1 (HCA) Westminster City v Southern Railway Co \[1936\] 2 All ER 322 Whitley v Stumbles \[1930\] AC 544 Whitsbury Farm and Stud Ltd v Hemens (Valuation Officer) \[1988\] AC 601 (HL) Yule v Commissioner of Taxes \[1918\] NZLR 890 (SC) Other references Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed, West Publishing, 1990) Concise Oxford Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, 2011) Public Information Bulletin No 136 (May 1985) Recognising Salary Trade-offs as Income (officials’ issues paper, Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue and the Treasury, April 2012). http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/20 12-ip-salary-tradeoffs-income/overview Rewriting the Income Tax Act 1994 (exposure draft, Inland Revenue, 2001). http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/20 01-dd-rewrite-exposure-draft/overview Streamlining the Taxation of Fringe Benefits (government discussion document, Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, December 2003). http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/20 03-dd-fringe-benefit-tax/overview 30 Appendix – Legislation 1.

GOODS AND SERVICES TAX – LOCAL AUTHORITY RATES APPORTIONMENTS ON PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS WHERE THE RATES ARE IN ARREARS – IMPLICATIONS FOR VENDOR PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 16/03 This is a public ruling made under s 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss 8 and 10 and the definition of “consideration” in s 2(1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the sale and purchase of real estate between a GST- registered vendor and a GST-registered or unregistered purchaser. The local authority rates for the property are in arrears on the settlement date and the parties have agreed that the purchaser will pay the outstanding amount. The vendor is supplying the property in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity. Because the rates are in arrears and the parties have agreed that the purchaser will pay the outstanding amount to the local authority, the settlement statement provides a credit to the purchaser for the vendor’s share of the outstanding amount. Section 14(1)(d) does not apply to the supply of the property. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows:  Where the vendor allows a credit against the purchase price for unpaid rates, the consideration (as defined in s 2(1)) for the vendor’s supply of the property to the purchaser is the amount received by the vendor from the purchaser (being the purchase price less the credit against the purchase price), together with the amount of the outstanding local authority rates that the purchaser has agreed to discharge.  Under s 8, GST is chargeable on the supply of the property by a registered vendor by reference to the value of the supply.

Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 8 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR Pub 16/01 to BR Pub 16/04 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Rulings BR Pub 16/01, BR Pub 16/02, BR Pub 16/03 a nd BR Pub 16/04 (“the Rulings”). All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. Summary 1. The Rulings address the question of how apportionments of local authority rates made in property transactions should be treated for GST. BR Pub 16/01 and BR Pub 16/02 apply to situations where the rates have been prepaid by the vendor beyond the settlement date. BR Pub 16/03 and BR Pub 16/04 apply to situations where the local authority rates for the property are in arrears on the settlement date and the parties have agreed that the purchaser will pay the outstanding rates, in exchange for a credit against the settlement amount for the vendor’s share of the outstanding rates. BR Pub 16/01 and BR Pub 16/03 consider the GST implications for the vendor. BR Pub 16/02 and BR Pub 16/04 consider the GST implications for the purchaser. 2. This commentary explains the conclusions reached in the Rulings. After providing a brief introduction and setting out the relevant legislation, this commentary discusses:  Consideration for a supply: This part of the commentary discusses key principles regarding “consideration” – namely that “consideration” has a wide meaning and that a statutory obligation to a third party does not amount to “consideration”.  GST treatment of transactions where the rates are prepaid: This part of the commentary explains the GST treatment where the rates have been prepaid beyond settlement. It explains that the payment of the rates apportionment to the vendor by the purchaser forms part of the total consideration for the supply of the property.  GST treatment of transactions where the rates are in arrears: This part of the commentary explains the GST treatment where the rates are in arrears at settlement and the vendor allows a credit against the purchase price for unpaid rates. It explains that the consideration for the vendor’s supply of the property to the purchaser is the amount received by the vendor from the purchaser (being the purchase price less the credit against the purchase price), together with the amount of the outstanding local authority rates that the purchaser has agreed to discharge. 3. After the legal analysis, the commentary provides examples of a range of different property sale situations. The examples include discussion of how the Rulings apply to each situation, as well as model settlement statements and tax invoices. 4. The relevant legislation is set out in the appendix to the Rulings. 9 Background 5. Section 5(7) requires local authorities to charge GST on rates. 6. Local authorities (that is, city and district councils and some regional councils) charge ratepayers rates in advance under the Local Government (Rating) Act 2002. On the sale and purchase of land, a vendor may pass on to a purchaser the amount of rates that relate to the period of the purchaser’s occupation of the land. Apportionment is usually provided for in the sale and purchase contract. 7. Confusion exists about whether the GST-inclusive or GST-exclusive rates amount should be apportioned and whether vendors should seek to recover a GST-inclusive rates amount from purchasers. The Rulings, and this commentary, seek to remove this confusion by explaining the effect of the rates apportionment on the amount of consideration the vendor receives. 8. The Rulings are reissues of BR Pub 10/10–10/13, which expired on 23 September 2015 (the expired rulings). The Rulings and commentary are essentially the same as the expired rulings. However, certain legislative amendments enacted after the expired rulings were issued affect the Rulings or commentary or both. The two main legislative changes to note are:  The definition of “input tax” in s 3A has been amended to remove the “principal purpose” test. It has been replaced with a new “use, or available for use” test under s 20(3C). That section, introduced from 1 April 2011, provides that input tax may be deducted to the extent to which the goods or services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies. BR Pub 16/02 and BR Pub 16/04, and the relevant examples, accordingly refer to the new “use, or available for use” test in the Act, rather than the previous “principal purpose” test.  Section 11(1)(mb) applies to supplies made on or after 1 April 2011. It zero-rates supplies consisting wholly or partly of land if: - both the vendor and the purchaser are GST registered; and - the purchaser intends to use the goods for making taxable supplies; and - the purchaser does not intend to use the land as a principal place of residence for themselves or any relative (as determined under s 2A(1)(c)). In determining the tax treatment of the supply of land, the vendor may rely on the written statement that the purchaser is required to give them under s 78F. The statement must address the three points set out above and must also provide the purchaser’s registration number. The commentary and the relevant examples in the Rulings reflect the application of s 11(1)(mb). Application of the Legislation 9. This part of the commentary explains the reasoning behind the Rulings. It begins by outlining some general principles regarding “consideration”. Following this, it discusses the two different situations to which the Rulings apply – where rates are prepaid and where rates are in arrears. Finally, the 10 commentary considers the effect of ss 11(1)(mb), 11(1)(m) and 5(15) on the application of the Rulings. Consideration for a supply Wide definition of “consideration” 10. “Consideration” is very widely defined in the Act. The definition of “consideration” in s 2(1) includes any payment made, whether by the recipient of the supply or by any other person. Therefore, c onsideration is not limited to payments made by the recipient of the supply. 11. Case law has also established that:  It is not crucial that the payment be made to the supplier; it is sufficient that the payment (or any act of forbearance if that were relevant) be made in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of the supply. Accordingly, if A makes a supply of goods and services to B and in response, at the request of A, B pays an amount of money to C, then there is still an amount of consideration for the supply of goods and services.  Consideration may be voluntary or involuntary.  The statutory meaning of “consideration” is wider than the contract law meaning.  For a payment to be “consideration” there must, however, be a sufficient relationship between the making of the payment and the supply of goods and services. Statutory obligation to a third party does not amount to “consideration” 12. Although “consideration” is a wide concept, case law has established that where the recipient of a supply is required by law to undertake an obligation to a third party, then any discharge of that obligation by the recipient is not the provision of consideration for the supply. Conversely, where the recipient has no such statutory obligation, then any discharge of the obligation by the recipient is part of the consideration for the supply: The Trustee, Executors and Agency Co NZ Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,076 (HC); Iona Farm Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,261 (HC). 13. In Trustee, Executors and Agency Co, the High Court found that the payment of rates by a lessee was part of the consideration for the supply of land by way of lease. An important part of that conclusion was Chisholm J’s finding that the lessor trust was the occupier of the farm property. Therefore, the lessor trust was primarily liable for rates levied against the farm. The lessee had no statutory obligation to pay the rates. Therefore, the lessee’s payment of the rates to the local authority was a payment on behalf of the trust and was part of the consideration for the supply. 14. In the later decision of the High Court in Iona Farm Ltd, Young J found that the open market rental (the relevant concept for determining the consideration for the supply in that case) for a farm exceeded the GST registration threshold. The threshold was exceeded without taking into account any rates that the lessee was paying. Even so, his Honour noted that the Commissioner had sought to suggest that the rates that the lease required the lessees to pay should be treated as part of the consideration for the lease, relying on the decision in Trustee, Executors and Agency Co. His Honour noted that the lease in Iona Farm was for a period longer than 11 12 months, so the primary rating liability lay on the lessee (and not the lessor). In that respect, the case was distinguishable from the Trustee, Executors and Agency Co case. Accordingly, because the lessee already had a legal obligation under statute to pay the rates, agreeing to pay them in an agreement with the lessor could not be consideration for the supply. Where the rates are prepaid 15. The Commissioner considers that apportionments of prepaid rates are a part of the consideration for the vendor’s supply of land. 16. A sale of land is a supply of goods for GST purposes. As a matter of contract, the vendor and purchaser can agree to any price for the land (including any apportionments). The Agreement for Sale and Purchase of Real Estate (9th edition, 2012), approved by the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand and Auckland District Law Society, is widely used in property transactions. It records the purchase price that the parties have agreed on for the property. The Agreement provides at cl 3.5 that the vendor shall prepare a “settlement statement”. This is defined in cl 1.1(21) as follows: a statement showing the purchase price plus any GST payable by the purchaser in addition to the purchase price, less any deposit or other payments or allowances to be credited to the purchaser, together with apportionments of all incomings and outgoings apportioned at the possession date. 17. The settlement statement usually records the apportionment of rates that the parties have agreed on. Such an apportionment is an amount to be paid in addition to the purchase price recorded in the Agreement. It forms part of the consideration the purchaser provides to obtain the property from the vendor. 18. Clause 3.8 of the Agreement requires that the purchaser shall pay the balance of the purchase price, interest and “other moneys”, if any, on the settlement date. The Commissioner considers that any rates apportionments recorded on the settlement statement are “other moneys”. 19. Another widely used agreement is the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand Inc Agreement for Buying and Selling Real Estate (REINZ Agreement). Clause 23.1 of the REINZ Book of Standard Clauses accompanying the REINZ Agreement similarly states that: A settlement statement must include, among other things: • the price • the amount of the price already paid (including the deposit) • adjustments for any outgoings like rates (but not insurance premiums) • adjustments for any incomings like rent • the GST that must be paid (if any) • the amount due on settlement. 20. The Commissioner considers that the payment of rates apportionments by the purchaser to the vendor forms part of the consideration for a single supply. Rates apportionments are paid in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of the supply of land. An agreement to apportion rates does not create a supply to the purchaser from the vendor separate from the supply of the real property. This is because no good or service, separate from the real property, is furnished or provided to the purchaser by the vendor for that payment. 12 21. Although the purchaser may experience a benefit from the vendor paying the rates for a period in which the purchaser will own the property, that benefit is not a supply. For there to be a supply, there must be a supply of something. Here the purchaser has no liability to pay rates until they are personally sent a rates assessment and/or invoice for the property. The vendor has not supplied to the purchaser a forbearance from having to pay rates, since the purchaser never had an obligation to pay those rates. Therefore, the vendor cannot make such a supply to them. Furthermore, if the purchaser receives a benefit (of not having to pay rates), that benefit is gained only because the vendor complied with their statutory obligation and not because the purchaser paid a rates apportionment. The purchaser would have received the benefit even if the purchaser did not pay the rates apportionment. 22. As the payment from the purchaser to the vendor reflecting the apportionment of prepaid rates is a payment in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of the single supply of land, the payment increases the “consideration” and value of the supply for GST purposes. Accordingly, GST should be charged on the amount of that apportionment received by a GST-registered vendor. 23. The purchaser can claim an input tax deduction (to the extent to which the property is used for, or is available for use in, making taxable supplies) if they are entitled to an input tax deduction for the other consideration paid. Where the rates are in arrears The Local Government (Rating) Act 2002 24. A purchaser’s liability for rates that are in arrears is a contingent liability. That is, the vendor has primary responsibility for rates invoiced during the time the vendor owns the property. Only in the event of the vendor’s default would the purchaser be pursued for those rates. This is important because the existence or non-existence of a statutory obligation on the purchaser to pay an amount can affect whether payment of that amount gives rise to consideration for a supply. The continued existence of a primary liability on a vendor means the purchaser can give value to the vendor by agreeing to discharge the vendor’s liability. If the liability is solely on the purchaser to meet an obligation, then no such consideration can be given to the vendor when the purchaser discharges that liability. 25. The Local Government (Rating) Act 2002 (“LGRA”) states that a local authority can charge rates (ss 13–20 of the LGRA) and, where rates are charged, those rates are to be paid by the ratepayer (s 12 of the LGRA). The ratepayer is the person listed in the rating information database and the district valuation roll (s 10 of the LGRA). This is usually the owner or the lessee (s 11 of the LGRA). 26. When the rates are assessed, the ratepayer is given notice of their rates liability by a rates assessment: s 44 of the LGRA. If rates are due for a particular period, then the ratepayer is sent a rates invoice: s 46 of the LGRA. The rates invoice also includes a due date (s 46 of the LGRA). Both the rates assessment and the rates invoice name the ratepayer who is liable for the rates (ss 45 and 46 of the LGRA). 27. Therefore, if the vendor is the ratepayer, the vendor will be sent the rates assessment and rates invoice and be liable for the rates. Because the vendor is named as the ratepayer and receives the rates assessment and rates invoice, the vendor remains liable for those rates until they are paid. 13 If the vendor sells their property, they must notify the local authority of the sale within one month (s 31 of the LGRA) and the vendor will remain liable for the rates that are due while the vendor is listed as the ratepayer. Section 34 of the LGRA states: Notice given under sections 31 to 33 does not release any person from liability for any rates that are due before the notice is given. 28. However, while the vendor may be liable for rates that were charged before the sale of the property that remained unpaid when the property was sold, the new purchaser can also become responsible for the unpaid rates. A purchaser can become liable for the rates because the rates are a charge on the land (s 59 of the LGRA) and the charge survives a sale of the property concerned. Analysis 29. There is only one supply by the vendor where rates are in arrears – the supply of the property. The question is whether the discharge of the rates by the purchaser can be consideration for the supply of the property by the vendor. 30. Case law establishes that a taxpayer’s fulfilment of their statutory obligation cannot amount to consideration for a supply from a supplier. However, in the context of the rating legislation the primary responsibility for discharging unpaid rates remains with the vendor, regardless of the sale of the property to the purchaser. The purchaser has only a contingent liability to pay the rates. It is contingent because, as the rates are a charge on the land, the local authority may, if unable to collect the rates from the vendor, seek payment by enforcing that charge on the land. In this sense, the purchaser is able to give consideration for the supply of the property by the vendor by offering to discharge the unpaid rates as part of the bargain for the property. In such a case, the purchaser is not simply fulfilling its statutory obligation, as that obligation is only contingent. Such a discharge of rates, by virtue of a contract between vendor and purchaser, can be consideration for the supply of the property. 31. Where the vendor allows a deduction from the settlement amount in return for a promise by the purchaser to discharge the unpaid local authority rates, the overall consideration received by the vendor from the purchaser is made up of three elements:  the purchase price;  the credit of the vendor’s share of the unpaid rates against the purchase price; and  the total amount of the vendor’s liability to the local authority that the purchaser has agreed to discharge. 32. That is, the consideration for the vendor’s supply is made up of the actual monetary consideration received by the vendor from the purchaser and the discharge of the vendor’s liability to the local authority. 33. The amount of the vendor’s liability to the local authority that the purchaser has agreed to discharge, less the credit of the vendor’s share of the unpaid rates against the purchase price, will generally equal the purchaser’s share of the unpaid rates. This means that the consideration remains the same as in a “prepaid rates” situation, being equal to the purchase price plus the purchaser’s share of the rates. The difference between the “prepaid rates” and “rates in arrears” situations is that where rates are prepaid, the 14 consideration is the total amount paid by the purchaser to the vendor; whereas, where rates are in arrears, the consideration is the total amount paid by the purchaser to the vendor and to the local authority. 34. This is consistent with the definition of “consideration” in s 2(1). That definition includes any payment made “in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of” the supply of any goods and services, but does not require the payment to be made to the supplier. Sections 11(1)(mb) and 11(1)(m) of the GST Act 35. Section 11(1)(mb) zero-rates a sale of land where the supply is between registered persons and wholly or partly consists of land that the purchaser intends to use for making taxable supplies (s 11(1)(mb)). 36. If for some reason the supply of land is not covered by s 11(1)(mb), s 11(1)(m) might apply to zero-rate the supply of the land if it is a taxable activity, or part of a taxable activity, that is a going concern. 37. The effect of the zero-rating provisions of ss (11)(1)(mb) and 11(1)(m) is that the rates apportionment, since it forms part of the consideration for the supply of a zero-rated property, will also be zero-rated. Section 5(15) of the GST Act 38. If the property being transferred is to be used by the purchaser in a taxable activity and the property also includes a house (for example, farm land that includes a house), s 5(15) deems the house (not being a commercial dwelling) to be a separate supply from the supply of the land in certain circumstances. 39. The effect of s 5(15) is that GST is charged (at either the standard rate or, if ss 11(1)(mb) or 11(1)(m) apply, at zero percent) only on the commercial supply (that is, the farm land) and not on the residential supply (that is, the house). The rates apportionment, since it forms part of the consideration for the property, will be divided between the dwelling and the land. One possible method for dividing the rates apportionment between the dwelling and the land is given in Example 7 in \[89\] to \[98\]. Examples 40. This part of the commentary discusses seven different land sale examples and sets out the GST consequences of each scenario. Examples 1–3 are situations where the rates are prepaid, so they explain the application of BR Pub 16/01 and BR Pub 16/02. Examples 4-6 are situations where the rates are in arrears, so they explain the application of BR Pub 16/03 and BR Pub 16/04. Example 7 is a situation where s 5(15) applies. 41. Each example discusses the GST consequences of the transaction, shows a sample settlement statement and, if applicable, shows a sample tax invoice. The sample settlement statements and tax invoices are not prescriptive; they are examples of how these documents might be drafted. Situations where rates are prepaid Assumptions underpinning Examples 1–3 42. The GST position for rates paid in advance is illustrated in the property sale examples that follow. In Examples 1–3 assume the following: 15  The vendor is selling property to the purchaser.  The purchase price the parties have agreed is $400,000 (plus GST, if any). The purchaser has paid a deposit of $40,000.  The settlement date is 26 April 2015.  The vendor has paid the local authority rates in advance to 30 June 2015.  The annual rating liability to the local authority is $2,518.50 (inclusive of $328.50 of GST).  The amount of rates relating to the period of the purchaser’s occupation of the land is $448.50 (inclusive of $58.50 of GST). This amount is payable by the purchaser to the vendor under the agreement for sale and purchase of the land. Example 1: Sale by an unregistered vendor 43. An unregistered vendor is not entitled to an input tax deduction for the rates they have paid in advance to the local authority. The supply of the property will not be a taxable supply for GST purposes. 44. In the absence of a provision in the Property Law Act 2007 or elsewhere, the amount of the apportionment is a matter for negotiation between the vendor and purchaser. Usually, however, the vendor would wish to recover the full GST-inclusive amount of $448.50. 45. The total consideration paid by the purchaser and received by the vendor would be $400,448.50. 46. If the purchaser is unregistered, the Act does not allow an input tax deduction. 47. If the purchaser is registered and entitled to a secondhand goods deduction on the overall property purchase, then the purchaser is able to claim an input tax deduction for the rates apportionment under s 20(3). However, the purchaser is only able to claim a secondhand goods deduction on the property purchase and the rates apportionment to the extent to which the property is used for , or is available for use in, making taxable supplies under s 20(3C). 16 48. The vendor’s settlement statement would be: Purchaser: Vendor: Settlement Date: 26 April 2015 ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price in accordance with contract 400,000.00 BY: Deposit paid 40,000.00 TO: Purchaser’s proportion of rates from 27/4/15 to 30/6/15 (65 days at $2,518.50 p/a) 448.50 BY: Balance required to settle 360,448.50 $400,448.50 $400,448.50 Amount required to settle on 26 April 2015 $360,448.50 49. The vendor is unregistered, so a GST tax invoice is not required. Example 2: Sale by a registered vendor – standard rate 50. In this example assume the following (in addition to the assumptions set out at \[42\]):  The vendor is selling the property to a purchaser who is: - unregistered; or - registered, but does not intend using the property for making taxable supplies; or - registered, but intends using the property as a principal place of residence for themselves or any of their relatives. 51. If the vendor can satisfy the requirements of s 20(3), the vendor will be able to claim an input tax deduction for the GST on the amount of annual rates they have prepaid to the local authority. 52. In this example, the supply of the land is in the course or furtherance of the vendor’s taxable activity, so it is a taxable supply on which the vendor must charge and return GST output tax. The consideration for the land itself will therefore be $400,000 plus $60,000 of output tax. The apportionment of the rates paid will also be part of the consideration for that supply. This part of the consideration will be $390 plus $58.50 of output tax, which the vendor must return to Inland Revenue. The total consideration for the supply will be $460,448.50. 53. If the purchaser is unregistered, the Act does not allow an input tax deduction. 54. If the purchaser is registered they will not be able to claim an input tax deduction, because the property will not be used for, or be available for use in, making taxable supplies. 55. The vendor would return GST output tax on the value of the supply of land (including the apportionments) and would issue a tax invoice to the purchaser inclusive of the apportionments. 17 56. The vendor’s settlement statement would be: Purchaser: Vendor: Settlement Date: 26 April 2015 ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price in accordance with contract 400,000.00 TO: GST as per tax invoice 60,058.50 BY: Deposit paid 40,000.00 TO: Purchaser’s proportion of rates from 27/4/15 to 30/6/15 (65 days at $2,190 p/a GST exclusive) 390.00 BY: Balance required to settle 420,448.50 $460,448.50 $460,448.50 Amount required to settle on 26 April 2015 $420,448.50 57. The vendor’s tax invoice would be: TAX INVOICE 23 April 2015 From: Vendor’s name GST number: XXX-XXX-XXX Vendor’s address To: Purchaser’s name Purchaser’s address ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price as per agreement $400,000.00 TO: Purchaser’s share of rates apportioned as at settlement date $390.00 TO: GST on total value of supply $60,058.50 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ $460,448.50 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Total GST: $60,058.50 Settlement date – 26 April 2015 Example 3: Sale by a registered vendor – zero-rated 58. As discussed at \[35\]–\[37\] above, a zero-rated sale of land arises under ss 11(1)(mb) or 11(1)(m). 59. If the vendor can satisfy the requirements of s 20(3), the vendor will be able to claim an input tax deduction for the GST on the amount of annual rates they have prepaid to the local authority. 18 60. In this situation, the apportionments on sale should be GST exclusive ($390) rather than inclusive ($448.50), which is consistent with zero-rating the supply of land. 61. The total consideration paid by the purchaser and received by the vendor would be $400,390. 62. As the sale is zero-rated, the purchaser cannot claim an input tax deduction for any element of the consideration for the property, including the rates apportionment. 63. The vendor’s settlement statement would be: Purchaser: Vendor: Settlement Date: 26 April 2015 ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price in accordance with contract 400,000.00 TO: GST as per tax invoice nil BY: Deposit paid 40,000.00 TO: Purchaser’s proportion of rates from 27/4/15 to 30/6/15 (65 days at $2,190 p/a GST exclusive) 390.00 BY: Balance required to settle 360,390.00 $400,390.00 $400,390.00 Amount required to settle on 26 April 2015 $360,390.00 64. The vendor’s tax invoice would be: TAX INVOICE 23 April 2015 From: Vendor’s name GST number: XXX-XXX-XXX Vendor’s address To: Purchaser’s name Purchaser’s address ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price as per agreement $400,000.00 TO: Purchaser’s share of rates apportioned as at settlement date $390.00 TO: GST – zero rated nil \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ $400,390.00 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Settlement date – 26 April 2015 19 Situations where the rates are in arrears Assumptions underpinning Examples 4–6 65. The GST position for rates in arrears is illustrated in the land sale examples that follow. In Examples 4–6 assume the following:  The vendor is selling property to the purchaser.  The purchase price the parties agreed is $400,000 (plus GST, if any). The purchaser has paid a deposit of $40,000.  The settlement date is 26 April 2015.  The vendor has not paid the local authority rates from 1 April 2015 (that is, the rates are in arrears for the current rating quarter).  The annual rating liability to the local authority is $2,518.50 (inclusive of $328.50 of GST).  The amount outstanding for the current quarter is $627.90 (inclusive of $81.90 of GST). Of this figure, the amount of rates relating to the period of the vendor’s occupation of the land is $179.40 (inclusive of $23.40 of GST).  The parties have agreed that the purchaser will discharge the unpaid rates in exchange for a deduction from the settlement amount for the amount of rates relating to the period of the vendor’s occupation of the land. Example 4: Sale by an unregistered vendor 66. In a sale by an unregistered vendor, the supply of the property will not be a taxable supply for GST purposes. 67. The amount of the credit against the purchase price is a matter for negotiation between the vendor and purchaser. In this example, the parties have agreed to a credit of the GST-inclusive amount of the vendor’s share of the rates: $179.40. This is a figure that is likely to be agreed to by two parties to an arm’s length transaction because using this figure puts both parties in the same position they would have been in if the vendor had paid the rates up until settlement and the purchaser had paid the rates from settlement onwards. 68. As discussed at \[31\] above, the consideration is made up of three elements. These elements are:  the purchase price: $400,000;  the credit of the vendor’s share of the unpaid rates against the purchase price: $179.40; and  the total amount of vendor’s liability to the local authority that the purchaser has agreed to discharge: $627.90. 69. Therefore, the total consideration for the supply will be $400,448.50. 70. If the purchaser is unregistered, the Act does not allow an input tax deduction for any element of the transaction. 20 71. If the purchaser is registered and can satisfy the requirements of s 20(3), the purchaser is able to claim a secondhand goods deduction for the property purchase. The consideration will be $400,448.50, so this is the figure the purchaser should use for calculating the amount of input tax. However, the purchaser is only able to claim a secondhand goods deduction on the property purchase and the rates apportionment to the extent to which the property is used for , or is available for use in, making taxable supplies under s 20(3C). 72. The vendor is unregistered, so a GST tax invoice is not required. The vendor’s settlement statement would be: Purchaser: Vendor: Settlement Date: 26 April 2015 ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price in accordance with contract 400,000.00 TO: BY: Rates to be paid by purchaser as agreed by parties Deposit paid 627.90 40,000.00 BY: Credit for vendor’s proportion of unpaid rates from 1/4/15 to 26/4/15 (26 days at $2,518.50 p/a) 179.40 BY: BY: Amount to be paid by purchaser to local authority to discharge vendor’s liability for outstanding rates Balance required to settle 627.90 359,820.60 $400,627.90 $400,627.90 Amount required to settle on 26 April 2015 $359,820.60 Example 5: Sale by a registered vendor – standard rate 73. In this example assume the following (in addition to the assumptions set out at \[65\]):  The vendor is selling the property to a purchaser who is: - unregistered; or - registered, but does not intend using the property for making taxable supplies; or - registered, but intends using the property as a principal place of residence for themselves or any of their relatives. 74. In this example, the supply of the land is in the course or furtherance of the vendor’s taxable activity and is therefore a taxable supply on which the vendor must charge and return GST output tax. 75. The amount of the credit against the purchase price is a matter for negotiation between the vendor and purchaser. In this example, the parties have agreed to credit the GST-exclusive amount of the vendor’s share of the rates ($156) against the property’s GST-exclusive purchase price. (This gives the same result as a credit of the GST-inclusive amount of the vendor’s share of the rates ($179.40) against the property’s GST-inclusive purchase price.) This is a figure that is likely to be agreed to by two parties 21 to an arm’s length transaction because using this figure puts both parties in the same position they would have been in if the vendor had paid the rates up until settlement and the purchaser had paid the rates from settlement onwards. 76. As discussed at \[31\] above, the consideration is made up of three elements. These elements are:  the purchase price: $400,000 plus GST, so $460,000;  the credit of the vendor’s share of the unpaid rates against the purchase price: $179.40; and  the total amount of vendor’s liability to the local authority that the purchaser has agreed to discharge: $627.90. 77. Therefore, the total consideration for the supply will be $460,448.50. As consideration is a GST-inclusive amount, the correct amount of GST on the supply is the tax fraction of the consideration - $60,058.50. The vendor must charge and return this amount. 78. If the purchaser is unregistered, the Act does not allow an input tax deduction. 79. If the purchaser is registered, they will not be able to claim an input tax deduction because the property will not be used for, or be available for use in, making taxable supplies. 80. The vendor’s settlement statement would be: Purchaser: Vendor: Settlement Date: 26 April 2015 ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price in accordance with contract 400,000.00 TO: TO: Rates to be paid by purchaser as agreed by parties (GST exclusive) GST as per tax invoice 546.00 60,058.50 BY: Deposit paid 40,000.00 BY: Credit for vendor’s proportion of unpaid rates from 1/4/15 to 26/4/15 (26 days at $2,190 p/a GST exclusive) 156.00 BY: BY: Amount to be paid by purchaser to local authority to discharge vendor’s liability for outstanding rates Balance required to settle 627.90 419,820.60 $460,604.50 $460,604.50 Amount required to settle on 26 April 2015 $419,820.60 22 81. The vendor’s tax invoice would be: TAX INVOICE 25 April 2015 From: Vendor’s name GST number: XXX-XXX-XXX Vendor’s address To: Purchaser’s name Purchaser’s address ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price as per agreement, less discount for unpaid rates $399,844.00 TO: Rates to be paid by purchaser to local authority $546.00 TO: GST on total value of supply $60,058.50 $460,448.50 Total GST: $60,058.50 Settlement date – 26 April 2015 Example 6: Sale by a registered vendor – zero-rated 82. As discussed at \[35\]–\[37\] above, a zero-rated sale by a registered vendor arises under ss 11(1)(mb) or 11(1)(m). 83. The amount of the credit against the purchase price is a matter for negotiation between the vendor and purchaser. In this example, the parties have agreed to a credit of the GST-inclusive amount of the vendor’s share of the rates ($179.40) plus the amount of GST input tax credit that the vendor has claimed on the purchaser’s share of the rates ($58.50): $237.90. This is a figure that is likely to be agreed to by two parties to an arm’s length transaction because using this figure puts both parties in the same position as they would have been in if the vendor had paid the rates up until settlement and the purchaser had paid the rates from settlement onwards. 84. As discussed at \[31\] above, the consideration is made up of three elements. These elements are:  the purchase price: $400,000;  the credit of the vendor’s share of the unpaid rates and the GST on the purchaser’s share of the rates against the purchase price: $237.90; and  the total amount of vendor’s liability to the local authority that the purchaser has agreed to discharge: $627.90. 85. Therefore, the total consideration for the supply will be $400,390. 86. As the sale is zero-rated, the purchaser cannot claim an input tax deduction for any element of the consideration for the property, including the rates apportionment. 23 87. The vendor’s settlement statement would be: Purchaser: Vendor: Settlement Date: 26 April 2015 ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price in accordance with contract 400,000.00 TO: TO: Rates to be paid by purchaser as agreed by parties GST as per tax invoice 627.90 nil BY: Deposit paid 40,000.00 BY: Credit for vendor’s proportion of unpaid rates from 1/4/15 to 26/4/15 (26 days at $2,518.50 p/a GST inclusive) 179.40 BY: BY: BY: Credit for GST claimed by vendor on purchaser’s share of rates Amount to be paid by purchaser to local authority to discharge vendor’s liability for outstanding rates Balance required to settle 58.50 627.90 359,762.10 $400,627.90 $400,627.90 Amount required to settle on 26 April 2015 $359,762.10 88. The vendor’s tax invoice would be: TAX INVOICE 25 April 2015 From: Vendor’s name GST number: XXX-XXX-XXX Vendor’s address To: Purchaser’s name Purchaser’s address ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price as per agreement, less discount for unpaid rates $399,762.10 TO: Rates to be paid by purchaser to local authority $627.90 TO: GST on total value of supply nil $400,390.00 Settlement date – 26 April 2015 24 Situations where s 5(15) applies Example 7: Sale by a registered vendor to a registered purchaser – sale of commercial land with a principal place of residence 89. In this example assume the following:  The vendor is selling property to the purchaser.  The land in question is farm land that includes a farm house.  The purchaser is registered and intends using the farm land for making taxable supplies.  The purchase price agreed on by the parties is $2,500,000 (plus GST). The purchaser has paid a deposit of $250,000.  The value of the farm house and curtilage is $500,000.  The settlement date is 26 April 2015.  The vendor has paid the local authority rates in advance to 30 June 2015.  The annual rating liability to the local authority is $7,300 (exclusive of $1,095 of GST). The amount of rates relating to the period of the purchaser’s occupation of the land is $1,300 (exclusive of $195 of GST). This amount is payable by the purchaser to the vendor under the agreement for sale and purchase of the land. 90. If the vendor can satisfy the requirements of s 20(3), the vendor can claim an input tax deduction for the GST component of the rates they have prepaid to the local authority. This input tax deduction will be subject to an adjustment for private use. 91. In this example, the supply of the land is in the course or furtherance of the vendor’s taxable activity. It is therefore a taxable supply but it is zero-rated under s 11(1)(mb). The farm house and curtilage is a non-taxable supply. 92. The rates apportionment will be part of the consideration for the supply. The amount of the apportionment is a matter for negotiation between the vendor and purchaser. In this example, the parties have agreed that the rates apportionment will be $1,300 plus the portion of the GST of $195 on the $1,300 that the vendor is unable to claim an input tax deduction for because it relates to the farm house and curtilage. This amount will depend on the amount of the rates apportionment that is allocated to the land and the amount that is allocated to the farm house and curtilage. It may be able to be calculated by reference to the local authority rates demand. 93. In this example the local authority rates demand shows that:  24% of the rates amount is directly attributable to the taxable supply (that is, relates to services provided in relation to the farm land) – 24% of $1,300 is $312. GST is charged at 0% on $312.  16% is directly attributable to the non-taxable supply (that is, relates to services provided in relation to the farm house and curtilage) – 16% of $1,300 is $208. GST, at the standard rate, of $31.20 is added to $208. This is part of the portion of the GST of $195 on the $1,300 25 that the vendor is unable to claim an input tax deduction for because it relates to the farm house and curtilage.  The remaining 60% is attributable to both the taxable and the non- taxable supply – 60% of $1,300 is $780. GST is charged at 0% on 80% of $780 (ie, on $624). This is because the taxable supply (the farm land) makes up 80% of the total supply. GST, at the standard rate, of $23.40 is added to the remaining 20% of $780 (ie, to $156). This is the other part of the portion of the GST of $195 on the $1,300 that the vendor is unable to claim an input tax deduction for. It is added to the $31.20, giving a total of $54.60. 94. The rates apportionment on sale will therefore be $1,354.60 (ie, $1,300 plus $54.60). 95. The total consideration for the supply will be $2,501,354.60. 96. As the supply of the land is zero-rated and the supply of the farm house and curtilage is non-taxable, the purchaser cannot claim an input tax deduction for any element of the consideration for the property, including the rates apportionment. 97. The vendor’s settlement statement would be: Purchaser: Vendor: Settlement Date: 26 April 2015 ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price in accordance with contract 2,500,000.00 TO: GST as per tax invoice nil BY: Deposit paid 250,000.00 TO: Purchaser’s proportion of rates from 27/4/15 to 30/6/15 (65 days at $7,300 p/a GST exclusive PLUS Purchaser’s proportion of GST on rates on house and curtilage) 1,354.60 BY: Balance required to settle 2,251,354.60 $2,501,354.60 $2,501,354.60 Amount required to settle on 26 April 2015 $2,251,354.60 26 98.

Susan Price Director, Public Rulings Classified Public 1 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 16/05 and BR PUB 16/06 This commentary is not a legally binding statement. The commentary is intended to help readers understand and apply the conclusions reached in Public Rulings BR Pub 16/05 and BR Pub 16/06 (the Rulings).

In the circumstances set out in the Rulings, a subdivision of shares does not result in a disposal of any shares for the purposes of s CB 4. This is because when a company subdivides shares, the original shares are not cancelled and the shareholders’ rights are not altered or terminated by the subdivision. 2. When a shareholder who acquired the original shares on revenue account disposes of a subdivided share, s CB 4 will apply to the disposal. This is because the subdivided shares are the same property as the original shares acquired. Therefore, the time of acquisition of the subdivided shares is the time of acquisition of the original shares. Under s ED 1, a reasonable method to determine the cost of each subdivided share is to divide the cost of an original share equally between its subdivided shares. Background 3. The Rulings are reissues of BR Pub 13/01 and BR Pub 13/02, which expire on 20 May 2016. BR Pub 13/01 and BR Pub 13/02 were published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 6 (July 2013): 26 and applied for the period beginning on 21 May 2013 and ending on 20 May 2016. The Rulings are essentially the same as BR Pub 13/01 and BR Pub 13/02. 4. A subdivision of shares is variously known as a “share split”, a “share subdivision”, or as a type of “share reorganisation”. One reason that a Classified Public 2 company might undertake a subdivision of shares is to improve the marketability of that company’s shares. 5. There are at least three ways to achieve an increase in the amount of shares in a company for no additional consideration, described as a subdivision of shares, namely:  existing shares can be cancelled or redeemed and, for no additional consideration, a greater number of shares can be issued to all shareholders in the same proportion as their original shareholdings;  in addition to the original shares, shares can be issued for no additional consideration to all shareholders in the same proportion as the shares already held;  existing shares can be converted into a greater number of shares for no consideration. 6. The Rulings are concerned with only the third type of subdivision of shares. 7. Section CB 4 provides that an amount derived on the disposal of personal property acquired for the purpose of disposal is income of the person. A share is a type of personal property: s 35 of the Companies Act 1993 (CA 1993). Therefore, in this context, questions arise on the application of s CB 4 to a subdivision of shares and to the disposal of a subdivided share. Application of the legislation 8. The Rulings consider two situations. These situations represent two points in time at which s CB 4 could apply to subdivided shares, namely when the:  shares are subdivided;  subdivided shares are disposed of. 9. Whether s CB 4 applies in these situations depends on whether the subdivided shares can be regarded as the same property as the original shares. Can the subdivided shares be regarded as the same property as the original shares? 10. Two broad requirements of s CB 4 must be satisfied. If these requirements are met, an amount that the person derives from disposing of the personal property is income of the person. The first requirement is that a person acquires personal property for the purpose of disposing of it. The second requirement is that the person disposes of the personal property. 11. The grammatical construction of s CB 4 shows that the property disposed of must be the same property as that acquired. When a subdivided share is disposed of, the question then arises whether the subdivided shares are the same property as the original shares. The answer to this question will also assist in determining the time of acquisition of the subdivided shares for the purposes of s CB 4. 12. In determining whether the subdivided shares are the same property as the original shares, it is helpful to consider:  What is the nature of a share? Classified Public 3  Does a subdivision of shares involve an issue of shares?  Have the original shares been disposed of or cancelled?  Have the shareholders’ rights changed as a result of the subdivision of shares?  Does the Act provide any guidance? What is the nature of a share? 13. It is generally accepted that a share is a bundle of rights and obligations conferred under a contract between the shareholders and the company: Borland’s Trustee v Steel Brothers & Co Ltd \[1901\] 1 Ch 279; Bradbury v English Sewing Cotton Ltd \[1923\] AC 744 (HL); IR Commrs v Laird Group plc \[2003\] UKHL 54. This was confirmed by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Robertson v Bicknell \[2002\] BCL 408 (CA). In Robertson, the court also confirmed that the nature of the property in a share is the interest of a person in the company, that interest being comprised of various rights and obligations (at \[23\]). 14. The CA 1993 and the general law on shares suggest that shares are an “aliquot” (meaning a portion of a larger whole) interest in a company; that is, a bundle of rights and obligations representing the shareholder’s proportionate interest in the company. The removal of par and nominal values for shares under the CA 1993 reinforces this approach. 15. Section 35 of the CA 1993 provides that a share in a company is personal property. In addition, s 36 of the CA 1993 sets out the basic rights and powers that attach to shares. These basic rights and powers include the right for the shareholder to vote at a meeting of the company on any resolution, the right to an equal share in dividends authorised by the board, and the right to an equal share in the distribution of surplus assets of the company. It is important to note that the rights and powers conferred by this section may be negated, altered or added to by the constitution of the company. Therefore, in any given situation, the constitution of a company (if it has one) will be an important factor in determining the nature of a share and the rights and powers attached to it. Does a subdivision of shares involve an issue of shares? 16. If a subdivision of shares involves an issue of new shares, this may indicate that subdivided shares are different property from the original shares. Sections 41 to 51 of the CA 1993 provide rules on issuing shares. However, the CA 1993 does not provide any guidance about how to achieve a subdivision of shares. There is only one reference in the CA 1993 to subdivisions of shares and that is in s 48. Section 48 is an exception to the requirements in s 47 of the CA 1993, which apply to the issuing of shares by a company after its registration. One view is that this shows that a subdivision must involve an issue of shares – otherwise there would be no need for the express exclusion. The other view is that the exclusion was simply to avoid any doubt in this regard. Apart from this, the CA 1993 is silent about how subdivisions should be effected. It is difficult, therefore, to draw an inference from the CA 1993 on whether a subdivision of shares involves an issue of new shares. In practice, a company’s annual return is the method by which the Companies Register is updated to reflect changes in the number of shares held and by whom. Classified Public 4 17. By comparison, the Companies Act 1955 (CA 1955) did include a procedure for the subdivision of shares. Sections 70 and 71 of the CA 1955 allowed a company to alter the conditions of its memorandum to, among other things, “subdivide its shares ... into shares of smaller amount” and required the company to notify the Registrar. This process was a separate one from that required to issue shares: see, for example, ss 14, 60, 70(1)(a), 72 and reg 2, Table A, Sch 3. This suggested that subdivisions of shares did not involve an issue of shares. 18. It has been suggested that the issue of shares involves the creation of property: FCT v St Helens Farm (ACT) Pty Ltd (1981) 146 CLR 336. Cases on the issue of shares support the view that a subdivision of shares does not involve an issue of shares. The thrust of these cases is that an issue of shares involves something leaving the company and being provided to the shareholder: Central Piggery Co Ltd v McNicoll (1949) 78 CLR 594; National Westminster Bank plc v IR Commrs \[1995\] 1 AC 119 (HL). The Commissioner considers that, in the case of a subdivision of shares, nothing has left the company or been provided to the shareholder. The shareholder has the same bundle of rights before and after the subdivision. 19. The CA 1955 suggested that subdivisions of shares did not involve an issue of shares. As noted, there is no clear process for subdivisions of shares under the CA 1993, but there is also no indication that the CA 1993 was intended to change the position under the CA 1955 for subdivisions of shares. Given that the case law shows that an issue of shares involves something being provided by the company to the shareholder, it seems that a subdivision of shares does not involve an issue of shares. Therefore, the Commissioner considers the better view is that subdivisions of shares do not involve an issue of shares. Have the original shares been disposed of or cancelled? 20. “Dispose” is not defined in s YA 1 for the purposes of s CB 4. (It is defined for the purposes of other sections in the Act, but these definitions do not assist in this inquiry.) The courts have held that “disposal” means the property is “got rid of” and is no longer in the control or possession of the disposer in any capacity: FCT v Wade (1951) 84 CLR 105; Lyttelton Port Co Ltd v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,556 (HC); Coles Myer Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue (VIC) (1998) ATC 4,537 (VICCA). As a result, the Commissioner considers that a “disposition” and/or “disposing” of property must involve the transfer or alienation of that property by the disposer. 21. Further, the provisions in the CA 1993 dealing with the cancellation of shares do not expressly apply to share subdivisions. This suggests that a subdivision does not involve the cancellation of the shares being subdivided. In addition, the case law shows that a “disposition” and/or “disposing” of property must involve total alienation of that property by the disposer. The absence of the cancellation of the existing shares and the fact the shareholder’s interests in the company are never alienated on a subdivision of shares suggests the original shares continue in existence. 22. In addition, when a company subdivides all the shares in the company, the shareholders retain control of their proportionate shares in the company. Classified Public 5 Have the shareholders’ rights changed as a result of a subdivision of shares? 23. As noted above, the basic rights attaching to a share (under the CA 1993) include the right to vote, the right to an equal share in dividends and the right to an equal share in the distribution of surplus assets. It might be argued that a subdivision of shares involves changes to a shareholder’s rights in some way because, for example, the number of votes held by the shareholder may increase in nominal terms. However, if this is viewed in terms of a share being a bundle of rights, then nothing has changed. The proportionate interest (and rights) that the shareholder had before and after the subdivision of shares remains the same. Said another way, the shareholder has, for example, a greater number of votes but the same proportionate voting interest in the company. Therefore, the Commissioner considers a subdivision of shares has little effect on shareholders’ rights – the subdivision results in more shares, but the shareholders’ proportionate interest in the company does not change. 24. The cases on subdivisions of shares in other legal contexts generally take the view that a subdivision of shares does not give rise to new property: Whittome v Whittome (No 1) (1994) SLT 114 (OH); Greenhalgh v Arderne Cinemas Ltd \[1946\] 1 All ER 512 (CA). There is also a suggestion that the subdivided shares could be traced back to, and identified with, the original shares: In re Financial Corp (1866–67) LR 2 Ch App 714. In addition, in cases concerned with whether a bequest of shares has “adeemed”, the question is whether the property exists as substantially the same thing at the death of the testator. (A gift will “adeem” – that is, be extinguished – in circumstances where, for example, there is a change in the nature of the gift between the time the testator makes the will and the testator’s death.) In several cases it has been accepted that subdivided shares have been changed in name and form only, but are substantially the same thing as the original shares: Re Greenberry, Hops v Daniell (1911) 55 Sol J 633; In re Faris, Goddard v Overend \[1911\] 1 IR 165 (IrHC); In re Clifford, Mallam v McFie \[1912\] 1 Ch 29; Guardian Trust and Executors Co of NZ Ltd v Smith \[1923\] NZLR 1,284 (SC). 25. Some support for the view that subdivided shares are the same property as the original shares may also be taken from cases on “identity of property”. These cases show that where the legal rights acquired are different in nature from those sold, then the property could not be considered to be the same property: McClelland v FCT (1970) 120 CLR 487 (PC); AL Hamblin Equipment Pty Ltd v FCT 74 ATC 4,310 (HCA). However, cases on “identity of property” also suggest that a mere subdivision of land does not change the nature of the legal rights in the property: Moruben Gardens Pty Ltd v FCT 72 ATC 4,147 (HCA). In that case, Mason J regarded the sale of all of the subdivided units as constituting a disposition of the entire estate in fee simple. He concluded that there was identity of property before and after the subdivision because the nature of the legal rights in the property remained the same. Does the Act provide any guidance? 26. Little guidance can be gained directly from the Act. Only s EX 68 deals with subdivisions of shares directly (this section uses the term “share split”). The wording of this section might suggest that a new interest arises. However, on balance, the Commissioner does not think this is the case. The wording of this section reflects the need to ensure the formulae in the foreign investment fund rules work when the number of shares in a Classified Public 6 foreign investment fund has increased without any new value being introduced. 27. The amendments made to the definition of “bonus issue” by the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013 clarified that subdivisions of shares are excluded from the dividend rules. The Rulings consider whether s CB 4 applies to subdivisions of shares and the disposal of subdivided shares. The amendments did not affect the reasoning and conclusions in the Rulings. Conclusion 28. In summary, under the CA 1993, it appears that a subdivision of shares in the circumstances set out in the Rulings does not involve an issue of new shares or the cancellation of the original shares – the original shares are merely reformatted or reorganised. Overall, the Commissioner considers that, when shares are subdivided, the shareholder’s rights in the company have not changed, even though the form in which those rights are held has changed. As a result, the Commissioner considers that the subdivided shares are the same property as the original shares for the purposes of s CB 4. Does s CB 4 apply at the time the shares are subdivided? 29. When a company subdivides shares, the Commissioner considers that at no point does the shareholder give up or lose their share rights as a result of the subdivision. The Commissioner considers that support for this view can be found in Whittome. In that case, the court considered a subdivision did not affect the identity of the property held by the shareholders, nor did it affect the proportion of the ownership held by the shareholders. The court considered that the shares were not affected by the subdivision and the shares held following the subdivision were the same property as the shares held before the subdivision. 30. Given this, the Commissioner considers s CB 4 does not apply at the time a person’s shares are subdivided. Does s CB 4 apply at the time subdivided shares are disposed of? 31. An amount derived by a person on the disposal of subdivided shares, where the original shares were acquired for the purpose of disposal, will be income of the person under s CB 4. Conversely, s CB 4 will not apply to an amount derived by a person on the disposal of subdivided shares where the original shares were not acquired for the purpose of disposal. This is because the shares held by the person after a subdivision are the same property as the shares held by the person before the subdivision. What is the time of acquisition and cost base of subdivided shares held on revenue account? 32. Given that subdivided shares are the same property as the original shares, the Commissioner considers that the time of acquisition of the subdivided shares is the time the original shares were acquired. 33. The cost of the original shares may be used to determine the cost base of the subdivided shares held on revenue account for s ED 1. Classified Public 7 34. The Commissioner considers that a reasonable method to determine the cost of a subdivided share is to divide the cost of an original share equally between its subdivided shares. Examples 35. The following examples are included to help explain the application of the law. Example 1 – shares acquired for the purpose of disposal 36. On 21 July 2013, Matiu purchased 500 shares in Barry’s Bananas Ltd (BBL) for $10 per share. On 10 January 2014, Matiu purchased another 500 shares in BBL for $15 per share. BBL has one class of shares with 100,000 shares on issue. Matiu acquired his 1,000 shares for the purpose of disposing of them at a profit in the future. Therefore, Matiu holds these shares on revenue account. 37. The directors of BBL decide to subdivide all the shares in BBL so that there will be 400,000 shares on issue. The directors pass a resolution stating: The Board resolves to subdivide (for nil consideration) each Share in the Company into four Shares of the same type. The subdivision of the Company’s Shares will take effect on 1 May 2014. 38. The rights attaching to BBL’s shares will continue in existence throughout the subdivision process and will not be altered. Each shareholder’s proportionate shareholding in the company will remain the same relative to the other shareholders. In addition, the subdivision will merely represent the reformatting of each shareholder’s interest. 39. When the subdivision takes place, BBL’s share register is updated with the new numbers of shares. BBL also informs the Companies Office of the subdivision and the new number of shares is recorded on the Companies Register. 40. After the shares are subdivided, Matiu has 4,000 shares. However, Matiu still has the same proportionate interest in the company and the same rights under the shares as he did before the subdivision. In addition, at no point during the subdivision did Matiu not hold shares in BBL. Therefore, s CB 4 will not apply at this time because Matiu has not disposed of anything. 41. On 18 May 2014, Matiu sells his 4,000 shares to Wiremu for $5 per share. Matiu receives $20,000 from Wiremu in return for the shares. At this point, the requirements of s CB 4 have been met; that is, Matiu has derived an amount from the disposal of property that he acquired for the purpose of disposal. As a result, Matiu will have derived an amount of income on the sale of the shares. Matiu does not acquire or dispose of any more shares in BBL in 2014. 42. The cost base of the subdivided shares is the cost of each of the original shares divided equally among its subdivided shares. That is, the cost of each original share is divided equally across four subdivided shares. 43. Matiu acquired 500 shares before the subdivision for $10 per share. After the subdivision those 500 shares became 2,000 shares. As a result, the cost per share of each of those subdivided shares is $2.50. Classified Public 8 44. Matiu also acquired a further 500 shares before the subdivision for $15 per share. After the subdivision those 500 shares became 2,000 shares. The cost per share of each of those subdivided shares is $3.75. 45. In the 2014-15 income year, the amount that Matiu derives on the disposal of the shares will be income. In addition, the opening value of the shares (ie, the cost of the shares) will be allowed as a deduction under the matching rules in s ED 1. Using the cost bases identified above, this is calculated in the following way:  The acquisition cost of the subdivided shares is $5,000 for the first 500 shares acquired, and $7,500 for the second 500 shares acquired. This gives a total acquisition cost for the 4,000 shares of $12,500.  Matiu sold all 4,000 shares to Wiremu for $20,000.  The profit of $7,500 that Matiu derived from the sale of the shares will form part of Matiu’s net income. Example 2 – shares not acquired for purpose of disposal 46. On 18 February 2014, Wei purchased 50 shares in BBL. Wei bought the shares as a long-term investment to earn dividends for his family. On 20 March 2014, BBL announces that it will subdivide its shares. After the subdivision, Wei will have 200 shares. Soon after, Wei is diagnosed with a serious illness. He decides to sell some of his shares to help pay for his treatment. 47. BBL subdivides its shares on 1 May 2014. On 2 May 2014, Wei sells 125 of his shares to Gareth. In this situation, s CB 4 will not apply to the amount that Wei derives on the disposal of the 125 shares. This is because, at the time Wei acquired the shares (on 18 February 2014), he did not acquire the shares for the purpose of disposal.

The Rulings consider two situations. The situations represent two points in time at which s CB 4 could apply when share rights are altered, namely when the:  rights are altered; and  shares with altered rights are disposed of. 2. Whether s CB 4 applies in these situations depends on whether the shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration. 3. A basis sometimes put forward for shares with fundamentally altered rights being different property is the contractual doctrine of rescission. In the case of alterations provided for in the terms on which the shares were issued, the alteration would be pursuant to the original contract, so the contractual doctrine of rescission would not apply. For the contractual doctrine of rescission to be relevant in other cases, there must be a contract. This makes the nature of a share, and whether share rights are conferred by contract, relevant in determining whether shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration. It is also relevant to consider the rules in the Companies Act 1993 (CA 1993) for the issue and cancellation of shares and the altering of share rights. 2 UNCLASSIFIED 4. The Commissioner considers that shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration for the purposes of s CB 4 for four reasons:  The rights and obligations comprising a share are not conferred by contract, so the contractual doctrine of rescission is not relevant.  Based on the rules in the CA 1993 for the issue and cancellation of shares and the altering of share rights, there is no cancellation and issue of shares by implication when share rights alter.  When share rights alter, at no point does a shareholder lose control of their shares and have only a right to receive shares, such as may be the case when shares are cancelled and new shares are issued.  Altering share rights does not involve property moving from the company to the shareholders. The alteration merely alters the shareholders’ existing rights against the company. 5. Accordingly, the alteration of rights attached to shares (share rights) does not result in a disposal of any shares for the purposes of s CB 4. The shares continue in existence with altered rights. The Commissioner considers that this will be the case whether there is a minor change, or a complete change of class. 6. When a shareholder who acquired the shares on revenue account before the alteration disposes of the shares after the alteration, s CB 4 will apply to the disposal. This is because the shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration. Therefore, the time of acquisition of the shares with altered rights is the time the shares were acquired before the alteration. 7. While an alteration of share rights will not result in a disposal of a share, it may have an effect on shareholder continuity. 8. If a change in the rights attached to a share is effected by cancelling the old share and issuing a new share, there will be a disposal for the purposes of s CB 4 when the share is cancelled. Background 9. Shares confer rights on shareholders: s 36(1) of the CA 1993. The rights can be altered by the constitution of the company, if any, or the terms on which the shares were issued: s 36(2) of the CA 1993. Altering share rights may be referred to as alterations, share reclassifications or share reorganisations. 10. Section CB 4 provides that an amount derived from the disposal of personal property acquired for the purpose of disposal is income of the person. Shares are a type of personal property: s 35 of the CA 1993. Questions arise as to the application of s CB 4 where share rights alter and when a shareholder disposes of shares with altered rights. Application of the legislation 11. Under s CB 4, an amount that a person derives from disposing of personal property is income of the person if they acquired the property for the purpose of disposing of it: 3 UNCLASSIFIED CB 4 Personal property acquired for purpose of disposal An amount that a person derives from disposing of personal property is income of the person if they acquired the property for the purpose of disposing of it. 12. The Rulings consider two points in time at which s CB 4 could apply when share rights are altered, namely when the:  rights are altered;  shares with altered rights are disposed of. 13. Whether s CB 4 applies in these situations depends on whether the shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration. Can the shares with altered rights be regarded as the same property as the shares before the alteration? 14. Two broad requirements of s CB 4 must be satisfied. If these requirements are met, an amount that the person derives from disposing of the personal property is income of the person. The first requirement is that a person acquires personal property for the purpose of disposing of it. The second requirement is that the person disposes of the personal property. 15. The grammatical construction of s CB 4 shows that the property disposed of must be the same property as that acquired. When share rights alter, the question arises whether the shares are the same property as the shares before the alteration. The answer to this question will also assist in determining the time of acquisition of the shares with altered rights for the purposes of s CB 4. In determining whether the shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration, it is helpful to ask two questions:  What is the nature of a share?  Are shares disposed of when rights attached to them alter? What is the nature of a share? 16. Section 36 of the CA 1993 sets out the basic rights and powers that attach to shares. The basic rights and powers include the right for the shareholder to vote at a meeting of the company on any resolution, the right to an equal share in dividends authorised by the board, and the right to an equal share in the distribution of surplus assets of the company. 17. A company may issue different classes of shares: s 37(2) of the CA 1993. “Class” means a class of shares having identical rights, privileges, limitations and conditions attached to them: s 116(1) of the CA 1993. 18. It is generally accepted that a share is a bundle of rights and obligations between the shareholders and the company: Borland’s Trustee v Steel Brothers & Co Ltd \[1901\] 1 Ch 279; Bradbury v English Sewing Cotton Ltd \[1923\] AC 744 (HL); IR Commrs v Laird Group plc \[2003\] UKHL 54. This was confirmed by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Robertson v Bicknell \[2002\] BCL 408 (CA). In Robertson at \[23\], the Court also confirmed that the nature of the property in a 4 UNCLASSIFIED share is the interest of a person in the company, that interest comprising various rights and obligations. 19. A shareholder does not have a proprietary right or interest in the assets of a company. A shareholder has been said to be entitled to a proportion of the company’s share capital, with reference to which the shareholder has certain rights: Archibald Howie v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) (1948) 77 CLR 143 at 156. 20. The property comprising a share encompasses all of the rights and obligations attached to the share. A shareholder does not own each share right as a separate piece of property: In re Alex Russell (deceased) \[1968\] VR 285 at 299. 21. Previously, under the Companies Act 1955 (CA 1955), the memorandum and articles of a company were deemed to be a contract between the company and its shareholders: s 34 of the CA 1955. However, the CA 1993 replaced the contractual model in the CA 1955: Maori Development Corp Ltd v Power Beat International Ltd \[1995\] 2 NZLR 568 (HC). The relationship between a company and its shareholders is now statutory: ss 31 and 38 of the CA 1993. 22. Obiter dicta in some cases decided under the CA 1993 suggest the relationship between a company and its shareholders is a contractual one: Ord v Calan Healthcare Properties Ltd \[2004\] 2 NZLR 122 (HC); Todd Petroleum Mining Co Ltd v Shell (Petroleum Mining) Co Ltd (2005) 2 NZCCLR 266 (HC); Herzog v Hertli (HC Blenheim CIV-2007-406-251, 23 March 2009); Manak v Hutt & City Taxis Ltd \[2009\] NZCCLR 36 (HC). However, in Maori Development Corp, s 31 of the CA 1993 was specifically referred to and considered. Blanchard J said, at 574, that the contractual model in the CA 1955 had been replaced by the statutory statement in s 31 of the CA 1993. 23. Blanchard J’s view is supported by statements made by the New Zealand Law Commission on the form and content of a new Companies Act in Company Law Reform and Restatement (NZLC R9, New Zealand Law Commission, Wellington, June 1989). In that report, at 1, the Commission said that one of the most significant proposed reforms was to redefine “the distribution of power within the company by direct operation of statute rather than by a deemed contract”. The Commission said, at 19, that “\[t\]he standard constitution, and any modification of it, should confer rights directly and not, as the \[CA 1955\] provides, by deeming the constitutional documents to be a contract”. Also, the Explanatory Note to the Companies Bill introduced on 21 September 1990 stated, at ii, that a purpose of the Bill was to redefine “the distribution of power within the company by direct operation of statute rather than by a deemed contract”. 24. The change from the contractual model of the CA 1955 is important. This is because under the contractual model, fundamentally altering the share rights may have amounted to rescission of a contract and the entering into of a new one and, by implication, a cancellation of the shares and the issue of new ones. This would not have been the case, though, if the alteration arose from the terms of the shares themselves or the articles of association of the company (or constitution in the case of the CA 1993). However, given the statutory basis of shares under the CA 1993, the contractual doctrine of rescission is not relevant. Whether the shares are cancelled and new ones are issued depends on the operation of the CA 1993 and the company’s constitution, if any. 5 UNCLASSIFIED 25. The Commissioner considers that the relationship between a company and its shareholders is statutory. The Commissioner has previously considered the nature of shares: “Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 16/05 and BR Pub 16/06”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 5 (June 2016): 5, “Income tax – Treatment of a subdivision of shares under section CB 4: Public Ruling – BR P UB 16/05”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 5 (June 2016): 3, and “Income tax – Treatment of a disposal of subdivided shares: Public Ruling – BR PUB 16/06”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 5 (June 2016): 4. The commentary on BR Pub 16/05 and BR Pub 16/06 states that it is generally accepted that a share is a bundle of rights and obligations conferred under a contract between the shareholders and the company. To the extent that the commentary on BR Pub 16/05 and BR Pub 16/06 suggests the relationship between a company and its shareholders is contractual, it is incorrect. The commentary to these Public Rulings (BR Pub 17/04 and BR Pub 17/05) should be relied on as setting out the Commissioner’s view on the nature of a share and the relationship between a company and its shareholders. Are shares disposed of when the rights attached to them alter? 26. “Dispose” is not defined in s YA 1 for the purposes of s CB 4. (It is defined for the purposes of other sections in the Act, but these definitions do not assist in this inquiry.) The courts have held that, speaking generally, “disposed of” covers all forms of alienation and carries connotations of sale, assignment, or transfer of the property: FCT v Wade (1951) 84 CLR 105 (HCA); Lyttelton Port Co Ltd v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,556 (HC). “Disposition” has been said to mean “a ridding oneself of the right or interest”: Coles Myer Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue (VIC) (1998) ATC 4,537 (VICCA) at 4,456. As a result, the Commissioner considers that “disposing” of property must involve the alienation or ridding of that property by the disposer. 27. If there is a cancellation and issue of shares by implication when share rights alter, then that would indicate that shares have been disposed of and that the shares with altered rights are different property from the shares before the alteration. 28. The CA 1993 provides comprehensive rules for the issue and cancellation of shares, and the altering of share rights. 29. Section 36 of the CA 1993 provides that the rights and powers attached to shares may be negated, altered or added to by the constitution of the company or in accordance with the terms on which the share are issued. A company is not required to have a constitution, although it may adopt one by special resolution: ss 26 and 32 of the CA 1993. If a company does not have a constitution, the company, its board and each of its directors and shareholders have the rights, powers, duties and obligations set out in the CA 1993: s 28 of the CA 1993. If a company does not have a constitution, the rights attached to its shares can alter only in accordance with the terms on which the shares were issued. 30. Sections 117 and 118 of the CA 1993 provide certain rules regarding the alteration of shareholder rights. Section 117(1) of the CA 1993 provides that a company must not take action that affects share rights unless that action has been approved by shareholders whose rights are affected. Section 118 of the CA 1993 gives dissenting shareholders the right to require the company to purchase their shares. 6 UNCLASSIFIED 31. The issue of shares is dealt with in ss 41–51 of the CA 1993. The issue of shares has been described as the whole process whereby unissued shares are applied for, allotted and, finally, registered: National Westminster Bank plc v IRC \[1994\] 2 BCLC 239 (HL). 32. Section 42 of the CA 1993 provides that, subject to the CA 1993 and the constitution of the company, if any, a company may issue shares at any time, to any person and in any number it thinks fit. On the face of it, this is a very broad power. However, the right to issue shares is subject to requirements in other provisions of the CA 1993, such as the registration of notice of a share issue and the obtaining of shareholder approval in certain circumstances: ss 43 and 44 of the CA 1993. Section 107(2) of the CA 1993 provides that shares may be issued otherwise than in accordance with some of these requirements, if all entitled persons agree or concur. Section 51 provides that a share is issued when the name of the holder is entered on the share register. 33. Sections 58–67 of the CA 1993 deal with the acquisition by a company of its own shares and their deemed cancellation. Section 59 provides that a company may acquire its own shares if permitted by its constitution, if any. Generally, any shares so acquired are deemed to be cancelled immediately on acquisition. A company must comply with procedural requirements when acquiring its own shares, such as meeting a solvency test and registration of notice of the acquisition: ss 58 and 59 of the CA 1993. 34. Sections 68–75 of the CA 1993 deal with the redemption of shares and their deemed cancellation. Section 68 provides that shares are redeemable if:  the constitution of the company makes provision for the issue of redeemable shares, and  the constitution or the terms of issue of the shares makes provision for the redemption of the shares for a consideration that is specified or calculated by a formula or suitably qualified person. 35. Shares a company redeems are deemed cancelled immediately on redemption. A company must comply with procedural requirements when redeeming shares, such as board resolutions and meeting a solvency test in certain circumstances: ss 69 and 70 of the CA 1993. 36. The rules in the CA 1993 for the issue and cancellation of shares, and the altering of share rights, make it seem unlikely that an alteration of share rights by the company’s constitution, if any, or the terms on which the shares are issued could involve the cancellation and issue of shares by implication. 37. Further, s 83 of the CA 1993 provides for a statement of rights to be given to shareholders, on request. Section 83(2) provides that the company does not have to provide a shareholder with such a statement in certain circumstances, including if a statement has been provided within the previous six months and the:  shareholder has not acquired or disposed of shares since the previous statement was provided (s 83(2)(b) of the CA 1993); and  the rights attached to shares of the company have not been altered since the previous statement was provided (s 83(2)(c) of the CA 1993). 7 UNCLASSIFIED 38. The relevance of s 83(2) of the CA 1993 is the distinction that Parliament has drawn between the acquisition of shares and the alteration of share rights. It is apparent from s 83(2) of the CA 1993 that Parliament regarded the acquisition of shares and the alteration to share rights as different things. 39. Based on the rules in the CA 1993 for the issue and cancellation of shares and the altering of share rights, the Commissioner considers that there is no cancellation and issue of shares by implication when share rights alter. This will be the case whether there is a minor change, or a complete change of class. 40. There are also other indications that shares are not disposed of when share rights alter. One such indication is that when share rights alter there is no point at which a shareholder loses control of their shares and has only a right to receive shares, such as may be the case when shares are cancelled and new shares are issued. 41. Another is that altering share rights does not involve property moving from the company to the shareholders. The alteration merely alters the shareholders’ existing rights against the company: Robertson v FCT (1952) 86 CLR 463. Conclusion 42. The Commissioner considers that shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration for the purposes of s CB 4 for four reasons:  The rights and obligations comprising a share are not conferred by contract, so that the contractual doctrine of rescission is not relevant.  Based on the rules in the CA 1993 for the issue and cancellation of shares and the altering of share rights, there is no cancellation and issue of shares by implication when share rights alter.  When share rights alter there is no point at which a shareholder loses control of their shares and has only a right to receive shares, such as may be the case when shares are cancelled and new shares are issued.  Altering share rights does not involve property moving from the company to the shareholders. The alteration merely alters the shareholders’ existing rights against the company. 43. This conclusion is consistent with IS9708 “Available subscribed capital – Consequences of deemed reregistration” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 10, No 7 (July 1998):8, which considers the consequences of share reclassifications on available subscribed capital. 44. While the altered shares will be the same property, it is noted that any change to the voting rights (defined in s YC 2) attached to shares may affect shareholder continuity for the purposes of determining whether losses and imputation credits can be carried forward. It is also noted that s GB 34 (ICA arrangements for carrying amounts forward) may apply in some circumstances if voting rights are altered. Does s CB 4 apply at the time share rights are altered? 45. When share rights alter, the Commissioner considers that the shareholder does not alienate, rid themselves of, or otherwise lose control of their shares. Shares with 8 UNCLASSIFIED altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration. Given this, the Commissioner considers s CB 4 does not apply at the time share rights are altered. Does s CB 4 apply at the time shares with altered rights are disposed of? 46. An amount derived by a person on the disposal of shares with altered rights, where the shares were acquired for the purpose of disposal before the alteration, will be income of the person under s CB 4. Conversely, s CB 4 will not apply to an amount derived by a person on the disposal of the shares where the shares were not acquired before the alteration for the purpose of disposal. This is because the shares held by the person after rights attached to the shares have been altered are the same property as the shares held by the person before the alteration. What is the time of acquisition for shares with altered rights held on revenue account? 47. Given that the shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration, the Commissioner considers that the time of acquisition of the shares with altered rights is the time the shares were acquired before the alteration. Examples 48. The following examples are included to help explain the application of the law. Example 1 — shares acquired for the purpose of disposal 49. On 15 May 2015, Shani purchased 1,000 shares in Red Packaging Ltd (RPL) for $10 per share. Shani acquired the shares for the purpose of disposing of them. Therefore, Shani holds these shares on revenue account. 50. The directors of RPL decide to create a new class of share with preferential rights to dividends and limited voting rights. The rights attached to half of RPL’s issued shares will be altered to create the new class of share. Five hundred of Shani’s shares will have their rights altered and become part of the new class of shares. The alteration has been approved by interested shareholders. 51. The alteration occurs on 30 July 2016. Shani’s shares are not formally cancelled or redeemed; nor are any new shares issued. Section CB 4 will not apply at this time because Shani has not disposed of anything. 52. On 15 August 2016, Shani sells all of her shares in RPL for $15,000. At this point, the requirements of s CB 4 have been met. Shani has derived an amount from the disposal of property that she acquired for the purpose of disposal. As a result, Shani will have derived income on the sale of the shares. Shani’s net income from the sale of the shares in RPL will be $5,000. 9 UNCLASSIFIED Example 2 — shares not acquired for purpose of disposal 53. On 10 April 2012, Blue Ltd purchased 100 shares in Orange Transport Ltd (OTL) as a long-term investment. The shares carry preferential rights to dividends and have limited voting rights. The directors of OTL propose that the rights attached to the shares be altered on 1 June 2013 so as to attract ordinary rights to dividends and full voting rights. Blue Ltd is among the majority of shareholders who vote in favour of the alteration. The shares are not formally cancelled or redeemed; nor are any new shares issued. Section CB 4 will not apply on 1 June 2013 when the share rights alter because Blue Ltd has not disposed of anything. 54. On 1 October 2013, due to a change in investment strategy, Blue Ltd decides to sell its shares in OTL. Section CB 4 will not apply to the amount that Blue Ltd derives on the disposal of its shares in OTL. This is because, even though Blue Ltd voted in favour of the alteration to share rights, the shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration. When Blue Ltd acquired the shares on 10 April 2012, it did not have a purpose of disposing of them.

1 Unclassified FRINGE BENEFIT TAX - Charitable and Other Donee Organisations and Fringe Benefit Tax PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 17/06 Note (not part of the Ruling): This Ruling replaces “Public Ruling BR Pub 09/03: Charitable Organisations and Fringe Benefit Tax”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 6 (August 2009): 12, which has been withdrawn from 30 June 2016. Under s 91DE of the Tax Administration Act 1994, BR Pub 09/03 will continue to bind the Commissioner for arrangements entered into before 1 July 2017 for a further three years. This Ruling will apply to arrangements entered into on or after 1 July 2017. Organisations qualifying for the FBT exclusion may choose whether to apply this Ruling to their existing arrangements, but after three years this Ruling will apply to all arrangements providing fringe benefits, regardless of when they are entered into. If there is an existing arrangement and the provision of a fringe benefit changes, then this Ruling will apply to the changed arrangement. This is a public ruling made under s 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of s CX 25. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of a non-monetary benefit by a charitable or other donee organisation, not being a local authority, public authority or university, (the qualifying organisation) to an employee of that organisation. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: Where a short-term charge card facility (as defined in s CX 25(3)) is provided to an employee of a qualifying organisation and the value of that benefit for the employee in a tax year is more than the lesser of 5% of the employee’s salary or wages or $1,200, that benefit is a fringe benefit and the exclusion in s CX 25(1) does not apply. Where any other non-monetary benefit is provided to an employee of a qualifying organisation: A fringe benefit is not provided where the benefit is not received mainly in connection with their employment. A fringe benefit is not provided where the benefit is received mainly in connection with their employment to the extent that: WITHDRAWN AND REPLACED BY BR PUB 22/06 2 Unclassified othe employee is employed in carrying out the qualifying organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes; or othe employee is employed in a business carried on by the qualifying organisation, where the business activity is within (ie, carries out) the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes. A fringe benefit is provided where the benefit is received mainly in connection with the employee’s employment, to the extent that the employee is employed in a business carried on by the qualifying organisation, where the business activity is outside (ie, does not carry out) the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes, regardless of whether business profits are applied to the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes.

Section CX 25 excludes some benefits provided to employees by qualifying non-profit organisations from being fringe benefits for fringe benefit tax (FBT) purposes. This Ruling and commentary explains which organisations the FBT exclusion applies to and how it applies. 2. The exclusion in s CX 25 applies to “charitable organisations”. This term is defined in s YA 1 and, in the FBT context, has a wider meaning than simply organisations that can be registered under the Charities Act 2005. It includes most organisations usually referred to as “donee organisations”; that is, any associations, funds, institutions, organisations, societies or trusts that are not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual and whose funds are applied wholly or mainly to benevolent, charitable, philanthropic or cultural purposes. Local authorities, public authorities and universities are specifically excluded from being “charitable organisations” for FBT purposes (and therefore the ordinary FBT rules apply to them). For ease of reference, in this commentary the types of non-profit organisations that can rely on the FBT exclusion in s CX 25 are referred to as “qualifying organisations”. 3. Qualifying organisations carry on a variety of activities. Those activities may include business activities. Those business activities may be within the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes or outside those purposes – even if undertaken to help fund the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes. 4. Essentially, the FBT exclusion in s CX 25 applies where a qualifying organisation provides a benefit to an employee mainly in connection with their employment, in an activity carried on within the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes. 5. The exclusion does not apply where a qualifying organisation provides a benefit to an employee mainly in connection with their employment, to the extent the benefit is provided in a business activity carried on outside the qualifying organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes. 6. The exclusion also does not apply to benefits provided by a qualifying organisation to an employee by way of short-term charge facilities (ie, credit or charge cards), if the value of those benefits in a tax year exceeds the lesser of 5% of the employee’s salary or wages for the tax year or $1,200. 7. The following flowchart summarises the approach to take to decide whether the exclusion in s CX 25 applies: WITHDRAWN 5 Unclassified Does the organisation qualify as a “charitable organisation” according to the widened definition in s YA 1? No FBT. Is the benefit provided to the employee a short- term charge facility? Fringe benefit if more thanlesser of 5%of employee’s yearly salary or $1,200. Yes No Yes No FBT. The exclusion in sCX 25 applies. Does the employee receive the benefit mainly in connection with their employment? Is the employee employed in any business carried on by the qualifying organisation? Is any of that business activityoutside the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropicpurposes? Fringe benefitto the extent the employee’s employment is in a business activity that is outside the qualifying organisation's benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropicpurposes. No Yes Yes Yes No No No Yes No Exclusion from FBT for qualifying organisations Does the organisation provide non-cash benefits to employees? FBT may be payable. The s CX 25 exclusion does not apply. WITHDRAWN 6 Unclassified Background 8. This Ruling replaces “Public Ruling BR Pub 09/03: Charitable Organisations and Fringe Benefit Tax”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 6 (August 2009): 12 (the previous ruling). BR Pub 09/03 was withdrawn from 30 June 2017. It was a reissue of “Charitable Organisations and Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT): Public Ruling BR Pub 00/08”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000): 3. 9. BR Pub 09/03 was withdrawn because the Commissioner’s view on aspects of that ruling has changed. BR Pub 09/03 was published for an indefinite period. Therefore, on withdrawal, the Commissioner continues to be bound by it for arrangements entered into before the withdrawal date for a further three years (see s 91DE(4A) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). 10. This Ruling applies to any arrangements entered into on or after 1 July 2017. This Ruling also applies to arrangements previously covered by BR Pub 09/03 where the provision of the benefit changes in some way, so that a new arrangement is created. Approach taken to analysis 11. The approach taken in this commentary is to:  briefly consider the legislative context of the FBT exclusion in s CX 25;  identify types of organisations that may qualify for the FBT exclusion;  address the following issues arising from the exception to the FBT exclusion (as set out in s CX 25(1)(a) and (b)): - when a benefit received by an employee is mainly in connection with their employment - when a qualifying organisation’s activity is a business - when a qualifying organisation’s business activity is within its charitable purposes;  discuss whether s CX 25(1) contemplates apportionment; and  consider briefly the rules regarding credit cards and charge cards provided to employees of a qualifying organisation. Legislative context of the FBT exclusion 12. Under the Act, an employer may be liable to pay FBT on fringe benefits that it provides to an employee. “Fringe benefit” is defined in s CX 2(1) as follows: Meaning (1) A fringe benefit is a benefit that— (a) is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment; and (b) either— (i) arises in a way described in any of sections CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, or CX 12 to CX 16; or (ii) is an unclassified benefit; and WITHDRAWN 7 Unclassified (c) is not a benefit excluded from being a fringe benefit by any provision of this subpart. 13. This definition is broad and intended to include all non-cash payments an employer makes to an employee in connection with their employment. 14. Section CX 25(1) excludes benefits provided by certain qualifying organisations to their employees from being fringe benefits, except in certain circumstances (see s CX 25(1)(a) and (b)): CX 25 Benefits provided by charitable organisations When not fringe benefit (1) A charitable organisation that provides a benefit to an employee does not provide a fringe benefit except to the extent to which— (a) the employee receives the benefit mainly in connection with their employment; and (b) the employment consists of the carrying on by the organisation of a business whose activity is outside its benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes. 15. Section CX 25(2) and (3) also limits the exclusion in s CX 25(1) by providing that the exclusion does not apply to benefits provided to an employee by way of short-term charge facilities if the value of those benefits in a tax year is more than the lesser of 5% of the employee’s salary or wages for the tax year or $1,200. Applying the legislation 16. For a benefit to be a fringe benefit, it must be provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment and must not be excluded from being a fringe benefit by one of the exclusions in subpart CX (see s CX 2 Meaning of fringe benefit). Where the employer is a qualifying organisation, a benefit provided to an employee is excluded from being a fringe benefit by s CX 25(1), except in certain circumstances. This means that, to the extent the exclusion in s CX 25 applies, no FBT is payable on the benefit provided to the employee by the qualifying organisation. What types of organisations qualify for the FBT exclusion in s CX 25? 17. The FBT exclusion in s CX 25 applies to a wider category of organisations than simply organisations that can be registered under the Charities Act 2005. 18. The term “charitable organisation” is defined in s YA 1 for the purposes of the FBT exclusion: charitable organisation — (a) means, for a quarter or an income year, an association, fund, institution, organisation, society, or trust to which section LD 3(2) (Meaning of charitable or other public benefit gift) or schedule 32 (Recipients of charitable or other public benefit gifts) applies— (i) in the quarter; or (ii) in the income year, if fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section RD 60 (Close company option); and (ab) includes a person who has been removed from the register of charitable entities (the register) under the Charities Act 2005, but only for the period starting on the day the person is registered on the register and ending on the earlier of the last day of the following periods: (i) the quarter, or income year if section RD 60 (Close company option) applies, in which the person does not comply with their rules contained in the register: WITHDRAWN 8 Unclassified (ii) the quarter, or income year if section RD 60 applies, in which the day of final decision falls; and (b) does not include a local authority, a public authority, or a university. \[Emphasis added.\] 19. The definition of “charitable organisation” essentially relies on the description of a “donee organisation” set out in the tax credit rules for charitable or other public benefit gifts. However, it specifically does not include local authorities, public authorities or universities. 20. The tax credit rules for charitable or other public benefit gifts provide a description of the types of organisation to be treated as a “donee organisation” for gifting purposes in s LD 3(2): Description of organisations (2) The following are the entities referred to in subsection (1)(a) and (b): (a) a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual, and whose funds are applied wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand: (ab) an entity that, but for this paragraph, no longer meets the requirements of this subsection, but only for the period starting on the day it fails to meet those requirements and ending on the later of— (i) the day the entity is removed from the register of charitable entities under the Charities Act 2005: (ii) the day on which all reasonably contemplated administrative appeals and Court proceedings, including appeal rights, are finalised or exhausted in relation to the person’s charitable status. (ac) a community housing entity, if the gift is made in a tax year that the entity meets the requirements to derive exempt income under section CW 42B (Community housing trusts and companies): (b) a public institution maintained exclusively for any 1 or more of the purposes within New Zealand set out in paragraph (a): (bb) a Board of Trustees that is constituted under Part 9 of the Education Act 1989 and is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual: (bc) a tertiary education institution: (c) a fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any 1 or more of the purposes within New Zealand set out in paragraph (a), by a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual: (d) a public fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any 1 or more of the purposes within New Zealand set out in paragraph (a). 21. Organisations of the types described in s LD 3(2) essentially include associations, funds, institutions, organisations, societies or trusts that:  are not carried on for the personal gain of an individual; and  apply their funds wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand. 22. The definition of “charitable organisation” also includes organisations listed in schedule 32. Schedule 32 lists certain named organisations that Parliament has approved as being “recipients of charitable or other public benefit gifts”. These are often international charities with a New Zealand presence, which would not otherwise qualify as “donee organisations” as they do not apply their funds wholly or mainly within New Zealand. WITHDRAWN 9 Unclassified 23. Therefore, the FBT exclusion in s CX 25 applies to organisations of the types described in s LD 3(2) or listed in sch 32, which together are referred to as “donee organisations” in s YA 1. The FBT exclusion does not apply to local authorities, public authorities or universities. Exception to the FBT exclusion 24. Generally, qualifying organisations are not subject to FBT. However, there are two exceptions. The first exception is where the benefits provided are certain types of short-term charge facilities (discussed at \[62\]). The second exception is where benefits are provided mainly in connection with employment to employees who work for businesses outside the organisation’s purposes. This second exception is set out in s CX 25(1) and has two limbs, paras (a) and (b): CX 25 Benefits provided by charitable organisations When not fringe benefit (1) A charitable organisation that provides a benefit to an employee does not provide a fringe benefit except to the extent to which— (a) the employee receives the benefit mainly in connection with their employment; and (b) the employment consists of the carrying on by the organisation of a business whose activity is outside its benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes. 25. The first limb of the exception in s CX 25(1) considers whether a benefit is received by the employee mainly in connection with their employment. The second limb looks at the activities being carried on by a qualifying organisation in which the employee is engaged. When is a benefit received by an employee mainly in connection with their employment? 26. The first limb of the exception (s CX 25(1)(a)) requires the employee to receive the benefit mainly in connection with their employment. 27. In the Commissioner’s view, this wording recognises that a qualifying organisation may provide benefits to people who are acting in different capacities for the organisation. It is not unusual for people to be employed by the organisation in a particular role and for those same people to also provide additional or different services to the organisation, for example, on a voluntary (unpaid) basis. 28. In the Commissioner’s view, the purpose of the wording in s CX 25(1)(a) is to clarify that a potential liability for FBT will arise only where an employee receives a benefit from a qualifying organisation mainly in their employment capacity and not in some other capacity (eg, in their voluntary capacity). 29. The word “mainly” is used in s CX 25 as a result of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. The intended meaning of “mainly” in the rewritten Act is discussed in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 5 (June 2004) (at p 71): Mainly The rewritten provisions use “mainly” in place of “primarily and principally” and similar expressions. The expression “primarily and principally” was considered by Eichelbaum J in Newman Tours Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,027 (High Court). The judge interpreted the expression as requiring that the purpose not only be the main one, in the sense of outweighing all the other purposes, singly or collectively, but WITHDRAWN 10 Unclassified also the primary one - that is, the first one. Sufficiently similar connotations can be conveyed in the single word “mainly”. 30. Therefore, a benefit will be provided to an employee of a charitable organisation mainly in connection with their employment if the benefit arises primarily in connection with their employment. If an employee is only employed by a charitable organisation, and does no voluntary work, then any benefits provided to that employee will be provided in connection with their employment. But, if, for example, an employee is both employed by and works as a volunteer for a charitable organisation, it will be necessary to determine in which capacity the benefit primarily arises. 31. If a benefit arises equally in connection with both their capacities, the benefit will be provided mainly in connection with the capacity in which the employee is predominantly engaged. When is a qualifying organisation’s activity a business? 32. Under the second limb of the exception (s CX 25(1)(b)), the FBT exclusion in s CX 25(1) does not apply to the extent that a benefit is provided to an employee whose: employment consists of the carrying on by the organisation of a business whose activity is outside its benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes. 33. Therefore, the next issue to be considered when deciding whether the FBT exclusion in s CX 25(1) applies is whether the employee is employed in the carrying on by the qualifying organisation of a business. “Business” is defined in s YA 1 as including: any profession, trade, or undertaking carried on for profit: 34. The Court of Appeal in Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682 considered that underlying the use of the word “business” in the context of a taxation statute is the fundamental notion of the exercise of an activity in an organised and coherent way that is directed to an end result – the making of pecuniary profits. The Court found that determining whether a taxpayer is in business involves a two-fold inquiry as to the nature of the activities carried on and the intention of the taxpayer in engaging in those activities. Richardson J (at 61,691) identified several factors relevant to determining whether a taxpayer is carrying on a business, namely the:  nature of the activity;  period over which the taxpayer engages in that activity;  scale of operations and the volume of transactions;  commitment of time, money and effort;  pattern of the activity; and  financial results. 35. Richardson J went on to note that it may also be helpful to consider whether the operations involved are of the same kind and are carried on in the same way, as those that are characteristic of ordinary trade in the line of business in which the venture is conducted. However, in the end, it is the character and circumstances of the particular venture that are crucial. 36. Many charitable or other donee organisations engage in activities on a continuous and ongoing basis, commit time, money and effort to those WITHDRAWN 11 Unclassified activities, and conduct a large volume of transactions, with the intention of making a surplus. Such organisations that carry on this type of activity are carrying on a business, as that term is defined in s YA 1. 37. A charitable or other donee organisation carrying on a business (eg, a private school operated by a charitable trust) may still qualify for the FBT exclusion even though it makes a profit. Just because an organisation carries on some activities for profit does not prevent the organisation from being a qualifying organisation for FBT purposes, so long as the activity is not being carried on for the personal gain of an individual. This view is consistent with one of the key descriptions of a “donee organisation” in s LD 3(2)(a): a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual, and whose funds are applied wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand. \[Emphasis added\] When is a qualifying organisation’s business activity within its benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes? 38. If it is established that a qualifying organisation is providing benefits to an employee employed in a business they are carrying on, then the FBT exclusion will still apply to the extent that business activity is being carried on within the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes. However, the FBT exclusion will not apply to the extent the employee is engaged in a business activity that is outside the qualifying organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes. Section CX 25(1)(b) provides: employment consists of the carrying on by the organisation of a business whose activity is outside its benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes. \[Emphasis added\] 39. The distinction between business activities that are within, or outside of, the qualifying organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes is specific to the FBT exclusion. This is not a distinction that is relevant for income taxation purposes, or when determining whether an organisation is a charitable entity for the purposes of the Charities Act 2005. 40. Applying the second limb of the exception requires an understanding of the types of activities the qualifying organisation is carrying on. Sometimes activities will be within a qualifying organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes and sometimes activities will be outside those purposes. 41. The distinction between activities carried on within a qualifying organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes and outside those purposes was discussed in Trustees of the Dean Leigh Temperance Canteen v Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1958) 38 TC 315. The High Court of Justice (Chancery Division) considered whether a charity could carry on a business activity that was within its charitable purposes. This was in the context of determining whether income derived by the trustees was exempt from tax. In the United Kingdom at that time, income from a business was exempt from tax if that business was carried on in the course of carrying out a primary purpose of the charity. 42. The trust was established for the purpose of promoting temperance. It operated a canteen selling non-alcoholic drinks and light refreshments at normal market prices in a market place. The canteen made considerable WITHDRAWN 12 Unclassified profits. The issue before the court was essentially whether the canteen activity was a business exercised in the course of carrying out the primary purpose of the charity. The court concluded that the object of the trust was to promote temperance and “the canteen was the engine in their hand for that purpose” (at 325). In other words, the canteen activity was a business activity within (and not outside) the trust’s charitable purposes. Accordingly, the income derived from the canteen business was exempt from tax. 43. Another case that considers the distinction between activities carried on by a charity is Oxfam v City of Birmingham District Council \[1975\] 2 All ER 289 (HL). In Oxfam, the House of Lords found that where a charity carried out its charitable objects or directly facilitated the carrying out of the charitable objects (such as administrative or clerical activities), it was acting within its charitable purposes. However, where a charity carried on a trading activity that did not carry out its charitable objects, that activity would be outside the charity’s charitable purposes. This is the case even if all funds raised from the activity are applied to the charity’s charitable purposes. 44. The House of Lords was considering whether Oxfam’s gift shops were on premises wholly or mainly used for charitable purposes. The court found that, although the gift shops were used for purposes indirectly related to the achievement of the objects of the charity (ie, selling donated goods to raise money for the charity), the premises were not wholly or mainly used for charitable purposes. 45. In reaching this conclusion, the House of Lords drew a line between the use of premises for purposes that are the charity’s charitable purposes and the use of premises for purposes that, though purposes of the charity, are not charitable purposes. Lord Cross said at 293: The wording of s 40(1) of the \[General Rate Act 1967\] shows that the legislature did not consider that the mere fact that the hereditament in question is occupied by a charity justifies any relief from rates. That is only justified if the hereditament is being used for ‘charitable purposes’ of the charity. So the first question which arises is: what are 'charitable purposes' of a charity as distinct from its other purposes? The answer must be, I think, those purposes or objects the pursuit of which make it a charity — that is to say in this case the relief of poverty, suffering and distress. 46. As well as “those purposes or objects the pursuit of which make it a charity”, Lord Cross recognised that activities that are “wholly ancillary to” or “directly facilitate” the carrying out of an organisation’s charitable objects will be part of fulfilling the organisation’s charitable objects. Fundraising through the gift shops did not meet those criteria. 47. In the Commissioner’s view, these cases support the view that activities (including business activities) undertaken to carry out the benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic objects of a qualifying organisation or directly facilitating the carrying out of those objects (including administrative or clerical activities) will be within the benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes of the organisation for the purposes of s CX 25. However, trading activities carried on to raise funds for the organisation that do not in themselves carry out the charitable purposes of the organisation will not be within the benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes of a qualifying organisation for the purposes of s CX 25. This is the case even if all the funds raised from the activity are applied to the qualifying organisation’s purpose. WITHDRAWN 13 Unclassified 48. Therefore, the Commissioner considers activities will be carried on within a qualifying organisation’s purposes when they:  are the performance of a qualifying organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes; or  directly facilitate the carrying out of a qualifying organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes. 49. Activities the Commissioner considers will usually be characterised as being carried on within a qualifying organisation’s purposes include:  the carrying out of the qualifying organisation’s purposes;  appeals for funds for the qualifying organisation’s purpose;  passive investment and management of the qualifying organisation’s funds, so long as the organisation does not carry on a business of fund investment; and  the administration of the above activities. 50. On the other hand, business activities that are carried on to raise funds for the qualifying organisation and that are not of themselves achieving a qualifying organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes, or which do not directly facilitate those purposes, will be treated as business activities outside the purposes of a qualifying organisation. This is the case even if the profits from such business activities are used to fund the qualifying organisation and thereby help it carry out its benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes. For example, a clothing thrift shop run by an animal welfare organisation is a business activity that is outside the organisation’s object of caring for animals. 51. Applying this approach to s CX 25(1), where benefits are received mainly in connection with employment, to the extent an employee is engaged in activities carrying out a charitable organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes (including the carrying on of a business activity), benefits provided to them will not attract FBT. However, to the extent a qualifying organisation's employee is engaged in business activities of the organisation that are not of themselves benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic, any benefits provided to the employee will not fall within the exclusion provided by s CX 25, and so may attract FBT. 52. It will be a question of fact in each case whether the business activities of a qualifying organisation are activities that are not of themselves achieving the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes. It is, therefore, possible that two qualifying organisations may carry out similar business activities, with different FBT consequences for each organisation. An example of this is where a qualifying organisation operates retail stores selling goods with a view to making a profit. This type of activity would generally be considered to be outside an organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes, although for some organisations such an activity might fall within their purposes. For example, if the operation of a particular retail store served the purpose of creating job opportunities for a group that the organisation was established to assist, or if the goods were provided at low cost to a group the organisation was established to assist. This business activity may be considered to be achieving the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes. WITHDRAWN 14 Unclassified Whether s CX 25(1) contemplates apportionment 53. Just as a person may work for a qualifying organisation in different capacities (eg, as a volunteer or as an employee), an employee may also be employed by a qualifying organisation in different activities, some of which may be within the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes and some of which may be outside those purposes. 54. Section CX 25(1) provides that: (1) A charitable organisation that provides a benefit to an employee does not provide a fringe benefit except to the extent to which— (a) the employee receives the benefit mainly in connection with their employment; and (b) the employment consists of the carrying on by the organisation of a business whose activity is outside its benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes. \[Emphasis added\] 55. In the Commissioner’s view, the phrase “to the extent to which” in s CX 25(1) applies to both paras (a) and (b), but in para (a) it is qualified by the word “mainly”. The word “and” between the paragraphs indicates that both paragraphs (ie, both the first and second limbs of the exception) need to be satisfied for the exclusion not to apply. 56. The word “extent” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, 2011) as meaning: n. 1 the area covered by something. The size or scale of something. 2 the degree to which something is the case: everyone has to compromise to some extent 57. The Court of Appeal in CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 and Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 held that the phrase “to the extent to which” expressly contemplates apportionment. On this point, Richardson J stated in Buckley & Young at 61,274: The second feature of sec. 111 is that the statutory language contained in the phrase “to the extent to which” expressly contemplates apportionment. In Banks this Court said, in relation to this aspect of deductibility (p. 61,241): “A deduction is allowed to the extent that the statutory standard of deductibility is met. Furthermore, this is not restricted to expenditure which can be dissected with distinct and severable parts being directly referable to the production of assessable income. It extends to outgoings not capable of such dissection but which serve both income earning and other purposes indifferently (Ronpibon Tin N.L. & Tongkah Compound N.L. v F.C. of T. (1949) 78 C.L.R. 47.” While sec. 112(a) does not expressly provide in the same way for apportionment between capital and revenue, at the same time it does not provide to the contrary, for example, by the use of the familiar qualification in taxation legislation “wholly and exclusively”. Section 112(a) operates as a restriction on deductibility and, as a matter of construction, applies only in so far as the expenditure is of a capital character. In The Texas Company (Australasia) Limited v F.C. of T. (1940) 63 C.L.R. 382, 466 referring to the then counterpart of sec. 112(a) Dixon J. said: “There is I think nothing which prevents the division or apportionment between capital and income of an outgoing which is in part of a capital nature and in part of a revenue nature.” In our view the same approach is to be made whether the apportionment is under sec. 111 or between capital and revenue expenditure \[Emphasis added\] WITHDRAWN 15 Unclassified 58. In Banks, Richardson J also made the observation at 61,243– 61,244 that “\[i\]ndeed, the expressions ‘to the extent’ and ‘so far as’ demonstrate the absence of a statutory minimum applicable in all cases”. 59. Richardson J makes it clear that the phrase “to the extent to which” expressly contemplates apportionment. Richardson J does, however, acknowledge that the phrase may not have this meaning if it is qualified with a term like “wholly and exclusively”. Therefore, applying that reasoning to s CX 25(1), the word “mainly” in s CX 25(1)(a) could be read as qualifying the phrase “to the extent to which”. However, in the Commissioner’s view, in s CX 25(1)(a) the word “mainly” places the focus on establishing the principal reason for the employee receiving the benefit. For example, whether the employee received the benefit mainly in connection with their employment or mainly in connection with their role as a volunteer. If it is mainly received in connection with volunteer service, the benefit is not a fringe benefit. However, if the benefit is provided mainly in connection with employment (ie, s CX 25(1)(a) is satisfied) then any volunteer service is disregarded for the purposes of s CX 25(1)(b). This is because only employment is considered for the purposes of applying the second limb of the exclusion in s CX 25(1)(b). 60. Unlike in s CX 25(1)(a), there are no words in s CX 25(1)(b) to qualify the phrase “to the extent to which”. This means that, for the purposes of s CX 25(1)(b), the words “to the extent to which” should be given their ordinary meaning (ie, requiring apportionment). Therefore, under s CX 25(1)(b) a qualifying organisation will be subject to FBT only to the extent to which that benefit is provided to an employee in connection to their employment in a business activity that is outside the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes. 61. In summary, the Commissioner considers FBT will apply only to benefits provided to an employee mainly in connection with their employment, and then only to the extent to which those benefits are received in connection with employment in a business carried on outside a qualifying organisation’s purposes. Where an employee is employed in different activities across a qualifying organisation and one or more of those activities is a business activity outside the organisation’s purposes, the benefits provided need to be apportioned so only the benefits relating to the employment in the business activity carried on outside the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes are treated as fringe benefits. In the Commissioner’s view, any apportionment should be reasonable and reflect the reality of the situation. Example 4 provides an example of a reasonable apportionment basis, based on working hours. Short–term charge facilities 62. As previously stated, the FBT exclusion in s CX 25(1) does not apply to the provision of short-term charge facilities (ie, credit and charge cards) in specified circumstances. Section CX 25(2) states that the exclusion in s CX 25(1) does not apply, and a fringe benefit is provided when a qualifying organisation provides a benefit to an employee by way of a short-term charge facility and the value of the benefit is more than the lesser of 5% of the employee’s salary and wages for a tax year and $1,200. Subsection (3) defines the term “short-term charge facility”. These types of benefits provided to a qualifying organisation’s employees are subject to FBT regardless of whether the employee works in any business. Example 6 at \[75\] illustrates this point. WITHDRAWN 16 Unclassified Examples Example 1 – Private school operated by a charitable organisation 63. A non-profit organisation has the principal purpose of providing education through a private school. The organisation is a charitable organisation for the purposes of the FBT rules because it is not carried on for the private gain of any individual and its funds are applied wholly or mainly for the advancement of education within New Zealand. 64. The organisation charges tuition fees for the education it provides and has had surpluses of income over expenditure for the last three income years. It provides a car to its school principal for work and private use. 65. The organisation is not liable for FBT on the benefit arising from the private use or availability for the private use of the car provided to the principal. This is because the benefit is provided by a charitable organisation to an employee who is employed in an activity that is within the charitable organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes. The employee is not employed in a business activity that is carried on by the charitable organisation outside its benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes. Example 2 – Farming activity within private school 66. The organisation from Example 1 also conducts a farming business on land adjacent to the school. The farming operation is carried on as a business and it directly facilitates the practical component of the school’s agricultural courses. The organisation provides a car to its farm manager for work and private use. 67. The organisation is not liable for FBT on the benefit arising from the private use or availability for private use of the car provided to the farm manager. This is because the farm manager is employed by the charitable organisation to carry out its benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes (ie, the advancement of education). In this case, the carrying on of the farming business falls within the benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes of the organisation because of it’s direct relationship with the school’s agricultural curriculum. Example 3 – Farming activity outside private school 68. This example has the same facts as in Example 2, except the farming business does not directly facilitate the education of the students at the school. Any profits earned are put back into the school. However, the farm is not used to educate students at the school. 69. In this situation, the organisation is liable for FBT on the benefit arising from the private use or availability for private use of the car provided to the farm manager. This is because the farm manager is employed in a business activity that falls outside the benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes of the organisation. This remains the case despite the fact the profit made from the farming activity is put back into the school. WITHDRAWN 17 Unclassified Example 4 – Employee in food bank and shop 70. A charitable organisation has the principal purpose of relieving poverty by running a food bank. The organisation is a charitable organisation for the purposes of the FBT rules because it is not carried on for the private gain of any individual and its funds are applied wholly or mainly for charitable purposes (ie, the relief of poverty) within New Zealand. The organisation also runs a shop that sells office supplies (purchased from a wholesaler) to the public. The profit made from the shop is used to purchase food for the food bank. 71. The organisation has a policy of providing low-interest loans to all employees. Peter is employed by the organisation to work three days a week in the shop and two days a week in the food bank. He receives a low-interest loan from the organisation. 72. A fringe benefit arises to the extent to which Peter’s employment consists of the charitable organisation carrying on a business activity that is outside the organisation’s charitable purposes. In this case, 60% of Peter’s employment is for the charitable organisation carrying on a business activity that is outside that organisation’s charitable purposes. Therefore, the charitable organisation is liable for FBT on 60% of the value of the fringe benefit arising from the provision of the low-interest loan to Peter. Example 5 – Voluntary work in food bank 73. This example has similar facts to Example 4, except that Peter is employed to work in the shop only two days a week, and for the remaining three days he volunteers to work for the organisation in the food bank. The low-interest loan is available to anyone who works regularly (as an employee or a volunteer) in the food bank. 74. In this situation, the organisation is not liable for FBT on the benefit arising from the provision of the low-interest loan to Peter. This is because the benefit is not received mainly in connection with Peter’s paid employment, but instead is received mainly in connection with his unpaid role as a volunteer in the food bank. This is because Peter predominantly works as a volunteer in the food bank. The benefit is not a fringe benefit and therefore no apportionment is required. Example 6 – Fuel card 75. A charitable organisation employs a secretary at its head office. The secretary’s employment involves administrative matters relating to the running of the organisation. The secretary’s salary is $40,000 for the tax year. On top of the salary, the organisation provides the secretary with a fuel card for use at a local petrol station. The fuel card is in the organisation’s name and the organisation is liable to pay any amounts charged to the card. The secretary uses the card to obtain at least $80 worth of petrol every week. 76. The provision of the fuel card to the secretary is a fringe benefit. It does not matter that the secretary is employed in an activity within the charitable organisation’s charitable purposes (ie, administrative work at an organisation’s head office). The organisation is liable for FBT because the benefit is provided by way of a short-term charge facility and the value of the benefit is more than $1,200 in the tax year, being the lesser WITHDRAWN 18 Unclassified of 5% of the secretary’s salary or wages for the tax year and $1,200. The benefit, therefore, is a fringe benefit under s CX 25(2).

BR Pub 96/6 applies up until 31 March 1998. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies to the definition of factor “j” in the formula within the definition of “transitional capital amount” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to companies that liquidate on or after 1 July 1994 and distribute to shareholders the same class of capital that the company has, prior to 1 July 1994, written off against its losses. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The “aggregate amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994” in factor “j” of the formula within the definition of “transitional capital amount” includes all paid-up capital that has been, prior to 1 July 1994, written off against losses incurred by the company The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to liquidations (as defined in section OB 1) during the period 1 April 1998 to 31 March 2001 and to distributions from such liquidations during the period 1 April 1998 to 31 March 2001. This Ruling is signed by me on the 22nd day of January 1998. Jeff Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 98/1 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 98/1 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Ruling BR 96/6 (TIB Volume Seven, No. 12, April 1996 at page 4 under the heading “Definition of “transitional capital amount”). This Ruling covers the period from 1 April 1998 to 31 March 2001. Background The Companies Act 1993 enacted major reforms in the company law area. One of the most significant was the removal of the concept of “paid-up capital”. Consequently the Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 was enacted to accommodate the changes to company law. In particular, the Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 introduced, with application from 1 July 1994, a definition of “available subscribed capital” for tax purposes. The Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 also repealed section 4A(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 4A(1)(h) allowed the Commissioner to exclude from dividends such amount distributed to a shareholder of the company as the Commissioner considered just and reasonable where: • The company had reduced the amount of the paid-up capital of the shareholder by writing off with High Court approval, losses incurred by the company; and • The company was subsequently wound up; and • Upon the winding up of the company, an amount (whether in money or money’s worth) was distributed to the shareholder in excess of the amount paid up on the shares of the shareholder. Taxpayers wish to know the effect of the repeal, and in particular whether or not it results in a reduction of the “available subscribed capital” of a company when the company has, prior to 1 July 1994, written off losses against paid-up capital. To calculate the available subscribed capital for companies existing prior to 1 July 1994, the “transitional capital amount” must be determined. The terms “available subscribed capital” and “transitional capital amount” are discussed in more detail in TIB Volume Six, No. 6 - Company Law Reform (December 1994). Legislation Section OB 1 states: 2 “ Transitional capital amount”, in relation to a share in a company at any relevant time, means the amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: j + k x m l where - j is the aggregate amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994 in respect of shares of the same class (whenever issued and including the share), not being-...\[Emphasis added.\] k is the aggregate of qualifying share premium paid to the company before 1 July 1994... l is the number of shares in the specified class ever issued before the close of 30 June 1994; and m is the number of shares in the specified class on issue at the close of 30 June 1994. Application of legislation The “aggregate amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994” in factor “j” of the definition of “transitional capital amount” includes all paid-up capital that has been, prior to 1 July 1994, written off against losses incurred by the company. This allows a company to restore the written-off capital upon liquidation, without the distribution being treated as a dividend to the shareholders. Example 1990 M Ltd issues 1,000 fully paid-up shares at $1 each. 1992 Pursuant to High Court approval, M Ltd writes off $500 (50 cents per share) of paid- up capital from its accumulated losses. 1994 Paid-up capital at 30 June 1994 is $500. 1995 Shareholders decide to liquidate M Ltd. There have been no movements in the capital of M Ltd since the capital reduction in 1992. After the sale of assets the distribution per share will be 75c. Because M Ltd existed before 1 July 1994, its “available subscribed capital” is determined by calculating its “transitional capital amount”. To calculate M’s transitional capital amount, the following formula is used: j + k x m l where- j is paid-up capital at the close of 30 June 1994 $ 500 add back capital reduction $ 500 aggregate capital paid up before 1 July 1994 as defined in the $1,000 Ruling k qualifying share premium assume is 0 l number of shares ever issued before 1 July 1994 1,000 m shares on issue at 1 July 1994 1,000 3 $1,000 + 0 x 1,000 = $1,000 transitional capital amount 1,000 The available subscribed capital per share cancelled equals $1,000/1,000 = $1 per share. The $0.75 per share distributed is not treated as a dividend as it does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share. 4
