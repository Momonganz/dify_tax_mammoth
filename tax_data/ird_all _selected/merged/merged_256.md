Canterbury District Health Board (CDHB). 2. The submitter is responsible for promoting the reduction of adverse environmental effects on the health of people and communities and to improve, promote and protect their health pursuant to the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000 and the Health Act 1956. 3. The Ministry of Health requires the submitter to reduce potential health risks by such means as submissions to ensure the public health significance of potential adverse effects are adequately considered during policy development. Details of submission 4. We welcome the opportunity to comment on the Future of Tax. The future health of our populations is not just reliant on hospitals, but on a responsive environment where all sectors work collaboratively. 5. While the most obvious link between tax and health is the financing of the health system, the relationship is far broader. Although health care services are an important determinant of health, health is also influenced by a wide range of factors beyond the health sector. Health care services manage disease and trauma and are an important determinant of health outcomes. Health creation and wellbeing (overall quality of life) are also influenced by a wide range of factors beyond the health sector. 6. These influences can be described as the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age, and are impacted by environmental, social and behavioural factors. They are often referred to as the ‘social determinants of health. 1 Barton and Grant’s Health Map 2 shows how the various influences on health are complex and interlinked. Tax is an upstream determinant of health and a just 1 Public Health Advisory Committee. (2004). The Health of People and Communities.

Tax revenue is also vital in providing funding for public services which impact on a broad range of these determinants. 7. The most effective way to maximise people’s wellbeing is to take these determinants into account as early as possible during decision making and strategy development. Initiatives to improve health outcomes and overall quality of life must involve organisations and groups beyond the health sector if they are to have a reasonable impact. 3 8. A well performing tax system is a major contributor to public welfare. Strong tax systems can provide regular, sustainable revenue for healthcare and funding for public services which impact on a broad range of determinants. Tax structures also affect society and the economy in many ways beyond a narrow financing focus: equity, in its many dimensions, impacting investment and growth; sustainability of the environment; and many other concerns central to the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. 4 9. Strong tax systems also contribute to a more equitable and democratic society. Small changes to the redistribution of wealth can have a big impact on poverty, a key determinant of health. Inequity is itself linked to a number of health conditions, including hypertension, heart disease, mental health disorders, accidents, ulcers, and cirrhosis. 5 More equitable societies are healthier societies. 10. The importance of tax to health improvement has been summarised by the 'Five R's' framework. 6 First, tax can improve representation and democratic accountability, and help make governments more responsive to the needs of its citizens. Second, tax can create a revenue stream for a universal pool of public finance for health care and other public services. Third, progressive taxation when combined with appropriate public spending can help redistribute wealth and income and mitigate social and health inequalities.

Fifth, taxation provides a route by which certain harmful industries can be regulated. General Comments 11. In its role of promoting and protecting the health of its population, the CDHB has a number of recommendations related to taxation for consideration which would improve health outcomes for the community. 12. The CDHB supports the use of the Living Standards Framework and taking a broader view of taxation that includes social costs. 13. As noted in the submission’s background paper, the ageing population will result in increased government expenses due to higher healthcare spending and slower revenue growth from lower labour force participation. Ageing is of particular concern for the CDHB, the District Health Board region with second largest population and the largest total population over 75 years,. 7 By 2026, one in every five people in Canterbury will be over 65 and the number of people aged over 85 will have doubled. Chronic diseases disproportionately affect older adults and contribute to ongoing disability and increased need for long-term health care. Ageing is associated with a growing need for acute health care services and ongoing chronic illness that sometimes requires long-term care. 8 However, when older people are in good health, they will need relatively fewer health care resources. Policies that allow a healthy ageing of the population include enhanced prevention services to tackle obesity, smoking and mental illnesses, as well as better coordination of health and long-term care services. These policies need vision, long-term planning and investment but comprehensive prevention strategies and a well-funded health system will allow more people to age healthily and will help to ensure future health services are properly equipped to accommodate population ageing. 9 7 Canterbury District Health Board.

Taxes on unhealthy products can produce major health gains, and the evidence shows these can be implemented fairly, without disproportionately harming the poorest in society. While one of the most common arguments opposing ‘behavioural’ taxation is the claim that such taxes are regressive, the latest research has found that taxes on alcohol, tobacco, and sugar-sweetened beverages offer a particularly effective strategy for reducing chronic disease among the poorest people in society who are disproportionately affected by unhealthy products. 10 The burden of preventable non-communicable disease associated with tobacco, alcohol and obesity is itself regressive. Although low-income households may often bear the largest financial burden they also receive the largest health benefits. 11 Although the direction and size of the equity effects of price policies depend to a large extent on the measures used to assess them in no case are these effects unequivocally regressive. Where taxes or tax increases do generate regressive tax burdens, the positive financial effects linked with health improvements that are triggered by taxation should also be considered. 15. The CDHB recommends that the Tax Working Group recommend that research be commissioned to explore into the link between tax and health in New Zealand. Specific comments Please refer to Appendix A Summary 16. The CDHB supports making improvements to the New Zealand tax system as an appropriate fiscal measure to improve population health outcomes, in particular harm from alcohol, smoking, and climate change, as well as rates of obesity and diabetes.

In line with the CDHB Position Statement on Alcohol 12 , the CDHB recommends increasing excise tax on alcohol by at least 50% to reduce alcohol-related harm. 18.1. CDHB are gravely concerned about the effect that misuse of alcohol has, either directly or indirectly, on the health and wellbeing of all New Zealanders and particularly the disproportionate effect that it has on the most vulnerable members of society. 18.2. Alcohol is a major public health issue in New Zealand. The 2016/2017 New Zealand Health Survey found 1 in 5 adults (20%) drank alcohol in a way that could harm themselves or others. 13 Alcohol contributes to acute harm, over 200 diseases and an estimated 800 deaths a year. 14 The knock-on effects of harmful drinking on others is inflicting an unacceptably high price on families, communities, and society as a whole. Alcohol related harm was estimated to be cost society $4.4 billion in 2005/2006. 15 As alcohol is widely available and promoted in New Zealand, changing the drinking culture will require changes to the regulatory environment. 12 Canterbury District Health Board. 2012.

Raising the alcohol price, in line with the 5+ Solution, is an internationally evidence-based way to reduce alcohol-related harm 16 , including a range of negative health outcomes. 17 Evidence shows that when prices go up, alcohol consumption goes down. 18 Systematic reviews have shown increases in alcohol prices reduce alcohol-related disease and injury outcomes, alcohol-impaired driving, motor vehicle crashes, motor vehicle injuries, death from cirrhosis, alcohol dependence, sexually transmitted infections, and violence. 19 In addition, suicide rates among young men are responsive to alcohol price increases. 20 18.4. The cost of alcohol has been shown to be an important determinant of consumption across a range of drinking groups, including young people and heavy drinkers. 21 18.5. Taxation is likely to be a more-cost effective means of reducing alcohol-related problems than other alcohol polices. 22 18.6. An increase in the excise rate of between 50 to 100 percent is likely to give major net benefits to the New Zealand economy, as detailed in the Law Commissions’ 16 Anderson P, et al. (2009).

It concludes that significant excise rate increases meet the public interest test as indicated by its benefit-cost analysis. There would also be savings and reductions in alcohol- related crime, improvements in family wellbeing and many other benefits associated with decreased alcohol consumption. 24 18.7. Increasing the excise rate by 50 percent would increase the price of alcohol by an average 10 percent, which has been estimated to reduce overall consumption by 5 percent, and possibly more long term. 25 The increased costs borne by non- excessive drinkers are modest: the reduction in the external cost of heavy and moderate drinkers is greater than any welfare loss experienced by light drinkers who never drink heavily or regularly. 18.8. Excise tax should be adjusted so that alcohol products are taxed directly on level on ethanol. A single tax rate would eliminate existing anomalies and ensure the tax system is based on the actual alcohol content, encouraging consumers toward lower price, lower strength beverages. Taxing on ethanol level may also help reduce inequalities, especially among heavy drinkers. 23 New Zealand Law Commission. (2010).

The CDHB recommends using revenue from an increase in excise tax on alcohol to reduce harm amongst high-risk consumers. 19.1. The tax-payer funded health system absorbs significant costs due to alcohol related harm. Health-related alcohol harm includes poor mental health, cancer, acute injuries and chronic disease. In Canterbury alone, alcohol-related harm was estimated to have cost the health system $62.8 million in 2011. 26 19.2. Approximately 23,000 people are treated in the publicly-funded health system each year for alcohol or other drug addictions 27 and 3.9% of health loss from all causes in New Zealand (measured in disability-adjusted life-years) is estimated to be attributable to alcohol. 28 19.3. The revenue from any increase in excise tax should be used for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation services. This position is supported by the New Zealand Medical Association. 29 An increase in price resulting from a tax increase is likely to be more acceptable to the drinking public if there is a transparent process whereby the revenue generated goes specifically to evidence-based harm reduction strategies. 19.4. Insufficient funds are currently allocated for the prevention of alcohol-related harm. While the Health Promotion Agency levy on alcohol products supports the provision of alcohol-related advice and research, the New Zealand alcohol excise 26 Slack, A. Nana, G. (2012).

A greater proportion of the revenue generated from alcohol excise taxation should be dedicated to fund treatment, in particular mental health and addiction services, and an increased level of inter-sectoral harm prevention strategies, increased enforcement of supply control measures, and research. Chapter 4: Taxes and Behaviour 20. The CDHB recommends continuing the regular increases on tobacco and using a proportion of the revenue from excise tax on tobacco for prevention of smoking and treatment of smoking-related conditions. 20.1. The CDHB supports the continuation of the regular tax increases on tobacco. 20.2. Increasing the price of tobacco (through taxation) acts both as a disincentive for young people to take up smoking, as well as an incentive for those who smoke to quit. The recent pattern of annual tobacco tax increases in NZ has been associated with a 23 percent reduction in tobacco consumption per adult (for the period 2010 to 2014). 31 20.3. New Zealand modelling work indicates large health cost savings from raising tobacco taxes ($3.8 billion saved over the lifetime of the current NZ population). This is even when accounting for the extra health costs from the longer lifespan of ex-smokers. 32 30 The Treasury of New Zealand Government. (2017).

Although tobacco tax is typically described as being a regressive tax overall, actual increases in this tax can be progressive due to the typically greater price sensitivity of low-income populations. Indeed, two systematic reviews indicate that tobacco price/tax increases tended to have a positive impact on equity (i.e., in terms of reduction in inequalities in smoking prevalence by socioeconomic status for both adults 33 and youth. 34 20.5. A proportion of revenue from excise tax on tobacco should be dedicated to fund better and more effective tobacco control initiatives and services. It is needed to counter tobacco control underfunding and can be highly cost effective compared to other health interventions. This is supported by the World Health Organization recommendation to earmark taxes to promote tobacco control. 35 Stop smoking services must focus on those groups with high smoking prevalence (e.g., Māori, mental health consumers) to help offset the hardship experienced by these groups when price increases. 20.6. In New Zealand, 59 percent of smokers support a rise in tobacco tax if used for quit support, especially for those most deprived and financially stressed. 36 33 Brown, T., Platt, S., & Amos, A.

The case for earmarking tobacco (and alcohol) taxes for health programmes (particularly tobacco control) is supported by a study of the experience of eight countries. All saw benefits in having a predictable, secure source of funds for long-term interventions. The fact that the fund in each country represents only a small fraction of the total health budget and efficient use of the funds and clear reporting and accountability mechanisms made it easy to address traditional arguments against earmarking taxes. 37 20.8. The current annual increases are unlikely to be strong enough to achieve Smokefree 2025 goals. 38 A series of regular tax increases, preferably at a higher level than the recent series of 10 percent annual increases, should be implemented up to 2025, accompanied by other enhanced tobacco control policies such as funding for prevention and quit programmes (ideally all funded with tobacco tax revenue). Although the data research is inconclusive on which approach is best in the long run, there may be advantages to switching to less frequent but larger increases to reach 2025 goals. Advantages include stimulating more attention by media and smokers which may stimulate more interest in quitting and being harder for the tobacco industry to smooth out price increases.

New Zealand currently has the third highest prevalence of obesity of all OECD countries, and our rates are rising. 40 Over a quarter of adults in Canterbury are obese. 41 This obesity epidemic imposes a heavy cost burden on the government, particularly via demand on health services. Such demand may be preventable should effective measures to reduce rates of obesity be implemented. 21.3. The World Health Organisation recommends tax on sugar-sweetened beverages as an effective fiscal measure to reduce risk of obesity, particularly in low-income consumers and children who are most influenced by price. 42 A tax on sugary drinks is a simple action that as part of a comprehensive suite of initiatives is likely to reduce the burden of dental caries, unhealthy weight gain, and type 2 diabetes. A sugary drinks tax is a straightforward action that would demonstrate serious effort to address childhood obesity and raise the public’s awareness of the harms sugary drinks pose to health. 21.4. Taxes affect consumer prices and can be used to make unhealthy beverage options more expensive relative to healthy beverage options, thereby 39 Health Promotion Agency. (2014).

Many studies have found that groups most at risk from obesity have greater price sensitivity. 45 21.5. Several countries have introduced taxes on SSBs and there is emerging evidence to support their effectiveness. France implemented an excise tax on all soft drinks in 2011, Mexico introduced a 10 per cent tax on SSBs in 2014 and the United Kingdom have announced a tax on SSBs will be introduced from 2018. A recent study of the tax in Mexico showed that the tax on SSBs was associated with reductions in purchases of taxed beverages and increases in purchases of untaxed beverages. 21.6. The tax on sugar-sweetened beverages was introduced in Mexico in January 2014 increasing their price by around 10%. Evaluation of the tax on purchases found that by December 2014, purchases of taxed drinks had declined by 12 43 Cornelsen L, Carreido A. (2015). Health-related taxes on food and beverages.

As well as delivering price signals to consumers, a tax on sugar sweetened beverages may also have an impact on sugar consumption by encouraging product reformulation to reduce sugar levels. The “soft drink industry levy” which in being introduced in the United Kingdom (UK) appears to have resulted in a reported 10 percent reduction in the average sugar content of energy drinks in the UK – prior to the levy even coming into force. 47 21.8. In relation to the appropriate tax rate, the CDHB notes recent research which has shown that reduction in consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is proportionate to the amount of tax applied. 48 In New Zealand, recent research estimates that a 20 percent tax on fizzy (carbonated) drinks would prevent or postpone 67 deaths from cardiovascular disease, diabetes and diet-related cancers in New Zealand each year. 49 A tax would also reduce the prevalence of non-communicable diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. 46 Colchero MA, Popkin BM, Rivera JA, Wen Ng S.

While reports have highlighted the risk of consumers substituting unhealthy but non-taxed products as substitutes, overall, we believe that even a small shift in the right direction has positive health implications at a population level. 21.10. Health care costs in New Zealand attributable to overweight and obesity have been estimated to be $624 million. 50 Along with reducing related health care costs, a 20% tax on sugar-sweetened fizzy drinks could generate about $30 million revenue per year (factoring in reductions in consumption due to tax). 51 If other non-carbonated drinks high in sugar were included, such as sports drinks and cordials, then the revenue generated would increase. Revenue from such a tax could be used to support health promotion programmes to improve population health. Chapter 7: Environmental taxation 22. The CDHB recognises the need to efficiently reduce greenhouse gases, thought such tools as the introduction of a carbon tax. 22.1. Climate, health and equity are inseparable 52 . Globally climate change is a critical public health issue. Climate change is affecting New Zealand and the health of New Zealanders as many factors that contribute to our health and well-being are threatened by climate change. Its direct effects result from rising temperatures and changes in the frequency and strength of storms, floods, droughts, and heatwaves—with physical and mental health consequences. Climate change acts as a threat multiplier, compounding many of the issues communities already 50 Lal, A., Moodie, M., Ashton, T., Siahpush, M., and Swinburn, B. (2012). Health care and lost productivity costs of overweight and obesity in New Zealand.

Indeed, climate change is not a single- system issue but instead often compounds existing pressures on housing, food and water security, poverty, and many determinants of good health. 53 Children, the elderly, people with disabilities and chronic disease, and low-income groups are particularly vulnerable. Existing health inequalities, having an economic base invested in primary industries, housing and economic inequalities and a greater likelihood of having low-income housing in areas vulnerable to flooding and sea level rise, all make climate change a particular risk for Māori. 54 22.2. There is considerable concern to reduce energy consumption and promote the health of the environment across the New Zealand health sector. The CDHB is working to reduce our impact on the environment, having reduced our carbon emissions by 20 percent over the past three years and become Certified Emmission Measurement and Reduction Scheme (CEMARS)-certified. 22.3. Accelerated action is needed to further tackle climate change. Well-designed policies to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions will not only limit climate change and reduce the associated risks to human health but have the potential to improve population health and reduce health inequalities. There are many health co-benefits to environmental taxation, such as climate change stability, emission reductions, reduced air pollution and related mortality/morbidity. 53 Watts, N., et al. (2018).

The only effective way for the world to reduce the impact of the climate crisis is to sharply drop emissions of greenhouse gases like CO 2 . An effective way to do that is to make those emissions costly such as through a well-designed carbon taxation scheme—or a combination of carbon taxation and emissions trading scheme (ETS). 22.5. Carbon taxation creates an opportunity to improve environmental outcomes and diversify the tax base. When compared to other price-based mechanisms, carbon taxes have the broadest range, applying to all fossil fuels and all sectors, therefore supporting almost all forms of energy conservation and providing, potentially, a wide range of additional benefits. 55 Because of this broader scope, they can more easily reach individual consumers as well as industries. This can result in a greater range of wellbeing co-benefits. In addition, it may be easier to moderate inequitable effects of carbon taxes: revenue flows directly to central government and may be utilised to reduce adverse impacts on vulnerable groups such as low-income households. 56 22.6. New Zealand has among the lowest effective carbon prices in the OECD. This strengthens the case for increasing our carbon price, and for considering a broader range of pricing instruments than just the ETS. Ideally an environmental tax should reflect the social cost of carbon, such as the health damage of a tonne 55 Litman T. (2008). Carbon Taxes. "Tax What You Burn, Not What You Earn".

A carbon pricing scheme that reflects the key principles of broad coverage, predictable implementation, revenue neutrality, and protection of low-income households could create a favourable environment for addressing our climate change obligations while improving wellbeing and equity. Careful design and revenue recycling, such as for better public transport, housing insulation in low- income areas or retraining programmes for workers in carbon-intensive industries, can ensure a progressive effect and has the potential to reduce wellbeing inequalities by improving the affordability and convenience of fossil fuel alternatives. 58 57 OECD.

Its members are DHL, FedEx, TNT and UPS. CAPEC members provide daily services of time sensitive shipments to thousands of businesses of all sizes in all sectors of the New Zealand economy, as well as to the many individual consumers whose choices have been widened as a result the development of ecommerce. An efficient flow of goods is crucial to our local economy and for maintaining and growing New Zealand’s international competitiveness. CAPEC is not belligerently opposed to changes in lowering the threshold for duties and taxes. CAPEC has consistently held the view that any changes to the collection of taxes for low value goods should be underpinned by the following Guiding Principles:  Effective and efficient collection of revenue;  Competitive neutrality (between air cargo and post);  Consistent application of border clearance and taxation arrangements;  Recognition of CAPEC’s unique and essential role as a provider of time definite delivery services.  Ongoing and meaningful consultation with Government If GST was to be charged at the NZ border using the current collection method we will see the following impact: Error! Unknown document property name. Error! Unknown document property name.Error! Unknown document property name. 2  The staffing costs would increase significantly and costs would need to be passed onto the importer.  Consumers are likely to abandon goods due to the high fees which may outweigh the cost of purchase. CAPEC members carry all the risk for the resulting increase in bad debts. Shipments will need to be stored on site as CAPEC will need to collect payments prior to delivery.  CAPEC is concerned about the lack of warehousing space available because current facilities are not adequate. Currently 10% of shipments are held at the border. The amount of shipments held at the border will increase by 90% if GST/Duties were to be collected at destination.  Consumers will have estimated delays up to 10 days which undermines the express industry. CAPEC believe that the only equitable, timely and cost effective methodology that can collect GST from Low Value Goods is through collecting the GST for under $400 value goods directly at point of sale at origin. This methodology can be implemented without the need to delay the movement of goods through the border process. We understand the position taken by Government on the current inequities of GST collection between low value on shore and off shore purchases. We also believe that the consumer should be able to access the benefits of a truly global market place. With this in mind we firmly hold the position that the collection of tax must be done in a way that the cost of collection does not outweigh the amount collected, done with minimal disruption and furthermore the consumer should not have to take on additional collection transaction costs over and above that of the tax itself. Based on the above CAPEC strongly supports the offshore collection of GST and endorses the model and approach that Australia has taken. CAPEC would like representation and consultation in relation to any potential changes to the LVG threshold and any changes to the current collection at the border for tax & duty. Error!

Quay Building, Level 3, 108 Quay Street, Auckland Central 1010 l PO Box 106-056, Auckland City 1143, New Zealand l SORTED.ORG.NZ l CFFC.ORG.NZ 1 Hon Sir Michael Cullen Tax Working Group By email 30 April 2018 Dear Sir Michael Re: Future of Tax Taxes - uninteresting and opaque? Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the Tax Working Group and the important work underway. Unprecedented demographic change, combined with the globalization of trade and automation of jobs, is changing the structures of our societies and economies. The time for review is now. For most people the mechanics of how governments fund transfers and public services is uninteresting and opaque. It falls behind the important stuff such as our marriages, mortgages, children, jobs, health and hobbies. That can make change difficult because it is not understood. During the 2016 Review of Retirement Income Policies we listened to people in shopping malls, community halls, WINZ offices, churches, maraes and workplaces across New Zealand and heard myths and misunderstandings about who pays for what. People were avoiding conversations with lenders because they believed overdue debts would be written off after 5 years, Superannuitants stated that NZ Super is paid out of a central fund they contributed to across their working lives, and others explained that KiwiSaver accounts had been combined and become something called the Super Fund. At CFFC we have invested time and resource in simplifying and explaining complex and dry subjects to help people be better equipped and informed to understand some of these issues. We will be rolling out a short and hopefully compelling video series in the second half of 2018 that seeks to present the mechanics of ‘tax in and tax out’ in a clear and meaningful way. An ageing population As with many other OECD countries, New Zealand is undergoing unprecedented demographic change. Our population is ageing due to increased longevity and a lower fertility rate. The change is not a bump or a blip. It is anticipated to be a long term structural shift. Preparation for an older population needs to be active and intentional, and problematically it needs to start before the changes ahead are apparent to the taxpayer. To understand the need for those changes we are asking people to ‘see what they can’t see’, which brings with it some tensions between generations and between the needs of today and tomorrow. Health expectancy is increasing alongside life expectancy, meaning we are healthier for longer, extending our working lives and our expectations of what we can do in our ‘third age’. As health expectancy increases our view of ageing has evolved, and for many New Zealanders 65 is no longer considered old. As more of us live into our nineties (and beyond) retirement can extend to thirty years or more. It cannot best be described as one period of life but rather several, extending from ‘young-old’ through to ‘old-old’. A CFFC competition to name the three stages of retirement gave us: Discovery, followed by Endeavour and then Reflection. The last phase is where we draw our friends and family close because they hold our history. As future generations become accustomed to a hundred-year life span, it won’t be just the end years that we will do differently, we will make whole-of-life changes. We may dip in and out of education across our lives as we train and retrain for multiple careers. We will live in more houses, juggle blended families and live life with diseases that would once have killed us. Quay Building, Level 3, 108 Quay Street, Auckland Central 1010 l PO Box 106-056, Auckland City 1143, New Zealand l SORTED.ORG.NZ l CFFC.ORG.NZ 2 Increased life expectancy is a positive trend, but it raises the question: how will we pay for the additional years we live? What are our expectations of how life will be after 60, 70, 80 and 90 and who will fund it? How many of those years will be healthy and lived independently, and how many will be spent in aged care? An increase in elderly New Zealanders with higher health needs will put pressure on government funds. The role of private provision will increase Present and future governments will need to navigate the choices around reduced spend, increased taxation or higher debt but irrespective of what policy changes occur, the role of private provision will increase and the jeopardy of reaching retirement with little or nothing will be greater. This is often referred to internationally as a ‘shift in responsibility’ from governments to individuals. In reality it is complicated and funding our retired years is a complex mix of the government, individuals and families. We know from the work completed during the 2016 Review that beliefs about the right balance of responsibility varies across individuals and cultures. At the risk of sounding bleak, the ageing population and reduced dependency ratios, combined with decreasing rates of home ownership and the need for infrastructure investment, presents us with a perfect storm. There are many questions on taxation across the system that will be reviewed in response to these issues. The one we are seeking to highlight here is the tax treatment of savings. When we talk about savings we include short term savings and retirement savings (many of which are investments). ‘You’d be a mug not to’ In a nutshell and to cut to the chase, if the role of private provision is going to increase, we need to ensure that saving makes sense. At all ages. To put it colloquially, it needs to be considered a ‘no-brainer’. Financial advisers need to be able to recommend savings products over and above rental property investments without reservation. Young people need to view it as ‘the smart thing to do’ or ‘you would be a mug not to’. The wisdom of savings needs to be in the social narrative, a social norm. Our conversations at dinner, with friends, at work, need to marvel at the simple logic of it. Based on our work at CFFC and what we hear from New Zealanders, New Zealand is not there yet. In fact, for many, we seem to be some way off. While acknowledging the role of low interest rates and therefore low yield as a deterrent, the longer-term issue is the tax treatment of savings. Savings are accompanied by some resentment and a lingering suspicion that ‘you are paying several times over’, that it is ‘an uphill struggle’. This is compounded when a colleague or a friend makes more money on property. By comparison savings doesn’t ‘feel active’ or an ambitious way to grow your money because ‘it gets eroded on the way in and eroded again on returns’. One of the challenges we face in building financial capability and asking people to forego something today to save for tomorrow is our present bias. It is that same present bias that causes resentment towards the TTE nature of KiwiSaver because we upweight the importance of the money paid today and award less importance to the tax exemption on draw down. People are not always driven by rational and detailed calculations when it comes to money decisions. (It’s worth noting that the Tax Working Group members and much of Treasury are likely to be a small and unique sub-set of numerate planners, not necessarily representative of the broader population.) Our spending can be driven by FOMO, fear of ageing, peer pressure, status anxiety, cultural and social norms. The bad news is that our savings and investments are a complex mix of assumptions and beliefs, stories combined with advice and hearsay and the occasional use of a calculator. So our views on what’s smart and where we are getting short -changed matter, they impact our decisions. Recently in the US a 29-year-old outlined to me why she saved into her 401k account. She saw it as a way to ‘stash cash and avoid tax’ and therefore a way of keeping more of her income. She also kept the income on the income. She wasn’t yet thinking about the tax taken on the way out, that was years away. In the meantime, her and her friends viewed it as a ‘no-brainer’. It was something for nothing and everyone wants something for nothing. Extensions of KiwiSaver One scenario is that a revised tax treatment relates only to KiwiSaver. Quay Building, Level 3, 108 Quay Street, Auckland Central 1010 l PO Box 106-056, Auckland City 1143, New Zealand l SORTED.ORG.NZ l CFFC.ORG.NZ 3 If that were the case, it would be worth also considering the idea under construction at CFFC, a form of KiwiSaver Lite which is a short-term emergency savings account that is automated to reach a pre-set amount and then further savings divert into a main KiwiSaver account. The product is designed for those who don’t save long term because they don’t want to lock up valuable funds they may need to cover an unexpected cost or cover a redundancy or sudden drop in income. Having built up a buffer, they are more likely to save for the long term. The mechanics of how they access the buffer account and under what terms needs work. There would need to be some criteria in place. The automation of the original saving, then switching across to long term savings and switching back if the buffer is raided, delivers the cognitive ease needed to make it work. Clearly offering a tax- free path for income to move into a buffer account would be highly contentious and may be considered prohibitively expensive but in the interests of innovation in the face of sizeable challenges it shouldn’t be dismissed too easily. There may be a variation of it that works and ‘expensive’ is relative. If tax breaks are to be given to low income families that can be done in a number of ways. Short term savings or the buffer or rainy-day account make a significant difference to financial wellbeing. Unexpected costs or a drop in income are expensive if they cannot be covered by savings. The poverty premium kicks in and people borrow, often using the short term high cost credit provided by payday or second and third tier lenders with interest rates of over 30%. The snowball effect of that kind of credit reduces a family’s ability to meet their living costs which leads to more borrowing and a debt spiral. The recent ANZ report based on the Kempson model confirmed the findings of previous research locally and internationally that our ability to save is less about income and more about our habits. Regular saving even at low income levels increases financial wellbeing. KiwiSaver providers have been broadly supportive of the idea. We know that half of members don’t get the full MTC and half of that group contribute nothing. Our research tells us that’s not always an affordability problem, it’s also an access problem. While at first glance KiwiSaver Lite might pose a risk of cannibalizing funds, it has the potential to grow them and build savings habits. Housing and KiwiSaver and retirees If KiwiSaver had a favourable tax treatment relative to other saving’s products, it would also be a tax supported flow through of funds to housing as people withdraw funds for first homes. As with the buffer, while contentious I can think of worse things. There is the argument that it fuels house price increases but it probably has to join the queue behind other contributing factors. Addressing the housing question is multifaceted including increased supply, cost of credit, employment and wage growth. While prices remain high and LVR’s are in place it all also requires a deposit. In the absence of parents who can assist that requires savings and KiwiSaver has a role to play. While it depletes long term savings in the short term, it sets that individual or family up long term. Declining home ownership is a serious headwind for our retirees of the future. Paying down a mortgage over time is a brutal discipline that sucks money out of our pay-packets and slowly but surely pays down a house. At CFFC we hear from young New Zealanders who, convinced they are ‘locked out of the housing market’ and renting, spend their remaining disposable income on other things. There is not enough going into savings to compensate for home ownership. More people will reach retirement as renters at a time when the number of taxpaying workers has reduced relative to retirees. Even with an investment in affordable rental housing stock suitable for retirees, and improved tenancy laws, reaching retirement renting is problematic. In addition to the financial challenge it presents, the prospect of packing up a house and finding a new place to live because a landlord needs to sell, is daunting. As we age we value constancy, we like to know where things are, knowing our neighbours provides connections and a greater feeling of security and community. New Zealand looks healthy in aggregate but at a household level, not so much To wrap up, in aggregate New Zealand is looking healthy. Over a trillion dollars of housing assets and only 250 B in (direct) housing debt would suggest 750 B plus in equity, on paper at least. But the CFFC barometer of 11,000 interviews suggests that while around 50% of New Zealanders are doing ok and will make it to retirement with a Quay Building, Level 3, 108 Quay Street, Auckland Central 1010 l PO Box 106-056, Auckland City 1143, New Zealand l SORTED.ORG.NZ l CFFC.ORG.NZ 4 mortgage free home and savings, the remaining 50% are broken down into varying levels of financial ill-health with 13% (of the total pop) in ‘intensive care’. It is the second 50% I am the most concerned about because future governments simply will not have the funds to plug the gap between what people can provide for themselves and what they need. To repeat the earlier statement, the jeopardy of reaching retirement with little or nothing will be greater. This is an important moment in time to consider the fundamentals needed to improve the prospects of that 50% and their children. Yours sincerely Diane Maxwell Retirement Commissioner

Submission to the Tax Working Group from the Christchurch East Labour Electorate Committee 1.0 Introduction 1.1. This submission is on behalf of the Christchurch East Labour Electorate Committee (LEC). 1.2. We have read the report, the fact sheets with summaries of issues, and the data tables of the historic New Zealand data and comparative data from around the OECD. 1.3. Broadly, and as stated, these show a tax system with a high reliance on three primary sources of income, Company Tax, GST and Income Tax, all of which are, in turn, reliant on work being readily available to the majority of the population. 1.4. The uncertainty surrounding the future of work suggests other types of taxation are likely to be required to mitigate potential issues with the adequacy of revenue. 1.5. Aotearoa has issues with inequality and housing, and there are real opportunities to address these as part of a broader approach by government by making improvements to the tax system. 1.6. Several of our group are familiar with other material and consider Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” to be a seminal work in the root economic causes of inequality and potential solutions which has informed our discussion and recommendations below. 1.7. A summary of our recommendations is at the bottom of the document. 2.0 Use of the taxation system to improve public outcomes via incentives and disincentives 2.1. Taxes are collected to fund health, education, social security, police, the courts etc. Effectively, governments use the revenue to improve outcomes for New Zealanders. 2.2. As noted in the information provided by the Tax Working Group (TWG), only tobacco and alcohol are taxed with the intentions of discouraging their consumption and offsetting associated health costs. 2.3. Minimising distortion and complexity are often given as reasons to discourage the use of taxation as an incentive or disincentive, but distortion and complexity are currently caused by the addition of levies, fees and user charges, often with the intent of decreasing general taxation required, adding some level of ‘user-pays’ to acknowledge individual benefit gained (e.g. student fees), or rationing publicly-funded goods and services to avoid overuse. Fees for doctors’ visits and prescriptions are good examples of fees added for the purpose of rationing and decreasing the level of taxation required which also cause distortion and complexity elsewhere for the general public. 2.4. Conclusion: That some complexity and distortion are acceptable if they lead to improved outcomes. We believe that the balance should move toward more use of the tax system to provide targeted incentives and disincentives. 3.0 Tax incentives and disincentives for environmental objectives 3.1. Tobacco taxes have had a large impact on smoking in Aotearoa and provide something of a model for offsetting costs associated with, and discouraging use of, a product without necessarily banning it. 3.2. A carbon or other excise tax is an excellent tax disincentive for products and services that result in harm to the environment e.g. plastic packaging. Bans may still be appropriate for some products, but taxes are appropriate to otherwise discourage use and offset any associated costs e.g. cleaning up pollution. Rebates for recycling environmentally-friendly packaging is also a viable option to consider e.g. 10c to return glass bottles to a recycling depot is a model used overseas to encourage the use of glass over plastic bottles. 3.3. Use of funds raised by a carbon tax to subsidise climate-friendly products and services is our recommended option to provide for incentives to increase the uptake of environmentally friendly goods and services e.g. additional funding for public transport, insulation, electric vehicles, integrated solar power systems with powerwall batteries (to minimise the impact on the grid of these products and decrease the total generation required). Funding housing improvements such as insulation can also improve public health outcomes. 3.4. We note the current Emissions Trading Scheme is an attempt to promote similar environmental outcomes. Such a scheme is unlikely to achieve equivalent or better environmental outcomes than carbon tax. 3.5. Conclusion: That carbon tax or other taxes should be used to disincentivise or minimise use of environmentally harmful products and services and funds raised by such taxes used to offset costs and incentivise environmentally-friendly products and services. 4.0 Tax incentives and disincentives for public health objectives 4.1. Tobacco taxes are the epitome of the successful application of taxation to public health policy, but the opportunity is also there to use taxation to incentivise and promote healthy eating and other public health objectives. This is most simply done with GST reductions as is currently the case for exporters. 4.2. Fruit and vegetables, sanitary products, toothpaste and sunscreen are all products which fit the description of being desirous in terms of public health policy and objectives, but there are no doubt others. 4.3. The information provided uses the term ‘exempt’, but we prefer to set GST on relevant goods and services at 0 (often referred to as being zero-rated), similar to export income, so that businesses are still able to claim GST on purchases as otherwise the benefits are small. This currently promotes and incentivises exporting and would presumably do the same for sales of fruit and vegetables and other examples. Naturally, exports are not sold here, so are not required to charge GST on sales, but being permitted to claim GST on purchases results in regular GST refunds which, in turn, provides a clear incentive. 4.4. There is some complexity and cost involved in differing GST rates with corner cases, updating software and cash registers all being issues, but we consider that the benefits outweigh those costs. Transitional arrangements or subsidies may have to be considered for small retailers or announcing any changes well in advance of the effective date. Having any changes take effect on 1 April would also assist as changing GST rates partway through a financial year creates additional difficulties. 4.5. Excise taxes on other products to discourage their use or consumption fits with this model – sugar-laden carbonated drinks and processed foods with high sugar and/or high fat would be one clear place to start as they are known to be a major cause and factor in the significant public health costs of type 2 diabetes, with very limited benefits. 4.6. Conclusion: That not charging GST on appropriate products and extending excise taxes to sugar-laden carbonated drinks and high fat and high sugar processed foods would promote public health objectives, help offset known public health costs and incentivise healthful food choices further. 5.0 Reduction of inequality and improving housing affordability using wealth tax 5.1. We support using the taxation system as part of a broader plan to address New Zealand’s current inequality and housing affordability issues. These issues are illustrated well in the information provided by our placement in the OECD inequality rankings and very high ratios of median incomes to median house prices in our cities particularly. 5.2. We believe that a wealth tax (including land but excluding the family home) is the best option to achieve both goals. 5.3. There is currently minimal tax on accumulated wealth as tax is only levied on any taxable income earned by the assets, not the assets themselves. 5.4. This does not incentivise productive use of assets such as houses and land or incentivise investing in more productive assets such as shares. 5.5. Inland Revenue figures show a surprisingly small number of high wealth individuals pay individual income tax at the highest rate which suggests they are not paying an amount of tax commensurate with their total wealth. While this will occasionally be caused by a bad year, it is more likely to be caused by structuring affairs to avoid the highest tax rates. Wealth tax would help eliminate any advantage gained by such structuring. We acknowledge that any wealth taxation will need to be carefully structured to maximise the broad base of the tax and minimise avoidance. 5.6. Wealth tax should be levied at a low rate on total investments in financial, property and personal assets, with the family home being exempt in line with the terms of reference. We would also exempt some assets as is currently the case for income support e.g. family vehicles, household effects. Another administratively simpler option would be to levy a wealth tax on all assets above a set figure e.g. $1 million. 5.7. One potential collection method is through insurance companies as most wealthy individuals and families insure their assets, but recent money laundering and real estate taxation laws have also shown that a government has options to enforce the disclosure and reporting of relevant information where deemed necessary. Requiring insurance companies to obtain IRD numbers of all house, contents and vehicle policy holders and disclose the value of assets insured to Inland Revenue would be another option to ensure compliance and collection. 5.8. Wealth tax should slowly reduce housing prices (or cause smaller price increases) as properties beyond the family home are taxed which reduces their value to investors while providing another form of revenue. 5.9. French Economist Thomas Piketty has shown conclusively in his excellent work “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” that where the rate of return on capital is higher than the growth rate of the economy, wealth accumulates and inequality worsens. Using the revenue generated by a wealth tax to reduce the GST rate, either generally or for specific proposals as outlined in section 4 above, or reduce the lowest income tax rate further, would be some options to reduce inequality without increasing transfers or increasing tax revenue above 30% of GDP. 5.10. Land tax is a less complex option which we would also support, also to be levied at a low rate. Land tax could be easily collected by territorial authorities with rates, although this is complicated by family homes being exempt. 5.11. We considered capital gains tax, but consider that a wealth or land tax would be more in keeping with current design goals as they would be broader in application and less complex to implement than capital gains tax as well as having a higher impact on inequality and house prices. The immediate impact and therefore revenue also allows more rapid implementation of other potential tax decreases elsewhere. 5.12. Conclusion: Wealth tax (or land tax) can be used to potentially reduce housing prices and income tax or GST, all of which decrease inequality and improve housing affordability. There will be some challenges in capturing wealth correctly and minimising avoidance, but these are not insurmountable challenges. We considered capital gains tax, but believe wealth or land tax are less complex, broader in application and more immediate in their impact and therefore ability to lower other taxes. 6.0 Other matters 6.1. We believe tax revenue as a percentage of GDP is too low when compared to OECD averages, particularly given our small size and generous superannuation scheme, as that suggests we are underspending elsewhere to make up for it. This is borne out in part by the use of other fees and levies being charged as the total spending has arguably not changed, just the method of revenue collection. 6.2. We also believe there is room to add an additional bracket with a higher rate e.g. 45% above $120,000 as part of reducing inequality, but acknowledge that these are outside the terms of reference. 6.3. While not stated by TWG as something to examine, we consider that fixed charges and fees for essential government services are regressive in nature, and reducing or eliminating these using funding from taxation should be part of any plan to reduce inequality. Increasing funding for public transport to decrease fares and prescription subsidies to decrease fees are two highly relevant examples. 6.4. A lower company tax rate for small companies seems unlikely to have much impact as they are mostly owned by New Zealanders who pay tax at their marginal income tax rate as shareholder salaries, rather than through the Company Tax regime. 7.0 Summary of recommendations 7.1. We support directly using the taxation system, through incentives and disincentives, to improve outcomes for Aotearoa and New Zealanders, particularly environmental and public health objectives. 7.2. We support tax incentives for increasing the uptake of climate-friendly products and services, and tax disincentives for products and services that result in environment harm e.g. a carbon tax. 7.3. We support eliminating GST on categories of goods for the purposes of improving public health e.g. fruit and vegetables, sanitary items, sunscreen and toothpaste. We prefer zero- rating over exemption as exemption does not provide a large enough benefit and would be in line with current treatment of exporters for public benefit. 7.4. We support using the taxation system as part of a broader plan to address New Zealand’s current inequality and housing affordability issues. We recommend a wealth tax in recognition of the fact that there is currently minimal tax on accumulated wealth as tax is only levied on any taxable income earned by the assets, not the assets themselves, which does not incentivise productive use of assets such as houses and land. Such a tax should be levied at a low rate on total investments in financial, property and personal assets. Land tax is a less complex option which we would also support, also to be levied at a low rate. We prefer wealth or land tax to a capital gains tax. 7.5. While it is acknowledged that these are outside the terms of reference, for the sake of completeness, we advocate for the position that the taxation overhaul not be revenue- neutral: we support a modest increase in the total tax take, in view of the evidence that Aotearoa has a lower tax revenue than the OECD average (34 vs 32, including local government). We also prefer a more progressive income tax structure with an additional top rate for very high earners. 8.0 Conclusions 8.1. There is room to address matters of public policy using taxation e.g. health, environment, inequality and housing. A lower GST rate, either generally or targeted to specific products or categories of products, potentially supports all of these goals. Decreasing the lowest income tax rate is an additional option to improve inequality. Funding these and other worthwhile environmentally-friendly options with carbon and wealth taxes is a way of diversifying the tax base in view of upcoming challenges to Aotearoa and our current worker-reliant base.

Yours faithfully Craigs Investment Partners Limited Cameron Watson Stephen Jonas Quality of Advice Manager Head of Client Services \[1\] \[1\] \[1\]\[1\] 2 Introduction We commend the TWG Submissions Background Paper. It provides a thought provoking overview of the risks and challenges facing our tax system. In particular, our ageing demographic brings into focus the obvious pressure this will bring to bear on superannuation and healthcare costs. Environmental issues, retirement savings, global equalisation of company tax rates and fairness across the tax base are among the other important issues discussed in the paper. As investment advisers, not tax experts, we have focused our comments on the areas where we believe we have most to add, namely investment and retirement savings. As requested on the TWG website, we have kept our submission brief. We outline our major points and provide recommendations under four areas; 1. Financial literacy 2. Tax neutrality across asset classes 3. Consistent taxation methodology across investments 4. Savings incentives Our submission 1. Financial literacy We sense two themes underpinning this report, and many other similar reports over recent decades, are the vexed questions of how to lift savings, and how to channel more of these savings into productive assets. Tax settings are clearly an important factor. Tax undoubtedly influences investor decisions on how much to save, and on what assets to buy. We also believe financial literacy has the potential to play a central role in addressing these issues. People who have a broad appreciation of some key investment concepts such as ‘the how and why to save’, the power of compounding, and an appreciation of risk and the role of diversification, are likely to make more informed investment decisions. When people think about saving and investment, these factors should ideally take priority over tax. For this reason, we believe financial literacy should be a component of any government strategy on the taxation of savings. 3 2. Tax neutrality across asset classes From an investment perspective, we believe the overriding principle of taxation policy should be to make the tax impost as agnostic as possible across asset classes (cash, bonds, listed property, shares, rental properties and the increasingly long list of alternative investments like cryptocurrencies, gold, art and so on). This neutrality ensures taxation does not drive investment decisions. A person’s portfolio should be constructed based on their risk profile and long term financial goals, not tax. Material variability in after-tax returns across asset classes can lead to inefficient asset allocations. The TWG recognises the importance of minimising the differences in the tax treatment of different investments on page 39 of the Submissions Background Paper. We agree with the TWG that the consistent treatment of different investments should improve both fairness and efficiency. Unfortunately, the current situation in New Zealand is far from neutral across asset classes. This is clearly illustrated by figure 21 on page 40 of the Submissions Background Paper (copied below). The tax impost on cash deposits is nearly double that on residential rental property. This inequity across asset classes has obvious implications for investment decisions and, from the government’s perspective, tax revenue. In 2009, the IRD estimated the value of the residential rental property market for the Tax Working Group at $200 billion 1 . At this time, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) estimated the total housing stock as being worth $578 billion 2 . Based on the IRD’s estimate, rental properties accounted for some 34% of total residential property. 1 A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future, Report of the VUW Tax Working Group, January 2010 2 RBNZ housing statistics – Housing M10, rbnz.govt.nz 4 Taking the December 2017 RBNZ total housing stock figure of just over $1 trillion, and assuming rentals represent the same proportion of total housing, infers $350 billion is invested in residential rental property in New Zealand. By comparison there is currently $47 billion invested in KiwiSaver 3 . Given the size of the residential rental market and its relative tax impost, aligning this asset’s tax profile with other asset classes would clearly lift government revenue. Recommendations a. Better align the tax impost on rental property with other asset classes – Rental property is the obvious outlier asset class from a taxation perspective. It incurs a significantly lower tax burden than the other investment assets. We note the government is already taking steps to address this with the recent extension to the bright line test for the application of capital gains tax from two years to five years and with the March 2018 proposal to ring-fence losses on rental properties 4 . We suggest these measures should be complemented with a capital gains tax on realised gains for this asset class. Together, these policy settings may better align the tax rate on rental property with other investment assets. b. Inflation indexing should be considered – Nominal returns are taxable. People who invest in cash and bonds tend to be more detrimentally affected by taxation as generally a higher proportion of their total return (interest) is impacted by inflation. The CWG should consider some form of inflation indexing to mitigate the unfair impact of inflation on investors in cash and bonds. This protection is warranted as, in our view, deposits and other low-risk fixed income is often the preferred investment of less sophisticated investors. c. Potentially lower the FDR 5% rate – The FDR rate of 5% per annum was established 10 years ago. Interest rates and global dividend yields have fallen since then and the appropriateness of retaining a 5% rate should be reviewed. A lower rate of 3% to 4% should be considered, along with a set review period, perhaps five yearly. 3 RBNZ KiwiSaver statistics – KiwiSaver T43, rbnz.govt.nz 4 IRD Issues Paper, Ring-fencing rental losses, 28 March 2018 5 3. Consistent taxation methodology across investments Not only does the rate of tax impost differ across asset classes, but so does the calculation method. Cash and bonds are subject to the financial arrangement rules, local shares are under the dividend-only approach, rental properties are taxed on net rents with no capital gains taxed if held for more than five years, while global shares are taxed under the foreign investment fund regime, the mainstay of which is a deemed taxable fair dividend rate (FDR) of 5% per annum. Recommendations a. Consider aligning methodologies where possible - While we believe it would be beneficial to simplify this situation and apply a standard approach across all asset classes, in practice this may prove challenging given the differing nature of asset classes. Injecting a capital gains tax on rental property would add another ‘unique’ approach for a single asset class. However, we believe the alignment of tax rates across asset classes is more important than having a consistent methodology. The different tax methodologies used for local shares and global shares is an obvious distinction that warrants discussion. Local shares are generally taxed on dividends only while global shares have been taxed under the Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) regime since 2007. They were previously treated in the same way as local shares and only dividends were taxable. The FIF regime is complex and has a perceived additional tax impost over and above local shares. We understand it is also fundamentally different from any other tax in New Zealand, and perhaps globally, in that it is effectively a tax on unrealised capital gains. The fact that, if net dividend income is insufficient, underlying assets may need to be sold to provide cash to pay the tax is out of step with the structure of capital gains taxes overseas. These apply only to realised gains, which provides the liquidity needed to fund the tax. This fundamental flaw means FDR could not be applied to less liquid asset classes, like rental property. In our view, the FIF regime has only been tenable since its introduction a decade ago because investors have drawn on other cash, or have been able to sell some global shares. We also note that this invokes additional costs on these investors as selling assets incurs transaction costs. These factors have undoubtedly led to reluctance from some investors to invest in global shares, which undermines prudent diversification. Data on how much impact it has had on weightings to this asset class is difficult to ascertain as other factors are also at play, such as the strong performance of local shares over the past decade. Local investors we deal with have become accustomed to the FIF regime and investment firms now have well-embedded reporting systems. However, given the increased global mobility of labour and capital, we believe the fact that the FIF regime is out of step with other capital gains tax methodologies around the world should be recognised and considered as part of this review. 6 b. Local equities, capital versus revenue account – An issue that arose when the PIE regime was established is that PIE fund managers are able to actively buy and sell local equities on capital account while private investors cannot. While most private investors, in our view, take a long-term approach when owning shares, there are some who prefer a more active approach. The taxation certainty provided to fund managers under the PIE regime is not available to private investors. This uncertainty creates deadweight costs for private investors and is inequitable. A consistent approach which is fair to both PIE managers and private investors should be considered. 4. Savings incentives KiwiSaver has been an indisputable success since its launch a little over a decade ago. The tax incentives on KiwiSaver have clearly supported this growth. Recognising the social and economic benefits that accrue from a higher savings rate, we believe there is scope to further lift tax incentives in KiwiSaver. Being mindful of the TWG’s mandate to be fiscally neutral, lifting the tax revenue on rental property would, we believe, provide the scope to raise savings incentives. Recommendations a. Retirement savings incentives could be boosted – The key taxation incentive in New Zealand is the differential between the Prescribed Investor Rate (PIR) tax rate on Portfolio Investment Entities (PIEs) and personal tax rates. There is also an annual member tax credit of a maximum of $521.43. As KiwiSaver balances continue to build, this will become less material. The current incentive provided by the PIR rates is small as the differential between the PIR rates and personal rates is modest. Lower PIR rates may help encourage more New Zealanders to use KiwiSaver as their preferred long-term savings vehicle. More compelling incentives are required in our view, to balance the ‘locked-up’ nature of KiwiSaver. Tax policy could be used to boost savings in New Zealand by reducing PIR rates given 90% of retirement income is generated by (compounding) investment income 5 . As noted in the Submissions Background Paper, New Zealand has a TTE approach to the taxation of retirement savings. We believe this should be shifted towards an EET approach. Tax on investment returns is a significant cost borne by those saving for retirement in financial assets, like cash, shares and KiwiSaver. As such, an EET approach can provide a material boost to the ultimate value of a saver’s retirement nest-egg 6 . b. Apply PIE rates to directly held investments – Many people prefer to save outside KiwiSaver or PIEs. They should be able to apply the PIR tax rates to these direct investments as well. 5 2011 Savings Working Group, referenced by Terry Baucher on interest.co.nz, 29 August 2017, Why KiwiSaver and Bitcoin mean some form of comprehensive capital taxation is inevitable 6 The tax barrier to retirement prosperity in New Zealand, Financial Services Council, 2013

CNI Iwi Holdings Limited | P O Box 1592 | Rotorua 3040 | Tel 027 9283423 | 30 April 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 WELLINGTON Tēnā koe TAX WORKING GROUP FUTURE OF TAX: SUBMISSIONS BACKGROUND PAPER CNI Iwi Holdings Limited is writing to submit on the Tax Working Group’s Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper (“the submissions paper”). We would like to thank the Tax Working Group (“the TWG”) for the opportunity to submit on the submissions paper and would like to comment on some key areas that are of particular relevance and significance to CNI Iwi Holdings Limited. CNI IWI HOLDINGS LIMITED – WHO WE ARE CNI Iwi Holdings Limited is owned in equal shares by PSGE’s of: Ngāti Whakaue, Ngāti Rangitihi, Te Pumautanga o Te Arawa, Ngāti Tūwharetoa, Ngāti Manawa, Ngāi Tūhoe, Raukawa and Ngāti Whare. The Board are responsible for holding and safeguarding CNI forest lands on behalf of CNI Iwi shareholders until 2043 when the forests will return to the ultimate beneficiaries. CNI Iwi Holdings Limited’s current asset base at the end of 2017 was $285 million. CONTEXT OF THE TREATY OF WAITANGI The eight iwi of the CNI Forests Iwi Collective signed a Deed of Settlement with the Crown on 25 June 2008 for the settlement of historical claims in relation to the Central North Island Forests Land. The subsequent Settlement Legislation transferred ownership of the land from the Crown to the Trustee to be held on the terms of the Trust set out in the Trust Deed. The settlement included ownership of the land, but did not include rights to current forest plantation crop growing on the land. The Deed provided for the Crown to provide Financial Redress and Commercial Redress. The financial redress included payment of all accumulated rentals of Crown Licence Payments accumulated since inception of Licence payments under the Crown Forests Act 1989. On 1 July 2009, the Crown returned 176,000ha of central north island land leased to forestry companies along with $284million of accumulated rentals. Under the Emissions Trading Scheme, the Crown issued 18 NZU’s per planted hectare. CNI Iwi Holdings Limited | P O Box 1592 | Rotorua 3040 | Tel 027 9283423 | In the Settlement process, certain assets were agreed upon and accepted by CNI Iwi, on the understanding that the tax framework would apply in a particular way in respect of these. When CNI Iwi settled with the Crown, they negotiated and settled in the context of the taxation framework at that time. If some of the proposals in the current TWG’s submissions paper were known then, we consider that the negotiated outcomes would have been significantly different. This holds particularly true for land and assets as any taxes imposed on these would significantly impact on the value of these assets (discussed further below in our submission). While CNI Iwi Holdings Limited understands that minor changes will be made to New Zealand’s tax system over time (including changes that will affect Māori organisations), these are potential significant and substantial changes that will have a material impact to the detriment of the Māori economy. It is in this context that CNI Iwi Holdings Limited makes its submission to the TWG and we set out below the key issues that we believe the TWG should consider. SUBMISSION ON KEY ISSUES 1. Māori authority regime 1.1 CNI Iwi Holdings Limited considers that the Māori authority regime is working well and operates effectively to meet the needs of Members. 1.2 The Māori authority regime has been in place for some time and its purpose to provide an appropriate tax framework for assets to be held in collective ownership is being achieved. In CNI Iwi Holdings Limited’s view, the current framework works well in serving this purpose. Māori authorities are an important feature of the Māori governance and asset ownership landscape that must continue for generations to come. 1.3 Some of the attributes of the Māori authority regime include an income tax rate reflective of the marginal tax rate of Members, low compliance costs, refundable credits and the removal of the need for most Members to complete an income tax return (at least to the extent that they would need to claim or pay the difference between the Māori authority tax rate and their own personal tax rate). These are attributes that CNI Iwi Holdings Limited believe should remain in place given the underlying policy rationale of having tax levied at a rate approximating the marginal tax rate of Members. 1.4 Māori authorities are an integral part of the administration of the tax system, not only for Members but also more generally. For some Members, their most significant interaction with the tax system other than PAYE is through the Māori authority regime, which subject to minor adjustment, meets the needs of Members. CNI Iwi Holdings Limited | P O Box 1592 | Rotorua 3040 | Tel 027 9283423 | 1.5 We would be very concerned if changes were proposed that would impact on the ability of Māori authorities to hold and manage their assets through a collective vehicle and for the tax on income earned to approximate the tax rate of the Members. This is particularly so given the inter-generational view that is taken to management of the putea that means that not all income is distributed in each year and therefore accumulated income should continue to be taxed at the marginal tax rate of Members and any tax refund or top up for individual Members to occur on distribution. 2. Land tax 2.1 CNI Iwi Holdings Limited does not support the potential introduction of a land tax as the cost of this would be born disproportionately by Māori. 2.2 Under the Treaty of Waitangi, Māori negotiated in good faith for redress for historic grievances and return of land illegally taken by the Crown. As part of the process, iwi and Māori received land from the Crown, as well as other assets, as full and final settlement / redress for historic grievances. As a result, Māori hold a significant portion of freehold land in New Zealand and by virtue of this would suffer the greatest impact if a land tax were to be introduced. A land tax would, in effect, be a tax on Māori. 2.3 A land tax will decrease the effective value of the land received and held by Māori, significantly reducing the redress provided under the Settlement process. 2.4 Many iwi and Māori organisations may not be able to absorb the impact of the decrease in effective value or fund a land tax particularly where a significant amount of the land transferred through the Treaty settlement process generates very low returns as it is classified as cultural land, is poorly productive land or is encumbered by existing rights (for example, Crown Forest licenses) that impact on the financial return. A land tax may force Māori to sell the very land that was transferred to them in settlement of the historical grievances committed against them by the Crown. 2.5 Whilst we do not support a land tax in any form, if a land tax is to be introduced, land transferred as redress under a Treaty settlement should be excluded from such a tax. 2.6 If a land tax were to be imposed on all land including land transferred as redress under a Treaty settlement CNI Iwi Holdings Limited would need to reconsider its position given that past claims will be negatively impacted in a significant manner. 2.7 While CNI Iwi Holdings Limited understands that minor changes will be made to New Zealand’s tax system over time (including changes that will affect Māori organisations), a land tax would be a significant and substantial change that would have a material impact on Māori. CNI Iwi Holdings Limited | P O Box 1592 | Rotorua 3040 | Tel 027 9283423 | 3. Capital gains tax 3.1 CNI Iwi Holdings Limited do not support the potential introduction of a capital gains tax, for many of the reasons noted above in relation to a potential land tax. 3.2 The introduction of a capital gains tax would again be born disproportionately by Māori as it would largely apply to land. 3.3 Whilst we understand the driver behind a CGT being to encourage investment in more productive or income generating assets rather than capital appreciating assets, Māori hold a disproportionate proportion of low income generating capital assets (particularly land) and are not afforded such flexibility to simply divest those assets in favour of other assets. As such, a CGT is likely to negatively impact Māori. 3.4 Again, Māori negotiated and settled with a particular taxation framework in mind. If a CGT had been in contemplation at the time of Settlement, CNI Iwi considers the outcomes from negotiations would have been substantially different. 3.5 A CGT will decrease the effective value of assets and land received by CNI Iwi significantly reducing the redress provided under the Settlement process from that which was expected and negotiated. 3.6 If a CGT was to be imposed on all land including land transferred as redress under a Treaty settlement CNI Iwi would need to reconsider its position given that the basis of past claims will be negatively impacted in a significant manner. 3.7 If a capital gains tax is to be implemented, property transferred as redress under a Treaty Settlement should be excluded, it should only apply on a realised basis and roll-over relief should be provided to allow asset ownership reorganisations to take place without tax consequences. 4. Environmental tax 4.1 The submissions paper queries whether the tax system does enough to maintain natural capital, being the natural environment needed to support life and human activity (as per Treasury’s ‘Four Capitals’). 4.2 Environmental sustainability, particularly the preservation and protection of the natural environment and resources for future generations, is a key concern for CNI Iwi Holdings Limited. 4.3 The relationship with the natural environment is at the heart of our kaupapa \[purpose\] and much of our constitutional documents and strategic plans give expression to our relationship with the natural resources / taonga. Our lands and environment have always been fundamental to our identity and the identity of our Members / wider whānau. CNI Iwi Holdings Limited | P O Box 1592 | Rotorua 3040 | Tel 027 9283423 | 4.4 As such, CNI Iwi Holdings Limited invest considerable money and resources towards the preservation of the environment in honouring the CNI Iwi Holdings Limited values of kaitiakitanga and through our role as kaitiaki of the environment within our rohe. This is over and above what may be required either by statute or regulation. 4.5 Environmental taxes are a blunt tool, often not well directed and penalise rather than incentivise taxpayers to do more. Whilst we are supportive of more being done to protect, preserve and restore the environment we consider that there may instead be a place in the tax system for incentives, with tax rewarding positive actions; for example tax credits or greater deductions for those investing in environmentally friendly alternatives or other environmental initiatives. 4.6 Consideration should also be given to when there are specific tax regimes that are targeted at environmental sustainability measures (such as pollution mitigation), the tax policy should err on the side of deductibility so that tax is not a barrier to more being done. Often this expenditure ends up as ‘black hole’ expenditure, with no immediate deduction available and no depreciation deduction certainty. 4.7 CNI Iwi Holdings Limited would be concerned about the potential introduction of environmental taxes if the effect was to simply impose additional costs on iwi / Māori organisations that already significantly contribute to the preservation, protection and restoration of the environment. 4.8 Māori through kaitiakitanga being a key value will always play an important role in the protection, preservation and restoration of the environment. We would argue that we are best placed to determine what that contribution should look like based on our knowledge of the area and as things change from generation to generation. 4.9 We would not support additional environmental taxes that did not take into account the contribution, funds, activities and resources already directed towards the protection, preservation and restoration of the environment. For that reason we would support a framework of incentives rather than additional taxes. 5. Engagement by Māori with the tax system 5.1 Historically, Māori have had as a generalisation low levels of engagement with Inland Revenue, to the detriment of the Māori economy and in particular the next generation of rangatahi. 5.2 For example, a 33% withholding tax rate automatically applies to certain distributions / payments where the Māori organisation does not hold a Members Inland Revenue number.

We believe that the current approach to alcohol excise tax in New Zealand is not fair for the majority of New Zealanders. We believe that rates of alcohol excise tax should reflect the cost of alcohol-related harm to society. Alcohol causes more harm than any other drug available in society, e.g. tobacco, cannabis, heroin, methamphetamine. Increases in alcohol excise rates are urgently required to address the growing number of hazardous drinkers in New Zealand. In 2016, there were 179,000 more hazardous drinkers than in 2012. Almost every group defined by age, ethnicity and sex has increased their drinking since 2011. The greatest increases are among our women. There remain significant inequities in alcohol- related harm between Māori and non-Māori - these are unjust. To achieve fairness, alcohol excise taxes need to addressed · Today, alcohol is more affordable than it has ever been · New Zealanders are missing out on millions of dollars of alcohol excise tax revenue each year because wine is taxed at a level equivalent to 10% alcohol, yet levels of alcohol in a bottle of wine are typically much higher than this (e.g. 12-14%). Taxpayers are losing out on this revenue which could be used to fund essential social services. · Every year, the Government receives money from alcohol excise tax ($1 billion in 2017) but this does not come close to the annual cost of alcohol-related harm to individuals and society (around $5 billion in 2005/06). · People who don’t drink alcohol (20% of New Zealanders) and low-risk drinkers are unfairly burdened with these costs. Recommendations For a fairer and more equitable society, we recommend the following: · Increase alcohol excise rates by at least 50% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10% · Annually adjust the excise rates to take into account changes in income (and to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers) · Address rates of excise tax on wine – all wine should be taxed by alcohol content, not volume of beverage. If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be raised from being based on 10% alcohol strength to 14%. · It is preferable that all alcohol products (beer, wine, cider, spirits, etc.) be taxed by the exact amount of alcohol they contain. This is fair across all beverages. Currently, some products are taxed by volume whereas others are taxed by alcohol content. It is alcohol that causes the harm. These recommendations are fair as low income heavy drinkers are shown to benefit the most when prices of alcohol are increased. Thinking outside the system, we recommend that a Minimum Unit Pricing Policy also be implemented to address the availability of very cheap alcohol. This policy is the most fair as it targets heavy drinkers and significantly reduces inequities in alcohol-related harms between income groups. Glenn McCutcheon Error! Unknown document property name.

PO Box 11543 Wellington New Zealand Ph 04 385 8722 www.commmunityhousing.org.nz 30 April 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat via email: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz RE: Future of Tax Thank you for the opportunity to provide our perspective on how changes to the tax system can improve outcomes for New Zealanders. Community Housing Aotearoa is the peak body for New Zealand’s community housing sector, working toward All New Zealanders well-housed. Our 80 provider members house approximately 25,000 people nationally across 13,000 homes. Our 23 partner members include developers, consultants and local councils. We see several areas where tax changes can specifically improve the wellbeing and reduce the inequality of lower income households relative to higher income households. We submit that charities and other registered non-for-profit housing entities who charge below market rents should be incentivised through the tax system to increase supply of permanent social and affordable housing. Our submission asks the Tax Working Group to consider: • a GST rebate to registered Community Housing Providers incurred in the construction of new affordable homes. • development of a sophisticated, comprehensive capital gains tax on housing, that exempts genuinely adequate, permanent affordable housing for rental or shared ownership, as well as exempting one home per family. These changes will stimulate the supply of new affordable rental and ownership homes by registered Community Housing Providers and provide additional crown revenue to mitigate the impact of speculative housing investment on lower income households. The methods we propose provide for regulatory oversight, consumer protections, and retention of public benefit and crown investment through a sophisticated and simple approach. Community Housing Aotearoa supports the submissions from the community housing sector, in particular the Manawatu Community Trust for their thorough description and example of how the GST rebate could work in practice. Definitions are important In calling for all New Zealanders to be well-housed we have adopted the Human Rights Framework on adequate housing which gives us a robust and legally based definition. Adequate housing is defined in General Comment 4, CESCR, and includes 7 ‘indicators’ - security of tenure, availability of services, facilities and infrastructure, affordability, habitability, accessibility, location, and cultural adequacy. We use the internationally recognised definition of affordable as housing costs accounting for no more than 30% of a household’s income. These provisions are set out in the Our Place plan available at http://www.communityhousing.org.nz/our-place/our-place For the purposes of this submission, any housing that is able to access a tax incentive should comply with these definitions. GST Rebate The background paper clearly documents the inequality trends for households after housing costs. We also note the dramatic increases in homelessness and households on the Social Housing Register 1 requiring a rental subsidy to afford a home. The proposed massive investment in KiwiBuild is an at-scale response. Recycling the GST paid by registered Community Housing Providers on new builds back into additional homes is a complimentary action to address the housing crisis. This rebate will provide an on-going incentive to deliver new affordable homes. It will work seamlessly with other funding sources including philanthropic, private and public capital. It will provide certainty for providers as an-ongoing resource available to leverage a mix of different funding including rental subsidies as well as up-front equity. Eligibility: Only entities registered with the Community Housing Regulatory Authority under the Housing Restructuring and Tenancy Matters Act (1992) should be eligible for the rebate. In addition, only those registered entities who also have either Charitable status or Community Housing Entity 2 status should be eligible. These requirements will ensure that all benefits received and all profits are either kept by the entity, or if profits are distributed or applied to another person or entity, they can only go to: • the entity's beneficiaries or clients • another community housing entity that has this exemption • another tax charity • organisations entitled to receive charitable donations. Rebate Process: Eligible entities would submit required documentation to IRD justifying the requested reimbursement amount. At a minimum, this would include: • GST receipts • Code of Compliance Certificate 1 http://www.msd.govt.nz/documents/about-msd-and-our-work/work-programmes/social-housing/housing- quarterly-report-dec2017.pdf 2 http://www.ird.govt.nz/charitable-organisations/chart-orgs-comm-housing/ Compliance Period: We recommend that any property receiving the GST rebate be retained as affordable for a period of at least 15 years. For clarity, we specifically cite the points made in Manawatu Community Trust submission: • As a charitable trust or other registered housing provider we would develop new affordable rental accommodation. • GST on expenses for the development would be captured as an adjustment on our return. • A matching amount would be recorded on our balance sheet as a liability. • We would be required to make a declaration each year that the assets remain in use for affordable housing, and this declaration would be auditable (we could also be required to disclose this as part of our financial statements). • If we sell the developed housing asset within a specified time period – say 15 years – then we would be required to pay the amount of the liability to the IRD. • If we keep the developed asset for affordable housing for the required time period, then we would be allowed to write the liability off. The housing provider must have a strong enough balance sheet to be able to carry impact of the GST amount for the specified time period (15 years in the example above). We believe this is necessary to ensure an element of sustainability in that providers will need to have sufficient assets to balance the carrying of this liability, and that the assets will continue to be used for the purposes of affordable housing. In other jurisdictions such as California, public benefits provided to affordable housing have compliance periods of up to 55 years, managed through a publicly recorded Regulatory Agreement. If concerns of the Tax Working Group are that the public benefit provided by the GST rebate should result in a compliance period longer than 15 years, we would be supportive of that approach so long as there is a clear and transparent method for satisfying the compliance period, and subsequent write off of the liability over time. We suggest that a measure of success of this tool would be on two fronts: • the number of new affordable homes delivered (that would not have been built otherwise) • the number of affordable homes that pass over to full market sale, and the successful capture of the GST rebate at that time. These two measures ensure that the rebate acts as a stimulus for the supply of genuinely affordable housing, as well as payment of the GST when that unit no longer meets the regulatory tests for affordability Monitoring: The Community Housing Regulatory Authority monitors the activities of its registered entities annually 3 . This monitoring activity includes the mandatory filing of audited financial statements, ensuring oversight that the benefits received from the GST rebate are re-invested for public benefit. This existing monitoring regime means there will not be a requirement for additional monitoring expenses for IRD. Further we wish to clarify that the monitoring requirement is on the Community Housing Provider – not the individual household residing in the home. We do not believe there should be any liability on a Provider to repay the GST rebate if the resident household improves their situation; but only when the home itself is sold on the open market. If the proceeds of the sale are reinvested in new, additional social or affordable housing we suggest consideration of a mechanism to exempt that as well (see the Tax Deferred Exchange explanation below). Consequential regulatory changes: We recommend that the the two further classes of registration be activated for the Community Housing Regulatory Authority, to clarify the use of the GST rebate applies to organisations undertaking capital development and asset management, as there is a lack of clarity on these activities under the current Class I Social Landlord regulations. The eligibility provisions set out above could also be enshrined withn the Class I Social Landlord provisions, as an alternate method to ensure the public benefit is achieved. To minimise the reporting burden, we suggest that the annual returns filed by CHPs with the Community Housing Regulatory Authority should suffice for the purposes of this rebate. We are happy to provide further detail on this to the Tax Working Group if you require. Capital Gains on Residential Property We believe that speculative investment is having a direct negative impact on housing affordability. As identified in the background paper, ‘real property held for more than two years is undertaxed relative to other investments when there are capital gains’. The time is at hand to bring speculative investment in real property into alignment with other investments. This will support families who need houses as homes and not investments. To balance this change for investors and to make long term investment in homes more attractive, a deferral mechanism can be used. A method used in the USA is a tax- deferred exchange into additional rental housing 4 . This mechanism allows owners to adjust portfolios without a tax penalty when the proceeds are into like kind property. The capital gain is taxed when the asset is ultimately sold and the proceeds no longer invested into rental housing. Families rely on building household wealth and security of tenure by owning the family home. Homeownership strongly supports community wellbeing and therefore any capital gains tax must exempt the primary family residence. Families who require assistance along their journey toward homeownership should not be disadvantaged, 3 https://chra.mbie.govt.nz/registered-chp/annual-reporting/ 4 https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/like-kind-exchanges-under-irc-code-section-1031 which is why we have set out above the interface between the GST rebate and this proposed component of tax treatment. We welcome further engagement with the Tax Working Group on the matters set out above. Community Housing Aotearoa does wish to speak to this submission, and would be happy to provide further detail.

Regulation, as the primary tool available under the RMA, has proved too cumbersome to address these issues on its own 1 . As a result, there are significant uncorrected externalities that result in the overuse of resources and the loss of natural capital. These losses undermine social, and physical/financial capital, and ultimately the wellbeing of New Zealanders. 2.2 We submit that public policy interventions should be considered holistically, regardless of the spatial level of delivery. We note that other tools, rather than taxes (such as regulation, incentive schemes, and trading systems) may provide answers in some cases, and consider it is important that this review does not close off options that may be appropriate. 3.0 LOCAL GOVERNMENT RATES 3.1 It is recognised that the Tax Working Group does not plan to consider local government funding (as noted on page 22 of the background paper), but we consider that the funding of public policy issues – whether at a national or local level – are relevant to this review. Property-based rates are one of the three broad forms of tax in New Zealand (the others being income-based and consumption-based), and are administered by local authorities. It is noted that changes to the other forms of tax are likely to have implications for rates (for example, implications for the affordability of rates), and consider that the Tax Working Group should bear this in mind. 1 This issue is explored more fully in the council’s Waikato Freshwater Strategy/Te Rautaki Waimāori mō Waikato (https://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/council/policy-and-plans/waikato-regional-freshwater- strategy/). Doc # 12330321 Page 3 3.2 A specific point in relation to rates is the current situation whereby goods and services tax is charged on rates. This represents a consumption-based tax levied on a property- based tax, and we submit that rates should be exempt from GST. 4.0 FUNDING INFRASTRUCTURE 4.1 Page 10 of the background paper notes that there is a need for “...a sustainable revenue base...” to fund the Government’s operations. This objective is shared by local authorities. However, local government across New Zealand is struggling to maintain physical infrastructure, and to provide for changing demographics (such as population growth or decline). In the case of the Waikato Regional Council, there are specific challenges involving flood protection and drainage infrastructure. 4.2 One issue is that some beneficiaries of the infrastructure are exempt from paying for it, resulting in a lower than optimal level of service and/or significant subsidies from local communities to ‘external’ beneficiaries. In particular, it is noted that the Report of the Local Government Rates Inquiry 2 in 2007 found that Crown land should not be exempt from rates. We support that finding in respect of Crown land that generates revenue or creates significant economic benefits (for example, the benefits to the wider population of New Zealand from the state highway and rail networks). 2 Available via the National Archives at http://ndhadeliver.natlib.govt.nz/ArcAggregator/arcView/frameView/IE12126512/http://www.dia.govt.nz/Ag ency-Independent-Inquiry-into-Local-Government-Rates-Index

Our organisation’s vision is to make CPA Australia the global accountancy designation for strategic business leaders. Earlier this month we engaged with members via a number of events in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch to help inform our organisation’s thoughts for this submission to the Tax Working Group’s (TWG) review. On behalf of our members, and considering good economic and social policy in the public interest, we now provide the TWG with the following submission on the Future of Tax. These comments are also made taking into account how New Zealand’s tax policy could possibly be calibrated and used as a lever to ‘grow the economic pie.’ Please treat this as a public submission. If you have any queries do not hesitate to contact us. Yours sincerely Paul Drum FCPA Head of Policy \[1\] \[1\] 2 Introduction The Tax Working Group’s Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper presents the future domestic and international environmental challenges very clearly. Given time constraints CPA Australia has not sought to comment on every specific element of the paper. However, in good faith we provide the following comments. This submission essentially follows the structure of the TWG background paper, focussing on Chapters 4 -7 inclusive, as well as Appendix 2 on capital gains tax specific design issues. Our comments are also made taking into account how New Zealand’s tax policy may possibly be calibrated to be used as a lever to ‘grow the economic pie.’ However, before it deep dives into the some of the key issues raised, we make the following observations regarding successes and failures of tax reform by governments in Australia in recent years. Lessons from Australia regarding tax reform CPA Australia is of the view that there are several lessons that can be learned from Australia’s prior attempts at reforming its tax system - including both its successes and failures. One such lesson is that big reforms often take a long time to implement. This has been well expressed in the following excerpt from Australia’s A Future Tax System (AFTS) 1 : ‘From the early 1970s, a growing concern about the equity of the tax system led to the establishment of the Taxation Review Committee (Asprey et al 1975). A key theme of the Asprey Report was the need to broaden the tax base. In 1985, the Australian government released a draft White Paper which recommended a broadening of the tax base through the adoption of a broad-based consumption tax, the introduction of a capital gains tax and comprehensive taxation of fringe benefits, and a broader foreign income tax base (Australian Government 1985). The capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax were introduced in the second half of the 1980s and the GST was introduced in 2000.’ 2 In this regard, New Zealand is in a similar position. For example, there have been a number of other tax inquiries over the years that have concluded, amongst other things, that New Zealand should implement its own capital gains tax (CGT) regime. CPA Australia believes that this is one idea whose time has come – that is to broaden the New Zealand tax base and for fairness and equity reasons New Zealand should implement a comprehensive CGT. Secondly, CPA Australia suggests a ‘tax package’ – or a packaged approach - is required to ensure New Zealand has the right tax mix for the future. If new taxes are to be introduced, existing taxes such as personal income tax and company income tax should be reduced accordingly - against a framework that encourages worker participation, savings and investment, while at the same time providing governments with the revenues required to meet future community needs and expectations. The effectiveness of this so-called packaged approach was demonstrated under the Howard/ Costello coalition government in Australia in 2000 when it successfully introduced its comprehensive tax reform package ‘A New Tax System’. 3 Thirdly, for reforms to be successful it is important governments ‘take the people with them’ - effectively selling the economic and social imperatives for change. Unfortunately, this was not what 1 http://taxreview.treasury.gov.au/content/FinalReport.aspx?doc=html/publications/papers/Final\_Report\_Part\_1/index.htm 2 http://taxreview.treasury.gov.au/content/Paper.aspx?doc=html/publications/papers/report/section\_4-01.htm 3 http://archive.treasury.gov.au/contentitem.asp?ContentID=167 3 happened in Australia under the Abbott/ Hockey led government when it undertook its Tax White Paper process in 2013. In contrast, the TWG’s report to Government has the potential to inform not only the Government, but all political parties and the community in a considered and timely way to enable them to form their tax policies accordingly and take them to the New Zealand people at the next election. A fourth lesson is to have a bipartisan approach in the Parliament/ parliamentary process. This is of course easier said than done - and something that has not been achieved in Australia when it comes to holistic tax reform. Initial comments regarding the tax system Many employed individuals do not need to lodge income tax returns unless they receive ‘other income’ including foreign income, carried forward imputation credits, business income etc. Further, there are very few deductions available for such taxpayers. Accordingly, compliance with New Zealand’s tax system is very easy for many individuals with simple tax affairs. CPA Australia members are generally of the view that this simplicity should be retained. Donation credits are claimed via a process separate to the lodgment of individual tax returns. The process is relatively simple. This simple system could be expanded to claim other credits such as on environmentally friendly personal expenditure or investment in technology for school aged students. CPA members have raised the issue of whether it is appropriate to add another band to allow for a higher marginal tax rate. One suggestion is that it could apply to income over $150,000 per annum and at a rate of 37 per cent. We also note that Australia imposes income tax on individual foreign residents differently to Australian residents – that is - foreign residents have fewer tax bands and they cannot access the tax-free threshold, however they do not pay the Medicare Levy. Losses on rental properties could be ring fenced. The existing system of allowing rental property losses to be offset against income from any source when combined with tax-free capital gains on the underlying asset is a significant tax concession - and one heavily weighted in favour of taxpayers on higher incomes and/ or significant wealth. Quarantining rental losses does come with risks – landlords could offset their ability to use these losses by increasing rents, which could be felt most severely in Auckland and Wellington, which are already experiencing a lack of rental stock. CPA Australia also notes that this is currently the subject of a separate but complementary IRD inquiry. 4 Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system The paper states that ‘New Zealand has a broad based low rate tax system.’ 4 While this statement holds true if it relates solely to New Zealand’s goods and services tax (GST), it does not apply to New Zealand’s tax system overall. This is evidenced by the fact that 90 per cent of all tax revenues come from three main taxes - personal income tax, the GST and company tax. It is CPA Australia’s view New Zealand’s tax base is now over-reliant on these three taxes, and overall its tax base is too narrow. If New Zealand is to be resilient to external shocks, and also be competitive in the decades to come, this tax mix will need to change. For example, with an ageing population even if workers choose to work longer into what is the ‘traditional’ retirement phase of their lives, there will be fewer workers for each dependant. This means without other changes, personal income tax rates would need to rise, which amongst other things would discourage worker participation and impact productivity. Further, New Zealand’s company tax headline rate is becoming less competitive internationally when one considers tax reform measures being implemented by other countries. The US has successfully passed laws to lower its corporate tax rate to 21 per cent. UK has 19 per cent and closer to home Australia is currently working towards a corporate tax rate of 25 per cent by the year 2025. As a net importer of capital, if New Zealand is to continue to attract its share of foreign investment then it needs to consider what options it has regarding lowering its corporate tax rate, and decisions that should be taken, if any, either now or in the future. Behavioural taxes All taxes could be viewed as behavioural taxes in many respects. However the term is often used more narrowly to refer to the so-called sin taxes – for example taxes on alcohol and tobacco, and more recently sugar. In this regard CPA Australia submits the UK’s experience regarding tax on sugar in drinks is worthy of the TWG’s consideration. When the UK sugar tax was announced by the Rt Hon George Osborne - Chancellor of the Exchequer - in his 2016 budget speech, 5 he stated that obesity drives disease and it increases the risk of cancer, diabetes and heart disease costing costs the UK economy £27 billion a year, or more than half the entire NHS paybill. He also stated that ‘a 5 year old child consumes its weight in sugar per annum.’ 6 Given the health issues associated with obesity diet - such as type 2 diabetes - and the ultimate burden on the health system and the public purse we encourage the TWG to consider such a tax. Notably it may not raise significant revenues, but both the benefits to the ongoing health and welfare of New Zealand’s citizens, as well as the future cost savings to the public purse – which is taxpayer’s money – are potentially considerable. It is also of note that a recent newspaper article 7 also observed that the UK’s sugar tax has already brought about positive behavioural changes by both manufacturers as well as retail store businesses prior to the actual commencement of the tax. 4 See p5 5 https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/budget-2016-george-osbornes-speech 6 ibid 7 https://www.smh.com.au/money/tax/the-sweetest-tax-of-them-all-20180413-p4z9ec.html 5 The TWG may therefore wish to consider such a tax as part of its review, or suggest that the Government consider it as part of its health reform agenda. Retirement savings As mentioned in the background paper, most OECD countries take an ‘Exempt, Exempt, Taxed’ (EET) approach to the taxation of retirement savings. CPA Australia supports this approach as it is the most equitable as income is taxed at the point of consumption, not the point of deferral. It better reflects the size of the accumulated benefit in retirement and how it is consumed in retirement. That is, an individual’s overall tax burden is based on the size of their benefit in retirement, not their income when contributions were made, which may be no indicator of the size of their future retirement benefit. We recognise the unique situation in New Zealand, with the New Zealand superannuation, a universal age pension, at least partly funded indirectly by the taxation of contributions and investment earnings. The universal New Zealand Superannuation provides an important safety net but one that is becoming increasingly unaffordable. Consideration should therefore be given to means and income testing eligibility for future generations. To reduce reliance on the universal New Zealand superannuation and to encourage additional contributions to KiwiSaver accounts, it may be necessary to move away from New Zealand's tax neutral system and introduce incentives to encourage greater self-sufficiency in retirement savings. Moving to an EET system would introduce an upfront incentive to save while also boosting accumulated savings in a tax-free environment. Deferred income would then be taxed at the point of consumption in retirement. However, placing greater reliance on accumulated retirement savings would require means-testing of New Zealand superannuation, which would have its own social impacts to be considered. OECD analysis has shown that an EET system will provide a better net outcome for retirees than an ETT system 8 . However, in an imperfect world CPA Australia fully recognises the difficulties of transitioning from a TTE system to an EET system. This includes the cost to government revenues that would result even if done on a sliding scale over a number of years. Accordingly, we encourage the TWG to consider other options also. These include over time shifting to: • A TEE system by removing tax on investment earnings. While the upfront incentive to save wouldn't be as great, a TEE system provides a better net benefit in retirement than TTE. • A ‘ttE’ system (or ‘small t’, ‘small t’, ‘big E’) where the tax rate on contributions and earning is less than the current rates on contributions and earnings. For example, in Australia the tax rate on contributions is in most cases 15 per cent on contributions, 15 per cent on fund earnings until pension phase or retirement, and exempt on exit or drawdown in most cases. Please note that CPA Australia can provide the TWG with more detail on the Australian model if required. 8 TAX TREATMENT OF PRIVATE PENSION SAVINGS IN OECD COUNTRIES, Kwang-Yeol Yoo and Alain de Serres, OECD Economic Studies No. 39, 2004/2. 6 Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system Fairness and balance Productive economy vs speculative economy. In the public domain in New Zealand at least the conversation about taxing capital gains seems to be largely confined to taxing the profits on sales of residential property. However, from a productive economy versus a speculative economy perspective our experience is that internationally, tax advisers, tax authorities and taxpayers are surprised when they find out that New Zealand does not have a more comprehensive tax system when it comes to taxing capital gains. It is acknowledged that not all capital gains are exempt from tax under the current income tax regime in New Zealand. However, it is not difficult for taxpayers to step around the current regime in many circumstances. The recent bright line rules in respect of residential property are but one example in this regard, with these provisions already the subject of modification not long after their introduction. CPA Australia is of the view that taxing capital gains on shares, real property, rights, and collectibles amongst other things are all issues for the TWG to consider. See our further comments on a capital gains tax under Chapter 7 later in this submission. Encouraging New Zealand business growth Small businesses make up 97 per cent of all businesses in New Zealand, account for 29 per cent of employment, and contribute over a quarter of New Zealand’s gross domestic product (GDP). 9 To further support small business, including start-up businesses, while attracting overseas capital, there is scope for a lower tax rate for small businesses, in particular a progressive company tax rate. Our recent member consultation sessions raised the following ideas and options for the TWG’s consideration. Options could include: Options Comment A lower company tax rate for smaller companies – i.e. multi- rate like in Australia for base rate entities. The threshold would need to be significantly lower than the threshold used for base-rate small business entities in Australia to reflect the size of New Zealand businesses. Pros Shouldn’t have too much impact on the current imputation regime, should it be retained (see comments on imputation later in this paper). Issues and solutions would mirror those in Australia. Cons Could be issues with deferral of income to avoid exceeding the threshold and/or eligibility issues to access the lower rate (this issue applies to all of the three options discussed here). A tax-free threshold for smaller companies and /or start-up businesses. This option is used in the Singapore tax system. Pros A lower rate for both smaller businesses and start-up businesses (for 5 years for example) both encourages start-ups in their early years and supports small businesses, including both new and 9 http://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/who-we-are/our-publications/briefings-to-incoming-ministers/2017-bims/small-business.pdf 7 existing small businesses. Avoids complexity and possible abuse of being defined as a ‘small business’ or similar. Provides certainty. Cons Will add to complexity of imputing dividends. Would have to be based on a prior year effective marginal corporate tax rate unless the imputation system is replaced with a more appropriate tax regime, see CPA Australia’s comments later in this paper. Progressive tax rate for companies. Lower rate until a threshold is met, higher rate for taxable income about the band. Malaysia applies this system for companies. Pros Avoids complexity and possible abuse of being defined as a ‘small business’ or similar. Provides certainty. Cons Will add to complexity of imputing dividends. Would have to be based on a prior year effective marginal corporate tax rate unless the imputation system is replaced with a more appropriate tax regime, see comments on the imputation system below. The dividend imputation system New Zealand members of our organisation are generally of the view that the dividend imputation regime works well and is well established. Unlike the Australian model where currently excess credits are fully refundable in the year received, in New Zealand unused credits are carried forward by taxpayers to be offset against future income tax liabilities. However, the issue to be considered here is whether there is a more appropriate alternative to the current imputation system that would better meet the challenges of the future? Most countries have now forgone their imputation regimes, and in fact Australia and New Zealand are now the only two OECD countries to operate dividend imputation systems. The AFTS final report 10 states ’Countries that have abandoned dividend imputation systems include the United Kingdom (in 1999), Germany (in 2001), Finland (in 2005) and Norway (in 2006). While the move away from imputation for European countries can be partly explained by European Union legal issues, the trend has also been evident in Asian countries. Both Singapore (in 2003) and Malaysia (in 2008) have abolished their imputation systems.’ It is important to note that the move away from dividend imputation systems does not necessarily mean a move back to the so-called ‘classical’ or double tax model, but instead moving to other models. For example, the UK now provides a dividend tax credit to resident shareholders of domestic companies, while in Hong Kong and Singapore dividends received by residents are exempt. 11 Imputation regimes are often seen as an impediment to attracting foreign capital. Further, New Zealand residents have a poor record of personal savings. Taking these two important yet different factors into account CPA Australia submits that the TWG should consider - as a possible alternative to the current imputation system - a model where dividends in the hands of individuals are taxed at a lower rate than the individual’s marginal rate. Such a model could also enable a tax exemption for 10 http://taxreview.treasury.gov.au/content/FinalReport.aspx?doc=html/publications/Papers/Final\_Report\_Part\_2/chapter\_b2- 3.htm 11 ibid, at table B2-3 8 individuals up to a certain threshold. This is also discussed further in this submission under the heading ‘Lower taxes on certain passive income.’ 9 Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current tax system. Other specific issues Lower taxes on certain passive income As mentioned earlier in this submission, New Zealand has a weak record of personal savings. There are many reasons for this and it is not proposed to comment on them all here. However, in the context of the TWG’s remit, one impediment to encouraging greater savings is that income derived from savings is taxed at an individual’s marginal rate (unless it is exempt). The 2010 Australia’s Future Tax System report proposed a 40 per cent savings income discount be introduced for individuals for non-business related net interest income, net residential rental income (including related interest expenses), capital gains (and losses), and interest expenses related to listed shares held by individuals as non-business investments. CPA Australia notes that such a recommendation, while not a ‘silver bullet’ may also have an additional benefit of making investments other than residential property (that is not the family home) more attractive, which may have a positive impact on the housing affordability challenge. CPA Australia encourages the TWG to consider whether such an option is appropriate in the New Zealand context. Digital economy, trade and exports CPA Australia’s Asia-Pacific Small Business Survey 2017 12 again shows that New Zealand small businesses are well behind their counterparts in all markets (except for Australia) when it comes to using social media for business purposes or selling online. It is very difficult for businesses to grow if they do not access modern platforms to enable them to gain greater access to both broader domestic but particularly international markets. Typically, when a New Zealand business seeks to expand internationally it thinks first and foremost about accessing the Australian market(s). But opportunities abound globally with the appropriate business use of technology in the digital economy. Small businesses need to be educated about the possibilities this can bring them, and how to effectively use these mediums to grow their businesses, creating wealth and jobs. This could be done several different ways – but one way would be to provide small business with an accelerated deduction for appropriate expenditure on education and measures that assist businesses to embrace the international trade opportunities the digital economy provides. Digital economy and technology Lower income households have reduced access to technology which affects school aged students’ ability to engage with digitalised learning and understanding of technology in general. Rebates for parents could be available here. Small businesses and start-ups could receive accelerated deductions for investment in technology to aid their engagement in the digital economy. 12 https://www.cpaaustralia.com.au/~/media/corporate/allfiles/document/professional-resources/business-management/small- business-survey/small-business-survey-2017.pdf?la=en 10 Digital economy and crypto currencies CPA Australia notes that the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department has issued guidance on the tax treatment of gains and losses made from crypto currencies. 13 This guidance reflects the application of the tax laws as they currently stand. However, one issue for consideration is whether the current laws provide the most appropriate outcome. For example, in Australia the revenue is protected to some extent as crypto losses will be, in many cases, quarantined in Australia’s CGT system and only available for offsetting against future capital gains. New Zealand on the other hand has no such revenue protection mechanism. Accordingly, CPA Australia recommends the TWG pay close attention not only to Australia’s approach to the taxation of crypto currencies, but also the policy responses by other jurisdictions. Further, CPA Australia encourages the TWG to consider whether crypto currency transactions should be subject to loss quarantining. Environmental taxes During our recent member roadshows around the North and South Islands members expressed their concerns regarding water quality and water management, including concerns about whether New Zealand was getting a fair return on its water, particularly where it was being exported and not used domestically. While water is generally seen as a renewable resource, demand for clean water continues to grow and climate change is also expected to adversely impact future supplies. The imperative for better management, including pricing of water, is clearly articulated in New Zealand’s recent Incoming Ministerial Briefing for the Minister of the Environment on water, that, amongst other things, states: ‘Demand for water is increasing – for farming, for drinking water, and for industrial purposes. For example, irrigated land increased by about 70 per cent nationally between 2002 and 2017. In a growing number of catchments and aquifers, the volume of water allocated for people to use has reached or exceeded sustainable limits. For example, of the 36 groundwater allocation zones in Canterbury where quantity limits have been set, 16 are at full allocation or over-allocated. 21. As New Zealand’s population and agriculture-based economy continue to grow, the demand for fresh water is likely to rise further. At the same time, climate change is projected to lead to lower rainfall in some areas of the east and north of the country, with more prolonged droughts and periods of low flows in rivers. Behaviour change and a new approach to allocation are needed to better protect waterways, place a higher value on fresh water, and encourage smarter production methods for commercial use. 22. An important factor is the framework for how water is allocated —who has the right to take water, how much they can take, and how much contamination they can discharge. The current approach to water allocation is primarily a ‘first in, first served’ approach, which means that rights to take water and to make discharges may not be allocated equitably, in the best interests of the water body or to the highest value use. Historical circumstances around Māori land ownership and development mean iwi and hapū have ended up at the ‘back of the queue’ for access to water. The water management system needs to better deliver on social and cultural values of water at the same time as supporting an economy that maximises value from fresh water through wise use and investment.’ (italics added). 13 http://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax-individual/cryptocurrency-qa.html 11 CPA Australia members recognised the complexities and sensitivities of the water issues, but were also of the view that the Government -in concert with municipal councils - should better price this resource whether by way of licence, royalty, levy or tax. CPA Australia encourages the TWG to consider a levy or charge on water use in non-agricultural commercial enterprises. It is also noted that there is significant concern about the health of some rivers, particularly due to farm run-off mainly from intensive dairying activities. 14 While agricultural run-off is difficult to measure, some argue that it would be feasible to put taxes on the business inputs used by farmers such as fertilizers and pesticides – for example see the following excerpt from a Canadian paper on environmental economics: ‘A good case of this is the problem of water pollution from fertilizer runoff in agriculture. It is impossible to tax the kilograms of nitrogen in the runoff because it is a nonpoint-source pollutant and thus not directly measurable. The same problem applies to agricultural pesticides. What may be feasible instead is to put taxes on these materials as they are sold to farmers; that is, a tax per tonne of fertilizer or per 100 kilograms of pesticide purchased. This tax exists in some US states. The tax is to reflect the fact that a certain proportion of these materials ends up in nearby streams and lakes. Raising the prices of these items would give farmers the incentive to use them in smaller quantities. The higher price also creates the incentive to use the fertilizer in ways that involve less waste; for example, by reducing the amounts that run off.’ 15 CPA Australia also encourages the TWG to consider tax deductions or credits being made available for investment designed to reduce pollution run-off into water courses and rivers. A third issue that comes under this area of environmental taxes is the impact of tourism on New Zealand’s natural environment which is also of concern to members. See CPA Australia’s comments under ‘Tourism and infrastructure’ immediately following in this submission. Tourism and infrastructure New Zealand has always welcomed tourists with open arms, and tourism contributes significantly to New Zealand’s GDP. Tourism is consistently one of New Zealand’s top two export earners and the largest services export – contributing $14.5 billion - or nearly 21 per cent to New Zealand’s total exports in the year ended March 2016. 16 This trend is expected to not only continue in the future, but also grow in the coming years. There is significant upside to the tourism sector to New Zealand’s economy, however, such growth comes with both economic and social costs. The increasing numbers of overseas tourists is increasingly putting unwelcome pressure on New Zealand’s public infrastructure and residents in a variety of ways. For example, the upkeep and maintenance of the Department of Conservation (DoC) tracks, DoC huts and campsites, public toilets, and litter collection are some of the significant challenges for New Zealand in this regard. But it is more than just a maintenance issue. There is also the issue of how appropriate tourism infrastructure for the future will be funded. These issues raise the question of who should pay. CPA Australia encourages the TWG to consider a small levy on international visitors that could be collected at the border - either on ingress or egress. Such a levy could be imposed on airline tickets. 14 https://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/about-us/briefing-incoming-ministers-%E2%80%93-environment-and-climate 15 Barry C. Field & Nancy D. Olewiler/Environmental Economics/Third Canadian Edition/ Ch 12 p11. 16 http://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/who-we-are/our-publications/briefings-to-incoming-ministers/2017-bims/tourism.pdf 12 Biosecurity issues for New Zealand’s farming sectors With the continued rise of the digital economy and cross-border trade arising from platforms such as eBay, Amazon, Etsy and Alibaba, some countries are considering new approaches to deal with international parcel traffic across borders for biosecurity reasons. New Zealand’s reputation as a source of high quality fresh produce is second to none. However, increasing movement of both human traffic and parcels puts this status at ongoing risk from foreign disease and pests. It was reported earlier this year that in Australia the Department of Home Affairs was considering a parcel levy of AUD$5 on all international parcels under AUD$1,000 in value. Australia already charges a AUD$95 levy on parcels valued at AUD$1,000 or more. We encourage the TWG to consider such a levy for biosecurity reasons. It has also been raised during our member consultations that if such a measure was implemented that other countries could retaliate. This remains to be seen – however it is not expected such a move would start a trade war. Encouraging research and development The most recent OECD Economic Survey on New Zealand 17 (June 2017) points out that expenditure on R&D as a share of GDP is low, most noticeably in the business sector. It also states that collaboration between firms, education and research institutions is low. R&D is one important way to improve productivity. The Survey also recommends that fiscal support for business research and development should be increased. This could take a number of forms. For example, it could be by way of targeted government grants. Alternatively, R&D could be encouraged by way of an appropriately designed incentive. CPA Australia also notes the recent release by the New Zealand government of a separate consultation process on R&D. 18 To assist in improving productivity CPA Australia encourages the TWG to consider recommending an appropriately designed R&D tax concession. There are many overseas examples that the Government could draw on. The recent review of Australia’s R&D incentive is just one case in point. 19 Fringe benefit tax Fringe benefit tax is essentially a set of anti-avoidance laws. As the TWG will be aware, FBT raises very little revenue but the compliance costs on business are very high. Members have recommended the TWG consider how the FBT laws could be simplified in a way that achieves their legislative intent but at the same time reduces compliance costs for business. One suggestion in respect of motor vehicles was whether a luxury car tax could be placed on certain cars in lieu of FBT. Charities and tax exemption status Some members have also expressed concern about the ‘automatic charitable status’ for certain bodies. They requested that the TWG consider whether tax exempt status is too easy to obtain and 17 http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-new-zealand.htm 18 http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/science-innovation/rd-tax-incentive 19 https://industry.gov.au/innovation/InnovationPolicy/Research-and-development-tax-incentive/Pages/R-and-D-Tax-Incentive- Review-report-and-submissions.aspx 13 that the eligibility requirements for such tax exemption should be tighter/ have greater integrity. For example, perhaps including requirements to ensure the entity is actually making a contribution back to the NZ community. 14 Chapter 7: Specific challenges Housing affordability Housing affordability issues are not unique to New Zealand. However as outlined in the OECD New Zealand Economic Survey 20 the issue is quite pronounced particularly in Auckland. Housing affordability is impacted by a number of factors, including housing stock/ supply, domestic demand, and foreign demand. Countries have responded to their own housing affordability challenges in a variety of ways. For example, by rezoning more land for residential purposes, and removing density restrictions - but also by tax measures. For example, both Vancouver, Canada and Australia have introduced vacancy or ‘ghost’ taxes on foreign owned residential properties that remain vacant, thus potentially making the return on investment for foreign investors less attractive. Further, in Australia’s 2017-2018 Federal Budget the Australian Government announced a package of measures aimed at improving housing affordability for potential home buyers. These measures included: • Making travel expenses related to inspecting, maintaining or collecting rent for residential rental property no longer tax deductible • Limiting plant and equipment depreciation deductions to only new items, and • Encouraging older Australians to downsize by enabling them to put AUD$300,000 from the sale of their home into superannuation. Further, nearly all Australian States now impose ‘foreign investor surcharges’ or a ‘foreign persons additional duty’ or similar of up to 8 per cent of the purchase price of residential property acquired by foreign persons. Further examples of tax policy options of which the TWG should be aware can be found in the Australian Labor Party’s recent policy proposals. 21 Amongst other things they state that ‘Labor will reform negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount to ensure that our tax system is fair, sustainable and targets jobs and growth.’ Regarding negative gearing, it also proposes to limit negative gearing to newly constructed housing from 1 July 2017 with all investments made prior to this date being fully grandfathered. They have also announced that from 1 July 2017 the use of losses from new investments in shares and existing properties will only be able to be offset against investment income tax liabilities or carried forward to offset the final capital gain on the investment. Labor also proposes to halve the capital gains discount for all assets purchased after 1 July 2017, reducing the capital gains tax discount for assets that are held longer than 12 months from the current 50 per cent to 25 per cent. All investments made before this date will not be affected by this change and will be fully grandfathered. As is reflected by the feedback on real property taxes in the TWG’s Background Paper, New Zealand’s current income tax laws as they apply to real property are significantly out of step with other OECD countries. To non-residents at least, the fact that an investor can negatively gear an 20 http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-New-Zealand.htm 21 https://www.alp.org.au/negativegearing 15 investment claiming tax deductions against their income, but then potentially not be subject to tax on profit when the asset is disposed of seems very outdated. Even with the extended bright line test for residential property 22 this seems overly generous and skews investment decisions. Some other countries have quarantined losses from property investments to be offset only against future income from property, for example the United Kingdom. 23 It is also of note that in Australia the Federal Labor Party has announced that if elected it will introduce laws to limit the negative gearing of existing residential property – it will only be available for new housing stock. 24 Currently in Australia such losses and outgoings are on revenue account, but when the asset is disposed of it will be subject to capital gains tax - albeit at a reduced rate if the property was held for 12 months or more. See CPA Australia’s comments on capital gains tax following in this paper. Members have also raised the following issues during our recent member consultations - capital gains tax on investment residential properties could: • cause investment distortions including reducing the attraction on such investments thus reduce competition homebuyers face, increasing accessibility to the housing market, but also • cause landlords to increase rents to offset future CGT tax liabilities. Other suggestions that have been put forward as part of CPA Australia’s member roadshow include: • Tax incentives could also be available for property developers which develop property in substantial part to rent to lower income households. This would increase the rental stock for a vulnerable part of the tenancy market. • Owners of undeveloped land in residential zones could face penalties if land is not improved within a certain timeframe post acquisition. Capital gains tax CPA Australia considers the most appropriate means of broadening the tax base would be via a comprehensive capital gains tax. It also notes this is in accord with one of the recommendations of the Report of the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group 25 a decade ago. It is often argued that such a measure would not provide very much revenue as New Zealand already taxes many capital gains. Examples given as evidence of the current approach include taxing foreign debt and equity investments 26 as well as other certain short-term gains being classified as normal operating taxable income – including ‘gains on the sale of personal property if the taxpayer is a trader in such property; gains from the disposal of land where the intention at the time of purchase was to sell it; and gains on domestic corporate bonds that are accruals taxed (OECD 2004, p.6)’ 27 as well as more recently residential property subject to the bright line test. 28 However, CPA Australia submits that such tests are relatively easy to step around tax-wise. CPA Australia notes that a more comprehensive capital gains taxation regime, beyond disposals of real property would broaden the tax base but add significant complexity to the tax system. 22 http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/bills/51-249 23 https://www.gov.uk/guidance/income-tax-when-you-rent-out-a-property-working-out-your-rental-income 24 https://www.alp.org.au/negativegearing 25 P11, recommendation 6 - https://www.victoria.ac.New Zealand/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cagtr/pdf/tax-report-website.pdf 26 https://www.newzealandnow.govt.nz/living-in-nz/money-tax/nz-tax-system 27 http://comparativetaxation.treasury.gov.au/content/report/html/08\_Chapter\_6-03.asp 28 http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/news/2018-02-15-sop-extends-bright-line-test 16 Conversely, a narrow regime only taxing realised gains on commercial/ investment real property could result in distortions and structuring to avoid the realisation of the gain. We understand of particular concern is the effect of taxing the capital gain on farm land in intergenerational transfers. A very narrow regime taxing only gains made by non-residents on commercial/investment real property could have a detrimental effect on foreign investment. Other issues raised by CPA members in the consultation phase include: • A de minimus exemption of around $20,000 per annum could apply • Personal assets excluded • Unrealised gains not subject to tax • Losses applied against other income • Net gains added to assessable income to determine taxable income. Land tax Land taxes target real property. Typical design features of land taxes are exemptions for main residences or homes, primary production land, as well as exemptions for other property owned by approved not-for-profit, religious, educational and/ or charitable institutions. When applied to a broad base they are generally very efficient and hard to avoid. However, the abovementioned typical exemptions distort the outcome. If a land tax was to be proposed by the TWG it would need to take into account these base issues. The TWG will also need to weigh up the advantages versus the challenges of other issues such as: • land rich but income poor residents • whether introducing a land tax would result in the tax being passed on to tenants by way of increased rents and in particular low-income tenancy properties. CPA Australia also notes that a ‘low rate land tax as a means of funding other tax reductions’ also had had the support of ‘the majority of the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group in its 2010 report. 29 Progressive company tax See CPA Australia’s comments under the heading ‘Encouraging New Zealand business growth’ earlier in this submission. GST exemptions for specific goods The GST regime in New Zealand is well embedded, very comprehensive, simple and efficient. Despite it’s relatively low rate by OECD standards it represents 31.4% of New Zealand’s taxation revenue. GST on food represents a significant cost to the community, especially for low income earners. However, while exempting some foods would ease this cost, it would result in significant complexity for certain businesses, for example owners of small food outlets. GST is levied on medicines however these are significantly subsidised by the Government. 29 P11, recommendation 8 https://www.victoria.ac.New Zealand/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cagtr/pdf/tax-report-website.pdf 17 In our recent member consultations there was no support for the concept of narrowing the GST base in any way. We also note that changing the GST rate is outside the terms of reference for the TWG. We also note that the OECD has stated that reducing the rate of GST to address social goals are shown to be a very poor tool for targeting support for lower income households – and it can have the perverse outcome of being of greater benefit to more wealthy households. 30 More targeted relief via welfare payments is typically considered a far better policy approach. 30 See page 3 The Distributional Effects of Consumption Taxes in OECD Countries, OECD 2014 https://read.oecd- ilibrary.org/taxation/the-distributional-effects-of-consumption-taxes-in-oecd-countries\_9789264224520-en#page5 18 Appendix 2 Capital gains tax specific design issues Possible capital gains tax (CGT) design issues for the TWG’s consideration. 1. Should the CGT be a separate tax or part of the income tax? Most countries tax capital gains as part of the income tax. CPA Australia recommends that it be part of the income tax regime. 2. Should capital gains be taxed on an accrual basis or only when realised (i.e. only when the asset is sold)? Most countries tax on a realisation basis. Capital gains should generally be on realisation – with deeming provisions where there is nil or non-market consideration. But special rules are also required for the creation of rights and also lease. The Australian CGT rules provide good guidance in this regard. 31 3. How should matrimonial property settlements and disposal of assets on death be treated? Such issues can be dealt with by deferring the gain until the recipient ultimately disposes of the asset. For example, under Australia laws in the case of death and inheritance CGT is not triggered. If the asset is a pre-CGT asset the acquirer is deemed to have acquired it at the market value at the date of death. If it is a post CGT asset they receive the cost base from the deceased. More information can be provided on this if required by the TWG. 4. What assets should be covered given that the terms of reference exclude any tax on the family home? Should it include just rental properties, shares, collectibles, private assets such as cars? CPA Australia submits that should the New Zealand Government decide to introduce a CGT that it allows exemptions for certain private assets such as cars. Australia also has special rules for certain ‘personal use assets’. For an overview of Australia’s CGT rules regarding different asset types see here: https://www.ato.gov.au/general/capital-gains-tax/cgt-assets-and-exemptions/ 5. Should assets held by KiwiSaver and other savings schemes be taxed? There is an argument that such gains should not be taxed at the full rate to encourage personal savings. See CPA Australia’s comments elsewhere in this paper regarding a lower tax rate on KiwiSaver accounts, and also note CPA Australia’s comments on the taxation of passive income such as rents, interest income and dividends outside the KiwiSaver regime. 6. Should assets held offshore be subject to tax? Yes. A New Zealand tax resident should be taxed on their worldwide income. 7. How would a capital gains tax integrate with current tax laws, such as when land sales are already taxable, our company imputation system and our CFC/FDR rules? New Zealand already taxes certain land sales. The CGT regime should apply to land sales not already captured under the current income tax laws - subject to specific exemptions and deferrals mentioned elsewhere in this submission - including the exemption for the taxpayer’s main residence. 31 https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/CGT-assets-and-exemptions/ 19 One issue raised by members during our consultations however was whether the exemption on the main residence should also be subject to a threshold – for example, whether net capital gains over $1,000,000 should be subject to CGT - thus carving out nominal gains for most taxpayers while at the same time providing additional fairness and equity in the tax regime. 8. When should non-residents be subject to tax? Special rules are required. More details can be provided on this in due course if necessary. 9. Should capital losses be ring-fenced to be offset only against capital gains income or should they be offset against any income? If capital gains are taxed on a realisation basis tax base maintenance considerations suggest that capital losses should be ring-fenced. CPA Australia supports ring-fencing CGT losses. 10. Should there be roll-over relief allowing capital gains re-invested in similar assets to be treated as unrealised? If so, when should roll-over relief apply? For example, should a farmer selling a farm and buying a new farm be taxed on the increase in value of the old farm? Australia has a range of reliefs for businesses and more information can be provided on these if required. 11. How should death, emigration and immigration be handled? Special rules are required. More details can be provided on this in due course if necessary. 12. How should gifts and gambling winnings be taxed? It is suggested that a gift could trigger a CGT liability depending on what the gift was. For example: • A gift of cash – no CGT. • A gift of the family home to a person – no CGT as the home is exempt. • The gift of shares, commercial property, antiques etc. – subject to CGT if a post CGT asset. 13. What should the rate of tax on tax on capital gains be – the normal income tax rates, or some other rate(s)? CPA Australia suggest a lower rate be applied to capital gains to reflect risk and reward and to not stymie investment. For example, in Australia individuals may get a 50 per cent discount. There are other special rules for business also – retirement exemption, rollover relief, 15 year exemption, etc. We can provide more details on this should it be required. 14. Should any allowance be given for inflation in calculating capital gains? Ideally taxing real gains rather than nominal gain is appropriate. However, in low inflationary times and for simplicity taxing nominal gains is simpler and arguably not too distortive. 15. Should there be a de minimis rule? CPA Australia is supportive of a de minimus rule, say $20,000. 16. What administrative implications would there be from a capital gains tax? The administrative implications for both the IRD and taxpayers will depend on the ultimate design of any CGT. But they will include changes to record keeping for New Zealand taxpayers - to enable them to correctly work out their capital gains (and losses) amongst other things. 20 17. What rules should govern the transition into a capital gains tax? The options seem to be cost of the assets (retrospective taxation of past accrued gains), valuation at date of introduction or only assets acquired post introduction (the Australian rule). CPA Australia is supportive of the ‘only assets acquired post introduction model’ as per the Australian model. 18. How should family trusts be integrated into the system? Trusts and relevant trust assets would also need to be subject to CGT. 21 References https://www.victoria.ac.New Zealand/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cagtr/pdf/tax-report-website.pdf Australia’s Future Tax System Final Report - http://taxreview.treasury.gov.au/content/FinalReport.aspx?doc=html/publications/papers/Final\_Report \_Part\_1/index.htm Full report, 31 January 1975 / Taxation Review Committee also known as the Asprey report http://adc.library.usyd.edu.au/data-2/p00087.pdf https://www.victoria.ac.New Zealand/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cagtr/pdf/tax-report-website.pdf http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-New-Zealand.htm http://www.oecd.org/tad/sustainable-agriculture/49849932.pdf http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/fresh-water/economic-instruments-managing-water-quality-new- zealand/5-economic

PO Box 5611, Wellesley St, Auckland 1141. http://www.cpag.org.nz Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) is an independent charity working to eliminate child poverty in Aotearoa/ New Zealand through research, education and advocacy. CPAG believes that New Zealand’s high rate of child poverty is not the result of economic necessity but is due to policy neglect and an ideological emphasis on flawed economic incentives. Through research, CPAG highlights the position of tens of thousands of New Zealand children, and promotes policies that address the underlying causes of the poverty they endure. We would like the opportunity to present an oral submission. Contact: admin@cpag.org.nz 2 Submission to the Tax Working Group April 2018 Introduction Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) agrees that the tax system is no longer fit for purpose. It does not fulfil the 1980s promise of broad base/low rate and no longer serves the needs of families well. The new Government has promised to place child wellbeing at the heart of policy-making and CPAG believes that such a focus is required in any reconsideration of tax policy. This submission takes a child-focused lens and submits that:  The taxation of housing must be radically reformed to improve affordability and reverse the trends to growing wealth inequality. Housing-related poverty is a significant and growing cause of child poverty.  The interface between the tax/transfer system has produced high and damaging effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs). The high work disincentives, that are inherent in the interface, act against the interests of the poorest children and their families.  The use of tax measures to influence behaviour is a focus of the Tax Working Group It is therefore critical that they examine the role of the IWTC which has failed the poorest children miserably. CPAG also supports a well-designed tax on sugary drinks to improve child health.  The design of transfers cannot be isolated from that of tax. Seeing the two issues in silos in the past decade has undermined child well-being.  The definition of income in the tax/transfer system needs to be consistent and more generous for child-related tax credit;  IRD’s latest simplification exercise should be reviewed in light of the potential for it to cause harm to children.  Miscellaneous matters re progressivity should be addressed. New Zealand’s tax system has harsh impacts on poor families, with no income tax exemption and GST at a high rate on almost all goods and services. CPAG’s full list of recommendations is compiled on page 11 of this Submission. Background to review The Government-appointed Tax Working Group (TWG) has invited Submissions with detail set out in the Future of Tax submission background paper. TWG will use Treasury’s Living Standards Framework of four ‘capital stocks’ to broaden assessment of the impact of tax  Financial and physical capital, such as roads, factories, and financial assets.  Human capital, such as skills and knowledge.  Social capital, such as trust, cultural achievements and community connections.  Natural capital, such as soil and water. CPAG argues that strengthening social capital also requires a well-being of children dimension. The TWG has identified the main criteria that have been used in past tax reviews to assess tax reforms: 3 Submission to the Tax Working Group April 2018  Efficiency: minimise impediments to economic growth and avoid distortions (biases) to the use of resources.  Equity and fairness: achieve fairness including through ‘horizontal equity’ (the same treatment for people in the same circumstances) and ‘vertical equity’ (higher tax obligations on those with greater economic capacity to pay).  Procedural fairness is also important for a tax system.  Revenue integrity: minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage.  Fiscal adequacy: raise sufficient revenue for the Government’s requirements.  Compliance and administration costs: minimise the costs of compliance and administration, and give taxpayers as much certainty as possible.  Coherence: ensure that individual reform options make sense in the context of the entire tax system. This submission will be based on the living standards framework with a child-focus, and the TWG chosen criteria. The taxation of housing New Zealand is in the grips of an extraordinary speculative housing bubble. Table 1 (see following page) shows how New Zealand’s housing market became dangerously out of step in the 2000s. Using the Economist’s interactive tool to show different aspects of this bubble, Table 2 shows the evolution of real price rises since 2000. The inevitable divide between children who thrive and those who don’t is now strikingly along housing lines. Good basic housing that is affordable is critical to child well-being. New Zealand has an ample supply of housing overall, but it is poorly distributed in terms of size and price. Increasingly large gains in house values are accruing for the already wealthy while the poorest households suffer excessive rents or lose housing access to housing altogether. Taking the balance sheet approach required by a social capital lens suggests a grave deficit especially from the child’s perceptive. CPAG submits that the lack of a principled-based approach to the taxation of housing has been a prime driver of the now precipitous state of our housing market which has in turn perpetuated rising inequality and deep child poverty. A suitable tax regime for taxing housing is suggested in this paper and is capable of generating enough income to allow for a significant shift away from the taxation of income overtime. This shift in the longer term is essential to begin to reduce the high tax rates faced by many working poor families. 4 Submission to the Tax Working Group April 2018 Table 1 New Zealand’s unsustainable housing bubble Table 2 The Economist (2017) House Price Index Why not a capital gains tax? CPAG does not believe it is appropriate, now, at the height of the boom, to solve the under- taxation of housing with a broad capital gains tax (CGT). Even if a CGT was agreed, it will be years before it is implemented and then affect only capital gains from the date of its introduction. There will be countless arguments over how to measure capital gains, but it is likely to apply only to realised gains giving rise to the lock-in effect. In the meantime, the wealth accumulation of the wealthiest households continues exponentially, and the accruing income is untaxed apart from easy-to-avoid bright line rules around truly speculative property investment. 5 Submission to the Tax Working Group April 2018 In the past CPAG has argued in several forums 1 for a radical shift in the taxation of all housing based on a net equity approach along the lines of that discussed in the 2001 McLeod Tax review (Risk-Free Rate Method - RRFM) 2 . More recently the Morgan Foundation have proposed a version of this net equity approach. 3 CPAG argues that while the RFRM was rejected by the Government under Michael Cullen in 2001, there remain good reasons to revisit the idea. There may be a higher degree of political and public acceptability for such an approach now because of the widespread concern over intergenerational housing equity issues. There are numerous ways to do such a tax. It is suggested here that it applies to housing as an asset class rather than more broadly to include other assets such as shares and commercial property. The accumulation of untaxed property income offends all the TWG’s criteria. Of these, offence against horizontal equity, vertical equity and intergenerational equity are obvious. In addition, fast-growing untaxed capital gains have grossly distorted economic signals, large untaxed gains redirect resources away from other more productive investments into speculative activity. Housing, once considered a basic need, is now prioritised as an income- generating asset over other forms of saving and investment. If this imbalance is not addressed, child poverty in New Zealand may not only persist, but increase. This in turn will further undermine the efficiency of the economy and social stability. CPAG suggests that the five-year ‘bright line’ test should still be used to capture short-term gains, but is not enough on its own. Under the net equity (RFRM) approach, landlords will no longer be subsidised through tax concessions to invest for capital gains, and some may withdraw from this market. While that leaves more houses for genuine first home buyers, a price correction is not to be avoided if the biggest housing bubble in the western world is to be contained. The best to hope for is gradual adjustment, not a precipitous fall such as experienced in Ireland after their strong bubble 10 years ago. Currently landlords can deduct costs including full nominal mortgage interest costs against other income for tax purposes. The present Government’s proposal to ring fence-losses from rental property investment is a very partial and inadequate response. Losses from one property are still able to be offset against others that make profits, or carried forward and written off eventually. Under the net equity approach any incentive for landlords and property investors to engage in intricate tax avoidance is removed. Moreover, as past capital gains are captured in the net equity base as they accrue with each new valuation, the wealth gap may narrow at last rather than continue to grow exponentially. The present Government has taken the owner-occupied home off the Tax Working Group’s table. The danger is that elaborate owner-occupied housing becomes even more attractive as a result. It would be better to allow a generous exemption for a home, say up to say $1 million net equity per person but to still include owner-occupied housing in the tax net. That 1 See for example: St John, S and Johnson A, Hit housing bubble through tax NZ Herald, August 12th 2016, St John, S The huge white elephant landlord in the tax living room, Daily blog 3 April,2018,and St John, Landlords save your crocodile tears, Newsroom,19 April 2918. 2 See The Issues paper 2001 for discussion of the risk free rate of return method (RFRM). 3 Gareth Morgan's new party policy reiterates call for tax on equity 6 Submission to the Tax Working Group April 2018 way very high value owner-occupied mansions will be included but modest homes fall outside this net. 4 Recommendation:  The Government should set up an expert group to design a net equity housing tax. The interface issues of the tax/transfer system Tax reform since the 1980s has shifted high EMTRs from high income earners to low and middle-income earners, and especially to working families. A more universal approach to transfers reduces this EMTR problem but requires a more progressive income tax schedule. Piecemeal policy making has recently worsened the already high and damaging EMTRs. This issue cannot be ignored when tax efficiency is considered. The high work disincentives inherent in the interface act against the interest of the poorest children in working families. 5 Cumulative abatements When extra income is earned, tax is levied, but there may be other consequences that further reduce disposable income from earning that extra income. Overlapping tax and abatements arise from six main sources 1. Tax (rate paid at 17.50-33% + ACC) 2. Accommodation Supplement (abatement at 25%) 3. WFF (abatement at 25%) 4. Student loans (repayment at 12%) 5. Best Start (abatement at 20.8%) 6. Child support (levied at 18-30%) These sources compound to form a high effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) which can affect low income working families over very long income ranges. From a joint family income of $42,700 when WFF starts to abate, it is possible for these EMTRs to be well over 80%. The income range is greatest for larger families who have more WFF to abate. Families might not be able to do the sums, but they know that the extra effort they put into earning more is just not worth it. They are caught out by income that is too low if they don’t increase their work hours and by clawbacks if they do. 6 Tax thresholds Increasing the tax thresholds for low-income earners could be tabled by the Tax Working Group. Working parents who earn over the $48,000 threshold face a big jump from a tax rate of 17.5% to one of 30%. A reduced abatement rate for Working for Families tax credits to 4 For some older people in large homes with little cash flow this may seem unfair, but the tax liability could accrue against the eventual sale/transfer of the property 5 St John, S (2017) “Tax and family assistance” in Progressive thinking: Ten perspectives on tax, eds R Thomas and K Windelov, PSA, Wellington, May 22nd 2017 6 See for example St John, S (2017) What would you do Prime Minister English? Daily Blog March 19,2017. 7 Submission to the Tax Working Group April 2018 20% (currently set to rise from 22.5% to 25% on July 1, 2018) would help but not fully compensate without other changes. The fiscal cost of increasing the $48,000 tax bracket to, for example, $52,000 has a ballpark cost of $560 million 7 . Unless this cost is recouped by higher tax rates on high income earners, CPAG thinks on balance the problem is best addressed by reforming the overlapping abatements. Recommendations: CPAG recommends a MUCH higher profile be given to these effects by the TWG. Ameliorative policies include that the Government should:  Shift housing assistance progressively out of AS into WFF;  Undertake a comprehensive overhaul of the student loans system and immediately raise the threshold for student loan repayment to a much higher level e.g. over $50,000, and progressively write off debt;  Add Best Start to WFF;  Reduce the abatement rate of WFF to 20% (as still the case in Australia); and  Review the child support formula. The use of tax measures to influence behaviour The In-Work Tax Credit (IWTC) Changing behaviour is a focus of the TWG and therefore it is critical that they examine the role of the IWTC. This very expensive tax credit has social objectives. The question must be asked by the TWG whether it has achieved those objectives and what are the unintended consequences. CPAG has written extensively about this here. Also see Progressive universalisation of Working for Families a background paper prepared for CPAG (March 2018) The IWTC has two objectives: incentivising work, and reducing child poverty. Treasury’s evaluation suggested that the overall effect on work effort was negative 8 . While the IWTC was an effective anti-poverty tool for families who qualified for it, the Ministry of Social Development has claimed repeatedly that it had no effect on the child poverty in workless families 9 . Its role and design must therefore be reviewed by the TWG as it has failed to incentivise work effort and, has failed to reduce the poverty of the poorest children. Support for consideration of a tax on sugary drinks ('health levy') The teeth of far too many low-income children in New Zealand are in a very poor condition. Dental health is important for overall child health and too much sugar, especially in drinks, is 7 Based on Treasury’s estimates of the revenue-effects-small-tax-rate-and-tax-base-changes/. This calculation does not pretend to be more than ball park figure but it indicates that changes to the tax structure are expensive. 8 Mercante and P. Mok(2014) Working for Families changes: The effect on labour supply in New Zealand NZ (WP 14/18), NZ Treasury 9 See Ministry of Social Development. Household Incomes Reports since 2007. The latest is here 8 Submission to the Tax Working Group April 2018 implicated in childhood obesity. This issue goes to the heart of policy to promote healthier eating, reduce processed food, and reduce sugar on the diet. CPAG believes that if there is a case for tobacco and alcohol taxes, there is also a sound case for a tax on sugary drinks. While we have some concerns about the regressivity of a sugar tax, families who currently spend most on sugary drinks also have the most to gain by reducing their consumption. A well-designed tax or 'health levy' can also change producer behaviour. The recently introduced graduated tax on sugary drinks in the UK has already resulted in most producers reducing the sugar content of drinks in order to keep the price down. 10 The Appendix contains some further points from Professor Toni Ashton for CPAG. Recommendations:  The Government should review the purpose and design of the IWTC; and  Consider a graduated tax (‘health levy’) on sugary drinks The design of transfers Transfers should not be isolated from that of tax considerations. They are opposite sides to the same coin. Seeing them in silos in the past decade has undermined child well-being. CPAG is aware that the Government intends transfers including WFF to be examined by the Welfare Working Group (WWG) and so is not further explored here. In the CPAG submission to the WWG it will be argued, among other things, that the income exemption for abatement of benefits needs to be at least doubled and benefits individualised. Recommendation:  The Government should integrate the work of TWG with that of the WWG. The definition of income The definition of income in the tax/transfer system needs to be consistent. This too is an issue for the WWG and so is not discussed in detail here. Principles of equity and efficiency suggest that income from all sources should be treated the same. The PIE regime acts to reinforce income and wealth disparities and must be reformed. “Along with the non-taxation of particular capital gains, there are other exceptions to New Zealand's general tax neutrality across different types of savings - some small concessions for retirement savings have been introduced in recent years with the 10 https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21739992-those-cheaper-low-sugar-offerings-stand-benefit-ditch- sugar-or-raise-prices 9 Submission to the Tax Working Group April 2018 establishment of Portfolio Investment Entities (PIEs) and KiwiSaver, both in 2007” (TWG, 2018) Income for WFF purposes is widely defined - see: http://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax- individual/income-adjust/intro/iit-adjust-income.html. For example. PIE income that is in funds that are not locked in are treated as income for WFF purposes. CPAG believes that if PIE income can be counted for WFF purposes, it should also be imputed as gross income with a deduction for PIE already paid. This will remove the benefit of the top PIE rate of 28% that goes only to those on 33% and improve equity, progressivity, efficiency and revenue. Recommendation:  The Government should be consistent in definitions of income in tax and transfer systems; and  Remove the advantage of the top PIE rate. IRD’s latest simplification exercise CPAG is alarmed that none of the objections to the IRD tax simplification project have been formally addressed. CPAG’s submission: Making Tax Simpler Better Administration of Social Policy: Working for families (WFF) suggests there are many issues that must be reviewed in light of the potential of harm to children. Real time adjustments of family income for WFF purposes may not be as helpful as IRD think. The caregivers’ income for the children can fluctuate widely. Data matching with MSD around such issues as relationships without adequate appeal procedures in place are not in the interests of children. Recommendations:  The Government should address the potential harms to families from data sharing and real-time adjustment of Working for Families; and  Improve appeal processes. Miscellaneous matters regarding progressivity, etc. CPAG acknowledges there are wider issues than can be canvassed in the time for this submission. The inability of the TWG to address the design issues of WFF is a major limitation. New Zealand’s tax system has a harsh impact on the poor, with no income tax exemption and GST at a high rate (15%) on virtually everything. More progressivity Over and above taxing income from assets such as housing to widen the tax base, the tax scale could be made more progressive. Increasing tax rates at the top end of the personal income tax spectrum and/or having a more progressive system of personal tax thresholds 10 Submission to the Tax Working Group April 2018 could be used to compensate low-income earners who pay a disproportionate amount of their incomes in income tax, GST, fuel and other excise taxes. However CPAG does anticipate this as a likely outcome of the TWG deliberations. A progressive scale like in Australia is too big jump for NZ at least in the short term. Nevertheless the tax structure, especially with such a comprehensive high rate of GST is far less progressive than desirable. CPAG does not support GST exemptions for certain goods and services as a way to help low income families, but believes that a GST of 15% is far too high when it is applied so comprehensively. CPAG suggests that the TWG could usefully remind the public that low- income families must have a well-supported transfer system including WFF and other tax credits to offset the regressivity of GST and of the income tax scale itself. Negative talk about WFF - such as that it is a subsidy to employers - is not helpful. Secondary tax Many low-income workers who have more than one part-time job contributing to the household income are concerned that secondary tax unfairly reduces their disposable income. However, secondary tax is important to ensure protection against an end of financial year tax bill. Two part-time jobs may effectively push part of the annual income over a tax threshold, which could mean that PAYE, if paid at the same rate for both (or several) jobs would not be sufficient to cover the tax due. By paying a higher rate of tax for second and subsequent jobs, a tax refund would be the likely outcome at the end of the year instead of a bill. Deborah Russell’s example here demonstrates. Nevertheless, a high marginal tax at the point of earning the money acts as a work disincentive and is perceived negatively by those affected. The provisions already exist for those affected to be given a special tax code. Making this option more of a default option so secondary tax payers have a more appropriate marginal tax rate would be helpful. Recommendations:  The Government should shift from taxing incomes to taxing wealth over time to reduce low income tax rates and improve thresholds;  Improve understanding of the need for well supported and generous child tax credits; and  Improve operation of secondary tax. Summary: a child-focussed approach CPAG urges that a child-focused lens be applied to all the TWG deliberations. This will highlight the need for the radical reform of the taxation of housing and a reduction in wealth inequality. An individual on a given income has a higher ability to pay tax than one with children. Tax credits for children can promote horizontal equity, at least for low and middle income families. A child focus should raise the profile of tax credits that are the key mechanism by which the presence of children are acknowledged in the tax system. 11 Submission to the Tax Working Group April 2018 Full list of recommendations: The Government should:  Set up an expert group to design a net equity housing tax.  Shift housing assistance progressively out of AS into WFF.  Undertake a comprehensive overhaul of the student loans system and immediately raise the threshold for student loan repayment to a much higher level e.g. over $50,000, and progressively write off debt.  Add Best Start to WFF.  Reduce the abatement rate of WFF to 20% (as still the case in Australia).  Review the child support formula.  Review the purpose and design of the IWTC.  Consider a graduated tax on sugary drinks.  Integrate work of TWG (taxes) with that of the WWG (transfers).  Be consistent in definitions of income in tax and transfer systems.  Remove the advantage of the top PIE rate.  Address the potential harms to families from data sharing and real-time adjustment of Working for Families.  Improve appeal processes.  Shift from taxing incomes to taxing wealth over time to reduce low income tax rates and improve low income tax thresholds.  Improve understanding of the need for well supported and generous child tax credits.  Improve operation of secondary tax. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Appendix 1 BOX Brief notes on a tax on sugary drinks Benefits of a tax on sugary drinks: 1. Reduces consumption of sugary drinks 2. Improves oral health, reduces obesity and other non-communicable diseases 3. Encourages producers to reduce sugar content if tax based on sugar content 4. Increases government revenue, some of which can be used to fund supporting health promotion campaigns. 5. Reinforces public health messages that the product is unhealthy or of low nutritional quality 6. Corrects for externalities, including the economic burden and social costs of obesity and poor oral health. Desirable features 1.

Characteristics: 12 Submission to the Tax Working Group April 2018 i. tax on beverage volume or sugar content ii. tax a broad range of sugary drinks iii. set an adequate tax rate 4. Invest some revenue in comprehensive health promotion campaign targeted towards high users which supports a switch to healthier alternatives. 5. Ensure other healthy beverages (including tap water, bottled water) are more affordable than sugary drinks 6. Monitor enforcement and the health impact over time to make any necessary adjustments What about regressivity? 1. Consumption is elastic. Studies show that children, adolescents, low-income populations, overweight individuals and high consumers are generally more sensitive to price increases. 2. Sugary drinks provide little or no nutritional benefit: money can be spent on more nutritional food. 3. Poorer households face higher levels of health risk factors and so stand to benefit more from shifting consumption away from sugary drinks. 4. Any regressive nature of a tax could be further offset by using the revenue gained from to provide health-promotion programmes targeted to low-income groups. Toni Ashton 11 April 2018 .

C o r p o r a t e T a x p a y e r s G r o u p C T G 30 April 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 WELLINGTON Dear Secretariat TAX WORKING GROUP FUTURE OF TAX: SUBMISSIONS BACKGROUND PAPER The Corporate Taxpayers Group (“the Group”) is writing to submit on the Tax Working Group’s Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper (“the submissions paper”). The Group’s submission addresses the questions asked throughout the Paper, in particular commenting on the areas that affect our membership, as well as providing broader comments on various aspects of the tax system. The Group would welcome the opportunity to make an oral submission to the Tax Working Group (“TWG”) on the contents of this submission. ABOUT THE GROUP – INFORMED, PRINCIPLED, PRACTICAL About the Group The Corporate Taxpayers Group is an organisation of major New Zealand companies that works with key Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to achieve positive changes to tax policy in New Zealand. The focus of the Group is achieving the right corporate tax policy settings for New Zealand’s tax system, not to push individual or industry specific agendas. The Group has traditionally not only devoted resources to responding to issues being progressed by Inland Revenue, but has also been forward-looking and proactively raises policy and operational issues to ensure that the tax system is working efficiently and effectively. The most significant stakeholders of Group members are New Zealanders, and therefore a New Zealand economy and society that is functioning well is in the interests of the Group. The Group’s Principles for a Good Tax System Underpinning the Group’s submissions and engagement on tax policy matters are three main principles that the Group believes a good tax system should be built around:  High certainty, predictability and low business risk;  Low compliance costs; and  International competitiveness. These principles are central to the way the Group judges tax policy issues and we discuss these further below in our submission. \[1\] CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 2 of 48 CTGCTG INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS In preparing this submission, members were surveyed for their opinions on the various questions asked in the submissions paper and this submission incorporates some of the themes arising from this survey. The submissions paper and issues arising from this have also been discussed at Group meetings and via other forms of correspondence. Given the Group’s varied constituency, there are areas in this submission where we discuss the potential impact of an issue but do not as a Group express a preference / opinion either way. In these situations the Group does not intend to imply that we support or do not support particular issues and silence as to an issue (or no clear view) merely reflects the short consultation period, the broad potential breadth of the TWG’s review, the lack of detailed information about options and trade-offs, our broad membership base and the differing impact different taxes will have on their diverse businesses. With this in mind, we would like to emphasise that any changes arising from recommendations made by the TWG (and accepted by the Government) should be consulted on in full, in accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process (“GTPP”). It is vital that detailed policy decisions are not made by the TWG without the proposals being considered by the wider public in the usual way. New Zealand has an effective and robust tax system and some of this success is attributable to the transparent and meaningful consultation between Officials and stakeholders. It is important that this continues in the future. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF SUBMISSION POINTS Competitiveness and the future It is vital that the New Zealand tax system helps create a business environment which is better than that which exists in competing countries. The tax system needs to support and incentivise, rather than hinder, economic growth. Other countries actively seek to compete on taxes in order to attract investment and the submissions paper does not place enough emphasis on the importance of New Zealand’s need for financial capital. As New Zealand and “New Zealand Inc” look towards the future, we must ensure that we have the flexibility and capability to capitalise on opportunities as they arise. It is in New Zealand’s best interests to continue attracting and retaining not only business investment but also individuals who, like many businesses, have the choice of whether to base themselves in New Zealand or not. This needs to be considered in a business tax context, particularly when the corporate tax rate is considered. Given the TWG’s unique opportunity to broadly consider New Zealand’s tax system, it is important to consider the “overall equation”. What is the overall package of initiatives that New Zealand has in place, should have in place, and would like to have in place for the benefit and growth of New Zealand. A strong corporate sector A strong corporate sector is important for any country’s economy, and New Zealand is no different. It is important that New Zealand’s corporate sector is maintained and continues to grow. New Zealand ranks first overall in the latest World Bank survey on ease of doing business, but only 9 th when it comes to paying taxes. In recent years we have seen micro reforms, increasing compliance costs for New Zealand businesses. This burden should not be increased with the introduction of complex new tax rules and we should focus on improving the current tax settings for New Zealand. CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 3 of 48 CTGCTG The Group refers you to the ATO’s computable general equilibrium (“CGE”) modelling of the major Australian taxes, which concludes that company income tax has a high marginal excess burden and that, in the long run, much of the economic burden of company tax falls on workers; i.e. the taxes on the corporate sector have the highest long-term costs for living standards and are more ‘harmful’ than other taxes. The corporate tax rate needs to be competitive The OECD 2017 Economic Survey of New Zealand noted “It is hard to see how \[New Zealand\] can resist the global trend to lower corporate tax rates without losing out on foreign investment.” Lowering the corporate tax rate is therefore something New Zealand must also consider. As it stands, New Zealand has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the OECD. Further, four of the five OECD countries with higher tax rates than New Zealand (Greece, Belgium, Australia and France) have proposals to reduce their corporate tax rates to lower than New Zealand’s current rate of 28%. Despite other jurisdictions (in particular the UK) being at the forefront of targeting BEPS, they have also recognised the need for balance and are vocal about their goal of having a competitive corporate tax system, with the UK committed to a 17% corporate tax rate. In the past there have been concerns with the ‘wedge’ (difference between the corporate and individual tax rates) being too large, and avoidance opportunities arising due to the non-alignment of tax rates. In the Group’s view, the level of concern around an increased wedge is not necessarily justified, particularly given the measures now in place to address avoidance opportunities (such as the personal services income attribution rule). It would also be possible to adopt some form of an integrated company tax regime where the profits of the company are either attributed to the shareholder or taxed at the shareholder’s tax rate (or some proxy thereof). Alternatively we need a competitive effective tax rate If the corporate tax rate cannot be lowered to a competitive tax rate, then the tax base on which that higher rate is levied needs to be reconsidered. Possible examples of measures that could reduce the effective tax rate include a comprehensive tax deduction regime (e.g. for black hole expenditure), changes to the depreciation base, rate and low value threshold, or relaxation of rules that spread or defer deductions for expenditure as well as incentivised deductions (e.g. R&D), relaxation of thin capitalisation rules is also an option. Such measures may have the added advantage of reducing unnecessary compliance costs. The Group notes that it can see a place for tax incentives, with tax rewarding positive actions; for example accelerated depreciation on electric vehicles or sustainably innovative technology, reduced fringe benefit tax for electric vehicles to recognise the lower running costs. Corporate tax base There are specific aspects of the corporate tax base that need to be addressed, including:  Widely-held look-through companies  Black hole expenditure  Loss continuity  Non-resident employee issues  Tax pooling  Fringe benefit tax CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 4 of 48 CTGCTG  Entertainment expenditure  Provisional tax – tax income method (TIM) for large taxpayers The Group considers that there is further scope to reduce compliance costs for businesses and we refer you to our “Business Tax Wish List” attached as an Appendix to this submission. Over the past few years the Group has seen the need for flexibility in the tax system emerge as one of the most important considerations. Aspects of the tax rules are currently too prescriptive and can be hard to get right. Rigidity and strictness add compliance costs without adding any significant benefit. Purposes and principles of a good tax system Underpinning all of the Group’s submissions on tax policy matters are three main principles that the Group believes a good tax system should be built around. These are:  High certainty, predictability and low business risk  Low compliance costs  International competitiveness The Group is also of the firm belief that a properly functioning GTPP is an appropriate measure for all parties to apply and adhere to, allowing for transparent and meaningful consultation between officials and stakeholders. However sitting above all of this is the first and foremost consideration of national interest – what is in the best interests of New Zealand as a whole? Fairness The submissions paper focuses a lot on the idea of fairness. Fairness is a subjective concept. In the Group’s view, to the extent fairness is intended to encompass progressivity, this objective is best addressed through the transfer system and targeted measures that address problems at source. The role of the tax system should be as a mechanism for revenue collection in the most efficient (and least distortive) way possible. One area in which fairness can, however, be a guiding principle in tax system design concerns the need for maintaining the tax legislation to ensure it applies as intended. Given the complexity of the tax system, there will inevitably be a need for the correction of drafting errors and other amendments to address unforeseen issues from time to time. Fairness requires that an appropriate balance be struck between Inland Revenue led base maintenance initiatives (to address the risk of under-taxation) and taxpayer favourable initiatives to address unintended overreach that would result in over taxation, relative to the policy intent. Broader macro initiatives to remove impediments to investment that would grow tax revenues should also be part of the mix. Broad-base low-rate (BBLR) The Group has been a longstanding supporter of New Zealand’s BBLR system and continues to support BBLR as an appropriate approach for our tax system. BBLR minimises distortions in the tax system and allows for tax to be a relatively neutral factor in decision making. However, the Group considers that in recent years there has been a trend towards detail and complexity this is driving inefficiency. Detailed rules to address every conceivable compliance risk or possible gap are resulting in increased compliance costs to the vast majority of taxpayers who are seeking to comply with their obligations. Taxpayers should be afforded more freedom in which to run their businesses rather than spend time and CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 5 of 48 CTGCTG resources trying to comply with complex and uncertain tax law – as noted earlier, compliance costs are part of the deadweight loss associated with tax. The focus has been on micro reform, when in reality it is macro reform that is needed. Compliant taxpayers are made to weave their way through an increasingly complex labyrinth of rules, designed to combat the behaviour or risks associated with a minority of non-compliant taxpayers. A better approach is for Inland Revenue to identify those non- compliant taxpayers and enforce existing laws including (in cases of aggressive tax avoidance) by applying section BG 1 and other anti-avoidance provisions. If the tax base is to be broadened significantly, such as if a capital gains tax is introduced, it is important that changes in other areas of tax are considered so that the overall effective tax rate is not driven up as a result. Capital gains tax Given the Group’s diverse membership, we do not have a view on whether a capital gains tax (CGT) should be introduced or not. However some of our members have strong views that a CGT is harmful and unnecessary and are planning to lodge their own submissions setting out these views. We do note, however, that in a world of falling corporate tax rates, the lack of a general capital gains tax is one of the few competitive advantages the New Zealand tax system offers to businesses looking to locate themselves in New Zealand. If a capital gains tax is introduced, care must be taken to minimise complexity and compliance costs. For this reason the Group considers that a targeted CGT would be preferred. For more detailed comments on a CGT (and answers to the CGT design questions posed in the submissions paper), please see our submission below.

If there is broadening of the base there needs to be a lowering of the rate. Tax changes can only be evaluated in the context of the wider package of reform. Growing NZ Inc New Zealand has a need for capital, from both within NZ and offshore. The tax regime needs to be competitive to bring in foreign capital. Let’s be aspirational and get out there and compete. Preferences for housing The statistics show a tax preference for housing (including owner occupied housing) but is this driving New Zealand’s housing problems? The CTG suggests reforms directly targeting housing are preferable when weighing up the potential revenue vs compliance costs of a capital gains tax. Incentivising saving into the right things Tax rules need to incentivise New Zealanders to save and invest in productive assets. A capital gains tax on savings products would not create the right incentives. Business costs should be deductible Tax rules are overtaxing businesses looking to grow and innovate. Business costs should be deductible, industrial buildings should be depreciable, debt and equity raising costs should be treated the same; the list goes on. Businesses need to get on with business Tax rules are becoming unnecessarily complex and are increasing compliance costs on businesses. Business is already the unpaid tax collector. Any tax reform needs to be conscious of the cost to comply. Looking through to shareholders Large projects often require multiple investors. New Zealand needs tax rules that allow investors with different tax profiles to co-exist. This could be tax integration, a form of widely-held look-through company, or something else. Letting businesses grow without tax consequences Innovative start up businesses will typically be in a loss position and the tax rules penalise businesses that need to bring in new shareholders. Loss continuity rules are hampering the ability of businesses to grow. The headline tax rate The corporate rate involves a trade off in how to tax mobile and immobile capital. It is important, however, that the resulting tax rate is competitive so as to attract mobile capital. Company taxes are more harmful than other taxes and consideration should be given to shifting to more efficient taxes. The effective tax rate If the headline rate can’t move then what can be done to enhance deductions to reduce the effective tax rate on mobile capital? BEPS changes and black hole expenditure have been increasing the ETR. CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 7 of 48 CTGCTG APPENDIX ONE – THE GROUP’S SUBMISSION The Group has set out (in green boxes) the “Questions for submitters” in the submissions paper, in the order that these questions are asked by the TWG and below each question the Group sets out its response. 1. The future environment What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium-to long term? Which of these are most important? Competitiveness and the future 1.1. The Group believes that New Zealand’s tax system plays a critical role in our competitive position with our major trading partners and competitors – tax is a significant cost of doing business. The New Zealand tax system should help create a business environment which is better than that which exists in competing countries. The tax system needs to support and incentivise rather than hinder economic growth. 1.2. This need to be tax competitive with other jurisdictions is very important, in order to attract and retain foreign investment. Taxes are distortionary and if taxes are excessive, they will ultimately be passed onto New Zealanders. New Zealand is a small economy reliant on exports, right next to a very large Australian economy. New Zealand is in a constant struggle against Australia for capital / foreign direct investment (“FDI”), particularly given we are geographically separated from the world. Other countries actively seek to compete on taxes in order to attract investment and the submissions paper does not place enough emphasis on the importance of New Zealand’s need for financial capital. 1.3. It is worth noting that the Australian Treasurer has requested that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics conduct an inquiry into the impediments to business investment in Australia. 1 In the media release, the Treasurer noted that: “Business investment is critical to economic growth. When firms are empowered to invest in new productive capacity and technology, it supports innovation and helps create new opportunities and employment for Australians.” The inquiry also specifically includes consideration of: “The role that taxation policy, at the Commonwealth and State government levels, can have on the encouragement of new business investment.” 1 http://sjm.ministers.treasury.gov.au/media-release/030-2018/ CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 8 of 48 CTGCTG The results of this report should be considered carefully by New Zealand. In New Zealand the coalition Government 2 : “is committed to \[...\] sustainable economic development increased exports and decent jobs paying higher wages, a healthy environment, a fair society and good government.” 1.4. This economic perspective is missing from the submissions paper. We cannot look at the New Zealand tax system in isolation and in relation only to itself, we must also look at tax systems of competing jurisdictions and the wider economic context. Increased financial capital is important for an economy like New Zealand and greater FDI not only brings in more capital, but also new ideas and innovation. Yet all New Zealand has done recently is increase complexity in the tax system (take the BEPS reforms as an example), actions that will only act to reduce the level of investment in New Zealand. However we do understand that the TWG has had a full briefing on the New Zealand economic environment and therefore should be well briefed on the impact that tax changes can have on the economy. We also note that the April 2018 Government discussion document in respect of research & development Fuelling innovation to transform our economy which is an example of tax assisting with improving the competitiveness of the economy. 1.5. An appropriate starting point is to ask the ‘simple’ question, where does New Zealand see itself in twenty years? This requires not only consideration of where we would like to be, but consideration of the reality of the international landscape, changing demographics and attitudes, and the evolution of technology and digital economies. If there is to be meaningful reform, we must look further ahead than merely 5-10 years into the future. Considering the time it will take to get any meaningful change enacted (in following the TWG and proper consultation processes), New Zealand’s position in the world (and indeed the world itself) will have already moved on. We need to consider where we see ourselves in the future (e.g. will we still be heavily reliant on dairy and agricultural exports and tourism or will we be a land of digital entrepreneurs?), and then future proof our tax system so that we can adapt and react to the changes to come. 1.6. Part of this is to consider where in the value chain New Zealand will lie. We are currently an industry based country, with a solid foundation based on our natural capital and labour capital. However, in the future we would expect to see a more mobile workforce, less reliance on natural resources and a more digitalised industry where it doesn’t matter where you are based. It is important that New Zealand adapts to meet this challenge. 1.7. We must also specifically consider who we think New Zealand’s major trading partners will be and identify the businesses and people we think will be coming to New Zealand in the future (or that we would want to attract to New Zealand). These trading partners, businesses and people may not be those that we have traditionally favoured / worked with, but we must have the flexibility to capitalise on opportunities as they arise. 1.8. New Zealand will want to continue attracting and retaining not only business investment but also individuals who, like many businesses, have the choice of whether to base themselves in New Zealand or not. One way of attracting these 2 Coalition Agreement New Zealand Labour Party & New Zealand First refer > http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1710/S00058/coalition-agreement-nz-first-and-labour.htm CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 9 of 48 CTGCTG taxpayers could be to reduce headline tax rates. However, if some of the tax base is lost, there would need to be more reliance placed on sourcing tax revenue from other sources. This needs to be considered in a business tax context, particularly when the corporate tax rate is considered. 1.9. With the above in mind, the Group sets out below some of the key areas of opportunities, risk and challenges it sees for the tax system. Company taxes A strong corporate sector 1.10. A strong corporate sector is important for any country’s economy, and New Zealand is no different. Corporates employ a significant section of New Zealand’s working population and there is a direct correlation between a successful corporate sector and growth and innovation. The previous Government’s Business Growth Agenda noted the importance of New Zealand being internationally connected, as internationally connected firms can access large markets and bigger opportunities. In particular: “With access to bigger pools of capital, skills and ideas, most internationally connected firms are more innovative and productive. They are therefore critical to creating jobs and lifting incomes in a sustainable way.” 3 These “internationally connected” firms are those such as the corporates that make up the Group’s membership base. They are also the corporates we want to invest in New Zealand and those that we want to trade with New Zealand 4 . For these corporates, their potential tax impost and the perceived complexity and compliance costs within the tax system are hugely significant factors for them in deciding whether to do business in and/or with New Zealand. It is important that the tax system does not act as a deterrent. 1.11. New Zealand prides itself on the ease of doing business in New Zealand, particularly in relation to setting up companies and other company administration. However the same cannot be said for our tax system (at least overall). In recent years we have seen micro reforms, increasing the burden of paying tax (from a compliance costs perspective) on businesses in New Zealand. This burden should not be increased with the introduction of complex new tax rules and we should focus on improving the current tax settings for New Zealand. In this regard we note that the latest World Bank survey on ease of doing business ranked New Zealand as first overall, but only 9 th when it comes to paying taxes. 5 The corporate tax rate needs to be competitive 1.12. The Group understands that a reduction in the corporate tax rate is not as simple as it sounds, and that many factors must be taken into account. However the Group notes that recently there has been a trend within the OECD member countries of recognising the need for a competitive tax system and reducing their corporate tax rate. The OECD 2017 Economic Survey of New Zealand noted "it is hard to see how \[New Zealand\] can resist the global trend to lower corporate tax rates without losing 3 https://enz.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/BGA-2017-refresh-report.pdf 4 The OECD in the 2017 Economic Survey of New Zealand recognised the importance of international connections for improving productivity. See OECD, OECD Economic Surveys: New Zealand (2017) at 16. 5 http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 10 of 48 CTGCTG out on foreign investment" 6 . Lowering the corporate tax rate is therefore something New Zealand must also consider. 1.13. For example Australia intends to lower its corporate tax rate to 25%, the UK is dropping its corporate tax rate to 17% from April 2020 and the US has lowered its corporate tax rate to 21%. We have attached as an Appendix the OECD corporate tax rates and rates of parties to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, including any proposed changes. As it stands, New Zealand has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the OECD. Further, four of the five OECD countries with higher tax rates than New Zealand (Greece, Belgium, Australia and France) all have proposals to reduce their corporate tax rates to lower than New Zealand’s 28%. 1.14. This difference is even more pronounced given our broad-base low-rate tax system and the general lack of tax incentives (unlike most other jurisdictions) which means our effective cash tax rate is close to or exceeds the corporate tax rate. Other jurisdictions (in particular the UK) have been at the forefront of targeting BEPS, but they have also recognised the need for balance and are vocal about their goal of having a competitive corporate tax system. While the Group agrees that lowering the corporate tax rate is not a silver bullet, New Zealand needs to keep an eye on the corporate tax rates and tax systems of other countries and not let itself fall behind. Where the gap between New Zealand and other countries widens, New Zealand is at a real risk of becoming a less attractive investment destination. 1.15. The impact of the corporate tax rate on the cost of capital and investment attractiveness is an important issue for the wellbeing of New Zealanders. New Zealand relies heavily on inbound investment to fund its capital stock and a range of studies have suggested that New Zealand has under-developed financial markets and low capital intensity. As a consequence, productivity is negatively affected. New Zealand’s taxation framework for inbound investment notes there “\[t\]here is a reasonable degree of consensus in the literature that FDI is normally highly sensitive to the company tax rate.” 7 1.16. The Group understands that Inland Revenue may be concerned with avoidance opportunities due to the nonalignment of tax rates (i.e. if the ‘wedge’ is perceived as being too large). However the Group would like to see an analysis / study of whether this is in fact the case (which could include a study of how other countries have addressed this issue, such as with Australia’s current 30% company tax rate and the top personal tax rate of 45%). In the Group’s view, the level of concern around an increased wedge is not necessarily justified, particularly given the increased controls and settings that have been put in place to address avoidance. The Group notes that within this debate imputation plays an important role as a back stop to the corporate tax rate. Without having undertaken a full assessment of the regime, the Group considers that, on-balance, the imputation system is working well and should be retained. 1.17. Leaving the above aside, educated investors will look beyond the corporate tax rate and look more broadly at New Zealand’s tax settings when determining whether they will invest in New Zealand. Our international tax settings in particular play a part in this. Around the world, jurisdictions moving towards or with low corporate tax rates have implemented, amongst other things, interest limitation and thin capitalisation changes to balance the low corporate tax rate. However in New Zealand, we have implemented these changes to the international settings and left our corporate tax rate where it is. There has been no overall rebalancing of the tax system. The 6 OECD Economic Surveys: New Zealand (2017) at 40. 7 Inland Revenue New Zealand's taxation framework for inbound investment (June 2016) at 8. CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 11 of 48 CTGCTG consequence of this is that both our headline and effective corporate tax rate risk falling out of step with the global trend, with the result that capital becomes harder or more costly for New Zealand to attract. 1.18. If the ‘non-alignment’ concerns over the personal and corporate tax rate are considered to be persuasive, then consideration could be given to adopting some form of an integrated company regime where the profits of the company are either attributed to the shareholder or otherwise taxed at the shareholder’s tax rate (or some proxy thereto). This would ensure that domestic shareholders are not able to shelter income from tax through the use of a corporate structure whilst ensuring that the company tax rate remains competitive to attract capital to New Zealand. Such a regime would involve some complexity. However, a similar regime has in effect successfully been in place within the savings industry via the Portfolio Investment Entity (“PIE”) regime. 1.19. An integrated company regime would allow for a more deliberate targeting of the corporate tax rate to allow it to be competitive without concern for domestic avoidance opportunities that the non-alignment of the corporate and personal tax rates may be perceived to provide. We note that there are a variety of valid commercial reasons for companies retaining earnings at the expense of dividends, e.g. for planned investment. 1.20. The complexity of such a regime would in part be driven by the desire for accuracy. Full integration would be the most complex, but some sort of calculation similar to the PIE regime where income is taxed based on the shareholder’s tax rate (or proxy) may allow for a less complex system. However, regardless of whether an integrated regime is adopted to address the non-alignment issue, we consider the ability for taxpayers to utilise a tax pass-through corporate entity is important as it reduces complexity. This is particularly true in comparison with New Zealand’s unwieldy limited partnership regime. This will improve our competitiveness and puts New Zealand on the same footing as Australia which is implementing a tax pass-through company regime. Alternatively we need a competitive effective tax rate 1.21. If the corporate tax rate cannot be lowered to a competitive rate, then the tax base on which that higher rate is levied needs to be re-considered. Possible examples of measures that could reduce the effective tax rate include a comprehensive tax deduction regime (e.g. black hole expenditure, wind back of thin capitalisation rules), changes to the depreciation base and rates, enhanced timing of deductions as well as incentivised deductions (e.g. R&D). Such measures may have the added advantage of reducing unnecessary compliance costs. 1.22. In June 2016 Inland Revenue released a draft paper New Zealand’s taxation framework for inbound investment (“inbound investment framework paper”). The inbound investment framework paper was an overview of New Zealand’s framework for taxing income earned on inbound investment and noted that a priority for the Government (at that time) was “...to ensure that New Zealand continues to be a good place to invest and for businesses to be based, grow and flourish. Excessive taxes on inbound investment can get in the way of this happening.” CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 12 of 48 CTGCTG 1.23. While the paper did not conclude on whether a reduction in corporate tax is necessary, it did note that the non-deductibility of certain expenditure for non- residents drives up their effective tax rate. For example: “...if the foreign country had a lower company tax rate than New Zealand, the foreign parent would prefer to debt-finance its New Zealand subsidiary and tighter thin capitalisation rules would lead to an increase in the effective tax rate on inbound investment and an increase in the pre-tax cost of capital for that investor.” 1.24. As the inbound investment framework paper 8 notes, there is a difference between the effective tax rate and the full corporate tax rate for non-residents investing in New Zealand. It is a common feature of tax systems internationally that non- residents are not subject to the full corporate tax rate on all their returns, since part of those returns will usually be in the form of interest. This is the case in New Zealand also. Provided certain thresholds are met and non-resident withholding tax (“NRWT”) is paid, non-residents can debt fund a portion of their investment, and the New Zealand tax on the interest component of the non-resident’s return will be the relevant NRWT rate. For example, non-resident owned corporates are taxed at 28% on the equity component of their investment, but (typically) at 10% on the debt component (note that if NRWT applies on dividends, then the tax burden on equity could potentially be higher than 28%). 1.25. However, if there is a reluctance to reduce the 28% corporate rate, the Group queries what the TWG consider is the ideal effective rate for non-residents? If a non-resident has money to invest, they have a choice of where they want to invest this money and will look at all their options. New Zealand needs to remain competitive. 1.26. One potential solution is to evaluate the boundary between debt and equity to allow non-residents to take out earnings as interest subject to NRWT – which will lower their effective tax rate (depending on the mix of debt / equity). As it stands, if the tax rate does not change and there is increased tightening on debt funding, this will have an overall negative effect. While it might be politically expedient to look to clamp down on non-residents putting debt into New Zealand we have to acknowledge the flipside, which is that this will reduce investment in New Zealand. CGE modelling on company taxes 1.27. In March 2015 the Australian Taxation Office released a tax discussion paper, Re:think Better tax system, better Australia (the “Re:think discussion paper”). 9 A section of this report covered the CGE (computable general equilibrium) modelling of the major Australian taxes, concluding that stamp duties and company income tax have the greatest “marginal excess burden” (i.e. they are the taxes with the highest long-term costs for living standards and are more ‘harmful’ than other taxes). The following graph sets out the results of CGE modelling on the various taxes in Australia. While obviously specific to the Australian context, the Group expects a similar study run in New Zealand would generate broadly the same results. 8 http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2016-other-nz-framework-inbound-investment.pdf 9 http://bettertax.gov.au/files/2015/03/TWP\_combined-online.pdf CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 13 of 48 CTGCTG 1.28. Some key points to draw out from this report include: “Company income tax has a high marginal excess burden because of the relatively high company tax rate of 30% in Australia, combined with the high level of mobility of the underlying tax base.” “Recent research by the Treasury indicates that, in the long run, much of the burden or incidence of company tax falls on Australian workers. This is because, over time, the amount of capital investment in Australia (for example, the construction of buildings and purchase of equipment for production) is affected by the company tax rate. Lower amounts of capital investment in the Australian economy will reduce the output or productivity of labour and, in turn, reduce the real wages of workers.” “The high economic cost of some taxes, combined with the distribution of those costs through the economy, has prompted a policy response internationally. Many countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada, have reduced their company tax rate in recent years and strengthened their integrity rules to counter multinational planning. Consequently, while Australia’s integrity rules are strong, our company tax rate of 30 per cent is now significantly above the average rate of other countries, particularly our Asian neighbours, with whom we compete for foreign investment.” The above suggests that New Zealand would be better off reducing corporate income tax (or seeking to reduce the effective tax rate) and should instead seek to maintain CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 14 of 48 CTGCTG the tax base through other, less harmful taxes, such as GST. The impact of the corporate tax rate on FDI cannot be underestimated and it is important that this is considered carefully as part of the wider consideration of corporate / business taxes. GST 1.29. The Group acknowledges that the TWG has been precluded from looking at raising the overall GST rate. However an increase in the GST rate would be the simplest and most efficient method of raising more revenue if that is considered necessary. The government could amend the benefits regime to “compensate” low earners for the increased GST (or make corresponding tax rate changes to lessen the impact). The figures below (taken from the TWG report but based on OECD statistics) show New Zealand has a relatively high corporate tax rate, but one of the lowest GST rates in the OECD. CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 15 of 48 CTGCTG Corporate tax base 1.30. In the Group’s view, there are also some specific aspects of the corporate tax base that need to be addressed. We set out below some specific examples of issues of importance to the business community. We also refer you to our “Business Tax Wish List” attached as an Appendix to this submission. Widely held look-through companies 1.31. The closely-held look-through company regime recognise the distortions and added costs that the interposition of a corporate vehicle can have. The Group would like the benefits and treatment of closely held look-through companies to be extended to widely held companies, creating an entity that can be described as a widely held look- through company (“widely-held LTC”). Small companies can use LTCs and private equity can use limited partnerships. However widely-held corporates have fewer options (and can struggle to use limited partnerships as these are unwieldy and not well understood offshore). 1.32. Most businesses prefer to use companies as these are a relatively simple and well- known form of entity. However, companies have significant tax implications when there are different tax profiles in play (i.e. ordinary companies, non-resident investors, charities, Maori authorities etc) meaning income can be over-taxed relative to the tax profile of the shareholder. This can incentivise the use of more complicated structures, such as limited partnerships, which allow for income to be taxed at the level of the investor. 1.33. Introducing the concept of a widely held LTC would go a long way towards increasing New Zealand’s competitiveness in the international market. It is notable that Australia has put forward proposals 10 in this space and it is likely that changes will be made in the near future. 10 https://consult.treasury.gov.au/financial-system-division/asia-region-funds-passport/ CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 16 of 48 CTGCTG Loss continuity 1.34. The Group, along with a number of interested business groups including BusinessNZ, have formally collaborated to advocate for a change in New Zealand’s loss continuity rules. In short, we would like to see an amendment to the law that currently disadvantages many fast growing and innovative companies. Specifically, the proposal is to amend the current rule relating to the carry forward of tax losses by enacting a "same or similar business" test as an alternative to the existing 49% continuity of ownership requirement. Such a change would bring New Zealand's rules into line with those of many comparable jurisdictions, reduce compliance costs, and further the potential for business growth. 1.35. We also note the Government’s recent discussion document on R&D tax credits suggests excess R&D tax credits will be carried forward on a similar basis to tax losses. The lack of an alternative carry forward test in this context means carried forward credits will potentially be forfeited where new equity is sought by these innovative and fast growing companies, defeating the purpose of the regime. Black hole expenditure 1.36. Over the years there have been a number of ad hoc changes to address specific types of black hole expenditure, and Officials have recently been working with the Group on a solution to deal with “feasibility expenditure”. Substantial work has been performed and possible solutions have been explored which the Group would like to see completed as soon as possible. 1.37. However, in addition to feasibility expenditure there are still a number of other categories of black hole expenditure in the New Zealand tax system, where tax deductions are not available for legitimate business costs. The Group believes that the following examples of black hole expenditure require consideration:  Costs incurred by a business seeking to raise debt funding (either by way of a traditional loan or by issuing bonds), where ultimately the taxpayer does not successfully raise that debt.  Costs incurred in raising equity (i.e. through the issue of shares). This creates a tax preference (i.e. a distortion) to raise debt over equity.  Certain resource consent costs and certain improvements made to land.  Losses on disposal of buildings (i.e. where the building is sold below its tax book value). A tax deduction is available for a loss made on the disposal of any asset aside from a building. When a taxpayer disposes of a building below its original cost, there is unquestionably a reduction in the value of the building. The Group believes this should be allowed as a deduction when the building is ultimately sold.  Capital expenditure to earthquake strengthen buildings. Many taxpayers have suffered a reduction in the value of their buildings due to a reassessment of the seismic risks. When they incur expenditure to strengthen the building, they obtain no tax relief for these costs given the removal of tax depreciation on buildings. In many cases the expenditure is simply a result of changing building regulations. Taxpayers should be allowed to claim a tax deduction for that expenditure either upfront or amortised over time. We believe this should be considered in detail by the Government. CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 17 of 48 CTGCTG  Costs incurred in acquiring a business asset, for example due diligence costs, especially when the acquisition does not proceed. 1.38. Previous governments have sought to resolve instances of black hole expenditure one at a time. However the Group notes that there is a case for a broader “catch all” category, to provide a tax deduction for black hole expenditure that is not otherwise covered by specific legislation. This would minimise the resource demands on Inland Revenue and the private sector alike. In this respect the Group notes that Australia adopts this “catch all” approach to black hole expenditure by providing an effective deduction for black hole expenditure which is not otherwise deductible spread over a period of 5 years. While such an approach has an obvious cost, this is significantly outweighed by the benefit of simplifying the position and eliminating the additional deadweight loss of a more complicated regime; a more holistic solution will also significantly reduce compliance costs judging the capital / revenue boundary and could be fiscally positive 11 . The Group has previously endorsed this approach and would like to work with Officials on this issue. 1.39. Some, but not all, of the issues raised above have a connection with capital (that is, if capital gains are to be taxed, capital expenditure should be deductible). As part of the consideration of the introduction of a CGT, some of the above issues should be analysed at the same time given the overlap and interconnectivity of the issues. However, the Group notes that even outside of the introduction of a CGT there remains a need to resolve the issue of black hole expenditure. Research & development expenditure – wider reform 1.40. The Group sees loss continuity, R&D tax credits and black hole expenditure as part of a wider package of attracting business to New Zealand and fuelling positive expenditure and growth within New Zealand as a whole. These are issues that should be considered together and given the release of the recent R&D discussion paper (which mentions tax losses), there should be more thought given to a broader approach for New Zealand Inc. In particular, the Group considers that a solution to black hole expenditure is just as important and relevant as R&D in the context of attracting the large firms to New Zealand. 1.41. The R&D discussion paper notes that there is a lack of R&D being carried out by large companies (and that New Zealand lacks the large multinational companies driving R&D expenditure overseas). It also notes that large firms bring resources to the economy that small firms struggle to provide, such as high quality managers and entrepreneurs, knowledge of international markets, large capital budgets, corporate finance and a customer base for smaller high-growth firms. If multinationals are so important to New Zealand, then more should be done to attract them, and addressing the issue of black hole expenditure should be high on this list. Tax remedials 1.42. The Group supports a more flexible process for dealing with remedial tax matters. The tax system is complex. There will inevitably be aspects of the legislation that do not apply as intended. In addition, there can sometimes be areas where minor technical changes would improve the way the tax system operates. 1.43. A more flexible approach to administration (such as is called for below) does not remove the need for adequate resourcing for progressing remedial amendments. The 11 As taxpayers may conservatively amortise expenditure over 5 years rather than taking an immediate deduction CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 18 of 48 CTGCTG pace and scale of tax reform inevitably leads to drafting errors and other instances of the law not operating as it should and hence an increased demand for resources to remedy these deficiencies. At the same time, the demands that the general tax law reform programme places on Inland Revenue constrains the resources available to address remedial tax matters. 1.44. The problem will likely be exacerbated in the future as many of the current reforms are complex and will likely involve post implementation issues that need remedying. Addressing remedial matters when they arise ensures that tax law operates as intended. If these tax remedials are not addressed on a timely basis this will create significant uncertainty for taxpayers. Therefore, dedicating sufficient Inland Revenue policy resource to addressing remedial tax matters regardless of other priorities is essential for maintaining perceptions of fairness and public support for the tax system. Non-resident employees: source and the traditional work environment 1.45. The residency and source rules are an area that will need to be considered further as we move into a world of advanced technology and increased mobility. The make-up of the future workforce is expected to look very different to what it is now, with the existence of some jobs under threat and new jobs expected to be created. It is also expected that many roles will become automated and the future workforce will be more mobile (if not already so). The traditional work environment and workforce as we see it now is changing. 1.46. This change represents both an opportunity and a threat for New Zealand. In the future, the tax base we are taxing now will not exist in the same form and it is important that the New Zealand tax system is flexible enough to adapt for these changes. New Zealand operates on a broad-base low-rate system so it is important to remain agile to retain the benefits of this system and not just in relation to residency. 1.47. In particular, the Group has long supported changes to the tax system to take into account non-resident employee issues. The key issue that arises is where an employer/employee relies on a day count exemption (either 92 day domestic rule or 183 day treaty rule) to not withhold PAYE in New Zealand and then the individual inadvertently breaches the relevant limit. Penalties and interest then apply from day one. The Group would like to see to some leniency applied in this area and a wider review of this issue to consider the way the PAYE rules apply to non-residents working in New Zealand. 1.48. It is arguable that in the future the taxation of non-residents should become a matter of administration for the government (as opposed to employers). For example, immigration could identify non-residents entering New Zealand on working visas and pass their information on to Inland Revenue (including their contact details). These people would be given information about their tax obligations and would need to fill out some sort of disclosure form (could be part of the visa application process). Inland Revenue could then contact the non-resident person(s) and deal with them directly on the collection of appropriate deductions (i.e. taxes, withholdings, levies etc from the income or revenue they earn whilst in New Zealand). On leaving New Zealand the non-resident person(s) would be required to make a declaration or obtain clearance about the payment of taxes. Such a process (acknowledging that this would need to be refined) would remove some of the current issues and risks faced by employers and other payers of non-resident contractors. CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 19 of 48 CTGCTG Tax pooling 1.49. The tax pooling regime exists to try and overcome the fact that interest rates that the Inland Revenue charges and pays on under and overpaid tax are the same across all sectors of the economy regardless of their credit risk. The reality for much of corporate New Zealand is that the rate of interest charged by Inland Revenue exceeds the corporate’s cost of funds. Consequently, such taxpayers typically overpay their tax instalments to mitigate the risk of the higher Inland Revenue interest rate applying. This results in an inefficiency in that money is in effect deposited with Inland Revenue at less than market rates. 1.50. Assuming that a single interest rate dynamic remains, it is imperative that the pooling regime is effective to mitigate the additional deadweight loss that such an interest regime imposes. The numerous amendments to the pooling regime that have been required to overcome restrictive applications of this regime by Inland Revenue evidence that it has not been fully successful in this regard and issues still remain. With this as background, the Group would support a broad review of the tax pooling regime, in particular consideration of whether the regime is working as intended, and whether any changes are necessary following amendments to the provisional tax regime and other Business Transformation changes. Fringe Benefit Tax 1.51. The Group supports a review of the FBT regime. The FBT rules currently operate in a punitive manner, leading to significant over taxation of benefits. In particular, the Group believes that the FBT rules in relation to motor vehicles do not reflect the commercial and practical reality of the benefit being provided to employees. Other FBT issues could also be considered such as removing FBT from certain “positive” benefits, including the provision of electric / hybrid cars to employees (at a minimum there should be a reduction in how FBT is calculated given these vehicles have lower running costs). 1.52. Another example of the need for review of the FBT rules arises from the increased use of flexible working arrangements including the ability to work remotely. Tax law has not kept pace with developments in technology, for example with communication benefits / allowances, where more people are working out of the office (and are often required to be contactable outside of work hours, and/or to be able to work from home if necessary as part of the employer’s business continuity planning). The Group would support a pragmatic and flexible solution to this issue that provides greater certainty and does not treat equivalent benefits differently. Entertainment expenditure 1.53. The Group would like to see a review of the entertainment expenditure regime. This is an extremely complex area of tax, particularly as it has income tax, FBT and GST implications, as well as numerous exceptions and qualifications that must be considered. The amount of tax at stake (and the amounts of expenditure involved) are relatively small and the precision required is unjustified, especially when the regime is an arbitrary one. It is currently extremely difficult to identify, code and capture entertainment expenditure properly and this has become a real pain point for businesses. 1.54. One example of this is the tax treatment of gifts of food and drink provided to clients, noting that the current interpretation of the rules is beyond what a layperson would consider entertainment. Another is the differing tax outcomes when a cup of coffee is drunk on or off premises (and the list goes on). The entertainment expenditure CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 20 of 48 CTGCTG regime is too compliance cost heavy, especially when considering the amount of tax that is at stake. How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? 1.55. The tax system is entering a new world of real-time engagement and greater flexibility and, as the tax system evolves, the rules governing it also need to adapt and improve. We set out below some general comments on how the tax system should change in response to various issues raised. 1.56. Over the past few years, the Group has seen the need for flexibility in the tax system emerge as one of the more important considerations. Linked closely to this concept of flexibility is the desire for certainty and the Group considers that these two concepts could be applied to better effect (both being of vital importance to the New Zealand tax system). Aspects of the tax rules are currently too prescriptive and can be hard to get right. Rigidity and strictness add compliance costs without adding any significant benefit. Taxpayers should not have to jump through multiple hoops to achieve the end result and there should be more leniency in allowing taxpayers to arrive at that final output. 1.57. There should be more consideration given to practical, real-world outcomes, especially where there is law change or operational change. Taxpayers should be afforded the freedom to run their businesses how they wish to do so and some examples of potential principle based outcomes from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue include: o Black letter law should be drafted as simply as possible, consider the extra compliance costs of absolute precision, use ‘safe harbours’ and be supplemented by Inland Revenue determinations / regulations. o Where possible Inland Revenue should make use of existing law (rather than instigating new laws) and use its existing tools such as section BG 1. o Taxpayers should be given answers that are practical and not overly restrictive, and should be given real-world solutions that fit in with their business. o There should be flexibility in the way in which the Commissioner exercises her power to allow for the myriad ways in which businesses operate. o This could be achieved through greater use of determinations. o The focus should be on what the right outcome is, not what the specific inputs are. o In this new technological world, where we have provisional tax paid through accounting software (for some) and more direct links through reporting of information, Inland Revenue shouldn’t have to expend resources to turn over every stone. o There should be more alignment of the tax rules with the IFRS accounting standards. o Adherence to GTTP consultation with realistic timeframes for discussion. 1.58. The Group considers this is an area where the Commissioner’s discretion and care and management role under section 6A (of the Tax Administration Act 1994) should come to the fore. Under these provisions (and using any of the examples above), there needs to be flexibility in the rules and in the administration of the rules to provide taxpayers with certainty in real time. The Group has had a number of CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 21 of 48 CTGCTG interactions with Tax Policy Officials in relation to this and we understand that a considerable amount of work has been done. How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future-focussed tax system? 1.59. A number of the Group’s members have business relationships with the Maori economy and co-invest in a number of projects and assets. The Group sees the Maori economy as an important part of the New Zealand business environment. 1.60. Reflecting the comments above on the complexity that the traditional company model has for accommodating different tax profiles (such as Maori authorities or charities) the Group believes that investment alongside the Maori economy would be enhanced and simplified if a corporate flow through vehicle, such as a widely held look through company, was available. This would allow other investors to easily co-invest with Maori businesses operating under the Maori Authority tax regime (which we understand is working well and should be retained). 2. Purposes and principles of a good tax system What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? 2.1 Underpinning all of the Group’s submissions and engagement on tax policy matters are three main principles that the Group believes a good tax system should be built around. These are certainty, compliance costs and competitiveness (collectively known as “The 3 C’s”). We set out what these mean to the Group below:  High certainty, predictability and low business risk: For the corporate sector, tax is not just a cost of doing business but is also a very significant risk. If the tax rules increase business risk by creating uncertain or unexpected tax outcomes, this has a negative effect on all businesses who must spend significant resources considering the tax implications of their decisions. Tax should not distort decision making and low certainty and predictability detrimentally impacts growth and innovation.  Low compliance costs: Compliance costs imposed by the tax system contribute to the deadweight loss of tax. Tax compliance costs of both taxpayers and Inland Revenue should be kept as low as possible. Those resources used to meet compliance costs would be better employed creating jobs and raising the wealth of New Zealand.  International competitiveness: Taxes are a significant cost of doing business. The higher those costs are in New Zealand relative to other countries, the higher the relative costs of doing business in New Zealand. That flows through to less investment, fewer jobs and lower wealth. New Zealand’s tax system plays a critical role in our competitive position with our major trading partners and competitors. 2.2 The 3 C’s have significant overlap with the common principles, as described in the Paper, that are used for considering costs and benefits of various reforms. These are efficiency, equity and fairness, revenue integrity, fiscal adequacy, compliance and CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 22 of 48 CTGCTG administration costs and coherence. The Group believes that these are all important considerations but notes that trade-offs may need to be made between various principles when changes are made to the tax system. In this situation, the most important consideration is that of national interest – what is in the best interests of New Zealand as a whole? 2.3 The Group is supportive of tax policies also being analysed against the Living Standards Framework as this recognises the trade-offs that need to be analysed when considering tax policy changes. For example, a tax policy change in pursuit of perceived fairness could improve social capital but at significant cost to financial capital which could have flow-on impacts to natural capital. In this submission, the importance of a competitive tax system has been emphasised by the Group, and when analysed from a Living Standards Framework perspective, the Group considers a competitive tax system is still important. 2.4 Sitting alongside all of the above considerations and principles is the importance and continued relevance of the GTPP. This framework allows for transparent and meaningful consultation between Officials and stakeholders and is a pillar of New Zealand’s robust and effective tax system. The Group is of the firm belief that the GTPP is an appropriate measure for all parties to apply and adhere to. 2.5 However, in the past couple of years, the Group has seen a deterioration in the quality of application of the GTPP. This has been a significant concern for the Group and the GTPP should only continue if the application is improved. One particular example of a breakdown in the GTPP process has been with the BEPS consultation process. 2.6 The Group is aware of the considerable time pressure Officials were under to get the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill (“the Bill”) introduced into Parliament before the end of 2017. However, where the subject matter is as significant and technical as the issue of BEPS, exposure drafts of legislation should be meaningfully consulted upon, to ensure that quality legislation is making its way to Parliament. While there was some limited consultation on aspects of the Bill, this was undertaken under extreme time pressure and in most instances there was no opportunity to consider revisions. The Group believes there should have been more detailed consultation on the draft legislation before it was introduced into the House. There needs to be more emphasis on getting it right from the start. 2.7 In addition, there is currently a worrying trend developing whereby, in our view, Inland Revenue Tax Policy has become unduly influenced by Inland Revenue investigators, resulting in a number of reforms that are contrary to the overall tax policy framework and create significant collateral damage (e.g. employee share schemes, aspects of BEPS reforms). In particular, Inland Revenue’s KPIs are in part based on adjustments to positions taken by taxpayers – this is an inappropriate measure and drives distortionary behaviour. 2.8 The Group would support a regulatory / determination making power that could be used to ensure that legislation is applied consistent with the original policy intent. This would allow for more flexibility in amending any errors in legislation. If this option is pursued, Officials or the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee should consult with stakeholders on the appropriate scope of such a power. However, while the Group accepts that there will at times be mistakes in legislation and unintended consequences, continued commitment to a full and effective GTPP should be the first line of defence in seeking to minimise mistakes and complexity in tax legislation. CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 23 of 48 CTGCTG How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? What would a fair tax system look like? 2.9 Fairness is a subjective concept that can be difficult to measure. In the Group’s view, the concept of fairness is best addressed through the transfer system and targeted measures that address problems at source. If overall the broad-base of New Zealand’s BBLR system is maintained, then the transfer system should then apply to ensure that the revenue collected is distributed appropriately, allowing for targeted measures for those most in need. 2.10 Recently multinationals and big business have received bad press about the amount of tax they pay. In a large number of cases this press has been misinformed as the recent Tax Heroes articles featured on the Spinoff have illustrated. 12 Further, tax aside, these businesses are also making significant contributions to New Zealand in their capacity as employers, and through their broader contributions to the community. As the Group has noted earlier in this submission, there are wider benefits to encouraging large corporates to do business in New Zealand such as increased innovation and productivity. While most New Zealand businesses are small enterprises, organisations with more than 100 employees employ 47% of the workforce (and make up less than 1% of all enterprises). 13 2.11 Fairness can also be addressed by considering issues as they arise and by raising and resolving issues proactively as required. It is important that New Zealand’s tax settings are set appropriately, taking into account the views of all stakeholders, including those of Officials, individuals, large businesses, small business, tikanga Māori and any other interested parties, including non-residents (capital providers or investors). This means that when points of ineffectiveness in the tax settings are raised, they should be addressed by the tax system (and through the GTPP where appropriate). It is also important that the broader New Zealand economic position is considered by Inland Revenue as part of the introduction of any wide reaching proposals (for example the interest cap suggestion under the BEPS proposals would have benefitted from consideration from this perspective). 2.12 The Group has, in its experience found that revenue positive initiatives are often raised and addressed by Officials. However other, just as relevant issues raised by other stakeholders are not given the same resources. It is important that all issues are addressed for an effective and fair tax system. While revenue take is an important part of the tax system, there are other benefits to be considered. For example the recent feasibility expenditure and loss continuity discussions have highlighted the potential positive impact these proposals could have on innovation and business certainty. The Group and other stakeholders do not raise issues lightly – when problems are identified and raised with Officials, they are generally significant enough to warrant attention. 12 https://thespinoff.co.nz/tag/tax-heroes/ 13 https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/new-zealand-business-demography-statistics-at-february- 2017 CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 24 of 48 CTGCTG 3. The current New Zealand tax system New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? 3.1 The Group has been a longstanding supporter of New Zealand’s BBLR system and continues to support BBLR as an appropriate approach for New Zealand’s tax system. BBLR minimises distortions in the tax system and allows for tax to be a relatively neutral factor in decision making. 3.2 New Zealand has a robust and effective tax system, driven in part by its (relative) simplicity, which leads to business certainty. New Zealand’s GST system in particular is a good example of this, its effectiveness driven by the fact that the rules are broad and encompassing, with few exceptions. New Zealand’s BBLR approach is part of the reason New Zealand’s tax system is held in such high regard. 3.3 However, the Group considers that in recent years there has been a trend towards a level of detail and complexity that is driving inefficiency. Detailed rules to address every conceivable compliance risk or possible gap are resulting in increased compliance costs to the vast majority of taxpayers, who are seeking to comply with their obligations. Taxpayers should be afforded more freedom in which to run their businesses – as noted earlier, compliance costs are part of the deadweight loss associated with tax. 3.4 The focus has been on micro reform, when in reality it is macro reform that is needed. One example of this is the resources that have been directed towards hybrid mismatch arrangements, of which there are only about a dozen in the country. While other countries have taken action in this area, New Zealand is a small country that has its own unique issues (and is not as impacted in the same manner as larger countries). 3.5 Another example of this is the recent introduction of the Kilometre Rate method in the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 (with the Kilometre Rate operationalised in the draft operational statement ED0203: Commissioner’s statement on using a kilometre rate for business running of a motor vehicle). The use of this rate, while in theory being a more accurate reflection of actual costs, drives inefficiency with its two tiered rate system based on the type of motor vehicle and engine. While not perfect, a flat rate would be preferred as a more simplistic approach that minimises compliance costs. 3.6 A number of surveys released in the last year have reinforced this point. Deloitte’s Asia-Pacific Tax Survey 14 notes that taxpayers are increasingly concerned with certainty and predictability, particularly in relation to future developments of tax law. The Business NZ - Deloitte Major Companies Tax Survey 15 noted that tax certainty is of upmost importance to businesses, emphasising the importance of tax system integrity and Inland Revenue’s role in its administration. Further to this, it is highlighted that there should be greater flexibility from Inland Revenue when it 14 https://www2.deloitte.com/nz/asia-pac-tax-survey 15 https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/nz/Documents/tax/nz-en-major-companies-tax-survey- 2017.pdf CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 25 of 48 CTGCTG comes to immaterial tax adjustments and that such an approach would maintain the integrity of the tax system, while reducing the strain on Inland Revenue’s resources. 3.7 The 80-20 rule has been discussed widely over the last couple of years and while this rule has its flaws, it remains relevant to tax policy and the New Zealand tax system. From a customer point of view, it is important that this is applied in an operative manner, to achieve efficient yet effective solutions. Compliant taxpayers are being punished by being made to weave their way through a labyrinth of rules. Often this complexity is driven because the rules are designed to combat the behaviour or risks associated with a minority of non-compliant taxpayers. The Group considers that a better option is to target the non-compliant taxpayers with more direct rules, still capturing them in the tax base. This is opposed to the current position of setting the standard wide and then forcing everyone to determine whether they are caught in the rules as has been done with the proposed restrictive transfer pricing rules. 3.8 The Group considers it important that New Zealand remain committed to a BBLR system. Base maintenance reduces upwards pressure on tax rates, however this must be balanced with situations where the base is broadened significantly or consistently. If the tax base is to be broadened significantly, such as if a capital gains tax is introduced, it is important that changes in other areas of tax (GST, withholding taxes, income tax etc) are considered so that the effective overall tax rate is not driven up as a result. The Group also refers the TWG to our earlier comments on black hole expenditure. Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and / or what type of taxes? 3.9 The Group is not generally supportive of using taxes to modify behaviour. In the Group’s view, behavioural taxes are ineffective in actually amending people’s actions and merely penalise the intended consumer. Such taxes will change the behaviours of some, but unless the tax is comprehensive and covers all alternatives, it will only have a limited effect. 3.10 Even if a behavioural tax is cast broadly it may not achieve the intended outcome. Take a ‘sugar tax’ for example. The underlying issue here is the (physical) health of New Zealanders and the impact sugary products have on this. To put an excise tax on ‘sugar’, it first needs to be considered what products are covered by this tax and where the line is drawn. Unless the tax applies broadly enough, consumers may move to cheaper alternatives that aren’t covered by the tax, or consume other products that are just as, or more detrimental to their health. There is evidence that such taxes do not achieve the desired outcomes. 16 A Treasury Working Paper notes about a sugar tax “\[t\]he health status of those responding to a price increase is generally not known, and higher responses may come from healthy consumers rather than the target population. 17 3.11 The Group considers it is more effective to address this behaviour at its source, via targeted education, rather than through taxation. This would be a more effective way to achieve the intended purpose. 16 NZIER Report to Ministry of Health Sugar taxes: A review of the evidence. 17 John Creedy Sugar Taxes and Changes in Total Calorie Consumption: A Simple Framework (The Treasury, WP 16/06, February 2016). CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 26 of 48 CTGCTG 3.12 In some situations behavioural tax costs are just passed on to the consumer, without effecting a change in behaviour where it really counts. For example with the Emissions Trading Scheme, some costs are merely passed on to the consumer, without any new investment in technologies for reducing emissions by industry. 3.13 The Group notes that it can see a place for tax incentives, with tax rewarding positive actions; for example electric vehicle fleets, environmental initiatives etc. In this regard, the Group points to Japan’s proposals for tax credits of 15% for companies who raise wages and capital investment. The tax credit may be increased to 20% where a company increases the amount spent on employee education and training by 20% or more. 18 This is an example of the tax system taking proactive action to achieve a wider goal. That said, we consider there is a high hurdle to move away from the BBLR status quo. Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? 3.14 As the submissions paper notes, New Zealand is unusual in that it operates a Taxed- Taxed-Exempt (“TTE”) approach to retirement savings (consistent with our broad- base, low-rate system). This can have distortionary consequences, particularly when the current system is applied to housing (in a simplified world where surplus income is either invested in housing or put towards retirement savings). To reduce these distortionary consequences (and to incentivise savings), there is an argument for moving to an Exempt-Exempt-Taxed (EET) model for retirement savings. 3.15 Changing the taxation of retirement savings to an EET model may in theory reduce demand for houses (and decrease house prices), especially if it is too difficult to address the issue directly on the housing side. However overall, savings should first be looked at as a standalone issue. That is because changing the tax treatment of retirement savings alone will simply shift the distortionary differential tax treatment from a distortion between housing and other types of savings to being between housing/retirement savings and other types of savings. The Mirrlees Tax Review in the United Kingdom in 2010 acknowledged this and recommended continuing the EET tax treatment of pensions, but with additional reforms to tax other assets on an expenditure basis. 19 4. The results of the current tax system Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? 4.1 If it is a simplified choice between the speculative economy and the productive economy, Inland Revenue should err on the side of taxing the non-productive asset as it provides fewer overall benefits to the economy. However this is an arbitrary decision and in the Group’s view, the focus of the TWG should be elsewhere. A farmer and their farm could be considered to be part of the productive economy as they are actively earning income. However the productive economy could also include a rental 18 https://www2.deloitte.com/jp/en/pages/tax/articles/bt/japan-inbound-tax-alert-dec-2017-no26.html 19 See Chapter 14 of James Mirrlees and others Tax by design (Oxford University Press, 2011). CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 27 of 48 CTGCTG property, as in a low-interest environment, it is possible investors may hold rental properties for long-term rental yield (with a possible prospect of capital gain in the future). 4.2 It should be noted that in terms of taxing the speculative economy, there are current provisions to tax speculative gains. It is arguable that the issue is one of enforcement rather than a deficiency in existing tax legislation. Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? 4.3 As the Group has previously noted, compliance costs are a deadweight loss to the economy. The Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department (colloquially and hereafter referred to as the “Richardson Review”) noted that “Excessive compliance costs, may in their effect, amount to a hidden tax on commercial activity.” 20 The Richardson Review also noted that: “First and most importantly, the tax policy development process must ensure that compliance cost impacts of new policy initiatives are fully costed and considered, to allow the Government to make appropriate trade-offs between these and administrative and economic costs. Equally, compliance costs must be a matter for explicit focus in the post- implementation review of legislation and in the identification of remedial issues requiring legislative amendment in existing legislation.” 4.4 In the Group’s view, these comments are as relevant today as they were in 1994. Whenever changes to the tax system are contemplated, part of the analysis should include a consideration of compliance costs and whether these costs outweigh the benefit of the proposal. While compliance costs are a consideration and Officials have listened to the Group’s concerns during consultation, the Group considers that there is further scope to reduce compliance costs for businesses. 4.5 One example of this is the recent Business Transformation process, particularly the investment and employment income changes. A large number of these proposals imposed additional compliance costs to businesses, which in the Group’s view, were over and above what was necessary to achieve the intended outcome of the proposals. Large amounts of information are being provided to Inland Revenue but it is not clear if this information is necessary and is being used by Inland Revenue. The Business Transformation process has also often merely moved costs from Inland Revenue to businesses. Further, as noted earlier in our submission, there has been a trend towards precision in the tax system and the Group considers that such precision is unnecessary – these resources are best spent elsewhere. 4.6 Other examples of rules that unnecessarily contribute to deadweight losses include PAYE and NRCT issues associated with non-residents working in New Zealand, that businesses are required to deal with (including shadow payrolls, getting employees to file income tax returns in the appropriate jurisdictions etc). Many taxpayers also have to fill out questionnaires (i.e. annual international questionnaire for Inland Revenue with information that can mostly be obtained from an entity’s annual financial reports). 4.7 Compliance costs could also be reduced in respect of simple compliance matters, such as completing returns and other tax administrative functions that businesses 20 Page 134, Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department 1994 CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 28 of 48 CTGCTG often have to face (i.e. businesses should not act as tax collectors for Inland Revenue except in so far as is practically necessary like with PAYE or there is an appropriate reduction in their own overall compliance costs). It is important that the only costs in the tax system are necessary for the efficient functioning of the tax system. 4.8 The Group considers there is more scope for Inland Revenue and other government departments to share information and/or data amongst themselves. The Group understands that this is a wider government issue, but the government as a whole needs to understand what information / data they have and allow for sharing of it as appropriate. Taxpayers should only have to provide the same information to government once (and it should only be asked for once). This would remove the requirement for businesses to provide similar data or information to different parts of government. This would assist in reducing costs as the provision of information and/or data is expensive. 4.9 It is also important that compliance costs are reviewed after changes have been integrated into the tax system. There are often hidden compliance costs or additional considerations that only become clear once proposals are put into practice. This is an issue for both Officials and stakeholders to consider and changes can be made where necessary. These changes do not have to be legislative, and other more flexible methods of implementing remedial change should be considered. Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? 4.10 The Living Standards Framework describes natural capital as the aspects of the natural environment needed to support life and human activity, including land, soil, water, plants and animals, as well as minerals and energy resources. Noting the Group’s comments on behavioural taxes earlier in this submission, the Group does consider that there is further scope for the tax system to maintain natural capital. One way in which this can be done is by amending the tax system in areas that reward taxpayers who are maintaining our natural capital, for example by providing tax concessions to businesses who use electric / hybrid vehicles. 4.11 While the Group does see some areas where tax can help maintain natural capital, environmental taxes are blunt tools and the Group considers that regulation is a more effective and efficient method for achieving the intended goals. It is better that the government use other tools in its arsenal, specifically targeted at the behaviours it wishes to change. However, where there are specific regimes (or there are proposed regimes) within the Income Tax Act 2007 targeted at pollution mitigation measures, Inland Revenue should err on the side of deductibility so that tax is not a barrier to doing the right thing for the environment. Often this expenditure ends up in the black hole expenditure bucket, with no immediate deduction available and no depreciation deduction. 4.12 To take this point further, the issue of the deductibility of feasibility (and other black hole) expenditure should be considered. Feasibility expenditure is the expenditure spent on determining the practicability of a project and currently is only deductible to the extent it does not materially advance / tangibly progress a capital project. This is an issue for many businesses, as it increases the costs and uncertainty in exploring new projects. Many examples of feasibility expenditure arise in the energy generation sector, where new and more environmentally friendly alternatives are explored by businesses, or, to consider a different industry, this feasibility expenditure could be towards researching less detrimental ways of farming. The non-tax deductibility of CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 29 of 48 CTGCTG feasibility expenditure impacts on the willingness of taxpayers to undertake innovative or new projects. The resolution of this issue (if also coupled with an R&D tax credit regime as signalled by the Government) would go some way to promoting protection and maintenance of natural capital. 4.13 A recently released draft report from the New Zealand Productivity Commission (on how a transition to a lower carbon economy might be achieved) highlights the importance of developing environmental sustainability technology. 21 The draft report also noted that the Government should be cautious about setting stringent targets for electricity-sector emissions before technology becomes available to further reduce emissions at reasonable cost. Further, the report notes that the government should be wary of intervening in a complex sector and of the unintended and expensive consequences that could result. 4.14 The TWG should also consider tax incentives for sustainable products, for example accelerated depreciation on electric vehicles or sustainably innovative technology. As a general rule, the Group believes that the tax depreciation regime is too complex and should be more aligned with the accounting rules. However allowing greater initial deductions to taxpayers through accelerated depreciation (which at the end of the day is only an issue of timing) is one way that the government can encourage businesses to undertake more environmentally sustainable initiatives. Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? 4.15 Any question of reductions in effective tax rate because of “excessive deductions” needs to consider that question in the context of why such regimes exist. In the Group’s view, one of the main considerations in relation to such deductions is that of (international) competitiveness. For particular New Zealand businesses and industries to remain competitive with their competitors, the Government has made a measured decision to allow deductions for particular expenses. This requires a consideration of the global tax frameworks and whether certain clawbacks are appropriate to ensure that New Zealand companies can compete on the global stage. 5. Thinking outside the current system What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? Taxpayer positive versus Revenue positive 5.1 The Group sees the biggest inconsistency arising where changes are being proposed to the tax system. Inland Revenue, by way of focus on revenue, is incentivised to bring more into the tax net (and to increase the ‘broad-base’ aspect of BBLR). Not unexpectedly, there is a natural tendency to raise proposals that are not in favour of the taxpayer and the majority of changes only seek to increase revenue (for example the recent bright-line test and BEPS changes). It is inappropriate for Inland Revenue 21 New Zealand Productivity Commission Low-emissions economy: Draft report. April 2018 CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 30 of 48 CTGCTG to measure performance by adjustments and then allow for this to affect the setting of the tax system. 5.2 An appropriate balance must be struck between Inland Revenue initiatives and taxpayer favourable initiatives (such as black hole expenditure), as well as broader macro focused projects which are designed to encourage investment and grow tax revenues. This has been highlighted by the Group’s concerns with the current tax policy programme that appears to be driven by Inland Revenue Officials, with little time / resource for private sector friendly measures. The work programme includes reforms necessary for the ongoing maintenance of our tax system, however these have tended to be base maintenance concerns and changes that shift compliance costs from Inland Revenue to taxpayers. If new items and issues are raised by taxpayers, these should be added to the work programme and progressed. If not there is a real danger that New Zealand’s tax system will stagnate and our tax settings will endanger (as opposed to maintain) New Zealand’s BBLR system. We also need a degree of consistency with other jurisdictions – if not we risk being out of step and becoming uncompetitive. 5.3 In particular there has been insufficient effort in introducing policy changes that would simplify tax for businesses. These are not issues taxpayers raise lightly and resources must be allocated to progressing these other proposals as well. We attach as an Appendix to this submission the Group’s “Business Tax Wish List” which contains a list of the business tax initiatives that would improve compliance costs for businesses. The wish list was prepared in November 2016 in response to the tax policy work programme for 2016-17, but is just as relevant today as only one or two of the wish list items have actually been progressed. Accounting versus Tax 5.4 In the Group’s view, more should be done to align the corporate tax code with accounting standards. This does not have to be a comprehensive alignment, but there are certain areas that would significantly benefit from more overlap (with no real detriment / risk). Some examples include:  Tax depreciation  Provisions and accruals  Unexpired expenditure / prepayments These are areas where it is possible to have a sensible interface between accounting and tax. However, currently there are specific arbitrary principles that must be applied that generate compliance risk for taxpayers in their relative complexity. For example the unexpired expenditure rules are hard to understand as they have no solid, principled basis. This makes their application compliance cost heavy as relatively more resources must be expended to comply with the rules. 5.5 The IFRS accounting standards are acceptable standards that are independently audited and usually merely represent short timing differences. There is little justification for having a complex tax overlay to accounting treatment. The depreciation rules in particular should be simplified, given the sheer number of rates and determinations for different depreciable assets. This is an area where a ‘close enough is good enough’ attitude can be applied and tax depreciation is a good example of looking for precision where none exists. This is an arbitrary timing difference and closer alignment with accounting should be considered. 5.6 There should also be greater acceptance of materiality for tax purposes (and this could perhaps be statutorily defined), coupled with raising the permissible limit for CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 31 of 48 CTGCTG writing capital expenditure off immediately to the profit and loss account (up from the current threshold of $500). These initiatives would give taxpayers more certainty and lower compliance costs, which are especially relevant in a self-assessment world. Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? 5.7 The Group does not comment on the introduction of any specific new taxes and is not opposed to the introduction of new taxes if required on the proviso that new taxes are accompanied by a lowering of taxes elsewhere. The Group notes that if the tax base is to be increased by the introduction of new taxes, serious consideration should be given to other initiatives such as reducing the corporate tax rate or the effective tax rate. It is inappropriate for the tax base to get larger and larger with no corresponding decrease in other areas (as we have noted earlier in this submission). 5.8 Any new taxes (and the reduction of existing taxes) should be considered in the context of added / reduced compliance costs and we refer you to our submission points on compliance costs above. 5.9 The Australian Re:think discussion paper noted that Australian tax revenue is drawn from more than 100 different taxes, however most of this revenue is collected from just a few taxes. 22 At its heart, tax is about revenue collection for the government. To do this, it is important to maintain the broad base and small additional taxes are often neither effective nor efficient in raising the revenue required. 6. Specific challenges How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? 6.1 In the Group’s view, the first consideration is whether housing issues are driven by supply or demand. If it is demand driving the issue, then it must be asked whether these demand issues are driven by tax. If the answer is in the affirmative, then tax should act to deal with the issue. However, if tax is not the cause of the issue, then the Group considers that the issue should be addressed at source, as this is a more effective approach. 6.2 Further, the existing comprehensive tax code for taxing land transactions needs to be adequately policed by Inland Revenue and the extended five year bright line test (and ring-fencing of rental losses if introduced) should be given time to be put into action and their impact considered, before any additional changes are introduced. 22 Re:think, page 15 CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 32 of 48 CTGCTG Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? 6.3 Given the Group’s diverse membership, we do not have a view on whether a capital gains tax (CGT) should be introduced or not and our following comments are not intended to be read as support for or support against a CGT. We do note, however, that in a world of falling corporate tax rates, the lack of a capital gains tax in a business environment is one of the few competitive advantages the New Zealand tax system offers businesses looking to locate themselves in New Zealand. Any potential CGT must be looked at as part of the wider ‘equation’ and there are a large number of significant considerations that must be analysed in full if a CGT regime is to be introduced. These include design considerations, exemptions / coverage, who it would affect, implementation and other various other miscellaneous issues. Amongst these design issues there will be trade-offs and New Zealand must decide where in the equation these trade-offs lie. We detail our response to the design issues below. 6.4 In addition, the TWG needs to be very aware that its recommendations need to take into account the New Zealand political landscape and the implications for any Government at the “ballot box” of changing the tax settings on retirement savings, farms and small businesses. Recommendations should be practical and politically achievable. For example there needs to be consideration of the costs for Inland Revenue for administering a capital gains regime and the costs for all taxpayers, from ‘mums and dads’ to larger corporates. Design issues 6.5 If a CGT is introduced, there are a number of design issues to be considered. These include (but are not limited to), rollover relief, inflation, integration with existing capital boundaries, CFC integration and preferences for certain industries (e.g. savings), as well as broader consideration of the wider equation and how a capital gains regime fits into New Zealand’s economy. The complexity of a capital gains regime cannot be underestimated and our Australian members’ experiences with their regime has been mixed. 6.6 The introduction of a CGT will have far-reaching consequences, many of which have not even been considered, and many of which will not be realised until the capital gains regime is actually in place. However, some current tax rules or regimes will need to be removed or redesigned to ensure that double taxation does not occur (i.e. the interface of the FIF rules, in particular FDR, and CGT. It is important that if a CGT is introduced, the capital gains regime is designed effectively so that there is consistency in application and the intended policy outcomes are met. New Zealand has a competitive advantage of sorts in not having a capital gains tax and so any potential introduction of a CGT must minimise any negative consequences as much as possible. 6.7 We set out below the Group’s view on the specific design issue questions from Appendix 2 of the submissions paper. We would like to again emphasise the need for full consultation on all aspects of any future CGT proposal. This following section proceeds on the basis that a CGT is to be implemented and is not intended to be read as support for a CGT (or disagreement with the introduction of a CGT) CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 33 of 48 CTGCTG Should the CGT be a separate tax or part of the income tax? Most countries tax capital gains as part of the income tax. 6.8 In the Group’s view, if a CGT is introduced it would be best introduced as part of the Income Tax Act rather than a separate Act. This is a simpler and a more efficient approach given the flow on effect changes that will need to be made to income taxes. The Group acknowledges there is a clarity perspective in keeping a CGT in a separate code (like with GST), however the close link with income tax means that it is best kept in the Income Tax Act. Should capital gains be taxed on an accrual basis or only when realised (i.e. only when the asset is sold)? Most countries tax on a realisation basis. How should matrimonial property settlements and disposal of assets on death be treated? 6.9 In the Group’s view a CGT applied on an accrual basis would provide a reasonably accurate reflection of the position. However this will introduce greater compliance costs, will impact cash flows (particularly where unrealised gains are taxed, with no immediate cash relief for losses in subsequent years) and will add another level of complexity into the tax system. It is for these reasons that most other jurisdictions which have adopted a CGT have done so on a realisation basis. If a CGT is to be taxed on a realisation basis there will be considerations around timing of disposal, creating its own distortions. A realisation based CGT will also be a less effective form of a CGT. However, as noted most countries with a CGT have implemented this on a realisation basis and their approach should be taken into account. 6.10 If the policy intention is base broadening then a comprehensive capital gains tax would be preferred. However, if the issues are perceived inefficiencies or ‘unfairness’ in the tax system, these issues should be fixed by a more targeted method. An example of this occurring is international portfolio shares – the FDR regime (cost method) is more appropriate than a CGT, particularly as many international equity investments do not have market values available (and so an unrealised CGT is also not available). 6.11 The main concern appears to be the under-taxation of residential rental homes, being a concern that commercial returns reflect a capital gain element and that rental income does not cover the costs without that capital gain. However, as noted above, if the supply and demand issue is driven by tax, then and only then should tax step in to fix the issue? 6.12 In the Group’s view a CGT, if introduced, should be limited to residential rental properties. The same tensions do not apply to commercial property and commercial property should not be included in any capital gains regime. A targeted approach is best as a more comprehensive regime (but with exemptions) will introduce significant complexities and any tax revenue to be collected would be offset by the costs of the system. This will involve trade-offs, between various positives and negatives, that must be considered carefully when designing a potential capital gains regime. CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 34 of 48 CTGCTG Should assets held by KiwiSaver and other savings schemes be taxed? 6.13 In the Group’s view, there should be as few distortions and inconsistencies in any potential capital gains regime as possible. If the way in which retirement savings schemes are to be taxed is to change, any change should be consistent (unless Government has a specific policy reason for incentivising one scheme over the other). The Group notes, however, that imposing a CGT on savings but not the family home risks further incentivising capital to flow away from rather than towards productive assets. Should assets held offshore be subject to tax? 6.14 New Zealand’s residency rules deem New Zealand residents to be subject to income tax on their worldwide income. This is an agreed and accepted principle, with foreign tax credits, double tax agreements and other exceptions in place to avoid any double taxation. Any capital gains on assets held offshore should be treated with the same principles for consistency (i.e. prima facie taxable, but with a foreign tax credit or other mechanism acting to provide relief from double taxation where necessary). Careful thought should be given to how these rules should interact with the active income exemption for Controlled Foreign Companies (“CFCs”). Many other countries exempt capital gains made by active CFCs. How would a capital gains tax integrate with current tax laws, such as when land sales are already taxable, our company imputation system and our CFC/FDR rules? 6.15 The answer to this will depend significantly on the extent of any proposed capital gains regime. In the Group’s view, if it is only a targeted capital gains regime, where assets are already held to tax under the current regime, this should not change (i.e. taxation on properties in the land sales rules). However there could be a case for full integration if a comprehensive capital gains regime is introduced as this will reduce complexity. Any existing regimes will need to be considered and if they are a more effective, efficient and accurate method for collecting capital gains, then these should be left unchanged. When should non-residents be subject to tax? 6.16 Consistent with our current residency / source principles, non-residents should only be subject to CGT on certain New Zealand sourced assets (regard should be had to what other countries do, such as only taxing land assets / land rich companies). The impact of New Zealand’s double tax agreements will need to be considered carefully, particularly in relation to issues arising from specific asset types, source and silence as to taxing right. CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 35 of 48 CTGCTG Should capital losses be ring-fenced to be offset only against capital gains income or should they be offset against any income? If capital gains are taxed on a realisation basis tax base maintenance considerations suggest that capital losses should be ring-fenced. 6.17 This is an issue that depends on the extent to which any potential capital gains regime extends. If it is a comprehensive regime then any capital losses should be able to be offset against all income of a taxpayer. However it is unlikely that the capital gains regime will be comprehensive in which case it may then create more justification for capital losses to be ring-fenced. Ring-fencing would bring in significant complexity into the tax system so should be implemented with caution, weighing up compliance costs versus perceived issue. Should there be roll-over relief allowing capital gains reinvested in similar assets to be treated as unrealised? If so, when should roll-over relief apply? For example, should a farmer selling a farm and buying a new farm be taxed on the increase in value of the old farm? 6.18 Any roll-over relief will need to be considered carefully from a policy perspective. There are sound reasons for providing such relief in ensuring that tax does not result in tax locking in investments in lower performing assets to avoid triggering a CGT. By providing roll over relief, the regime allows capital to flow to the best performing asset unimpeded by the loss of value that a CGT would impose if it were to apply when assets are essentially swapped. However, it needs to be recognised that deferring any capital gain may reduce the effectiveness of the regime due to the deferral of the tax event. The counter being, however, that a roll over relief allows for more efficient investment decision making which can increase the amount of capital gain which is ultimately taxed. 6.19 On balance, the Group would favour roll-over relief, particularly to allow normal business to continue without tax being a barrier (such as allowing corporate restructures and M&A activity to take place with no tax cost). How should death, emigration and immigration be handled? 6.20 If a CGT is imposed, the regime must work so that individuals / organisations with a CGT liability are not able to escape the regime in any way – i.e. if they leave the country they should be held accountable for their tax liability. Immigration is a trickier issue that will require some balance, especially as we will want to ensure we are attracting people and organisations to New Zealand. The main issues will be around timing (i.e. when do they fall into the regime) and whether any exclusions (such as transitional residency) will cover a capital gains regime. It must also be considered whether these companies / individuals have a right to tax former residents for a period of time following their emigration. 6.21 We comment on emigration / immigration in relation to competitiveness and attracting and retaining capital investment in New Zealand further below. CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 36 of 48 CTGCTG How should gifts and gambling winnings be taxed? 6.22 Gifts and windfall gains should remain outside the tax base (as should gambling losses). What should the rate of tax on capital gains be – the normal income tax rates, or some other rate(s)? 6.23 A CGT at the normal income tax rates would be the least distortionary method of taxing capital gains, as it would apply tax at the appropriate marginal tax rate for individuals and would not incentivise particular investments over others (i.e. if capital gains were taxed at a lower rate, then there would be a tendency to put money towards these sorts of investments as opposed to others). While slightly more complex than a flat rate CGT, it would make for a more coherent tax system. 6.24 The other option is a flat rate tax (similar to GST) where all capital gains are taxed at one rate. On the face of it, this may be simple and may be appropriate for certain types of investments; however it may also drive further compliance costs having to distinguish between capital and other income due to the different tax rates. Some Nordic countries attempt to tax all forms of capital income at a lower rate than labour income. However, distinguishing capital from labour income has proven difficult in practice. For example, Norway initially treated widely held and closely held companies differently with all income in widely held companies treated as capital income while income from closely held companies was split into labour and capital components. This created additional distortions as it became more advantageous to be treated as "widely held". 6.25 The Group considers that further research and study must be done before the method and rate of taxation are chosen, with a focus on what other countries are doing and the success of their regimes. Should any allowance be given for inflation in calculating capital gains? 6.26 The Group believes that if a capital gains tax is introduced, some allowance should be given for inflation in calculating capital gains (particularly for assets held long- term). In the absence of any specific measures, gains from inflation will be brought to tax which would be inappropriate, especially where this amount is significant (which is likely where assets are held for many years). A capital gains tax should not be looking to tax nominal gains but the ‘true’ capital gain. 6.27 Inflation is dealt with in various different ways throughout the economy and indexation is one such method. However indexation of the tax rate will not offer ‘real- time’ benefits to taxpayers given the time it takes to implement. It will also introduce greater administrative costs and complexity. 6.28 There is a case for a more progressive rate to deal with inflation concerns, based on the length of time an asset is held (or some other measure as appropriate). This will add additional complexity into the tax system but it is important that taxpayers are not taxed on inflationary gains. Another option is to amend the quantum of the capital CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 37 of 48 CTGCTG gain that is taxed to reduce the impact of inflation, depending on the length of time the asset is held (i.e. only 50% of the gain is taxed if held for more than 5 years). Again this would need to be a progressive scale. 6.29 The problems here is if the distinction / progression is not set correctly, the tax system will distort and influence investor decisions. For example if the capital gains rate (or the portion of the capital gain that is subject to tax) were to change significantly for assets held for (say) 5 years or more, then investors would be incentivised to hold onto these assets for a longer period of time. In the case of residential housing, this would mean that rental properties would be held for a longer period of time (which the government may or may not want). If this is the intention then this must be explicitly publicised. Should there be a de minimis rule? 6.30 In the Group’s view, a de minimis will be appropriate if a CGT is introduced to reduce compliance costs and reduce complexity. At a certain level the taxation of capital gains may be a net loss to economy, as any revenue from taxation will be far outweighed by the compliance costs to administer and adhere to the regime. A de minimis may also negate concerns around inflation, but this will only be true for short-term investments where inflation has less impact. 6.31 The question is whether the de minimis is applied on an investment by investment basis, or whether it takes a more portfolio basis (i.e. an annual brightline exclusion for the total capital gain arising from disposal of all assets in a year). An annual brightline exclusion will remove taxpayers who have only small capital investments and are not the target of a CGT, noting there will be compliance costs around valuation for those close to the threshold and added complexity for taxpayers who have never previously had to consider these issues. 6.32 Any potential de minimis must be set at an appropriate rate in order for it to be effective and not influence behaviour. It will need to be a percentage measure of the asset as opposed to a single monetary figure (i.e. if the capital gain is more than 5% of the original cost then it should be brought to tax). It would be inappropriate to use a monetary figure as this will be insignificant depending on the size of the investment. 6.33 An issue is that an appropriate de minimis level will also differ depending on the type of investment. All assets are not equal and have differing expected gains / losses. Further to this, take the sale and purchase of a rental house. At the margin there is greater control here to decide on a price and prices could be amended so that the de minimis is met and no tax is collected – this is particularly true for short-term sales (assuming property is not held or deemed to be held on revenue account) where any capital gain may be minimal. What administrative implications would there be from a capital gains tax? 6.34 A potential capital gains regime will obviously add greater administrative costs and compliance costs into the tax system, particularly where there are exemptions and particularly when any gain / revenue is modest. We refer you to the extracts at para 6.49-6.55 on the Victoria University Tax Working Group Tax Review and McLeod Report, both of which noted a CGT would introduce significant complexity and CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 38 of 48 CTGCTG compliance costs (whether a full or partial regime). This also forms part of the consideration of the wider ‘equation’ – where does a capital gains regime fit in, in New Zealand’s economy? What rules should govern the transition into a capital gains tax? The options seem to be cost of the assets (retrospective taxation of past accrued gains), valuation at date of introduction or only assets acquired post introduction (the Australian rule). 6.35 In most circumstances it would be inappropriate to require the original cost of assets to be used as a measure for the retrospective taxation of accrued gains; there is an argument to have cost as an option where there has been a temporary reduction in market value between the purchase of the asset and the CGT being implemented. The Group would be strongly against mandatory use of original cost. 6.36 From a policy perspective it would be appropriate if the capital gains regime were to only include assets acquired post introduction. This would mean that investment decisions made prior to the introduction of the regime and any presumptions made at that time are preserved. However this will add in additional complexity and will distort investment decisions going forward, as well as rewarding those who have already invested and disadvantaging those who have not. 6.37 Having the option to obtain a valuation at date of introduction would be the fairest approach as from that point in time. However this will obviously introduce a cost and put pressure on valuers in respect of time and volume – regulation of this process will be necessary to ensure that no manipulation occurs. How should family trusts be integrated into the system? 6.38 This is not an issue for the Group. A targeted capital gains tax 6.39 If a capital gains regime is to be implemented and if it is to be workable, a significant number of exemptions will be required which will reduce the amount of revenue a CGT will actually collect. This is the same for whether a comprehensive regime is considered or a slightly less comprehensive regime is considered. In the Group’s view, if a CGT is to be introduced, it would be more worthwhile introducing a targeted CGT on the specific areas that the government considers should be addressed. This would avoid some of the costs that would be introduced by a broader capital gains regime. 6.40 It will also be important to undertake research and analysis into how much tax could be collected by a CGT, charged on a realisation basis, by asset type. This will enable an informed decision to be made by weighing up the tax to be collected when certain assets are excluded against the compliance costs imposed on the economy by the CGT. CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 39 of 48 CTGCTG Impact of a CGT on competitiveness / investment in New Zealand 6.41 The traditionally strong agricultural / primary sectors of New Zealand have been relatively easy to tax, given their clear source / base. However, the technology sector and other more moveable industries have a real choice as to where they base themselves. These industries are not as restrained by natural capital and labour capital restraints and their clients are usually based outside of New Zealand (i.e. it is not vital for them to set up shop here). These entities do base themselves in New Zealand however, for one reason or another, whether it be ease of setting up their business here and a simple tax system, or the mere fact that New Zealand is a great place to live. 6.42 Currently, if these entities are successful and decide to sell their business, then there is no capital gain element to be considered. However, if a CGT is implemented, these entities will have less incentive to set up shop in New Zealand. In this situation businesses will start to consider other countries, even ones like the US who also have a CGT, because there they would at least be closer to their target market and capital, with the increased savings and opportunities that come with that; and of course the benefit of a lower corporate tax rate. 6.43 New Zealand’s geographical location and economy size are very relevant considerations and we must be aware of these sorts of unintended consequences that a capital gains tax regime may bring. Part of the consideration of a CGT must map where we think New Zealand will be in the future, and what trade-offs New Zealand is willing to make (including potentially losing a competitive advantage). If the entities described above are ones that New Zealand wants to be enticing to New Zealand, then this needs to be considered. Further, for many companies already based in New Zealand it is currently very complex for them to move to Australia or the United States, as there are capital gains to consider. However the introduction of a CGT will reduce the relative complexity of this and the barrier to leaving will appear lower. Further deductions must be considered 6.44 If a capital gains tax is introduced this would significantly broaden the tax base. This would give an opportunity for other taxes to be reduced (or for further deductions to be allowed to reduce the effective tax rate). This is particularly relevant for capital intensive businesses, as a capital gains tax will place a significant burden on these businesses that did not previously exist. These businesses (and others) do not exist to make a capital gain, this is not part of their business model and this must be considered if a capital gains regime proceeds. 6.45 Under a potential capital gains regime, the Group submits that a deduction for goodwill must be allowed. Organisations are taxed on the income that they receive to earn their goodwill balance, however no corresponding deduction is allowed. In New Zealand an annual impairment test must be performed for goodwill under NZ IAS 36. The Group argues that if there is any impairment, a tax deduction should be allowed. 6.46 If a capital gains tax is introduced, it should be clear that certain other costs are fully deductible. For example, there are a number of instances where businesses can incur costs for which a tax deduction is not available. This is known as ‘black hole’ expenditure and we refer you to our comments on this earlier in our submission. 6.47 The Group considers that there is also scope for a deduction to be allowed for tax depreciation on commercial/industrial buildings. In reality these buildings depreciate CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 40 of 48 CTGCTG over time, given the particular requirements of the building can change rapidly due to new technology or a shift in focus involving the operations of the business. There also must be care taken in defining and differentiating residential and commercial buildings if any ring fencing is to take place. Complexity 6.48 Members of the Group with experience in the Australian capital gains regime have not been complimentary of the complexity of Australia’s regime. In particular members have noted that there are significant compliance costs in the regime in understanding what is captured, what isn’t, quantum affected and so on, so that any benefit of the regime is essentially netted off by its complexity. This is not a future New Zealand should be chasing. If a capital gains regime is introduced, care must be taken to minimise complexity and compliance costs and it is for this reason that a targeted CGT would be preferred. However, the Group reiterates again that this is not intended to be taken as support for (or against) the introduction of a capital gains tax. Reviews of New Zealand’s tax system / A capital gains tax 6.49 There have been a number of reviews of New Zealand’s tax system in the past and these also included consideration of the introduction of a CGT. While undertaken in a different time / context, many of the same considerations apply today and so we briefly consider these below. Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group’s report: A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future 6.50 The 2010 Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group’s report A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future concluded that the most comprehensive option for base broadening with respect to the taxation of capital would be to introduce a comprehensive capital gains tax. However, most members of the Victoria University Working Group had significant concerns over the practical challenges from a comprehensive CGT and the potential distortions and other efficiency implications that may arise from a partial CGT. 23 6.51 It is worth noting that the Victoria University Tax Working Group report noted that if owner-occupied property was excluded from the tax (as will be under the TWG’s terms of reference), then there would then be a bias towards investing in primary residences. 6.52 It was also noted that some members of the Victoria University Working Group would support applying a deemed notional calculation using a risk-free rate of return (“RFRM”) method to tax returns from capital invested in residential rental properties. However, the Working Group noted that there would be a number of complex design issues that would need to be addressed with this option. There would also need to be consideration regarding the extent to which the benefits of a RFRM tax would be reduced by excluding owner-occupied housing from the tax base. 23 Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group, A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future, January 2010. CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 41 of 48 CTGCTG McLeod Report 6.53 The 2001 Tax Review (“McLeod Report”) 24 concluded that New Zealand should not adopt a general realisations-based capital gains tax, in particular noting: “We do not believe that such a tax would make our tax system fairer and more efficient, nor do we believe that it would lower tax avoidance or raise substantial revenue that could be used to reduce rates. Instead, such a tax would increase the complexity and costs of our system.” However the McLeod Report did note that the RFRM could be used to address the specific problem of disparate tax treatment of different savings entities, continuing the past approach of dealing with specific capital gains issues as they arise. 6.54 The McLeod Report also considered the tax treatment of housing, noting the concern that New Zealand’s tax system creates a bias in favour of investing equity in a home, with renters and those with mortgages paying from after-tax income. In contrast, those without mortgages earn what amounts to a tax free return on the equity invested in their owner-occupied dwellings, encouraging people to apply savings to owner-occupied housing in circumstances where higher overall (fully-taxed) yields can be obtained from alternative investments. 6.55 In response to the above, the McLeod Report rejected the OECD view that housing should be taxed on imputed rental income and capital gains (with deductions for mortgage interest, depreciation and repairs and maintenance). In particular, noting that the RFRM to tax the net equity-component of owner-occupied and rental houses would be unlikely to be supported. Given this, the McLeod Report concluded that there would be no more viable way to making this aspect of the tax system fairer and less distortionary and did not recommend that the government proceed. Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? 6.56 If any such tax is introduced in relation to land, this should be limited to land in relation to residential rental properties. As noted earlier, a rental property can be considered to be a ‘non-productive’ asset, whereas a farmer and their farm would be considered a ‘productive’ asset on New Zealand’s balance sheet. Inland Revenue should err on the side of taxing the non-productive asset (in a choice between the two). However this is an arbitrary decision and tax is not the appropriate mechanism for addressing any inequities in housing – these issues should be addressed by other mechanisms of government. 6.57 New Zealand already has a comprehensive capital gains regime on land sales (with an exclusion for the family home except where a regular pattern of trading has occurred). Instead of adding further complexity into the regime by adding new taxes, the focus should be on the enforcement and use of the existing regime. Further, the extended five year bright line test (and ring-fencing of rental losses if introduced) should be given time to be put into action and their impact considered, before any additional changes are introduced. 24 2001 Tax Review, McLeod et al. CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 42 of 48 CTGCTG What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? 6.58 One area in which the tax system can incentivise and reward environmentally friendly behaviour is through concessions in areas that are considered to be environmentally positive. One example that the Group has previously raised is the tax treatment of employers providing both electric cars and hybrid cars to employees, and any concessions that could be provided to promote sustainability-related initiatives. We note also our comments earlier on feasibility expenditure / R&D tax credits / loss continuity changes promoting innovation and potentially sustainability. Should the tax system do more to support small businesses? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? 6.59 A progressive company tax is not really an issue for the Group to comment upon, but if such a system is introduced, it is important that this is a final tax. If it is not, this will result in significant uncertainty for businesses. Certainty over tax is important for all businesses, but for small businesses even more so, given many of them have relatively slim margins in which they operate. A progressive company tax rate will increase the complexity of the tax system and will raise a number of flow-on issues that will also need to be addressed. In particular the ‘line in the sand’ thresholds between small, medium and large businesses will need to be carefully considered. The Group does see value in a progressive company tax to the extent the capital is retained by the business to reinvest. However, overall the Group considers that the complexity such a system would introduce would outweigh any benefits. Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? If so, what should be excluded? What else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue? 6.60 As noted earlier in our submission, New Zealand’s GST system is successful due to its simplicity (in both administration and application). GST is an effective and efficient tax, driven by the fact that the rules are broad and encompassing, with few exceptions. In the Group’s view, this simplicity should not be undermined by exclusions (and in particular exclusions that would add additional compliance costs). The underlying issues regarding the exclusion of some goods and services from GST are an issue for the transfer system and should not be addressed by tax. Both the McLeod Report and Victoria University Working Group Review concluded that there should be no exemptions from GST. 7. Other comments 7.1 The Group sets out below a non-exhaustive list of recent live issues / issues that the Group would like to see continue to be addressed. These are:  FBT remedial issues  Tax pooling review  Feasibility and black hole expenditure  Business continuity  Entertainment expenditure CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 43 of 48 CTGCTG  Non-resident employee issues  Provisional tax reform – TIM The Group has discussed with and written to Officials / Ministers on most of the above issues and would be happy to provide any copies of these letters as required. CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 44 of 48 CTGCTG APPENDIX ONE: BUSINESS TAX SUGGESTIONS PROVIDED TO OFFICIALS Policy changes  Tax loss shareholder continuity rules - Consider appropriateness of the current 49% shareholder continuity requirement. Current threshold significantly restricts the ability to introduce new capital into a business. Consider reducing the threshold and / or introducing a same business test concept (similar to Australia). A 10% threshold should be sufficient to ensure there was not loss trading.  Imputation credit continuity rules - Consider appropriateness of current 66% shareholder continuity requirements. Is there still a policy justification for a distinction between ICs and losses.  Consider shortening time bar periods.  Accruals for expenditure incurred booked in financial statements - If financial statements are audited, then accruals booked should be accepted as expenditure incurred for tax without any review of possible under or over accruals.  Similarly, unexpired expenditure / prepayment rules should follow IFRS accounting if financial statements are audited. The compliance costs associated with unexpired expenditure are not justified when it is simply a matter of timing.  Entertainment expenditure regime - Review and simplify regime e.g. expenditure on meals where business contact present should be fully deductible, off premises morning and afternoon teas deductible, etc. The entertainment regime is very compliance intensive and the outcomes are not always logical.  Write-off low value residual asset balances in tax asset register - If DV depreciation rates are adopted, then can end up with minor asset balances that never reduces to zero. Create the ability to write-off residual asset balances of say $50 or $100.  Allow taxpayers to align their ICA with their balance date (rather than having an ICA to 31 March for a taxpayer with an early or late balance date).  A comprehensive solution to black-hole expenditure that allows taxpayers to group expenditure otherwise not deductible and spread the tax deduction over a number of years (e.g. five years).  Simplification of the depreciation framework / deprecation rate table – The sheer number of rates and constant need to update the table and produce new determinations makes depreciation unnecessarily complex. Suggestion would be to simplify the asset categories so that there are a few broad categories for rates to be allocated against. Legislative thresholds Many legislative thresholds were set a number of years ago and should be reviewed for their appropriateness in the current business climate. Suggestions include:  Higher thresholds for immediately deducting the cost of “low-value” assets (e.g. increase the threshold from $500 to $1,000).  Increase in the DC 13 share scheme threshold of $2,340 (we expect this will be considered as part of the share scheme work but this is included for completeness). CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 45 of 48 CTGCTG  Determination E12 (unexpired portion of accrual expenditure) - Consider increasing maximum threshold amounts, noting that for large corporates the Group’s view is that tax should follow accounting where audited IFRS accounts are prepared.  DB 62 Legal fees - Currently where legal fees are $10,000 or less, a taxpayer can claim a deduction without the need to review for capital items. Consider raising this threshold.  Consider setting an additional de-minimis threshold for the application of the thin cap rules based on the total interest deduction claimed (i.e. if the taxpayer’s interest for the year is less than X they wouldn’t need to undertake any thin capitalisation calculations). Approvals and certificates  Remove the requirement for taxpayers to have to seek the Commissioner’s approval to issue Buyer Created Tax Invoices.  Allow special rate certificates and certificates of exemption to be granted retrospectively (often commercial arrangements mean that payment needs to be made before a certificate has been granted. This would also be helpful, where a taxpayer has inadvertently neglected to withhold amounts, but ultimately no tax is payable in New Zealand).  Remove the requirement to withhold NRCT on contract payments made to the New Zealand branch of a non-resident entity (noting that the income is returned in New Zealand).  Increase the period of validity for a certificate of exemption. Employer obligations and payroll taxes  Refer to separate document previously provided to Inland Revenue for a number of non-resident employee issues which cause compliance difficulties for New Zealand businesses. Other employee / employer tax issues include:  Clarifying the source of directors’ fees paid to non-residents. There is widespread differences in treatment between organisations. Some will treat only a portion of the fees as sourced in New Zealand based on the number days spent in New Zealand (which creates apportionment issues). Whereas others treat the full amount as taxable on the basis that they were paid by a New Zealand company. Deeming the full amount to be sourced in New Zealand would reduce compliance costs.  Business Travellers – (i.e. highly mobile employees who travel to one or more countries on short term assignments). Where employees come to New Zealand to work short term but remain on a foreign payroll it can be difficult to ensure PAYE obligations are met at the time the individual is in New Zealand. Often it is uncertain how long they will be here for. Consider a mechanism that allow for the obligation to be assessed at year end and a wash up undertaken. The UK are currently considering a similar system. Filing obligations  Remove the requirement to file change of imputation ratio notices with the Commissioner. If a blanket removal will not be contemplated, we suggest that a concessional threshold should be introduced for small changes in imputation ratio. If CTG – Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 Page 46 of 48 CTGCTG the change in imputation ratio is below the threshold (we suggest less than 10%), the company would not be required to file a change of imputation ratio notice with the Commissioner. This would remove a compliance burden on companies paying dividends in foreign currency from filing a change in imputation ratio where the change in imputation ratio is due to foreign exchange movements.  Remove the requirement to file company dividend statements with the annual income tax return.  Extend the ability to file group returns for other tax types (i.e. beyond GST and income tax). This could include, group FBT, PAYE and other withholding tax returns.  Simplification of non-resident insurer return process. Inland Revenue systems  Greater pre-population of return forms. For example Inland Revenue could prepopulate the NRWT annual reconciliations with the data already held.  Ability to file a wider range of returns online for example RWT and NRWT returns.  Allow online access to the status of the filing of tax agent’s returns and agency list.  An agents online log on where you can file an online income tax return for your clients (like MYIR but for agents where they are able to file several Income Tax Returns) \[This may already exist but the functionality does not appear to be working\].  Tax reclaim forms (to obtain refunds of overpaid NRWT): o Update to electronic forms, o Inland Revenue should provide automatic residency certification to overseas authorities. Currently we have to complete duplicate hard copy forms and send the forms to the IRD for stamping, o Agree the treaty rate when the security is obtained rather than deducting at the full rate and obtain a refund  Online FBT return form should have a box to manually enter the GST amount  When registering a PIE online with Inland Revenue having the option to select a certificate of exemption from RWT instead of having to writing in to request one.

DairyNZ is the industry good organisation representing New Zealand’s dairy farmers. Our purpose is to secure and enhance the profitability, sustainability and competitiveness of New Zealand dairy farmers and their local communities. Comments The Future of Tax Background Paper presents ideas in general terms so our comments here are mainly at an ‘in principle’ level. As the Tax Working Group (TWG) will be well aware when it comes to tax, the devil is in the detail. We anticipate that the interim report to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue due to be released for public consultation later in the year will contain sufficient detail to enable DairyNZ to model and submit the likely impacts of the proposals on the Dairy farming industry. DairyNZ has read and supports submissions by Horticulture NZ, Federated Farmers of New Zealand, and Irrigation NZ. DairyNZ is happy to meet with the Tax Working Group to discuss our submission. Principles of a good tax system DairyNZ supports the principles of a good tax system espoused by the TWG convened by Victoria University of Wellington in 2010 and articulated in the Future of Tax Background Paper. A broad-based, low-rate tax system that balances the principles of Efficiency, Equity and Fairness; Revenue Integrity; Fiscal Adequacy; Compliance and Administration costs and has Coherence is a solid foundation for the tax system. In making the inevitable trade-offs between these guiding principles a broad-based low-rate tax system should apply to a wide range of activities; avoid individual taxes on specific sub- sectors of the economy; rates of taxation should be as low as possible, while still meeting revenue needs and equity concerns; and taxes should be seen as a system, not a collection of individual measures designed to meet specific policy objectives. While we expect the TWG to make recommendations to Government on whether and how the tax base might be broadened, we suggest that the TWG also consider mechanisms to discipline the government to adhere to the principle of setting low-rates. Any transition to a broader tax base should be fiscally neutral, i.e. if there was to be a new form of taxes introduced a corresponding reduction in the rate of existing taxes would be expected also. Fairness and Balance There is little doubt that the current tax system does not strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy. Taxing and conversely the non-taxing or under-taxing of specific sub-sectors of the economy should be avoided. The tax system should in principle be neutral, having little influence on the flow of capital between the productive and speculative parts of the economy. 3 | P a g e The different treatment of one class of asset from others (e.g. housing) distorts savings and investment decisions and has no doubt contributed to higher costs of capital to the productive sector. The current tax system incentivises free capital gains while taxing productivity gains, undermining the long-term competitiveness of the productive sector. There is an inherent unfairness in taxing the productive sector while not taxing capital gains made in investment housing. DairyNZ has no objection to addressing speculative behaviour in investment housing through the bright-line test. On the other hand, the introduction of a comprehensive Capital Gains Tax (CGT) presents significant challenges both in transition and practical implementation. While in the long-run the inevitable reduction in the value of land may improve opportunities for farm ownership for the next generation, may reduce the cost of capital, and increase focus on productivity gains on-farm, there is significant risk for those already heavily invested in the industry. The transition arrangements from the current tax arrangements to a comprehensive CGT are therefore key when considering the desirability of broadening the tax base in this manner. Should the TWG propose a comprehensive capital gains tax it should also articulate the likely transition arrangements so that stakeholders can better assess the merits of the proposal. Specific implementation issues that would need to be resolved include: • The treatment of double taxation or double losses caused by capital gains and losses in a company being reflected in the company’s share price if both bases are subject to a comprehensive CGT. • The treatment of Livestock Herd Scheme gains and losses that are currently treated as being on the capital account. This could cause the herd scheme to be abolished and this itself would create issues as farmers have paid taxation on entry to enjoy the benefits of the herd scheme. • The treatment of the primary residence when it is a component of a larger land-owning activity, such as farming and treatment of the primary residence when it is situated on a farm owned by a company? • Where there is no change in ownership, the treatment of houses that move in and out of the CGT tax base as their usage changes from being a home to a rental house and vice versa. Will this require valuations at the point of the change, or apportionment or some other arrangement? • Indexing asset cost base so the inflation component is not taxed will be an issue (the same issues currently exists with income tax on revenue account property and monies on deposit for interest and this would have to be addressed at the same time); • Dealing with roll-over relief for intra-family and intra-group company transactions and for transactions involving Maori land and its owners will be essential; • The same roll-over relief problem exists for transactions within a group of companies. This is of particular relevance where the group is a wholly-owned group of companies as in an intra-group transaction there is no change of the ultimate owners; and • The question of which assets should be included in the CGT base will have to be considered. For example, almost all cars depreciate over time, but some appreciate. There are timing consideration here also, a car may not be an appreciating asset until 4 | P a g e it has been owned for a (large) number of years – if cars that appreciate are included in the base, when is this appreciation determined and how is their CGT cost ascertained. If this is not handled carefully there could be considerable compliance costs. In keeping with the broad-based low-rate principle, any broadening of the tax base through the introduction of a capital gains tax should be fiscally neutral with a commensurate reduction in, say, personal and company income tax rates. Taxes and Behaviour Targeted taxes to incentivise behaviour change are best considered alongside other regulatory options and current and/or planned voluntary efforts pertaining to the specific issue of concern. The best package of interventions to impact, for example, environmental concerns may or may not include an environment tax - there may be better options to influence change in behaviour. While in theory the adoption of an environment tax might incentivise behavioural change, in practice it will be difficult to identify what rate that tax would need to be set at to incentivise the change in behaviour. As demonstrated in the application of excise tax for cigarettes, the rate would most likely have to be very high to encourage behaviour change by outliers. In contrast, regulation is compulsory and will better deal with laggards. A nationally applied environmental tax is a blunt instrument unable to account for regional variation in performance, for example some regions, districts or catchments may be managing water quality very effectively. Deciding what to tax is also challenging, for example taxing inputs that result in risk of nitrate reaching groundwater and surface water does not take into account the measures individual farmers may have taken to mitigate impacts on water quality. There has been an indication that environmental taxes may be reinvested back onto farms to accelerate the transition to a more sustainable footing. We question whether the government would be well placed to re-allocate that resource any more efficiently than had that resource stayed with those farmers already engaged in improving their environmental practices. If an environmental tax was to be introduced it is likely those farmers that are motivated to invest in improving environmental performance will have resource diverted. That would at face value seem to be a demotivator, potentially resulting in behavioural change in the wrong direction, slowing if not stalling progress. In addition, the cost of administering the reallocation of the resource would inevitably absorb resource that may otherwise have been focused on getting on with implementing the change process on farm, for example, to meet regional council water quality or water quantity limits under the National Policy Statement for freshwater management (NPS-FM). It is DairyNZ’s preference that the TWG do not make specific recommendations on the merits of environmental taxes as this would be out of context of the other regulatory and voluntary efforts of the farming community to address environmental impacts. For Green House Gases, for example, that issue should be addressed by the Interim Climate Change Commission which is specifically charged with dealing with GHG. A premature conclusion that a particular environment tax is the right option risks more effective options at a catchment scale, being passed over. Examples of other existing and planned regulatory and voluntary interventions to address environmental impacts are attached, Appendix 1. 5 | P a g e The TWG group could usefully provide general guidance to support those working on specific issues, e.g. water quality or Green House Gases (GHG), to assess the merits of adopting a targeted tax over alternate interventions. For example, how would an input tax score against the principles of Efficiency, Equity, Revenue Security, Compliance and Administration, and Coherence, as was attempted by NZIER in its recent report to the agriculture sector 1 . Land Tax The tax system should in principle be neutral. Decisions about where to invest capital should not be influenced by different treatment of assets under the tax system. A targeted tax on land alone could, for example, incentivise farmers to shift from an extensive pasture based system to a smaller plot with intensive barn stored animals fed through supplements – ‘factory farming’. The tax system should not unduly influence farmers’ farm systems choices. A Land Tax would unevenly fall on those industries with land intensive modes of production, and as a consequence increase the relative attractiveness of investing in mechanised intensive industries, like manufacturing, that would have less land tax liability. Farmers already pay a disproportionate amount of tax through rates compared to other modes of production. According to DairyNZ’s 2015/16 Economic Survey, the average Dairy Farm pays around $16,000 per annum in rates. This is inherently unfair and unduly influences investment decisions. Land tax has the potential to turn highly geared enterprises into equity-negative enterprises, potentially with a flow on effect to banks and other financiers. Further, developing businesses, or businesses whose annual income fluctuates may not have sufficient cash flow in any one year to pay a land tax. This is a particular concern for farming where there is significant and unpredictable volatility in revenue due to international commodity process, exchange rates, interest rates and the weather. Cash flow problems are also likely to be an issue for owners of fallow land, and this could particularly affect Maori land owners. Then there is a question over the treatment of QE II covenants – would an exemption apply? GST Exemptions for particular goods GST is a world leading consumption tax because there are no exemptions. Businesses do not find it difficult to comply with GST obligations. Introducing exemptions will only add to complexity, and consequently reduce compliance and add administrative burden. If the government has an interest in facilitating greater access to certain goods and services for lower socioeconomic groups, if it were to broaden the tax base it may look at lowering the GST rate for all to benefit or alternatively target transfers such as increases in family assistance payments.

In Waikato, Hawkes Bay and Canterbury Regional plans, a Farm Environment Plan is required as a regulatory tool that seeks to manage risk of diffuse contaminants entering waterbodies, using guidelines and expert certified advisors. In the absence of clear links between on-farm mitigations to reduce contaminants and the community-desired values such as swimmability, this approach is seen as a practical and effective way of improving environmental outcomes. DairyNZ supports these sorts of approaches and offers expert advice and partnership approaches to science research to look ahead to achieving long term and challenging limits in waterbodies. In relation to water quantity, DairyNZ has commissioned work to better understand how much water is used on farms and how this can be used more efficiently. Some of this work has been used by councils such as Bay of Plenty Regional Council. In a recent regional plan change, the council is requiring water to be metered at source, and has volume guidelines for efficient water use in the milking shed. DairyNZ has offered to work with council and milk company staff, as happened in the Waikato Region over the last five years, to ensure farmers know their environmental obligations and are making changes on farm to use water efficiently. Green House Gases There is a comprehensive policy development process underway to strengthen New Zealand’s response to climate change and examine whether introducing a price on biological emissions (methane and nitrous oxide) will incentivise on farm behaviour change. DairyNZ believes this process is the most appropriate mechanism for examining whether an environmental tax is an appropriate means of driving on farm behaviour change to reduce or offset biological emissions. In addition to this, dairy farmers are already undertaking actions to address on farm greenhouse gas emissions. The Government is proposing to introduce a similar framework to the United Kingdom which is comprised of a Zero Carbon Act, a legislated net zero 2050 emissions target, and an Independent Climate Change Commission which develops five year rolling carbon budgets outlining how each sector of the economy will contribute to meeting the greenhouse gas reduction targets. This framework would then be supported by an array of policy mechanisms including the Emissions Trading Scheme, under which biological emissions must be reported by the processor but do not face a price. Consultation on the Commission, the Zero Carbon Act, and the 2050 target is due to commence on 31 May 2018 for six weeks. An Interim Climate Change Committee has been established in parallel to the development of a Zero Carbon Act to build an evidence base on agriculture’s role in meeting New Zealand’s greenhouse gas targets. The Committee will examine whether biological emissions should face a price in the Emissions Trading Scheme or whether an alternative mechanism should be adopted to incentivise on farm behaviour change to reduce on farm emissions. This evidence base will be provided to the Independent Climate Change 7 | P a g e Commission which is scheduled to be established in mid-2019 who will make a recommendation to Government on whether to price biological emissions. Despite the absence of a policy framework to reduce agricultural methane and nitrous oxide emissions, dairy farmers are undertaking actions to address their on-farm emissions as a result of the actions underway to improve water quality. This is being accelerated by the Dairy Action for Climate Change. The action plan is a partnership between DairyNZ and Fonterra, and is supported by the Ministry for the Environment, and the Ministry for Primary Industries. It is focused on building an understanding of why action is required by dairy farmers, the mitigations that are available now and the options that could be adopted in the future. On average individual dairy farmers have spent over $90,000 on the environment over the past five years, with many farmers investing far more than this. This equates to a $1 billion- dollar investment on initiatives such as effluent management, stock exclusion, riparian planting, upgrading systems, investing in technology, retiring land, and developing strategic wetlands. By managing the farm’s nitrogen surplus through improved farm practices, wetlands, and effluent management systems both nitrate leaching to water and nitrous oxide emissions entering the atmosphere will reduce. Practices undertaken to improve the efficiency of the farm system through managing total feed intake, reducing replacement rates, and increasing production per cow will result in a slight reduction in methane emissions. Case Study Wairarapa dairy farm Kaiwaiwai Dairies, a 425 hectare farm with a 1400 animals, has seen its greenhouse gas footprint drop by a third from the 2012-13 season due to a change in farm practices and adopting new technology. The farm has implemented a man-made wetland which removes around 600kg of nitrogen (both nitrate leaching and nitrous oxide) per year, this cost around $55,000. The farm has invested $800,000 into a state of the art effluent management system which provides 30/30 years storage and allows the effluent to be spread on pasture under the right conditions, reducing the nitrogen leached to water and the nitrous oxide emissions. The farm has also invested in planting marginal land, which sequesters carbon and improves biodiversity.

Without high level reviews it can be easy for tax policy development to get embroiled in micro reforms which don’t have the necessary macro view. Ensuring a tax system is fit for purpose involves an examination of how much tax revenue is required and what can be taxed to raise that revenue, generally in the least distortionary way. It is difficult to make a submission to the Tax Working Group without having an understanding of the options being considered and the overall package of reform. For example, broadening the tax base through the introduction of new taxes will be more palatable when it is combined with a lowering of taxes in other areas. Until the options and tradeoffs are known it is difficult to comment on any reform package including its component parts. It is with this context that we do not provide direct views on the Tax Working Group submission paper other than noting that we are in general agreement with the process and many of the observations made in the documents to date. We instead provide some observations and international comparisons. Observations 1. To ensure New Zealand continues to collect the tax revenue it needs, the emphasis should be on initiatives that encourage the economy to grow with increased tax revenues flowing from that growth, rather than just taxing existing economic activity harder. A key lens through which the tax system and initiatives relating to it should be analysed is therefore from the perspective of what can be done to help New Zealand be more productive and grow, rather than being drawn into micro base maintenance concerns which have dominated recent policy deliberations. 2. New Zealand is a country which is reliant on foreign capital, it should be at the forefront of the minds of the Tax Working Group that New Zealand’s tax rules need to be designed to both tax and retain what capital is already invested here, but also to attract and retain foreign capital. The Tax Working Group should be focused on ensuring there is an attractive tax regime that is internationally competitive, recognizing that there is a balance to be struck between appropriately taxing economic rents and looking to attract and retain mobile capital. Consistent with the findings of previous reviews, we think that drawing the line is not easy. In analyzing whether our tax rates are appropriate there is a need to consider where we stand vis-à-vis other jurisdictions, in particular our trading partners. As an example, New Zealand’s 28% corporate rate is at the high end of the range by international standards. That said, one competitive advantage New Zealand currently has is the lack of a general capital gains tax. 3. The taxation of savings also needs to be considered. New Zealand needs to be encouraging and incentivising New Zealanders to save. Tax “the emphasis should be in initiatives that encourage the economy to grow with increased tax revenues flowing from that growth” Tax Working Group | Executive Summary 04 can play a part in this by reducing taxes on saving. New Zealand is an outlier in following a Tax-Tax-Exempt (TTE) model and steps should be taken to reduce taxes at the investment and earning stages of the savings cycle. 4. The tax system should also be analysed on the basis of what it best for the tax system; what are the fairest and most efficient ways of collecting tax. The Tax Working Group should not be focusing on how the tax system could be used to redistribute wealth, very few tax systems do this. This is the function of the welfare / transfer system. 5. Addressing or mitigating the effects of the hidden economy should be a priority in the current review. The amounts involved are material as are the equity issues. An immediate response could be to hold a tax amnesty to draw taxpayers out. The New Zealand approach of not requiring individuals to file returns could be revalidated as part of this issue and in particular whether the lack of tax return filing contributes to the hidden economy given the impact on tax literacy. 6. Tax systems in other countries are beginning to anticipate a need to encourage employment and to support training. In 2006 New Zealand undertook consultation on Skills Training Tax Credits. While not proceeded with at that time, there could be merit in reassessing the work done in 2006 to determine whether there is a place for Skills Training Tax Credits in 2018. 7. The effectiveness of behavioural taxes varies depending on the subject matter in question. With a small population of consumers the deadweight costs of imposing and administering new taxes may negate any perceived benefit. In many instances education, information sharing and at the extreme simply regulating an outcome, is a better option for influencing / impacting behaviour; for example promotion of the harm plastic straws can cause to sea life has seen a shift away from plastic straws in mainstream life, this has been largely driven by consumer awareness and demand. 8. Housing issues are not unique to New Zealand and internationally arise whether or not gains are taxed. Likewise, it is not clear that any perceived (or real) under-taxation of housing is justification for the imposition of a capital gains tax on all assets. International Perspectives While some may consider New Zealand an isolated country in terms of geography, the New Zealand tax system does not operate in isolation. The New Zealand tax system needs to achieve two broad outcomes. First to tax what is here and will remain here (economic rents); second to ensure that it is able to compete against other tax systems around the world to attract mobile capital and labour. It is therefore important that when analyzing New Zealand’s tax system, regard is had to the tax systems in other countries. The Tax Working Group submissions paper identifies a number of challenges facing the New Zealand tax system. New Zealand is not at all unique in having an aging population and the imminent threat of a mobile digital economy. It is the ubiquitous nature of these challenges (or opportunities) that has lead Deloitte to undertake a survey of tax systems. Tax Working Group | Executive Summary 05 For this we must acknowledge the assistance of Deloitte member firms in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Russia, Spain, and the United Kingdom who have contributed their time and resources to providing information for this submission.

Tax Working Group | Taxing people 06 Taxing people Personal income tax can be easy to collect when tax is withheld at source from employees. But more and more of us aren’t employees and don’t work a single job. The changing nature of work means that New Zealand needs to consider the best manner to tax its workers. The Pay As You Earn (PAYE) collection system will lose some of its effectiveness as we increasingly move to new business models and New Zealand needs to ensure workers are paying their fair share. We posed the following question: New Zealand has an efficient and effective system for collecting tax off employees (in New Zealand employers withhold tax at marginal rates each pay day. Employees cannot claim tax deductions for costs of earning employment income). In New Zealand people who work as 'contractors' only have tax withheld at source in a limited number of industries. However the world is changing from people having a single full time jobs to working for multiple employers or being contractors / self-employed. In a world where less tax can be collected at source, what is your country doing to ensure tax can be collected in an efficient way? What measures are in place to ensure individuals are declaring all income (e.g. collecting & matching data)? All responses are general in nature and should not be relied on without further detailed advice. Argentina Employers act as withholding agents when paying employees, but also all companies must act as withholding agents when paying independent contractors on the amounts they are invoiced. On an annual basis, individuals must declare all their assets, with a test to determine whether the change in assets is reasonable based on declared income. Australia Australia is implementing a number of initiatives to ensure that income is accurately reported. These include “single touch payroll” (which is real time reporting of tax and superannuation payments), payment reporting systems for contractors operating in certain industries (cleaning, couriers and construction), a black economy taskforce (which has examined risks and solutions posed by the black economy), automated and standardized third party reporting of interest, dividends, land transactions, share transactions and data matching programmes (including for online sales, motor vehicle acquisitions, welfare declarations). More information is available at the following links. Tax Working Group | Taxing people 07 Single Touch payroll: https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Single-Touch- Payroll/ Taxable payment reporting system: https://www.ato.gov.au/general/new- legislation/in-detail/direct-taxes/income-tax-for-businesses/black-economy- taskforce--extension-of-the-taxable-payments-reporting-system-to- contractors-in-the-courier-and-cleaning-industries/ Black economy taskforce consultation paper: https://consult.treasury.gov.au/tax-framework-division/black-economy- taskforce/ Third party reporting systems: https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Third- party-reporting/ Specific data matching programs: https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Building-confidence/In-detail/Data- matching/?anchor=Datamatchingprograms Brazil Under Brazilian rules, employers act as withholding agents of individual income tax and social security when paying employees’ salaries. All income received by the individual must be declared on an annual income tax return in which any residual tax should be collected by the submission deadline. Independent contractors are also subject to specific withholding mechanisms that apply on a case by case basis. Canada Canada withholds at source on employment income. In addition, where prior year's residual tax liability is $2,000 or more, tax instalments are required to be paid by the employee quarterly. For non-resident contractors, a withholding tax regime is in place (subject to certain exemptions). China China still heavily relies on a withholding mechanism to collect tax from individuals. A party making payments to an individual generally has the obligation to withhold the tax at source and remit the tax to authorities, except for certain situations (e.g. the individual doing business through a sole proprietorship, partnership, or "individual industrial and commercial household"). However, China has considered moving the existing typical scheduler Individual Income Tax system towards a more comprehensive system, which might require more self-reporting by individual taxpayers. Chinese tax authorities have made efforts to establish information exchange mechanism with other government departments (e.g. the State Administration of Foreign Exchange) to regularly collect income-related information for internal matching/audit purposes. France As from 2019, a pay-as-you-earn system will be set up. In addition, France intends to develop data mining to ensure individuals are declaring all income. Tax Working Group | Taxing people 08 Germany Employers act as withholding agents when paying employees, but there is no withholding requirement when paying independent contractors. Germany is relying on additional data collection and exchange of information to make sure that in the case an expense is claimed by the principal company the payment is taxed at the level of the recipient. This mostly happens in case of a tax audit at the level of the principal company. There currently is no "real-time" mechanism in place. Tax auditors and social security auditors have begun analysing payments to freelancers or contractors in much more depth, than a couple of years ago. No other new or specific measures have been introduced. Hungary Companies are required to withhold taxes from salaries and fees paid, irrespective of whether the individual is an employee or contractor. All employers ought to report the earnings of their employees to the tax authority though a central database. The tax authority then prepares a return for the taxpayer automatically, which may be modified by the taxpayer. This practice helps eliminate opportunities for undeclared earnings and reduces administrative burdens. The personal tax rate in Hungary is a flat rate of 15%. Israel The duty to withhold tax is on the payer, with criminal sanctions in place if tax is not withheld (except where the worker has provided a tax exemption). Italy In Italy both employees and the self-employed are subject to withholding taxes. Japan Many payments to individuals are subject to withholding tax, even outside of employment relationships, for example, payments to a Japanese resident lawyer, accountant, consultant, translator, and several others are subject to withholding in Japan. More information is available in the Japanese tax authority withholding tax guide: https://www.nta.go.jp/publication/pamph/gensen/shikata2018/pdf/withhold ingtaxguide2018.pdf Luxembourg Luxembourg withholds at source for some revenues (e.g. salaries and pensions). A "full" tax return should be completed once a year. This must disclose all income received, with sanctions applying if obligations are not met. There is an exchange of information in place between European countries concerning some revenues (including salaries of cross-border workers). There is also an exchange of information in place between national authorities (tax authorities and authorities in charge of social matters). Recently, there was a tax amnesty whereby if an individual declared revenues not yet declared, less sanctions were applicable. More information on this tax amnesty is available here: https://www2.deloitte.com/lu/en/pages/tax/articles/implementation- luxembourg-tax-amnesty.html Tax Working Group | Taxing people 09 Mexico The tax rules applying to employees and self-employed contractors are similar; in a sense, that businesses are required to withhold taxes from salaries and fees paid, irrespective of whether the individual is an employee or a self-employed contractor. To ensure taxes are collected in an efficient way there is an obligation to issue electronic tax invoices which are shared with the Mexican tax authorities. Additionally, the tax authority prepares a “pre filled” return for the taxpayer, which may be modified by the taxpayer. This practice helps eliminate opportunities for undeclared earnings and reduces administrative burdens. Russia Multiple employment is not very common in Russia and therefore there are no specific initiatives related to this issue. All contractors must be registered with the tax authorities to carry out an independent business. Spain As a general rule, payments to self-employed individuals (e.g. contractors) are currently subject to 15% withholding tax at source regardless of industry. United Kingdom The UK has an efficient payroll withholding system for employees and pensioners. It has required that public sector engagers take responsibility to withhold from contractors deemed to be employees. There is discussion about broadening this to private sector engagers. There is also discussion about requiring information and possibly withholding from platforms engaging gig workers. The issue has been the subject of a review: “Good Work: The Taylor Review of Modern Working Practices”. More information about the review and the UK government’s response are here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/good-work-the-taylor-review- of-modern-working-practices and https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-response-to- the-taylor-review-of-modern-working-practices Summary Internationally there is a clear trend towards real time data collection, which is used to either pre-fil returns or verify tax return reliability. This data collection is increasingly being available to taxpayers themselves to provide transparency to their affairs. The requirement on all taxpayers to file tax returns in other countries brings integrity to the tax system. Given recent research in New Zealand on the size of the hidden economy and the current Business Transformation project, now seems the right time to reevaluate whether we should return to all taxpayers filing annual tax returns. Like Luxembourg, consideration should be given to holding a tax amnesty to allow taxpayers to draw a line under the past and change behaviours going forward. Tax Working Group | Technological change 10 Technological change It’s all well and good taxing people, but what if workers are replaced by robots? Technology should be viewed as an opportunity rather than a threat, but what is being done to prepare for and embrace it? We posed the following question: There is concern the coming wave of technological change will result in job destruction / higher unemployment. Is your country doing anything to ensure tax rules encourage the retention / growth of employment? For example tax incentives for training or increasing staff numbers All responses are general in nature and should not be relied on without further detailed advice. Argentina Argentina has tax incentives on training. Other tax incentives usually require employers to maintain staff numbers. Australia In Australia the 2017-18 budget focused on the following broad areas to achieve stronger growth in jobs: http://budget.gov.au/2017-18/content/glossies/jobs-growth/html/ The Australian government has made significant progress in implementing its National Innovation and Science Agenda and FinTech measures to encourage individuals and businesses to innovate through greater collaboration, building talent and skills, supporting entrepreneurship and improving access to capital: http://budget.gov.au/2017- 18/content/glossies/factsheets/html/FS\_innovation.htm Brazil Recent labour reforms have been made, but these changes are not necessarily related to the fact that new technologies are evolving. Canada There is no comprehensive tax program to encourage the retention or growth of the size of the workforce. Some provincial credits or levies have been introduced over the years. China China has tax incentives to encourage the employment (including self- employment) of specific group of people, notably the disabled, ex- servicemen, fresh graduates and unemployed individuals from low-income families. For example, companies are entitled to additional deductions for Tax Working Group | Technological change 11 salary expenses paid to the disabled employees. Qualifying small businesses that hire certain individuals may be entitled to tax credits. France Since 2013 France has had a tax credit for competitiveness and employment (“CICE”). The CICE was introduced to reduce the cost of employing workers. The tax credit, based on the wages an entity pays to its employees over the calendar year, currently is 7% of gross payroll on the portion of remuneration that does not exceed 2.5 times the national minimum wage. The CICE generates a receivable against the French treasury that may be offset against the entity’s corporate income tax liability, or refunded after three years. Some recent changes to the CICE are explained in the following article: https://www.taxathand.com/article/8954/France/2017/Parliament-adopts- second-amended-finance-bill-for-2017-and-finance-bill-for-2018 Germany There is no current known activity in Germany in this area. Hungary Hungary is promoting the retention of employees through having a fairly low personal income tax rate (a flat rate of 15%) and favourable tax exemptions and allowances. Refer to the Hungary Country Guide for more information: https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dtt l-tax-hungaryguide-2017.pdf Israel There is no current known activity in Israel in this area. Italy In Italy there are tax deductions available which encourage open-ended employment contracts. Japan Japan has a number of initiative to address the changing nature of work. There is a tax credit available to companies based on the number of employees hired, however, this is only for companies that hire outside the major cities of Japan. There is a tax credit available for companies that raise wages and capital investment. An additional tax credit will be available to companies that increase training costs. More information is available here: https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/jp/Documents/tax/bt/jp- bt-japan-inbound-tax-alert-dec-2017-no26.pdf Luxembourg No such new measures have been implemented in Luxembourg yet. There have been (non-tax) initiatives in relation to allowing flexibility at work in order to acknowledge the particular circumstance of Luxembourg being a small country with many cross-border workers. “At a national and local level, government subsidies are provided for qualifying training programmes.” Tax Working Group | Technological change 12 Mexico Recently, Mexico has launched seven special economic zones (SEZs). The SEZs aim to stimulate growth, reduce poverty, facilitate the supply of basic services and attract investment to economically underdeveloped or depressed areas. SEZs are available to Mexican companies or state-owned entities that obtain permission to become “integral administrators” and Mexican or non- resident entities and individuals that receive authorization from the Ministry of Finance to be qualified SEZ “investors” and that carry out qualifying “economic productive activities” in an SEZ. The tax benefits available in SEZs for qualifying integral administrators and investors includes, among others: • A 100% reduction of the normal corporate income tax rate for the first 10 fiscal years, and a 50% reduction for the following five fiscal years, subject to certain requirements (except for the Progreso SEZ, which offers accelerated depreciation); • A tax credit equal to 50% of the employer's contribution for illness and maternity insurance for the first 10 fiscal years, reducing to 25% for the following five fiscal years. More information about SEZs is available here: https://www.taxathand.com/article/8935/Mexico/2017/Two-more-SEZs- launched Russia No specific developments. Spain From a corporate tax standpoint, article 37 of the Spanish Corporate Income Tax Act (“CIT”) provides for a tax deduction for employing individuals under 30 years of age. At a national and local level, government subsidies are provided for qualifying training programs. United Kingdom The UK has introduced an Apprenticeship Levy of 0.5% on payroll costs to finance new apprenticeships. At the autumn Budget 2017, a new tax relief for self-funded work related training costs was announced (employer costs are deductible and not a taxable benefit), with consultation currently being undertaken: https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/taxation-of- self-funded-work-related-training Summary There is a trend towards implementing tax rules which encourage employers to grow the workforce and also enhance the skills of their employees. Employment is critical for New Zealand’s growth, but it is also important that employees are productive in their work and there is matching between the skills and strengths of employees and the work they are engaged in. An employee using his or her strengths are more likely to be productive and happy in their work. New Zealand should monitor the approach being taken in the United Kingdom of looking at how the tax system can support those needing to upskill and retrain, particularly for those who want or need to change career. Tax Working Group | The sharing economy 13 The sharing economy Thinking smarter and utilizing assets and workers is what the sharing economy is about. But have tax systems adapted to ensure these new business models are taxed? We posed the following question: The sharing economy generally refers to people using online platforms to share assets such as their house or car with third parties (think Air BNB, Uber). Is your country doing anything to change the tax rules to ensure these transactions are taxed? All responses are general in nature and should not be relied on without further detailed advice. Argentina Argentina has taken the step of prohibiting Uber, however this has not been successful and Uber still operates. Credit card companies were also mandated not to collect money on behalf of Uber. These moves do not appear to be tax driven. Australia The Australian Taxation Office has engaged in some high profile litigation in respect of the requirement for ridesharing to be registered for GST where it is below the GST threshold of $75,000 (on the basis it is a taxi-service) https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?LocID=%22JUD%2F2017ATC2 0-608%22&PiT=99991231235958 Australia has been proactive at considering taxes and the sharing economy, including holding targeting educations campaigns, such the following three examples related to the sharing economy generally, holiday homes and ride sharing: https://www.ato.gov.au/General/The-sharing-economy-and-tax/ https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Property/In-detail/Holiday-homes/ https://www.ato.gov.au/general/ride-sourcing-and-tax/ The guidance on ride sharing communicates that the Australian Tax Office undertakes data matching in order to ensure drivers are complying with tax obligations. The Black Economy Taskforce has also acknowledged in its interim report that the sharing economy incentivises participation in the black economy https://consult.treasury.gov.au/tax-framework-division/black-economy- taskforce/supporting\_documents/BE\_IR.pdf Brazil There have been discussions on how to adapt the current legislation to the new sharing economy, but nothing concrete has been issued at this point. Tax Working Group | The sharing economy 14 Canada The province of Quebec, in its most recent budget, expanded its VAT regime to include non-residents supplying the digital economy. The federal government has recently announced that it is commencing a study to determine whether changes are required. Domestically, the Canadian tax regime encompasses transactions such as Airbnb, Uber, via worldwide taxation and self-reporting requirements. However, no new compliance measures have been introduced. China The government is studying the relevant issues of the sharing economy. However, there have not yet been any announcements of plans to change the existing tax rules. France As from 2019, collaborative platforms will have to transmit the income realised by their users through their platform to allow the tax administration to pre-fill the tax declarations. In addition, a bill will be examined by the Parliament in June. If the bill passes as it is drafted, the platforms will also have to transmit information to their users concerning their tax obligations and a document mentioning the relevant elements to enable them to fill their declaration. Germany Germany is part of the EU's initiative to tax the digital economy. See the following Tax Alert article for more information: https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dtt l-tax-alert-european-union-23-march-2018.pdf Germany has not yet implemented any specific measures relating to the sharing economy. Hungary A proposal has recently been submitted to make online cash registers mandatory at the place of all accommodation services. These registers are hooked to the central data system of the tax authority. Uber was banned in Hungary based on unethical (tax) advantage. Israel At this point there are no tax rules that ensure these transactions are taxed, but this is a current issue under consideration and the tax authorities have stated an intention to publish a position on the sharing economy. Italy There is a specific 21% flat tax on rental fees (colloquially known as the Italian Airbnb tax). This is an optional flat tax on short-term rental (less than 30 days) income. The tax applies to the gross rental income with no deductions available. The 21% rate compares with progressive tax rates ranging from 23% to 43%. Tax Working Group | The sharing economy 15 Japan From an indirect tax perspective, Japan has introduced digital service rules requiring foreign enterprises that provide digital services to Japanese customers to collect and remit Japanese Consumption Tax. Luxembourg There are no current specific rules in Luxembourg. It is noted that there is an EU proposal to tax the digital economy. Mexico In Mexico, there is an electronic tax obligation that, among others, establish the obligation to issue electronic invoices, which are shared with the Mexican tax authorities. Additionally, Mexican banks have the obligation to inform tax authorities when there is cash deposit that exceed a specific threshold. Russia No specific developments. Spain The Spanish Revenue Agency has recently expressed not only concerns, but also action plans to ensure appropriate tax is being collected from online platforms related to the "sharing economy." This comprises both Airbnb, Uber, and online marketplaces (Wallapop, similar to Ebay in the United States). This is being addressed from both a direct tax and indirect tax perspective. The Spanish Revenue Agency has publicly announced its intention to pay particular attention to these businesses and to conduct appropriate tax audit proceedings. United Kingdom The United Kingdom has not yet implemented new laws specific to the sharing economy. Steps are being taken to ensure that platforms selling goods of others share responsibility for collection of VAT. For more information see the following consultation paper regarding a possible options for a split payment mechanism (whereby payment merchants could be required to withhold and remit VAT to HMRC on a real time basis): https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/alternative-method-of-vat- collection-split-payment Summary The sharing economy does not necessarily require special tax rules but it is important that revenue authorities educate taxpayers about tax obligations, particularly to the extent its participants are individuals who have had limited interaction with the tax system due to New Zealand’s approach of not having compulsory personal tax returns. The digital nature of the sharing economy presents facilitates data collection and matching and this is necessary to ensure the sharing economy does not contribute to an increase in the hidden economy. Tax Working Group | Information is everything 16 Information is everything If you can’t collect tax at source, the next best thing is information. Information gives the revenue authority the power to raise assessments and query return positions. We posed the following question: Information is everything and we're starting to get the computer power to process a lot of information and to undertake data matching. Does your country collect a lot of data on a regular basis and use it to verify/audit tax positions? For example, submitting invoices with VAT/GST returns. All responses are general in nature and should not be relied on without further detailed advice. Argentina There are more than 100 information collecting regimes for tax purposes. For example, credit cards, schools, banks, even neighborhoods must report how much money individuals spend. Electronic invoicing is mandatory on most transactions, and any expense higher than USD50 must register who is the buyer to track expenditure. Australia Australia has a legislated system of third party reporting to enable data collection in a uniform and prescribed manner. This includes collection in respect of:  Interest and dividends  Employment income  Government payments  Capital gains tax from the disposal of shares and property  Employment-related foreign source income  Taxable government grants and payments  Payments made to contactors in the building and construction industry, cleaning and courier services  Distributions from partnerships, trusts and managed funds. For more information see the following link from the ATO: https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Building-confidence/In-detail/Data- matching/?anchor=Legislateddatacollection#Legislateddatacollection Further data collection is undertaken as one-off requests for information, largely around compliance risks. The ATO routinely uses data analytics to assess compliance risks, and to conduct taxpayer reviews. Tax Working Group | Information is everything 17 Brazil Brazilian corporate taxpayers operating in Brazil are required to comply with the Public Digital Bookkeeping System (Sistema Público de Escrituração Digital, SPED), which is replacing paper bookkeeping. The SPED is a new complex and sophisticated data requirement in which taxpayers should file on an annual or monthly basis (and not just in case of audit) all account and tax information available based on standard uniform electronic layout. Canada This type of data is not collected on a regular basis but it may be requested upon audit. China Chinese tax authorities have made efforts to establish information exchange mechanisms with other government departments to regularly collect income-related information for internal matching/audit purposes. China's State Administration of Taxation has launched a program to identify and request certain large businesses to regularly provide their relevant tax and financial information. China has established a nationwide electronic system and all domestic VAT invoices must be issued through the system. France The French Tax Authority is using data mining to verify and audit tax positions for individuals as well as for companies; for example, a lot of transfer pricing information is transmitted. For individuals, most of the information is focused on their accounts. Banks also have important reporting obligations in this area. Germany Data collection by the tax authorities is an important topic in today's environment. Tax auditors generally want to have access to the company's Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in order to analyse the company's data. For VAT purposes data analytics has been a common theme for a while. When filing the annual tax returns an electronic balance sheet needs to be submitted so that the tax authorities can verify the data in case of a tax audit. Hungary The use of online cash registers is mandatory to perform certain activities. These cash registers prevent the erasure of items post sale and provide the tax authority with information on a daily basis. As of 1 July 2018 real-time data exchange on transactions, where the invoice includes more than approximately €320 of VAT will become compulsory. Hungary is also taking part in the EU’s Intrastat data collection. Intrastat requires companies to send monthly statistical declarations to national authorities in a close link with the tax system. In addition, taxpayers are required to file EC Sales List reports when trading with other EU Countries. More details about Intrastat are available here: https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/be/Documents/tax/dttl- tax-intrastat-guide-2017.pdf Israel The Israel Tax Authority regularly collects large amounts of data and uses it to verify and audit tax positions. Tax Working Group | Information is everything 18 Italy A lot of information is collected electronically in Italy. For VAT purposes there is a requirement on certain businesses to issue electronic invoices, for example supplies made to public bodies (B2G transactions) must have an electronic invoice issued before payment can be made. An annual VAT return summarizing transactions undertaken in the previous year must be filed. Japan The authorities collect information returns regarding payments subject to withholding tax paid by a company so that they can match with the recipient to ensure they are reporting such payments as income. Luxembourg The filing is more and more under the format of e-filing. Also data is required and exchangeable on the basis of the different exchanges of information in place (exchange of information on request, automatic exchange of information, and spontaneous exchange of information). Mexico The Mexican Tax Authority has a standardized trial balance and taxpayers must upload standardized trial balances on a monthly basis. All Mexican taxpayers must issue invoices electronically in a format established by the Mexican Tax Authority, this is known as “CFDI” (its acronym in Spanish). From 1 January 2018 there is a new 3.3 version of CFDI. These obligations provide the Mexican Tax Authority with a lot of information to verify tax positions and to undertake data matching. Russia Russia is not doing anything special in this area. The tax authorities have a right to request any information they may need to verify the tax position. Spain The Spanish Revenue Agency has a very powerful technology reach and practically all taxpayers must mandatorily file their returns and communicate with the Spanish Revenue Agency electronically. Extensive resources have been invested towards creating a strong information technology system to conduct data matching which often results in tax assessments / audits. From an indirect tax perspective, as of almost a year ago, VAT information is being submitted for qualifying taxpayers practically on a real-time basis as per Suministro Inmediato de Información (SII) system, which is conducted entirely online and provides the Spanish Revenue Agency with various sources of VAT data to reduce tax evasion. United Kingdom The UK requires iXBRL tagged accounts and tax computations for companies. It does not require any transaction data. The government is consulting on requiring digital record keeping and return submission for VAT, which is due to be introduced in April 2019. It may require the same for self-employed and landlords but not before April 2020. This project is called “Making Tax Digital” and more information is available here: https://www.taxathand.com/article/7510/United- Kingdom/2017/Consultation-published-on-making-tax-digital “For VAT purposes data analytics has been a common theme for a while.” Tax Working Group | Information is everything 19 Summary Data collection is becoming an important tool to ensure tax compliance in a cost effective way for tax authorities. It will be important to seriously consider compliance costs for taxpayers before pursuing a regime where large amounts of data are routinely collected. If additional information reporting is required, then on the basis that any enhanced information reporting increases tax compliance (and so tax revenues), consideration could be given to compensating entities which are required to report additional information. Tax Working Group | The company tax rate 20 The company tax rate The headline tax rate can have a significant impact on the allure of a country for international investors. If New Zealand’s company tax rate stays at 28% what sort of competition will we be facing? We posed the following question: A number of countries have dropped company tax rates recently. Is your country actively considering a company tax rate reduction? Is your country planning to keep the company tax rate the same but change effective tax rates in other ways (e.g. through enhanced deductions)? All responses are general in nature and should not be relied on without further detailed advice. Argentina - The company tax rate in Argentina is 30% The company tax rate has just been reduced to 30% this year and will be further reduced to 25% in 2020. Australia - The company tax rate in Australia is 30% Australia aims to reduce the large company corporate tax rate from 30% to 25% over 10 years. The government has already legislated a company tax rate cut for small business up to AU$50million turnover. For more information see the following link from the ATO: https://www.ato.gov.au/rates/company-tax/ https://www.ato.gov.au/Rates/Changes-to-company-tax- rates/?page=1#Base\_rate\_entity\_company\_tax\_rate In addition to dropping the company tax rate, certain tax incentives exist. For example there is a $20,000 instant asset write off available up to 30 June 2018. For more information see the following link from the ATO: https://www.ato.gov.au/newsroom/smallbusiness/lodging-and- paying/$20,000-instant-asset-write-off/ The National Science and Innovation agenda includes some tax initiatives including Research & Development Tax Credits: https://www.innovation.gov.au/ Brazil – The company tax rate is 15% but various surtaxes provide an effective tax rate of 34% The Brazilian government is considering a corporate income tax rate reduction but nothing concrete been enacted as yet. Tax Working Group | The company tax rate 21 Canada - The federal company tax rate in Canada is 15%. Provisional general corporate income tax rates range from 11.5% to 16% There is no planned reduction to the general federal corporate tax rate. However, the federal government has announced a review of the impact of US tax reform on Canada. The federal government and certain provinces have recently reduced the tax rate on small corporations. China - The company tax rate in China is 25% Qualifying small businesses may enjoy a tax rate reduction so that the effective corporate income tax rate is only 10%. China plans to significantly expand the scope of small businesses eligible for this incentive. France - The company tax rate in France is 28% for the first €500,000 taxable profit and 33.33% thereafter The French Parliament just voted for a corporate income tax reduction. The corporate income tax rate will gradually be reduced to 25% by 2022 over a four-year period (2018-2022). More information is available here: https://www.taxathand.com/article/8954/France/2017/Parliament-adopts- second-amended-finance-bill-for-2017-and-finance-bill-for-2018 Germany - The company tax rate in Germany is approximately 30%. This is made up of a base rate of 15%, a solidarity surcharge and a variable local trade tax Germany is currently not considering a tax rate reduction or changing effective tax rates in other ways. Hungary - The company tax rate in Hungary is 9% Hungary already has a rather low corporate income tax rate of 9%. Israel - The company tax rate in Israel is 23% Since 2015, the corporate tax rate has been reduced (2015: 26.5%, 2016: 25%, 2017: 24%, 2018: 23%) and they will be reduced further in the future. In addition at the beginning of 2017, there was an amendment to the Israeli encouragement law, which introduces a new route of tax benefits that in case a company will meet some terms the corporate tax rate applying to that company can be reduced to 7.5%. Some examples where reduced corporate tax rates will apply are set out in this guidance: https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/cn/Documents/internation al-business-support/deloitte-cn-ibs-israel-int-tax-en-2017.pdf Italy – The company tax rate is 24% In Italy the company tax rate was reduced from 27.5% to 24% from 1 January 2017. There is an addition 3.5% surcharge on financial institutions. There are also accelerated depreciation deductions available for investments in tangible assets and R&D incentives which reduce the effective tax rate further. Japan - The effective company tax rate in Japan ranges between 30%-34% depending on the size of the company. Over the past few years Japan has dropped its effective tax rate to about 30%. There are no known plans for further reductions. Tax Working Group | The company tax rate 22 Luxembourg - The company tax rate in Luxembourg is approximately 26%. This is made up of a base rate of 18%, a surcharge for the employment fund and a variable local trade tax There was a main tax reform with a reduction of corporate tax rate over the last two years (from 29.22% to 26.01% for entities located in Luxembourg City). See the following article for more information: https://www2.deloitte.com/lu/en/pages/tax/articles/tax-reform-2017.html Mexico - The company tax rate in Mexico is 30% The Mexican income tax rate applicable to entities is 30%. There is no current expectation of a rate reduction or enhanced deductions. Russia - The company tax rate in Russia is 20% A corporate tax rate of 20% has been in place in Russia for many years and there are no expectations that the rate will change in near future. Spain - The company tax rate in Spain is 25% Following an overhaul to taxing legislation, effective 1 January 2015, the corporate tax rate was reduced from 30% to 25%. As a compromise to the corporate tax reduction (which is not expected to be reduced any further) most historical deductions were eradicated. The current corporate tax deductions revolve around R&D, film/audiovisual/artistic productions, employment creation, and hiring of disabled individuals. The Spanish government is actively trying to increase tax revenue collection and in has for a period had a minimum corporate tax installment based on the accounting result (i.e. if tax due under the tax rules is lower, the minimum corporate tax installment must be paid). The corporate tax rate for installment payments was also increased for large-sized enterprises so that it better matches the effective tax rate borne in the final balancing payment. United Kingdom - The company tax rate in the United Kingdom is 19% The UK has a 19% corporate tax rate and has legislated for a 17% from April 2020. It offers an effective 10% rate on certain income from patents. It offers enhanced deductions for enhanced R&D costs and for qualifying creative industries costs e.g. films, animation etc. No new incentives have been announced in the last 2 years. Summary Tax rates involve a series of trade-offs between taxing mobile and immobile capital and labour. It is clear that many other countries have and are considering a reduction in company tax rates. Some of this is likely to have been driven by a need for competitiveness and in part be a reaction to other countries. In addition, it may also be an acknowledgment that company taxes can be more harmful to economic growth than other forms of tax. Tax Working Group | What else can be taxed? 23 What else can be taxed? We tax a broad range of things in different ways, but are there other things which could also be taxed? We posed the following question: Income taxes, capital gains tax, employment taxes, consumption taxes (VAT/GST) are all fairly common. Does your country tax other things? (e.g., environmental taxes) Is your country considering any new types of taxes? All responses are general in nature and should not be relied on without further detailed advice. Argentina Argentina has a number of taxes: VAT and GST; a tax on minimum presumed income (however this has been repealed from 2019); a 1% stamp tax on written agreements; personal assets tax, which is a tax on the net wealth of individuals each year; tax on use of bank accounts. In addition to taxes there are numerous withholding systems which accelerate collection and increase the administrative burden on taxpayers. Australia Australia has a comprehensive capital gains tax regime, and goods and services tax. At the state level, there are a number of taxes imposed including payroll tax, land tax and stamp duty on a transfer of real property. Recently, Australia has introduced a Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL) for taxing permanent establishment avoidance and a Diverted Profits Tax (DPT). More information is available here: https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/International-tax-for-business/In- detail/Doing-business-in-Australia/Combating-multinational-tax-avoidance-- -a-targeted-anti-avoidance-law/ and here: https://www.ato.gov.au/general/new-legislation/in-detail/direct- taxes/income-tax-for-businesses/diverted-profits-tax/ Brazil Apart from the several layers of VAT (Federal, State and Municipal), Brazil imposes Excise Tax, Import Duty, Financial transactions tax, property tax, transfer tax, capital gain tax (resident and non-resident), inheritance state tax, income tax (corporate and individual), social security, taxes on specific cross border payments (technical services and royalties), withholding taxes, amongst others. Brazil has also initiated discussions on the indirect taxation of the digital economy on a State and Municipal level. Brazil is not currently considering any new taxes. Tax Working Group | What else can be taxed? 24 Canada Canada has indicated a commitment to some form of carbon tax to be implemented by the provinces/territories as they determine. Some jurisdictions have already introduced measures. Canada has indicated that it will review the taxation of the digital economy. China China has Resource Tax (which is imposed on various mineral resources) and Environment Protection Tax (which is imposed on taxable pollutants). The Environment Protection Tax started to be collected from 1 January 2018; noting this tax was previously collected as a fee charged by government authorities. More information is available here: https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/cn/Documents/tax/tax- newsflash/deloitte-cn-tax-newsflash-bilingual-161229.pdf France France has created many other taxes, such as environmental taxes. In addition, France is one of the country’s leading the discussion which are taking place at the EU level to tax digital services. Germany Germany has a variety of other taxes like e.g. real estate transfer tax, real estate tax and other consumption and indirect taxes. Germany is currently not considering any new types of taxes. Hungary Hungary has special taxes for the energy sector, financial institutions, telecommunications, utility pipes and insurance companies. It cannot be excluded that more special taxes will be proposed in the future. Israel No new tax types are currently being considered. Italy Italy imposes real estate tax (a levy of 0.76% on immovable property); transfer taxes on all transactions involving real property; a stamp duty of €2 on any invoices zero-rated for VAT purposes that exceed €77.47; a “Tobin Tax” applies in the form of a stamp duty on transfers of shares and other financial instruments issued by Italian companies (the rate is 0.2% of the transaction value, reduced to 0.1% where the sale takes place on a listed market). Japan Japan has a number of other taxes, for example:  Depreciable asset tax - tax imposed on value of depreciable assets  Real estate registration tax - tax imposed on value of real estate when transferred  Stamp duty  Business premise tax - imposed on amount of office space used More details of these taxes are available here: https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dtt l-tax-japanguide-2017.pdf?nc=1 Tax Working Group | What else can be taxed? 25 Luxembourg To increase the level of building sales there is a temporary lower tax rate. More information is available here: https://www2.deloitte.com/lu/en/pages/tax/articles/tax-reform-2017.html Mexico No new tax types are currently being considered. Russia An ecological levy has recently been introduced. It is payable by virtually all manufacturers and importers in Russia. Spain There are so-called "green taxes" in Spain and corporations engaged in the hydrocarbon industry suffer a higher tax rate and reduced benefits. A "sugar tax" for the beverage industry has also been the subject of debate in congress. United Kingdom The UK has recently introduced a soft drinks industry levy and is considering a tax on single use plastics. It has various environmental taxes and an air passenger duty. Details of yield from taxes can be obtained from the Office of Budgetary Responsibility analysis; with the soft drinks industry levy collecting less than half the amount forecast (refer page 213): http://cdn.obr.uk/EFO-MaRch\_2018.pdf Summary While there are a wide range of different taxes around the world, what is not known from the information above is the level of efficiency and effectiveness of these taxes. Taxes are about raising revenue required for Governments; our tax system should therefore favour taxes which are the most effective and efficient. Any new taxes would add compliance costs which need to be considered in assessing the merits of such. Tax Working Group | Influencing behaviour 26 Influencing behaviour The tax system has the ability to operate as a carrot or a stick. In general New Zealand has sought to avoid picking winners and losers. We posed the following question: Tobacco taxes and alcohol excise tax are fairly common. Some believe there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally aim to modify behaviour. Does your country impose taxes on "bad" things? (For example sugar, plastic bags) Does your country do anything in the tax system to incentivise "good" things? (For example exempting healthy food from VAT/GST tax) If so, is there any evidence this is effective? All responses are general in nature and should not be relied on without further detailed advice. Argentina Argentina imposes excise taxes on many items, including alcoholic beverages, sodas, expensive cars, etc. There was a plan to reduce excise tax on sodas depending on the level of sugar, but this was ultimately not implemented, but may still occur. Sodas with natural juice pay less tax. Australia Australia levies excise taxes on items such as alcohol and tobacco, fuel and petroleum products. https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Excise-and-excise-equivalent-goods/ Australia has resisted calls for taxes on sugar and plastic bags. The current GST system exempts many items e.g. unprocessed foods, education, health etc. See the following page from the ATO: https://www.ato.gov.au/business/gst/when-to-charge-gst-(and-when-not- to)/gst-free-sales/#MainGSTfreeproductsandservices Brazil Brazil levies excise taxes. These taxes are higher on certain products such as guns and tobacco. Canada Canada regularly increases tax rates on tobacco and is planning a tax regime for recreational cannabis once legal in July 2018. Tax Working Group | Influencing behaviour 27 China China has a "Consumption Tax" (which is somewhat like other countries' excise tax). The Consumption Tax is imposed on certain luxury goods (e.g. luxury watches, luxury cosmetics, golf balls and accessories, etc.) and energy-consumptive/highly pollutant or resource-incentive goods (e.g. certain cells/batteries, coatings, etc.). More information is available here: https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dtt l-tax-chinaguide-2017.pdf?nc=1 China has some VAT and income tax incentives to encourage renewable energy (e.g. wind power) and waste recycling (e.g. reclaimed water, construction materials made from solid wastes). France The most relevant are the taxes on sodas, applicable since 2013. A new scale will enter into force as from July 2018. The current rate of tax for beverages with added sugar is €7.5 a hectolitre. This will soon start at 1g sugar/100ml; rising to €20 a hectolitre for drinks with more than 11g/100ml. France has also banned free refills of fizzy drinks in restaurants. Germany Germany imposes consumption taxes on a lot of "bad" things, for example alcohol, tobacco, gas, air travel, etc. Certain items like medical products and certain types of food benefit from a reduced 7% VAT rate instead of the general 19% VAT rate. Most of these incentives however were introduced to generate revenue and not so much to influence the consumption behavior of the population. Whether the introduction of such measures is effective and creates a significant effect on the consumption behavior is heavily discussed amongst tax practitioners and scholars. We are not aware of any evidence for the success of any such measures in Germany. Hungary Excise taxes are levied on alcoholic products, tobacco, fuel and products containing sugar. In addition, environmental taxes are levied on the manufacture of certain products (e.g. batteries). A reduced VAT rate is applied on certain meats, such as chicken or fish. Israel There are very high taxes on items such as cigarettes. Italy No such taxes have been imposed. Japan Japan has a liquor, tobacco and gasoline tax. Luxembourg For "good" things, there are some incentives in connection with green mobility (electric car, electric bikes etc). “Whether the introduction of such measures is effective and creates a significant effect on the consumption behavior is heavily discussed amongst tax practitioners and scholars. We are not aware of any evidence for the success of any such measures in Germany.” Tax Working Group | Influencing behaviour 28 Mexico Regarding incentives, there is a special limit for the deduction of hybrids cars as well as for assets uses in the generation of renewable energy. A 0% VAT rate applies to products to be use as food (exceptions apply), books and medicines. Russia In Russia there are regular excise taxes and VAT. Lower VAT can apply to certain categories of goods (such as certain food and groceries). Spain There are currently more taxes on "bad" things than on promoting or incentivizing "good" things. United Kingdom The UK has introduced taxes on sugary drinks and consultation on single use plastics. Wales is considering a vacant homes levy. There is 100% tax relief on certain environmental equipment and lower tax rates on electric and low emission cars. Summary Whether the tax system is best way to influence behavior may depend on the particular behavior in question. In many instances other approaches, such as education, are likely to be a better option and lead to more successful outcomes rather than applying the tax “stick”. Tax Working Group | Housing 29 Housing Housing is a complex problem, is tax an easy solution to solve the problem? We posed the following question: There is a concern that there is a housing shortage in New Zealand and this is influencing housing affordability. There are many ways to attack this problem but it is unclear whether the tax system should be used to address this shortage. Does your tax system do anything to incentivise the increase in the supply of housing? Does your tax system do anything to disincentivise investment in housing? All responses are general in nature and should not be relied on without further detailed advice. Argentina Employees are only permitted to claim a limited number of deductible expenses, one of them is the interest paid on mortgages. Australia The Australian Federal Government announced about 10 initiatives to promote housing affordability in 2017-18. See the following fact sheets: http://budget.gov.au/2017-18/content/glossies/factsheets.htm Brazil There are no specific initiatives. Canada The province of British Columbia has introduced a levy on unoccupied homes with a view towards making more residential spaces available. China The current policy objectives of the government for real estate sector are to cool off the market and control the ever rising high price of residential property so that the middle-/low-income group of people can afford their housing. Therefore, most tax incentives in the real estate sector are granted to the supply of middle-/low-end housing which are designated to be provided to the middle-/low-income group, e.g. exemptions from stamp duty, urban land use tax, etc. Supply of high-end housing may face less favourable tax treatment, e.g. higher profit rate when tax authorities assessed the taxable profit. The government is also considering the expansion of the scope of real estate tax to include certain residential properties. Tax Working Group | Housing 30 France France has chosen to put into place a tax on vacant units. Some tax incentives favour rental investment. As from 2018, the French government has been willing to incentive financial investment rather than investment in housing by refocusing the wealth tax only on real estate. Germany The German tax system does not incentivize the increase in the supply of housing. The last tax incentive for supporting housing was abandoned back in 1995. There are certain non-tax incentives for the supply of housing, the current government is planning to introduce an incentive for families with children in the form of a cash payment. There are no specific tax measures that disincentivise housing. Hungary Hungary levies a reduced 5% VAT on certain building constructions and offers allowances from real estate duties for first-time real estate owners and on certain new apartments. Savings accounts dedicated for real estate ownership are supported with supplemental credits. In addition, the “CSOK” aid grants up to approximately €32,000 for the creation of family homes (exact amount is based on the number of children in the family). Extraordinarily favourable loan opportunities are also part of the CSOK package. Israel Israel, especially across Tel-Aviv, has a problem with a lack of housing. Consequently housing is very expensive and difficult to purchase. In light of the housing shortage in 2017, the tax authorities issued a rule which states that there will be tax on each person that has more than 2.5 apartments. Italy There is no housing shortage in Italy. Despite this there are many incentives to purchase and restore homes. Japan Japan allows a deduction for interest on a mortgage. Luxembourg To increase the level of building sales, there is a temporary lower tax rate and other initiatives such as a 50% tax exemption for rental income derived from qualifying social dwellings. See the following article for more information: https://www2.deloitte.com/lu/en/pages/tax/articles/tax- reform-2017.html Mexico There is a personal deduction available for all individuals for mortgage interest payments when mortgage credit is up to approximately US$243,000. Note, all personal deduction are limited to the lower of 15% of the total income, or the equivalent to approximately US$7,900. Additionally, Mexico has a tax exemption for individuals on the sale of a primary residence. Russia Russia has a tax exemption for individuals on the sale of primary residence after 5 years of ownership. Tax Working Group | Housing 31 Spain There are incentives from an individual tax perspective as there are tax benefits related to one's primary home. On the other hand, ownership of a second home which is kept for one's sole enjoyment (i.e. it is not rented) is subject to a certain degree of additional taxation. United Kingdom The UK has introduced several measures to make it more costly to be a buy-to-let landlord. These include a 3% supplement on purchasing property and a limit on the deductible of finance costs (so they are deducted at the 20% basic rate and not the landlord's marginal rate, which could be 40% or 45%). Summary It is clear that New Zealand is not unique in having issues associated with housing. The range of examples expressed above indicate there are a number of ways to tackle the problem. Tax Working Group | Retirement savings 32 Retirement savings With an aging and expanding population that is also living longer, the youth of today can expect a very different world when they come to retire. Universal superannuation may be a thing of the past in 2058, so should there be incentives now to save for the future? We posed the following question: More people are reaching retirement age, we're expecting more "baby boomers" to start retiring. Is your country doing anything to incentive savings? All responses are general in nature and should not be relied on without further detailed advice. Argentina Certain financial products are exempt from tax. Australia Whilst Australia does not have specific savings incentives, the tax incentives within the superannuation system are attractive to savers. Australia has both a compulsory and voluntary superannuation savings. The compulsory regime is the superannuation guarantee scheme which requires employers to contribute superannuation contributions of 9.5% of an employee’s ordinary-time earnings to superannuation (this will eventually increase to 12% in financial year 2025-2026). Employees can also make contributions either as salary sacrificed (before tax) or after tax contributions subject to a capping system. More information on the taxation settings of the Australian superannuation system can be found on page 3 of this Budget 2016 fact sheet: http://www.budget.gov.au/2016- 17/content/glossies/tax\_super/downloads/FS-Super/01-SFS- budget\_narrative-161109.pdf The Re:think Tax Discussion Paper (March 2015) also provide a full summary of the taxation of savings in Australia (pages 57-72): http://bettertax.gov.au/files/2015/03/TWP\_combined-online.pdf In addition Australia operates under a dividend imputation system which imputes a credit for tax paid at a company level to the shareholder. This provides an incentive for Australian residents to invest in Australia companies. Tax Working Group | Retirement savings 33 Brazil Specific retirement funds benefit from a withholding tax exemption. Canada Canada has a registered retirement savings plan regime which provides a tax deduction for contributions and tax deferred growth accumulation. As well, a tax-free saving account has been introduced to further encourage savings. There are limitations on contribution amounts to both. China China has been encouraging employing companies to set up annuities for employees by providing an income tax deferral treatment, i.e. the income tax will not arise until the withdrawal. China recently launched a pilot programme to provide income tax deferral treatment to individuals who purchase qualifying commercial pension insurance products. France France have some measures to orientate savings to certain types of investments helping the financing of specific companies or sectors. Germany There are specific retirement plans that are tax subsidized. Payments out of the general old age insurance are generally taxable whereas contributions into the old age insurance system are tax deductible. Hungary Hungary have quite limited incentives. Voluntary contributions in pension funds are supplemented with another 20% of the in-payment as a tax allowance. Israel In 2017 the Social Security started to save 50ILS (US$14) monthly for each child aged under 18. Italy Italy has always implemented a favourable tax regime for savings. For example there are generally no capital taxes and there are favourable tax rates for interest. Japan Japan introduced NISA (National Individual Savings Account) which can accumulate earnings tax free (subject to limitations). Luxembourg There are dedicated tax regimes for optional retirement regimes with tax deductions. Mexico Until the mid-1990s, the country had a traditional defined-benefits pension system, which was administered by the government. However, this system was modified in 1997 and since then each worker have their own pension account. Pensions are no longer administered by the Mexican Social Security Institute, and have been passed into the hands of administradoras de fondos para el retiro (AFORES), or retirement funds administrators, which opened the way for private participation in the segment. Tax Working Group | Retirement savings 34 It is important to mention that this pension funds are funded through contributions made by the employee, employer and government. Under Mexican income tax law, personal pension account contributions are available to be claimed as a taxable deduction for the individual subject to certain requirements and limits. Russia There are no specific initiatives. Spain Tax incentives for savings are small and one could say they do not have a real impact on large figures. The Social Security system needs to find new ways of funding, but real decisions have yet to be reached. More could probably done. United Kingdom The UK has Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) which allow an individual to save £20,000 annually in a tax-exempt environment. There are Lifetime ISAs and Help to Buy ISAs which offer additional incentives to save (supplements paid in by the government). An individual's main residence is exempt from capital gains tax. Pension saving follows the EET model, with limits on the amount that can be saved. The UK introduced auto-enrolment for pensions, where all employers have to enroll employees in a pension with a minimum employer and employee contribution. Employees may opt out but few do; the numbers saving has increased significantly. The minimum contributions are due to rise and naturally there is concern that more employees could opt out. “More could probably be done.” Summary The taxed-taxed-exempt (TTE) approach in New Zealand differs from many other countries and there is merit in exploring how New Zealand could reduce taxes on savings so as to grow the domestic supply of capital. Tax Working Group | Other examples 35 Other examples The catch-all. Is there anything else unusual out there in the tax world that New Zealand could consider? We posed the following question: Are there particular tax issues / challenges your country is facing? Has your country done (or considering) anything unique or novel with its tax rules? All responses are general in nature and should not be relied on without further detailed advice. Argentina The level of non-declared sales is very high, mainly by small companies and shops. It was recently made mandatory to accept debit cards, which helps tracking sales. Electronic invoicing is also expected to increase tracking to reduce non declared sales. Australia Due to the political make-up of the Senate, the Australian government is not tackling significant tax reform initiatives apart from multinational tax avoidance, housing affordability and risks in respect of the black economy. Brazil There are ongoing discussions of tax and social security reforms which are necessary to recover the economy of the country. In addition, there are current discussion on the creation of a unified VAT system to reduce complexity. Canada Canada offers R&D incentives. China No. France No. Germany The tax environment in German is relatively stable, the last change in tax rates and a major overhaul of the corporate tax system took place in 2008. There are currently no plans to do anything unique or novel in the area of Germany's tax rules. Germany is one of the few countries that does not offer any R&D tax incentives. Hungary No. Tax Working Group | Other examples 36 Israel No. Italy Web taxation has been introduced and should apply from 1 January 2019. This is a 3% tax on certain internet transactions (this was originally proposed to be 6%). The tax is levied on firms buying “intangible digital products” such as online advertising and sponsored linked embedded in webpages. There is a de minimis threshold of 3,000 transactions in a calendar year before the tax applies. More information on this tax is available here: http://newsletters.usdbriefs.com/2017/Tax/WTA/171215\_5.pdf Japan As a means to more effectively utilize tax authority resources, the tax authority introduced a tax governance program whereby companies, which show that they have good tax governance and are in communication with the tax authorities prior to large transactions, can be subject to less frequent tax audits. Luxembourg No. Mexico No. Russia Russia has "deoffshorization" laws in place incentivising Russian based activities and punishing "tax heaven" activities. Spain From an individual income tax perspective, a new Form 720 was introduced to report assets held abroad by Spanish tax residents (similar to the US's FBAR declaration). United Kingdom The UK has implemented a Diverted Profits tax. The UK is considering turnover tax on certain digital businesses, probably as part of an EU initiative. See the following link for more information: https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/corporate-tax-and-the- digital-economy-position-paper Summary Each system has its own nuances and tax policy changes will be made bearing in mind the challenges faced and the nuances of the particular system. What is interesting to observe is there is no indication of moves away from traditional sources of tax to “new” or “novel” methods of taxation.

The primary objective of tax policy is to provide revenue for the government to fund the provision of public goods and services, and redistribution. Oliver Wendell Holmes put it more succinctly: “Taxes are what we pay for civilized society”. 2. A good tax system is one where the tax due is actually collected. New Zealanders should not be able to avoid paying tax through evasion or avoidance arrangements. 3. Taxpayers’ costs of complying with the tax system and the government’s costs of administering the tax system should be kept to a minimum. 4. ‘Nāu te rourou, Nāku te rourou, ka ora ai te iwi’ ‘With your contribution and mine, the people will prosper’. . 5. GST is regressive in that lower-income households tend to pay a larger proportion of their income in GST. 6. Changes in technology, particularly with digital communications, are changing business practices and the way people earn income . We would like to address each of these statements in turn and in the course of doing so, address some alternatives. 1. If, as Oliver Wendell Holmes put it: “Taxes are what we pay for civilized society”, why is it that a significant portion of the taxes people pay are not directed to that goal. For example, approximately $4,500,000,000 every year (about what is spent on Police & Law and order) goes directly by way of interest payments into the profits of banks and financial institutions that the government borrows money from. Government borrowing could instead be accessed direct from the Reserve Bank at no interest (and possibly without the need for repayment) as is increasingly being done in Japan. That $4.5 billion could then actually be used “to fund the provision of public goods and services” – supposedly the primary objective of tax policy. An example of what might be is provided below. \[1\] We have a new coalition government, the major party in which used that very funding mechanism to build 40,000 houses in its first period in government under Prime Minister Michael Joseph Savage. As William Ball Sutch (New Zealand economist, historian, writer, public servant, public intellectual) put it following the passing of the Reserve Bank amendment Act 1936: “The Reserve Bank now has the power to underwrite Government loans, to extend long-term loans to the Government and to advance to the Government moneys on overdraft for the purchase and marketing of any New Zealand product. (From the Reserve Bank of New Zealand: Bulletin, Vol. 69, No. 3) The 1949 Ministry of Works report “State Housing in New Zealand” went further:- “The sums advanced by the Reserve Bank were not subscribed or underwritten by other financial institutions. This action showed the Governments intention to demonstrate that it was possible for the State to use the country’s credit in creating new assets for the country”. The implementation of that method of funding government borrowing would allow for either a reduction in taxes (especially for the lower paid) or the provision of more public goods and services. That approach is being recommended by an increasing number of international and local sources. Power of Printing Money By Bernard Hickey - NZ Herald - Sunday Feb 26, 2012 It's time the Reserve Bank of New Zealand started printing money and lending to our government to build houses and infrastructure, particularly in Christchurch. Right now our major trading partners are doing exactly this. We should at least be talking about it. Central banks throughout the Northern Hemisphere are doing similar things. The United States Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, the Peoples' Bank of China and the European Central Bank have printed a combined US$10 trillion ($12 trillion) in the past four years and spent it on all manner of bonds and cash injections into banking systems. This process, known as "quantitative easing", is often a last resort after interest rates have been cut to almost zero. Many argue it has been ineffective because the money went straight into the banking system and parked there, or was used to pump up the prices of various assets, including shares, gold and bonds. Lending this new money directly to governments to spend immediately on infrastructure, goods and services would have been a much wiser idea. China did this most effectively. Isn't it better for our Government to be borrowing from its own central bank than from foreign banks and pension funds? Wouldn't it be better employing the unemployed to build new houses and repair Christchurch's infrastructure than to just sit back and let it happen? Wouldn't it be better to print the money to fund the deficit than choose to sell public assets to do it? It would devalue our currency, but is that such a bad thing when we need to boost our exports? \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* From an International Monetary Fund report released in August 2012 titled “The Chicago Plan Revisited” “Allowing the Government to issue money directly at zero interest, rather than borrowing that same money from banks at interest, would lead to a reduction in the interest burden on government finances and to a dramatic reduction of (net) government debt, given that irredeemable government- issued money represents equity in the common wealth rather than debt.” Bernard Hickey is Managing Editor of Newsroom, former editor of interest.co.nz , and a commentator on economics. “What would cease to exist however is the proliferation of credit created, at the almost exclusive initiative of private institutions, for the sole purpose of creating an adequate money supply that can easily be created debt-free”. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* From Monetary Reform - A Better Monetary System for Iceland – a comprehensive 134 page report, commissioned by the Prime Minister of Iceland 2015. “...the Central Bank 0f Iceland \[Reserve Bank\] can create the money that is needed by the economy. When the CBI creates sovereign money the government can spend or invest it into circulation .” “By using a state created money supply, instead of effectively ‘renting’ the money supply from private banks, the overall level of debt in the economy will be reduced.” A significant reduction in tax could be achieved if the government progressively increased Reserve Bank funding, thereby leaving more money in people’s pockets to allow for greater investment in productive industry and greater economic activity. 2. “A good tax system is one where the tax due is actually collected”. “New Zealanders should not be able to avoid paying tax through evasion or avoidance arrangements”. The current tax system does not come anywhere near to achieving those objectives. Larger companies and wealthier individuals can afford to employ specialists to minimise, through a host of methods including trusts and overseas jurisdictions, the tax they pay. Those at the other end of the scale cannot. This applies also to GST where, as the background paper points out “there are concerns that New Zealand’s GST is regressive in that lower-income households tend to pay a larger proportion of their income in GST”. GST is also causing significant problems for small and medium sized businesses who are finding it increasingly difficult to compete with internet shopping from overseas even with the recent imposition of GST on such purchases. The tax system needs to be simplified by removing income tax, GST, and a host of other taxes and the introduction of a transactions tax on the movement of all money out of bank accounts. Both objectives would then be met as the withdrawal of money from a bank account would automatically trigger the deduction of the tax amount and remit it to the Inland Revenue department via bank software. 3. “Taxpayers’ costs of complying with the tax system and the government’s costs of administering the tax system should be kept to a minimum”. The introduction of a transactions tax on the movement of all money out of bank accounts would achieve both these objectives. The necessity of filing GST returns, PAYE returns, Fringe Benefit Tax returns and Income Tax returns etc would disappear, reducing the significant costs that currently accrue to businesses. The government’s costs of administering the tax system would also significantly reduce, with the need to check and reconcile returns, carry out audits, and install costly, complicated software being negated. 4. ‘Nāu te rourou, Nāku te rourou, ka ora ai te iwi’ ‘With your contribution and mine, the people will prosper’. Under the current system not all the people prosper, and a select group do not even make a contribution. Speculators in financial assets are exempt from GST. Their activities contribute little to the strength of industry and in fact remove much needed funds from investment in productive industry, technology, innovation and development of new ideas. Financial speculation should be brought into the tax net by way of the transaction tax detailed above. This would broaden the tax base and would potentially lead to lead to greater investment in the productive economy. The issue of some multinational corporations paying little or no tax anywhere in the world by way of exploiting inconsistencies and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules (known as BEPS) would be remedied, at least in New Zealand, by the introduction of a transactions tax which would force them to pay their share here. 5. GST is regressive in that lower-income households tend to pay a larger proportion of their income in GST. That is a statement of truth and needs little explanation. As noted above GST needs to be removed entirely and replaced with a transactions tax. A rate of approximately half a percent on financial transactions would bring in the equivalent of the current GST tax take. The effect on people on lower incomes would be significant as prices would come down, and they would be left with more disposable income. This would reduce the need for income top-ups through schemes like Working for Families and benefit payment increases. 6. Changes in technology, particularly with digital communications and artificial intelligence, are changing business practices and the way people earn income . This means the current level of 40% of tax revenue that comes from income tax is likely to significantly reduce due to lower labour force participation. An aging population will generate increased expenses, largely due to higher spending on healthcare and New Zealand Superannuation. The introduction of a transactions tax would allow tax on business profits to balance the reduction in income taxes. The increased costs could be funded from the source described in point one. Conclusion In a modern economic system (we currently have an outmoded one) the aim should be to reduce tax as much as possible to leave greater spending power in the hands of individuals. With that aim in mind the Tax Working Group should recommend:- - Progressive removal of as many taxes as possible, especially GST. - Introduction of a transactions tax on all bank account withdrawals. - Funding of increasing amounts of government expenditure through the Reserve Bank. - Reduction in the amount of credit creation undertaken by the private banks.

SUBMISSION TO THE TAX WORKING GROUP SUGAR TAX How our tax system can save lives, improve life quality, and shave millions off our national health costs Submission by 30 April 2018 2 Sir Michael Cullen, Chair of the Tax Working Group, Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 Dear Sir Michael, How the tax system can save lives, improve life quality, and shave millions off our national health costs Diabetes New Zealand is at the forefront of New Zealand’s greatest health issue, diabetes. The incidence of diabetes in New Zealanders is at epidemic proportions and rising. Diabetes is a chronic illness with significant morbidity and mortality burdens. Obesity is a primary factor leading to Type 2 diabetes. The 2017 OECD Obesity Index analysis that New Zealand has the third most obese population out of 35 member countries is both shameful and unacceptable. This is an indictment on our country and the poor health of our people. The OECD report represents an emphatic call to action. The Rt Hon Helen Clark has described the OECD’s finding as “shocking” and has vigorously implored that “whoever’s in government needs to implement strong policy to stop this epidemic now”. For decades, Diabetes New Zealand through its hard-working staff and volunteers has fought the war on diabetes across the whole country, deploying enormous resources to support and help countless thousands of people deal with their health problems and improve their lives. Raising awareness and prevention consumes a large part of the organisation’s resources. From all this involvement, effort and informed experience at New Zealand’s diabetes coal face, Diabetes New Zealand is ideally placed with this submission. The bottom line is that despite many governmental programmes to address the problem, the incidence of diabetes in New Zealand is increasing, as is the rate of obesity. Something much more is needed to stem this fatal tide. Diabetes New Zealand earnestly believes that this ‘something’ is a Sugar Tax. This submission carefully analyses the evidence and arguments surrounding the case for a Sugar Tax. We recommend this submission by Diabetes New Zealand to you, and its conclusion that a Sugar Tax will create a bow wave to behaviour change beyond any other governmental measure thus far. As Patrons of Diabetes New Zealand, we appeal to you to follow the example of other nations in deploying the levers of taxation to intervene in this runaway health epidemic. You have a unique opportunity to play a critical role in the health, well-being and longer lives of hundreds of thousands of current and future generation New Zealanders. \[1\] 3 Contents 1.

Fiscally positive dual effect of revenue raising and cost savings Appendix – About Diabetes New Zealand 4 1. Executive Summary The key essential messages within this submission by Diabetes New Zealand (DNZ) are: 1.1 New Zealand is an obese nation and this has a direct and significant correlation to the incidence of Type 2 diabetes, and all its chronic downstream illnesses. One in three New Zealanders are obese. This country ranks as the third most obese nation out of a 35 nation analysis by the OECD. As at 31 December 2016, a massive 217,000 New Zealanders had Type 2 diabetes. Ministry of Health estimates that a further 100,000 New Zealanders are ‘pre-diabetic’, or at risk of developing diabetes. This represents a staggering 6.74% of all New Zealanders, and with 40 people newly diagnosed with diabetes each and every day, this health crisis is escalating. This is why diabetes is a towering health problem for this country. 1.2 The flow-on health complications that arise from diabetes are serious, and fatal. Diabetes is a major contributor to many diseases, including: blindness; cardiovascular disease; kidney failure; nerve damage (neuropathies); ketoacidosis; and amputations. 1.3 Type 2 diabetes is largely preventable through lifestyle, diet and weight loss. Obesity is symptomatic with unhealthy diets and lack of exercise. 1.4 Today’s food shelves contain heightened levels of added sugar and fat, and this extends to many processed and convenience foods. The standout culprit of todays mass-marketed high sugar intake foods are sugary drinks, known as sugar sweetened beverages (“SSBs”). This is a global phenomenon. 1.5 Substantial evidence links the intake of sugar to increased body mass and chronic non-communicable diseases including heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, gout and fatty liver disease. The lack of nutritional value combined with their excess calorific content puts sugary drinks in the spotlight amongst a range of health damaging foods and drinks. This is exacerbated by sugary drinks being cheap, readily available and accessible with widely advertised content. 1.6 New Zealand consumes excess amounts of soft drink. Consistent with global analysis, this is prevalent amongst teenagers. In the UK and USA, sugary drinks (sugar sweetened beverages, or SSBs) are the top calorie source of sugar for 11 to 18-year-olds. 1.7 Scientific and nutritional studies overwhelmingly show causal links exist between sugar sweetened beverages and the prevalence of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. 1.8 MoH states that diabetes has high health costs because it is a long-term condition with the potential for severe complications. The Ministry calculates that the total direct health care costs for a person with diabetes are approximately three times those for people without diabetes. 5 The cost to our health system of treating diabetes and obesity related illnesses is enormous. A PwC report commissioned by DNZ modelled the total health costs of treating diabetes at service levels in 2008 could be $1.310 billion by 2016/17, with projections to blow out to $1.770 billion by 2021/22. These figures place the country’s health spend on Type 2 diabetes at some 8.1% of the total Crown Health budget spend for 2016/17. The costs of obesity are of similar proportions. Added to this is the economic cost of lost productivity. A NZIER review found that the impacts of obesity have a wider social cost (the impact of obesity on economic, social, cultural and environmental well-being) that are much greater than the health costs. 1.9 Given the sheer scale of New Zealand’s diabetes and obesity population, the increasing year-on-year numbers who develop these long-term conditions, and the massive health care and social and economic impact costs, the call for tougher governmental action has never been stronger, as has been urged by the Rt Hon. Helen Clark. 1.10 Government policies to combat obesity and Type 2 diabetes have to date varied from healthy food and better nutritional encouragement, to health sector offerings, to sports and greater activity incentives across national levels, and also targeted community groups. The distinctive feature of the above government led health programmes is the absence of any hard-hitting regulatory or legislative intervention or penalty impost such as a taxation. The policies touched on may be described as a faciliatory approach which seek to “influence” rather than “prescribe” a change in individual poor health behaviours. 1.11 However, we are still confronting a growing, rather than a reversing trend in population obesity and Type 2 diabetes which brings into question the overall effectiveness of education and information campaigns. This is reflected by Camilla Cavendish, author of Soft Drinks Industry Levy, as former head of policy under David Cameron who stated, “making things more expensive does change people’s behaviour in a way that I’m afraid all the leaflets we have all read over the years and all the newspaper articles fundamentally don’t”. 1.12 The ’sugar tax’ trending with other countries can’t be ignored. The UK / Ireland Sugar Tax provides a strong case example for New Zealand. Following many years of political resistance to introduce a sugar tax (with politicians claiming insufficient evidence existed around the effectiveness of a sugar tax), these governments boldly stepped forward in 2016 with a ‘profound move’ to introduce a Soft Drinks Industry Levy. 1.14 DNZ believes that the example set by these other nations is incontrovertible and that the TWG simply must give credence to the growing trend in favour of governmental intervention in the form of a Sugar Tax. In short, the scale of the problem is now too great to ignore, and sharper measures in the form of a Sugar Tax are essential if this country is serious about promoting the good health and welfare of New Zealanders. 6 1.15 The success with New Zealand’s campaign to stop smoking with tobacco taxes is a demonstrable example of how interventionalist fiscal policy can change consumer behaviours. It is also a strong precedent about the influence of price increases on reducing consumer demand for health poor products. 1.16 Given that SSB’s have been identified as the single biggest contributor to obesity and Type 2 type 2 diabetes, it seems clear that these can and should be targeted by way of a rifle-shot taxation approach. 1.17 The more visible the tax impact is on the shelf price, the greater will be the response in consumer behaviour. To this end the International Diabetes Federation in conjunction with WHO recommend that taxation is required at levels that result in price rises by at least 20% to be effective in changing buying behaviours and materially reducing SSB consumption. 1.18 DNZ also believe that the Tax Working Group should give close consideration to a two-pronged approach, with some tax measure that offers thin subsidies to price reduce healthy alternatives, such as water. Evidence supports that this dual approach will have greater success on consumer behaviours over a sole Sugar Tax approach, by drawing consumers to discounted healthy substitutes over less healthy other sugar substitute options. The combination of a Sugar Tax and thin subsidies represents a powerful ‘push me, pull me’ effect that doubles the buyer influence for greater impact. 1.19 Working with the Food and Drinks Industry to develop and promote healthy products is an important program. However, DNZ has reservations about this voluntary and industry dependent approach being sufficiently productive, given the very obvious profit conflict inherent here, and also the historic delays in progress since the Nation Accord with the Food Industry Group back in 2004. DNZ considers that the UK experience with the introduction of the Soft Drinks Levy Tax offers lessons to the parallel New Zealand position. The UK experience reveals a period of doubts and reticence toward the introduction of a Sugar Tax until a final realisation that the dire health evidence within the UK with obesity and Type 2 diabetes was just too overwhelming to ignore. Of particular relevance here, Camilla Cavendish, author of Soft Drinks Industry Levy, as former head of policy under David Cameron commented: “There was an onslaught from the companies – every company said they couldn’t possibly reformulate it. It would be impossible to change their ingredients, it would be impossible to take the sugar out. Here we are, three months before the tax comes in, and every single company, except one, has already reformulated its drink to avoid the tax. I think this is a huge success”. 1.20 The missing and very salient point here is that little evidence exists that New Zealand’s history of non-tax strategies for reducing Type 2 diabetes and obesity is making tangible inroads to that goal, and that something more is needed. We believe that a Sugar Tax will constitute a political ‘bow wave’ that will strike more directly at reducing consumption of SSBs and the corresponding harmful effects, and will also infuse much needed attention to healthier dietary choices by the public at large. As with the UK, such a measure would send out a loud message about the seriousness with which Government is tackling better health outcomes to industry, and the broader public. 7 1.21 The Tax Working Group will be extremely mindful of the dual effect of a Sugar Tax, and the benefits this yields for Government and taxpayers more generally. A Sugar Tax will raise revenue. This revenue can be deployed in promoting other health campaigns (the UK is using its tax receipts to fund the promotion of sport in primary schools). The other fiscal benefit comes from a reduction to this country’s massive and increasing health cost burden in treating diabetes and obesity related illnesses as positive outcomes emerge from changing current poor health options amongst our population. This dual fiscal effect represents a rare outcome from regulatory intervention that economically underpins the case for action. 1.22 The complex nature of diabetes requires a comprehensive and sustained approach across many fronts to turn this rising tide. DNZ continues to advocate the need for multi-faceted actions across a wide-range of initiatives. However, the gap in New Zealand’s arsenal for combatting the Type 2 diabetes and obesity epidemic is a Sugar Tax, and as a no cost (revenue positive) measure DNZ strongly recommend that the lead taken by 30 territories with such a tax is one that this country should follow. 1.23 For the reasons above, and more expansively outlined in the body of this submission, DNZ believe that a highly compelling case exists to justify the introduction of a Sugar Tax in New Zealand. We sincerely and earnestly encourage the TWG to strongly consider the merits of a Sugar Tax. 8 2. What is the purpose of Tax? 2.1 The Tax Working Group (“TWG”) pose a very poignant question. Should we have a simple tax system, or should our tax system do more to incentivise or discourage behaviours? Diabetes New Zealand (“DNZ”) do recognise and support the strong tax framework that New Zealand has developed over the past 30 years, and its simplicity. Further, we believe that taxes that target behavioural change be on an exception-only basis. 2.2 We believe that a ‘Sugar Tax’ is a justified exception. Within this submission, we explain the basis for this exception from the appalling human and social poor health outcomes across New Zealand for which sugar sweetened beverages (“SSBs”) is a major contributor, to the rising health costs to the nation of treating and dealing with an increasingly obese and diabetes affected population. 2.3 We also believe that consideration be given to ‘subsidies’ over healthier alternatives as a measure that would incentivise consumer choices away from high sugar SSBs in favour of alternative healthier options. This thin subsidy approach could be funded from revenue raised from a Sugar Tax. 2.4 DNZ has always advocated that a multi-faceted approach is essential to combat Type 2 diabetes and its complications, with actions across many fronts on an awareness, better information and educative footing. These non-tax strategies have dominated New Zealand’s campaigns against obesity and Type 2 diabetes, however we believe that a Sugar Tax is a sharp tool that is missing from the arsenal that can create a powerful ‘bow wave’ to change poor consumption behaviours and send a necessary message to the beverage and food industry. 2.5 The growing trends and precedent from other nations with sugar taxes, and in particular the recent UK Soft Drinks Industry Levy, warrants considerable attention by the TWG. These countries have demonstrated considerable political will-power to tackle the increasing health epidemic from Type 2 diabetes and obesity. These government interventions using the blunt instrument of taxation exemplify what is necessary by New Zealand. 2.6 DNZ urge the TWG to closely consider the benefits of this country’s commitment to aggressively taxing tobacco as a proven example of how leveraging the taxation system can generate better health outcomes for New Zealanders. 2.7 You have a unique opportunity to play a critical role in the health, well-being and longer lives of hundreds of thousands of current and future generation New Zealanders. 9 3. The New Zealand Obesity and Diabetes Epidemic 3.1 The OECD’s 2017 Obesity Update ranking of New Zealand as the third most obese country out of a 35 country analysis is a shocking indictment of this nation. This was immediately recognised by the Rt Hon Helen Clark who pleaded that “whoever’s in government needs to implement strong policy to stop this epidemic now”. 3.2 The OECD analysis is a reflection of the MoH’s own findings 1 that basically 1 in 3 New Zealanders are obese. The rate of obesity of this nation at 30.7% has been a continuously climbing rate since 2007 (26.5%), and this is expected to increase further over the next decade. Source: OECD Health Statistics 2017 (Forthcoming in June 2017) 3.3 The MoH Obesity Statistics show: i. Around 1 in 3 adults (aged 15 years and over) were obese, 32% ii. A further 34% of adults were overweight but not obese iii. 50% of Maori adults were obese iv. 69% of Pacific island adults were obese v. Adults living in deprived areas were 1.5 times as likely to be obese vi. Around 1 in 8 children (aged 2 to 14 years) were obese, 12% vii. A further 21% of children were overweight, but not obese viii. 18% of Maori children were obese ix. 29% of pacific Island children were obese x. Children living in deprived areas were 2.5 times as likely to be obese 1 Refer, https://www.health.govt.nz/nz-health-statistics/health-statistics-and.../obesity-statistics - The New Zealand Health Survey 2016/17, and also, Obesity and diabetes in New Zealand; Parliamentary Library Research Paper 2014/04 10 3.4 Obesity is a primary risk factor for Type 2 diabetes 2 , which is the maturity onset condition and which at close to 90% of all diabetes cases dominates this population. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease, which means it gets slowly worse with time. Using the latest MoH figures out of the revised Virtual Diabetes Register (VDR) 3 , some 241,000 New Zealanders suffered from diabetes at 31 December 2016. By simple extrapolation at 90%, some 217,000 were people with Type 2 diabetes, which is relevant here for reasons above that overweight and poor nutrition is a leading contributor to this condition. In addition, MoH figures estimate that some 100,000 people are ‘at-risk’ of developing diabetes but as yet undiagnosed 4 . 3.5 The combined current diabetes population (5.13%), together with the pre- diabetic population therefore represents a staggering 7.26% of all New Zealanders 5 , with the Type 2 population representing some 6.74% of New Zealanders. This is a very significant portion of the nation’s population and represents a more prevalent condition than any other health disease, particularly long-term conditions. Put in contrast, these numbers are more than the total combined populations of Blenheim, Whangarei, Taupo, Queenstown, Nelson, Napier, Masterton and Kaitaia. 3.6 Figures reveal the growing incidence of diabetes within New Zealand, as illustrated by this graph taken from the MoH VDR. 2 Type 2 diabetes is adult-onset diabetes mellitus, where the body becomes insulin resistant and unable to metabolise glucose, or blood sugars. It is distinguishable from Type 1 diabetes which is insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus that is an auto-immune failure of the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes is the dominant condition and accounts for approximately 90 of diabetes cases worldwide. 3 The VDR contains data about people suspected as having diabetes, identified through their use of diabetes health services. The VDR uses an algorithm in data extracted from inpatient, outpatient, laboratory test and pharmaceutical dispensing databases. 4 Refer - https://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/conditions-and-treatments/diseases.../diabetes, but this could be higher, refer https://www.health.govt.nz/system/.../pre-diabetes-risk-factor-management-nov16.doc 5 Using 2016 population figures of 4.7 million, comparable with the timing of MoH VDR figures. 11 Year- end 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 VDR figures 187,860 200,235 211,590 220,870 228,790 236,070 241,460 % yearly increase - 6.6% 5.7% 4.4% 3.9% 3.2% 2.3% % total increase 28.5% 3.7 Pacific island peoples have a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes than all other ethnic groups. The rates of diabetes within Indian populations is also close to that of Pacific Islanders. A recent NZIER Report 6 stated: There are major ethnic and socio-economic disparities in the prevalence of diabetes and long-term outcomes for people with diabetes. Maori and Pacific people develop diabetes 10 to 20 years earlier than Europeans, and experience worse outcomes. These groups are also more likely to be heavy consumers of sugar-sweetened beverages. This data, together with an increased rate of diabetes within deprived communities, sees many parallels between diabetes and obesity. 3.8 Diabetes has been termed the ‘silent assassin’. The MoH figures predict that nearly 100,000 people are pre-diabetic and this group will already be suffering irreparable harm with the gradual damage to their health as elevated blood-glucose levels cause deterioration in vital health functions such as vision, kidney function, cardiovascular disease, and nerve damage. 3.9 What is seen here is that diabetes represents a large, deadly health-lake, from which morbidity 7 estuaries flow. Diabetes is cataclysmic as a major contributor to many diseases. It is the leading cause of adult blindness; the leading cause of kidney failure; a major cause of cardiovascular disease (heat attacks and strokes); and a causal factor with the development of nerve damage (neuropathies), ketoacidosis and amputations. The flow-on health complications that arise from diabetes are serious, and fatal. 3.10 While huge numbers of people die from diabetes, the vast majority are recorded as dying from their immediate and proximal medical cause of death, such as stroke and heart attack, kidney/renal failure, causal operation complications (eg. amputations), and other conditions. As a percentage of the national mortality profile, diabetes is mis-represented. A study in the US 8 concluded that while 3.3% of deaths of 30-to-84 year-olds from 1997 to 2011 recorded diabetes as the underlying cause of death, a much higher percentage closer to 12% could actually be attributable to diabetes. 3.11 The data above is dire, and explains why diabetes is described as an epidemic, indeed a pandemic health situation. 6 Sugar taxes – a review of the evidence, NZIER report to Ministry of Health, August 2017 7 Morbidity being the incidence of disease, disability and ill-health 8 The disease that may be a leading cause of death; Data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) ; Article from Diabetes in Control, News and Information for Medical Professionals; 4 th February 2017 12 Type 2 diabetes is largely preventable 3.12 Unlike Type 1 diabetes 9 , Type 2 diabetes which is the prevailing condition in approximately 90% of cases can be prevented. The escalating prevalence in Type 2 diabetes has been attributed to personal and environmental factors that conspire to drive this epidemic. A segment of people who maybe genetically disposed to Type 2 diabetes may not prevent its onset. However, the majority of at-risk people can adopt lifestyle changes that will delay or prevent its onset. 3.13 Lifestyle changes from weight loss, improved dietary changes, and exercise are the keys to prevention. Fundamental here is healthy eating and good diet (portions and choices). Actions relating to healthy food promotion, advertising and labelling will all play a part in curbing bad food choices and encouraging healthier supermarket trolleys. 3.14 However, the introduction of a Sugar Tax represents a powerful weapon to drive better food choices and improve our nation’s diet. This measure will strike at beverage manufacturers and distributors as well as the consumer population in general. This is a double edge sword, and as such a tougher and more direct measure that will add materially to the actions needed to drive changes in our health outcomes. “It's all about healthier option taking” 9 Type 1 diabetes is insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus that is an auto-immune failure of the pancreas 13 4. The impact of sugary drinks on obesity and Type 2 diabetes 4.1 Obesity is symptomatic with unhealthy diets and lack of exercise. It is non- contentious that today’s food shelves contain heightened levels of added sugar and fat, and this extends to many processed and convenience foods – cereals, ice cream varieties, yoghurts, breads, cookies, nutrition bars, fruit juices, etc. The standout culprit of today’s mass marketed high sugar intake foods are sugary drinks, known as sugar-sweetened beverages (‘SSB’). Fuelled by industry mass-marketing and promotional campaigns, including aggressive pricing techniques, the consumption of SSB’s has escalated. This is a global phenomenon. 4.2 The following summary positions will inform readers of key facts about SSB’s, and the adverse causal outcomes. These positions are well documented internationally, including New Zealand based literature. Key positions relating to SSB’s • SSB’s include those beverages that have added sugar such as carbonated or fizzy drinks, sports drinks, fruit drinks and juices, powdered drinks, cordial and flavoured drinks; • A 600ml bottle of soft drink contains approximately 16 teaspoons of sugar. A 375ml can of soft drink contains approximately 10 teaspoons of sugar 10 . • The World Health Organisation recommends that the total daily sugar intake for adults and children should be reduced to less than 10% of their daily energy intake, which is equivalent to around 12 teaspoons of sugar for adults 11 . The UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition halved this (previous) recommendation and advised that to achieve good health the average population intake of sugar should not exceed 5% of total dietary energy 12 . • In both the UK and USA, SSB’s are the top calorie source for teenager’s diets 13 . In the UK, as the largest single source of sugar for 11 to 18 year olds, consumption of SSB’s equates to one can individually each and every day. Soft drinks provide close to 30% of daily sugar intake, on average, for this age group. • In the UK, it is estimated that the sugar intake of school aged children and teenagers is up to 15.7%, and for adults is over 12% on average 14 . • Back in 2002, New Zealand was ranked 9 th out of 18 developed countries consuming 84.2 million litres of soft drink 15 . 10 Taxes on sugary drinks: Why do it? apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/260253/1/WHO-NMH-PND- 16.5Rev.1-eng.pdf; World Health Organisation 2017; and also, Rethink sugary drink key messages for professionals.

In this way, they contribute empty calories. They are also highly acidic 17 . • Substantial evidence links the intake of sugar to increased body mass and chronic non-communicable diseases including heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, gout and fatty liver disease, as well as dental caries 18 . People who consume sugary drinks regularly – 1 to 2 cans a day or more – have a 26% greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes than people who rarely consume such drinks 19 • The lack of nutritional value combined with their excess calorific content puts sugary drinks in the spotlight amongst a range of health damaging foods and drinks. This is exacerbated by sugary drinks being cheap, readily available and accessible with widely advertised content. • A University of Cambridge Study predicted that under current trends nearly 80,000 new cases of Type 2 diabetes will develop in the UK over the next 10 years as a direct result of SSB’s 20 . This research does not suggest that all cases of Type 2 diabetes are triggered by the consumption of SSB’s, but the regular intake off SSB’s will increase the likelihood of Type 2 diabetes. • Research at the Queen Mary University of London assess that the reduction of sugar in soft drinks by 40% over five years could prevent 1.5 million cases of obesity, and 300,000 cases of obesity related Type 2 diabetes in the UK 21 . The reduction in calories from this measure was estimated to lead to an average body weight reduction of 1.2kg. • A common finding amongst studies and health reports is that high sugar intake, and excess SSB consumption is associated with low socio-economic groups 22 . This correlates to statistical data that records obesity and Type 2 diabetes as most prevalent within these same groups 23 . 16 Sugary drinks: NZ worse than Canada, UK and Australia, study finds; article by Ruby Nyika; Stuff; 16 January 2018; https://www.stuff.co.nz/.../Sugary-drinks-NZ-worse-than-Canada-UK-and-Australia-stud... 17 Consensus Statement on Sugary Drinks; New Zealand Dental Association; 2016 18 Te Morenga L, Mallard S, Mann J.

This is exacerbated by sugary drinks being cheap, readily available and accessible with widely advertised content. 4.4 The scientific and nutritional studies overwhelmingly show causal links exist between SSB’s and the prevalence of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. 16 5. What is obesity and diabetes costing our health system? 5.1 The cost to our health system of treating diabetes and obesity related illnesses is enormous. Not only is it an enormous health cost but it is also a disproportionately higher one than the costs of treating other health conditions. In its health plan to manage the country’s diabetes problem, the MoH states: “Diabetes, because it is a long-term condition with the potential for severe complications, has high health costs. For example, the total direct health care costs for a person with diabetes are approximately three times those for people without diabetes” 24 . 5.2 These costs represent a very heavy burden on the country’s health budget, and, indirectly on all taxpayers. Importantly, the cost burden of obesity and Type 2 diabetes also needs to be considered from a broader non-fiscal perspective, involving economic, social, cultural, and environmental well-being factors. 5.3 A fundamental and compelling message here is that the costs on preventative intervention will deliver significant cost savings across our health sector 25 . 5.4 In addition, the increasing cost and resource burden on our health system from the growing demands of health care for obesity and Type 2 diabetes, and the associated complications, has adverse repercussions for the general health care of the public in general. This ‘squeeze-out effect’ threatens an already under pressure health system to have sufficient resources and budget to deliver full health services required by the country at large 26 . 5.5 Therefore, greater and more effective measures to tackle and reduce New Zealand’s obesity and diabetes crisis should directly benefit the government’s fiscal purse, free up more health services to cater for other general public health treatment and contribute to better health outcomes for New Zealanders. 5.6 In this regard, DNZ strongly advocate the introduction of a Sugar Tax as just such a measure. Costs of Type 2 diabetes 5.7 Several studies and Treasury’s own health care cost-benefit tool substantiate the enormity of health service costs expended in treating diabetes and obesity related illnesses. 24 “Living Well with Diabetes – A plan for people at high risk of or living with diabetes 2015-2020”, the New Zealand Ministry of Health 25 This fundamental message was at the core of the PwC Report “Type 2 Diabetes: Managing for Better Health Outcomes” that concluded, that there is potential to make significant savings through increased expenditure on prevention and early detection.....an increased investment of $60 million a year (in 2008 dollars) in prevention, self-management and early detection services for Type 2 diabetes has the potential to reduce the government’s health expenditure by as much as $260 million in 2022. As well as this reduced cost to the taxpayer, at the same time there will be increased services focused on improving the health and well-being of New Zealanders. 26 This threat is acknowledged by the MoH. In its 5 year plan, “Living Well with Diabetes – A plan for people at high risk of or living with diabetes 2015-2020”, the MoH state, The increasing prevalence of diabetes in New Zealand will have a major impact on the health system. This is because more people will need to access secondary and tertiary health services for treatment of the complications associated with primary health care support to help manage their disease, as well as diabetes. 17 5.8 PWC was commissioned by DNZ to undertake a report – Type 2 Diabetes: Managing for Better Health Outcomes in 2001, which provided modelling of government health costs for Type 2 diabetes services. This model was updated in 2007 27 , and again in 2008, where the costs for public health services for people with Type 2 diabetes was modelled then (2008) at $600 million per annum. The model also projected that based on then current services and treatments, these costs could be expected to reach $1.310 billion per annum by 2016/17 (based on MoH prevalence data), growing further to $1.770 billion per annum by 2021/22. The PwC 2008 updated model costs closely approximate another Study on the health care costs analysed from obesity related illnesses in 2006, which allocated $526m to the treatment of Type 2 diabetes 28 . 5.9 While it is accepted that differences and mis-matches will exist in the figures, this extrapolated model of the country’s health spend on Type 2 diabetes represents some 8.1% of the total Crown Health budget spend for the same 2016/17 period of $16.2 billion 29 . By any measure, this is a very disturbing proportion of the country’s total health budget. 5.10 A further study conducted in 2008 concludes that cardiovascular disease and diabetes accounted for a substantial and disproportionate share of health care expenditure by the Counties-Manakau District Health Board 30 . The following Table from that report is demonstrable. 5.11 The 2017 Treasury healthcare cost-benefit analysis 31 draws on the above CMDHB Study and applies adaptations to update the associated healthcare costs as follows: 27 diabetes.squiz.co.nz/\_\_data/assets/pdf\_file/0016/11806/OutcomesModelUpdate.pdf (PWC’s Report and Outcomes Model Update, is the most commonly cited reference of costs of diabetes in New Zealand) 28 Refer Health care and lost productivity costs of overweight and obesity in New Zealand; Australia and New Zealand Journal of Public Health; 2012, Vol.36, No.5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23216496 29 https://treasury.govt.nz/information-and-services/interest-areas/health.

The MoH health plan for managing diabetes 2015-2020 reflects the figures above that the total direct health costs for a person with diabetes are approximately three times those for a person without diabetes. Costs of obesity 5.13 In the same vein, the cost burden of overweight and obesity in New Zealand is considerable. In a 2006 study 32 , health care costs attributable to overweight and obesity were estimated to be $624 million, or 4.4% of New Zealand’s total health care expenditure in 2006. Added to this, the study estimated that an additional $100 million to $225 million was costed to lost productivity. The combined upper end costs of health care and lost productivity from the incidence of (high) obesity in New Zealand was nearly $850 million. This study examined health care costs from hospital (inpatient /outpatient) services, allied health professional costs, G.P. visits, residential aged care, pharmaceuticals and laboratory tests across co-morbidities, such as Type 2 diabetes, stroke, ischemic heart disease, osteoarthritis, colorectal cancer, postmenopausal breast cancer, uterine cancer, and kidney cancer. As such, some overlap of costings exists with these figures and those above for Type 2 diabetes health care costs. 5.14 In addition to these hard health care costs of obesity, there are a range of substantial non-health impacts of obesity that have a wider social cost. A review of the impact obesity has on New Zealand’s economic, social, cultural, and environmental well-being was undertaken in 2014/15 by NZ IER for Superu 33 .This review concluded that “obese people experience a range of non-health impacts and some evidence suggest that these impacts are much greater than the health costs most commonly associated with obesity”. 32 Refer Health care and lost productivity costs of overweight and obesity in New Zealand; Australia and New Zealand Journal of Public Health; 2012, Vol.36, No.5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23216496 33 superu.govt.nz/costsofobesity 19 These costs threaten to overrun the health system 5.15 The Mexican Health Secretary Jose Cordova said that diabetes will bankrupt his country’s health system in the next decade if nothing is done to improve the situation. The PwC Report referred to above has projected that the cost for our healthcare services to treat people with Type 2 diabetes will reach a staggering $1.8 billion by 2021/22. 5.16 As has been the case in the majority of countries, the costs to the health budgets are blowing out in dealing with Type 2 diabetes and its complications. These costs are creating considerable pressure on our hospitals and District Health Boards that run to constrained governmental budgets. The risk here, and a real one at that, is that the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and all its complications will squeeze out the funds and resources available for wider health services. 5.17 In this regard, the New Zealand Parliamentary Inquiry into Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes in New Zealand in 2007 34 stated: “Diabetes services throughout the country are overloaded and delivery is inconsistent across District Health Boards (DHBs). Hospital dietetic services are not available for all patients who need dietary advice, and outpatient support service for those with obesity or diabetes is available in some districts only for patients with co-morbidities”. 5.18 DNZ itself confronts a “tsunami” of needs from our country’s vast population with diabetes and despite the enormous input, efforts and goodwill of all our staff and many volunteers in improving the health and wellbeing of many thousands of affected New Zealanders, we lack the necessary resources and funds to make a difference in the lives of far too many people. 34 https://www.parliament.nz/resource/0000026433 20 6. Tougher government intervention is necessary 6.1 Given the sheer scale of New Zealand’s diabetes and obesity population, the increasing year-on-year numbers who develop these long-term conditions, and the massive health care and social and economic impact costs, the call to governmental action has never been stronger. 6.2 Since 2002 successive government and ministry initiatives have been put in place to tackle obesity and diabetes in New Zealand. The New Zealand Parliamentary Inquiry into Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes in New Zealand in 2007 35 represents a comprehensive review of these labelled ‘epidemics’ that concluded that the severity of the problem demanded an urgent, concerted, and sustained public-health approach to manage the issues. This conclusion is just as germane today. Snapshot of major Government and Ministry actions 6.3 The following is a snapshot of major initiatives undertaken under successive governments in response to the growing diabetes and obesity crisis. These actions are revealing for the non-tax strategies deployed. • 2000 NZ Health Strategy - improving nutrition as a way to reduce obesity • The 2002 launch of “Healthy Action – Healthy Eating”, targeted at more at risk and disadvantaged groups such as the poor and Maori. • Free annual consultations were provided to people with diabetes under the ‘Get Checked’ programme • In 2004, the Government signed the Health of our Nation Accord, an industry led ‘agreement’ with the Food Industry Group to work toward healthier eating in a bid to reduce obesity 36 . • The 2005 initiated Fruit in Schools programme (for 114 low decile schools). • The 2007 launch of the B4 School programme aimed at compulsory health checks for four-year olds, including weight measurement. • Healthy eating guidelines were introduced by Labour and then scrapped by National. • Physical activity became a focus in 2008 with the Kiwisport initiative. • In 2014, MoH dropped its Get Checked programme in favour of a new Diabetes Care Improvement Package - a community and primary care-based programme, building on core diabetes services • In 2014 Healthy Families NZ was an anti-obesity initiative from Australia, which backed community-led efforts to encourage healthy eating and exercise. • The Health Star Rating system is a 2014 trans-Tasman Government led initiative for food companies to (voluntarily) rate packaging on basis of nutritional value. • In 2015 the Childhood Obesity Plan introduced initiatives to identify, help and prevent obese Kiwi kids and stop others from becoming overweight. 35 https://www.parliament.nz/resource/0000026433 36 Of note from this is the Voluntary Schools Beverage Agreement (VSA) in 2009 which heralded NZ’s two major company’s Coca-Cola Amatil New Zealand, and Frucor Beverages withdraw the direct supply of full sugar carbonated soft drinks from all New Zealand schools. 21 6.4 As seen from above, government policies have varied from healthy food and better nutritional encouragement, to health sector offerings, to sports and greater activity incentives across national levels, and also targeted community groups. 6.5 The distinctive feature of the above government led health programmes is the absence of any hard-hitting regulatory or legislative intervention or penalty impost such as a taxation. The policies touched on may be described as a faciliatory approach which seek to “influence” rather than “prescribe” a change in individual poor health behaviours. 6.6 By comparison, a more prescriptive approach is evident in the government’s war on tobacco, which DNZ regards as compelling precedent how to change habits and behaviours that have chronic health outcomes. Using high tax and price inflating measures was shown as being a blunt tool which had direct and impactful consequences in reducing smoking. 6.7 DNZ considers that the policies above are necessary since tackling the obesity and Type 2 diabetes epidemic requires a multi-faceted approach, as was clearly identified in the 2007 Parliamentary Inquiry. However, DNZ believe that given the extent of the bad health obesity and Type 2 diabetes crises that a sharper and more direct intervention with a Sugar Tax is a necessary addition to the overall combative arsenal. 22 7. The effectiveness of a Sugar Tax 7.1 Camilla Cavendish, author of Soft Drinks Industry Levy, as former head of policy under David Cameron has stated, “making things more expensive does change people’s behaviour in a way that I’m afraid all the leaflets we have all read over the years and all the newspaper articles fundamentally don’t”. DNZ considers that this statement is an accurate reflection of just where New Zealand is at following many years of non-tax strategies to combat unhealthy behaviours leading to our obesity and Type 2 diabetes epidemic. We are still confronting a growing, rather than a reversing trend in population obesity and Type 2 diabetes which brings into question the overall effectiveness of education and information campaigns alone. 7.2 DNZ contends that blunter government intervention in the form of taxation is necessary. In this respect there is ample evidence of the effect of excise taxes and price increases from the success of the New Zealand governments’ war on tobacco and cigarette consumption. In addition, there is a growing trend by many countries to introduce a Sugar Tax (in some form), and the recent introduction of the Soft Drinks Industry Levy in the United Kingdom and Ireland deserve particular attention by the TWG. 7.3 There is a growing body of research and literature about the effectiveness of a Sugar Tax, both in terms of whether it results in a marked reduction in the consumption of SSB’s, and also of the improved health benefits. While these reports do vary in the conclusions reached, one thing remains clear and that is the decisiveness of a great many countries to put a stake in the ground and declare their resolve to tackle the enormous health crisis from obesity and Type 2 diabetes. The ‘sugar tax’ precedent trending with other countries can’t be ignored 7.4 Nearly 30 nations have introduced some measure of taxation in the form of a Sugar Tax all with the combined aim of countering the increasing prevalence of obesity and Type 2 diabetes and reducing the dire health consequences of the nation. More countries are actively considering their position. Notable amongst these nations are Mexico (2013/14), France (2012), Hungary (2011), Norway (increased level of tax 2017), UAE (2017), South Africa (2018), United Kingdom (2018), Ireland (2018), USA City Taxes (incl. Berkeley, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Oakland, Boulder, Seattle). 7.5 The UK / Ireland Sugar Tax provides a good case example for New Zealand. Following many years of political resistance to introduce a sugar tax (with politicians claiming insufficient evidence existed around the effectiveness of a sugar tax), these governments boldly stepped forward in 2016 with a ‘profound move’ to introduce a Soft Drinks Industry Levy. The then Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, stated in his budget address announcing the Soft Drinks Levy – “I am not prepared to look back on my time here in this Parliament, doing my job and say to my children’s generation ‘I’m 23 sorry. We knew there was a problem with sugary drinks. We knew it caused disease. But we ducked the difficult decisions and we did nothing.” 7.6 DNZ believes that the 30 or so jurisdictions that have introduced some form of Sugar Tax have a genuine concern for this health crisis and are committed to act decisively by regulation. These 30 examples lend considerable weight to the viability and effectiveness of sugar taxes and the TWG must take note of this level of credibility about the use of taxation to drive affirmative health outcomes. In short, the scale of the problem is now too great to ignore, and sharper measures in the form of a Sugar Tax are essential if this country is serious about promoting the good health and welfare of New Zealanders. Strong precedent with tobacco taxes 7.7 New Zealand has a smoke free target by 2025. Since 1997, the smoking rate amongst New Zealanders has dropped nearly 10% 37 . This success must be attributed to considerable political will-power and decisive actions with a range of campaigns, most notably the government’s aggressive taxation increases on cigarettes and tobacco. This is a demonstrable example of how interventionalist fiscal policy can change consumer behaviours. It is also a strong precedent about the influence of price increases on reducing consumer demand for health poor products. 7.8 We accept that differences exist with a tobacco tax and a sugar tax. Most notably, people can live entirely without tobacco, they can’t live entirely without sugar. But, people can live without added sugars, and foods overly-rich in sugar content. 7.9 Given that SSB’s have been identified as the single biggest contributor to obesity and Type 2 type 2 diabetes, it seems reasonably clear that these can and should be targeted by way of a rifle-shot taxation approach. In its message to world leaders to tax sugar to reduce obesity and Type 2 diabetes rates, the International Diabetes Federation has stated 38 – “It is well established that heavy taxation on tobacco and relentless reinforcement of the message that tobacco is unhealthy has had a very good effect. It is time now that we adopted a similar approach with sugar”. 7.10 DNZ urge the TWG to closely consider the benefits of this country’s political commitment to aggressively taxing tobacco as a proven example of how leveraging the taxation system can generate better health outcome for New Zealanders. 37 Refer, Facts & Figures, Health Promotion Agency, Smokefree.org.nz. Smoking rates are now less than 16%. 38 International Diabetes Federation message to the Group of 20 (G20) of the world’s major advanced and emerging economies, who are meeting in Turkey on 15 th -16 th November 2015. 24 What type of ‘sugar tax’? 7.11 It is beyond the scope of this submission to examine the taxation options with any sort of Sugar Tax. However, the following brief observations have relevance to DNZ’s stance here. 7.12 Differing approaches to taxing sugary drinks exist. Commonly, such taxes are imposed as excise taxes in the form of a sales tax at the point of sale to public consumers (on a basis proportional to the level of calorific or sugar content). An excellent research report on the types of tax impost used by countries is contained in Curbing the Consumption of Soft Drinks in New Zealand: Is Tax the Solution? 39 7.13 The UK and Ireland Soft Drinks Industry Levy is imposed at the manufacturer and distributor level on bands of total sugar content (First, at 5gms per 100ml; second for drinks over 8gms per 100ml). The expectation is that the price per litre unit of SSB’s at the lower level would rise by 18p, and that of the higher level by 24p 40 . Taxation at the point of sale, or at the manufacturer/ distributor level, will ultimately bear on the consumer, although with the latter impost, this depends on the pass- through price rate to consumers. Camilla Cavendish, author of the UK Soft Drinks Industry Levy has said “The sugar tax on drinks is not a tax on customers, it is a tax on manufacturers. The whole point of it was to get manufacturers to change the ingredients of the product”. The reality is that industry will pass on additional costs to their customers in some shape or form. 7.14 DNZ agrees with the World Health Organisation that the more visible the tax impact is on the shelf price, the greater the behavioural change made in response to it 41 . 7.15 The response from the soft drink industry in the UK was swift and material. Between announcement date in 2016 and implementation date 6 th April 2018, significant reformulation of soft drinks took place across the industry rendering considerably more SSB’s with a sugar level below the 5% level, thus avoiding the tax (this despite industry protestations that it would be impossible to reformulate the ingredients). UK policy makers deemed this industry response an immediate success of the Soft Drinks Levy. 7.16 Both of the International Diabetes Federation and the World Health Organisation rely on evidential research in recommending that taxation is required at levels that results in price rises by at least 20% to be effective in changing behaviours and reducing SSB consumption materially 42 . This approach draws on the effectiveness of price increases with tobacco taxes. In this sense, product pricing is 39 Curbing the Consumption of Soft Drinks in New Zealand: Is Tax the Solution?; Lin Mei Tan - Senior Lecturer School of Accountancy, Massey University, and James Xun Liu Accountancy intern Bank of China; New Zealand Journal of Taxation and Policy (2014) 20 NZJTLP 203. 40 The UK Soft Drinks Levy: what’s the impact of the 2018 ‘sugar tax’? By Market Analyst Joshua Warner, of IG (IG Markets Limited, 27 February 2018. 41 Fiscal policy to improve diets and prevent noncommunicable diseases: from recommendations to action; 20 December 2017 revised version; www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/96/3/17-195982/en/ 42 Fiscal policy to improve diets and prevent noncommunicable diseases: from recommendations to action; 20 December 2017 revised version; www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/96/3/17-195982/en/ 25 seen as a potent way to discourage consumption and achieve healthier outcomes. The research piece Curbing the Consumption of Soft Drinks in New Zealand: Is Tax the Solution? references trialled studies on New Zealand supermarket pricing and consumer behaviour that the authors estimate that a 10% tax on SSBs could lead to a 13% decrease in population purchases of SSBs 43 . 7.17 A common criticism of a Sugar Tax is that it is a regressive tax 44 . This criticism is that a Sugar Tax will have most impact on people with lower incomes who spend a higher proportion of their income on food and beverages, and this is seen as inequitable. However, contrary views exist which counter balance this criticism. Notably, that socio-economic deprived groups who typically consume high levels of SSBs would be highly impacted and so reduced consumption would have most effect 45 . Equally, it is thought that lower income groups are more price sensitive, and therefore resulting changes in buying patterns away from SSBs would offset the regressive nature of a Sugar Tax. A tax impost approach (unlike a subsidy approach) to promote healthy outcomes will commonly have a degree of regressive inequality, however this should be justified where greater benefits are derived from those disadvantaged groups. This was, and is, clearly the case with tobacco taxes, and parallels exist with a Sugar Tax on SSBs. 7.18 Another form of tax leveraged intervention is the zero-rating or exemption from sales or value add taxes (such as our GST) for targeted healthy foods and drinks. This approach exists within Australia and the UK with concessions for healthy foods, such as fruits and vegetables. New Zealand’s indirect Goods and Services Tax is a broad based, no exemptions system, that is regarded highly on an international scale. We understand that policy makers are steadfast on the existing no exemptions system rather than introducing a subsidy in the form of zero rating or exempting GST on selective drink and food items. 7.19 However, there is considerable logic to the ‘push me / pull me’ effect of tax pricing bad consumables while subsidising good consumables. To this extent, it has been forwarded 46 that a most impactful approach is a two-pronged one that taxes unhealthy drinks, and also offers thin subsidies to price reduce healthier alternatives, such as water. This could be tax neutral with the revenue from sugar taxes funding the thin subsidy. 7.20 DNZ believe there is considerable merit in this double-up, two-pronged taxation approach as one that can have greatest impact on changing consumer behaviours, and accordingly we urge the TWG to look at how a thin subsidy in the form of GST relief might be achievable. 43 There is much literature on the Price Elasticity (of supply and demand) of food and beverages, and the resulting changes in consumption.

We consider that this messaging would likely have other upside benefits by encouraging wider healthy option taking behaviours from the public at large. 7.22 DNZ believe that a Sugar Tax will constitute a political ‘bow wave’ that will strike more directly at reducing consumption of SSBs and the harmful effects that arise. The ‘bow wave’ effect will build much needed attention to healthier dietary choices by the public, and inevitably turn buyer behaviours for the better. 7.23 Type 2 diabetes requires combative actions on a multi-faceted basis. DNZ has long-advocated that many viable actions are available and essential to build into a comprehensive yet integrated Type 2 diabetes prevention campaign, and that this is necessary to make meaningful inroads to reversing the prevalence trends 47 . In this regard, DNZ endorses the excellently crafted call to action recommendations of the Report of the Parliamentary Health Committee Inquiry into Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes in New Zealand, as well as recommendations of the International Diabetes Federation and World Health Organisation 48 for intervening to reverse the growing prevalence of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Need for ‘political will-power’ 7.24 The previous Minister of Health, Dr Jonathan Coleman dismissed calls for a sugar tax claiming that “there is no evidence that a sugar tax decreases obesity rates”. This follows several New Zealand reports that looked at the evidence for introducing a Sugar Tax. 7.25 Alasdair Gardiner’s 2016 Treasury Working Paper 49 stated that there was insufficient conclusiveness about the effectiveness of sugar taxes. That paper did acknowledge that the majority of studies (9 of 13) provided evidence to show that a sugar tax could be effective in reducing obesity rates, \[and achieving better health outcomes\], when set at a sufficiently high rate, and when introduced as part of a broader policy package to tackle obesity. However, Gardiner reported that limited evidence existed about the ‘substitution effect’, that is, whether consumers retreating from higher priced sugar drinks would substitute other unhealthy products, or healthier choices. (This point underpins our contention that a double-edged taxation 47 These range from clearer and stronger food labelling on sugar content; guideline limits on food and beverage advertising and promotions; reinvigorated school campaigns about family health and eating options; healthy lifestyle awareness; water only schools; more city and town water fountains; government and community pressure on the Food and Beverage Industry to focus on healthier foods and drinks and de-focus less healthy alternatives, and more. 48 “ Fiscal Policies for Diet and Prevention of Noncommunicable Diseases”; Technical Meeting report, World Health Organisation, 5 th -6 th May 2015, Geneva, Switzerland 49 “Implications of a Sugar Tax in New Zealand” Incidence and Effectiveness”; New Zealand Treasury Working Paper 16/09, November 2016, 27 and “thin subsidy” approach represents an optimal approach – refer para 7.18 – 7.20 above). 7.26 The NZIER 2017 report to the Ministry of Health 50 undertook a comprehensive review of the literature and from that review concluded that insufficient evidence exists that sugar taxes have an identifiable impact on better health outcomes. While this Report agreed that taxes are passed through to prices with reduced demand consequences, it found a lack of any conclusive real experience studies of any material reduction in sugar intake. 7.27 The current Minister, David Clark appears to have adopted the pre-existing same party line, and prefers an industry led self-regulating approach involving the voluntary reduction of sugar content by soft drink makers 51 . This approach mirrors the Health of our Nation Accord with the Food Industry Group back in 2004, which also had a backstop regulatory threat, but resulted in only modest progress toward healthier outcomes from the Food Industry until 2009, and then piecemeal moves thereafter. 7.28 DNZ again highlights the UK example which not unlike New Zealand reveals a long period of doubts and reticence toward the introduction of a Sugar Tax until the realisation that the dire health evidence within the UK with obesity and Type 2 diabetes was just too overwhelming to ignore. Of particular relevance here, Camilla Cavendish, author of Soft Drinks Industry Levy, as former head of policy under David Cameron commented “There was an onslaught from the companies – every company said they couldn’t possibly reformulate it. It would be impossible to change their ingredients, it would be impossible to take the sugar out. Here we are, three months before the tax comes in, and every single company, except one, has already reformulated its drink to avoid the tax. I think this is a huge success”. (As noted below, DNZ has reservations about the motives of soft drink companies and related industry to fully commit to product changes that promote healthy outcomes). 7.29 The missing point to all this is that little evidence exists that the governmental non-tax strategies for reducing Type 2 diabetes and obesity is making tangible inroads to that goal. This salient point was at the forefront of a concerted appeal to Government by 74 expert health professors calling for a sugary drinks tax 52 . The signatories agree that the evidence supporting sugary drink taxes is stronger than the evidence for any of the 22 strategies in the government’s childhood obesity action plan. 7.30 Finally, we draw on the wisdom of ex-Prime Minister the Rt Hon Helen Clark (who for some years was Minister of Health) with her response to this country’s appalling obesity rates pleaded that “whoever’s in government needs to implement strong policy to stop this epidemic now”. DNZ contend that this message begs a regulatory response. 50 “Sugar taxes – A review of the evidence”; NZIER report to the Ministry of Health; August 2017 51 Refer Thomas Coughlan from Newsroom, 8 February 2018, and Rachel Thomas from Stuff Health 8 th March 2018 (The Sugar fix: Is it right to target sugary drinks?) 52 An open letter to Cabinet Ministers from 74 health professors calling for a sugary drinks tax; Convened by Professor Boyd Swinburn, University of Auckland, April 2016 28 Industry Reactions 7.31 The soft drink industry is confronting a rising tide of protest about the poor health consequences from its SSBs. As noted from the UK, this industry has only meaningfully begun to change its product mix to offer more lines of low and no sugar drinks with the introduction of sugar taxes by more and more countries. In June 2017, Coca-Cola launched its new brand of ‘Coke No Sugar’, and other SSBs are being reformulated. While this signifies progress from the soft drink industry in terms of healthier choices, the jury remains out over the consumer impact in response to these new product lines in the absence of any price influence to substitute to low / no sugar content drinks. 7.32 We also note that a number of countries have introduced sugar taxes on both added sugar and artificial sweetener drinks 53 . Related to this, studies cast doubt on the healthier effects of artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs), one such observation 54 being - “ASBs stimulate sweet taste receptors—which could theoretically increase appetite, induce preference for sweet taste, and modulate gut hormone secretion—or result in overconsumption of solid foods due to awareness of the low-calorie content of ASBs”. 7.33 Like many, DNZ harbours serious reservations about a vested interest and conflicted soft drink industry advocating self-regulation of SSBs as part of its responsibility to promote public health. To this end we reiterate the relevance of comments by Camilla Cavendish 55 , author of Soft Drinks Industry Levy, on industry responsiveness becoming truly active following the introduction of a tax (colloquially known as a ‘stick over carrot approach’). 53 For example France and the Philippines 54 “Artificially Sweetened Beverages and the Response to the Global Obesity Crisis”; MC Borges; January 2017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5207632/ 55 “There was an onslaught from the companies – every company said they couldn’t possibly reformulate it. It would be impossible to change their ingredients, it would be impossible to take the sugar out. Here we are, three months before the tax comes in, and every single company, except one, has already reformulated its drink to avoid the tax. I think this is a huge success”. 29 8. Fiscally positive dual effect of revenue raising and cost savings 8.1 The TWG will be extremely mindful of the positive fiscal results that a health driven Sugar Tax will generate. 8.2 Nations that implement a Sugar Tax typically appropriate the revenue raised from such a tax toward healthier action plans on several levels. The UK estimate of taxes raising £520 million a year be earmarked for increasing funding of sport in primary schools. 8.3 We acknowledge that as sugar taxes bite and cause a change in SSB contents to a lower sugar content, there will be a resulting drop in tax revenue gained (a successful outcome). 8.4 From a New Zealand perspective, Treasury are best placed to analyse the likely tax revenue gains from introducing a Sugar Tax. However, we do note that a sugary drinks tax was expected to raise $30 million to $40 million in New Zealand by a study by the University of Auckland 56 . Further, that finding advocated the use of this revenue to boost funding for obesity prevention programs. 8.5 There is of course a dual effect from sugar taxes that is fiscally positive also. That is the reduction to this country’s massive and increasing health cost burden in treating diabetes and obesity related illnesses as positive outcomes emerge from changing current poor health options amongst our population. The cost savings that flow from positive health outcomes represents the dual advantage to the country’s health costs that can be expected to yield from a Sugar Tax. (refer section 5 of this submission). 8.6 It has been suggested that over 10 years, a tax on sugary drinks of 1 cent per ounce in the United States of America would result in more than UD$17 billion in healthcare cost savings 57 . The DNZ commissioned PwC report 58 is clear on the financial benefits to future health care costs from the adoption of earlier preventative measures. 8.7 From the above, there is no financial barrier to New Zealand taking actions with a Sugar Tax. In fact, the evidence suggests that such an action would pay considerable dividends to our health budget, and taxpayers in general. 8.7 While these fiscal benefits are a significant factor in the case for a Sugar Tax, it goes without saying that the more important and compelling factor is the improvement in the health and wellbeing of New Zealanders. 56 Refer An open letter to Cabinet Ministers from 74 health professors calling for a sugary drinks tax; Convened by Professor Boyd Swinburn, University of Auckland, April 2016 57 Refer Taxes on sugary drinks: Why do it?; article by World Health Organisation, 2017, quoting WangYC, Coxson P, Shen Y, Goldman L, Bibbins-Domingo K; A penny-per-ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages would cut health and cost burdens of diabetes.

The organisation is a not-for-profit charity (CC11432) that has been working to improve the lives of people with diabetes for over 50 years. We have a National Office in Wellington, and branches across the country with staff and volunteers. Diabetes New Zealand is affiliated with 168 country and territory organisations all over the world through its membership and representation to the International Diabetes Federation in Brussels. The vision of the International Diabetes Federation is to promote diabetes care, prevention and a cure worldwide. Diabetes New Zealand and its branches undertake the following work: 1. Leadership and Advocacy – at national level as the voice for people with diabetes with diverse representation to Government, Ministry of Health, Pharmac, and other agencies and organisations (such as NZSSD – the New Zealand Society for the Study of Diabetes), as well as pharmaceutical companies. At local levels, our branches liaise, lobby and advocate with District Health Boards, Primary Health Organisations, and many related health providers. 2. Education, Awareness and Profiling – this involves a full suite of initiatives, from web- based data about diabetes, to information brochures and resources, community based courses and presentations, workplace diabetes and wellness presentations, and mobile awareness services, the HOPE programme (Healthy Options Positive Eating), events and functions. 3. Support – to people with diabetes through support groups and meetings, education sessions, self-management assistance, help lines, a variety of shopping and nutritional courses, and more. 4. Youth – a sub-set of DNZ involves Diabetes Youth which is dedicated to Type 1 diabetes children, including newly diagnosed care and help, peer group social media, children camps and excursions, and other support activities. 5. Prevention – through education programmes to the wider community, mobile awareness van, the HOPE programme, diabetes risk assessments and testing, and information dissemination. 6. On-line Shop – providing information and a wide range of specific diabetes supplies. 7. Research – on a limited basis, funds are made available for projects that further the research and study into diabetes related causes. Diabetes New Zealand is a not-for profit organisation that is reliant on funding from an assortment of generous grants, member subscriptions, self-fundraising events, donations and bequests, and some investment income. The organisation receives Ministry of Health funding for brochures and awareness campaigns but no government funding for the provision of the extensive support services it provides within the community.

The Tax Working Group Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Email: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz 29 th April 2018 Submission on the Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Introduction 1. I welcome the opportunity to provide a submission to the Tax Working Group (“the Group”) in examining further improvements to the structure, fairness, and balance of the tax system. 2. The experience I draw upon in preparing this submission is a combination of qualifications such as a chartered accountancy; employment in private sector businesses of all sizes including: multinationals; public sector; local bodies; the NFP sector; as a SME business owner; medium sized employer; also a property developer and landlord. Countries I have lived and worked in are the UK, NZ and Australia. Countries I have worked but not lived in include France, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland and briefly, the USA and Poland. In the past I had a detailed knowledge of much of the UK tax system, including VAT, CGT and NI plus have exposure through my work to taxation in a number of European countries, the USA and Australia. 3. It was disappointing to note the composition of the Group lacked direct representation of some sectors that will nevertheless be affected by the outcomes. An example of this is the lack of representation of small and medium sized employers, the self-employed , the SME sector and the rural sector. The omission of these sectors is a common theme in policy making as is the lack of robust follow-up The Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper 2 up as to how these groups are affected after changes have been implemented. At a meeting at which the Minister was present, I mentioned this noting that broadening the composition of the working party should increase the credibility of the findings of the Group and reduce the occurrence of unforeseen adverse consequences. 4. It is noted that page 54 of the Background paper refers to the use of an independent advisor to “analyze ... and help distil the information to assist the Group”. This raises questions in the minds of those preparing submissions as to whether the content will be read in its entirety or will be selectively edited to remove statements the advisor considers not important. 5. As a general principle the timing of applying taxation should be when a gain is realised. Realised gains generate cash which also makes some cash available to pay tax; unrealised gains or assets based taxes do not. Taxation on unrealised gains or assets can create cash flow problems, force the sale of productive assets, inhibit business growth and create problems for trustees in meeting their responsibilities to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the trust. Capital Gains Tax 6. Disregarding the Bright Line Test for the purpose of this comparison, a person earning $50,000 receives $42,000. 1 A person earning $50,000 from selling a revenue generating property, or business, receives $50,000. To tax one of the $50,000 and not the other is inequitable and unfair. Furthermore, the addition of CGT would further broaden NZs tax base. 2 See Appendix A for responses to the specific points on CGT in Appendix 2 of Background Paper - Design Issues with a CGT. 1 Calculated using IRD Tax on Annual Income Calculator and rates for the YE 2018 2 “The UK Government has announced that from April 2019, UK tax will be charged on gains \[corporation tax or CGT\] made by all categories of non-UK resident sellers on both direct and indirect disposals of UK real estate, extending existing more limited rules that apply only to residential property.” So any affected property will need to be rebased). The Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper 3 Land Tax 7. Land tax is opposed as it bears no relationship to the ability to pay, only taxes one form of wealth, and singles out a particular productive tangible asset for taxation. If land is to be taxed then all tangible business assets used to generate income, such as buildings, plant and equipment should also be taxed. The principles of equity could also be used to argue that some intangible assets used to generate income should also be taxed, for example intellectual property. Environmental Taxation 8. I support the general principle that environmental costs should be borne by the business that is making the gain on the activity that is creating the negative impact on the environment. Equally where taxpayers are incurring costs that benefit the environment for the public good such as QE II covenants, the general principle should be that those expenses should be deductible. Progressive company tax 9. Progressive company tax with a rate for SMEs at 26% is not supported as it would add complexity and cost to the process, raise issues of definition, and would increase the incentive to direct time and energy into tax planning to minimise tax. Many SMEs are not companies but sole traders, partnerships or trusts. Look-through companies are treated for tax purposes as a partnership, or as sole traders if there is one shareholder. Of the ownership structures only SME companies would benefit which is inequitable and unfair. 10. I would however strongly support a more progressive tax regime but for personal income tax, with a top rate of 65%. GST exemptions for particular goods 11. New Zealand’s approach is a good one. While it has resulted in a more regressive tax than in many other countries and there are periodically calls for GST to be removed The Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper 4 from healthy foods stuffs, sanitary items and so on, the regressive nature of GST could be offset by adjustments to other taxes, such as income tax including an amount of income, possibly only earned income, on which no tax is charged. New Zealand has wisely avoided the anomalies and complexity of administration that came from matters such as cakes are zero-rated (0% VAT charged) and biscuits are standard rated (20% VAT charged) also eating the food inside a café resulting in VAT but none if your took it away. Relationship between Tax, Affordability of Housing and Effect on Retirement Savings 12. Reduce the incentives to invest in housing by reducing the risk of other ‘safe’ investments such as deposits with banks by replacing the OBR with a bank deposit scheme and by requiring the Reserve Bank, and Government, to keep investors (depositors and shareholders) fully informed. Housing presents as a less risky investment as although housing can also fall in value, while this loss remains an unrealised loss and the property continues to generate a rental income stream, the investor is not disadvantaged. In addition the investor has some control over their income generating asset if it is a piece of property. Small investors have no control over the actions of either banks or fund managers. Refer Appendix B for a comparison of the bank deposit guarantees of New Zealand and other countries. 13. Other matters of serious concern with the OBR from a business perspective relate to access to business cash for matters such as payroll, taxes and paying business expenses. In the Government’s concern to “reduce the pressure for Government to provide a bail out for a failed bank” it would appear that failed businesses, inability for unpaid employees to pay mortgages etc., is seen as mere collateral damage. Confidence in banking systems is important for business investment however it would be naive to be confident in the banking system in New Zealand. 3 3 Interesting to note support for the lack of confidence in being able to leave funds in NZ Banks from former BNZ chairman Kerry McDonald “giving the Reserve Bank both barrels for its hands-off, "naive" and "not fit for purpose" regulation of New Zealand banks, and for "consistently ignoring" the interests of bank customers”... “McDonald notes that New Zealand's big four banks - ANZ, ASB, BNZ and Westpac - are all Australian owned with parental representatives on the New Zealand The Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper 5 14. Reduce the attractiveness of housing as an investment by the introduction of CGT (except for the family home), and by requiring housing stock to be of an acceptable standard. 15. Increasing the attractiveness of other investments. For example the availability to small savers of Government national savings bonds with a guaranteed positive rate of interest on savings and a maximum holding per person. 16. As a general principle, tax retirement saving more lightly. Deductibility of expenses for Salary and Wage Earners 17. Attached as Appendix E is a copy of a paper from the Journal of the NZ Accountants Society dating from 2012. Since that time the line between work and home and where and with whom expenses fall, has blurred, plus changes in employment practices have increased the work related expenses now becoming a cost to the employee. The loss of the right for employees to deduct tax occurred over 30 years ago. In the interests of equity, fairness and of having a tax system that reflects the reality of New Zealand’s work environment as it is today, it is time this was reviewed. This review should include whether there should be any deduction for child care costs and if the conclusion is that there should, at what level it should be capped. Estate Duty. 18. To a certain extent I depart from the ‘no tax on unrealised gains’ view with respect to estate duty and believe this should be further reviewed in conjunction with any proposed changes in other taxes such as CGT and individual tax rates. If a comprehensive CGT and higher top tax rates are not introduced than estate tax should be considered but not if the costs of collection are excessive and with subsidiaries' boards. Additionally they organise/control many of the senior executive appointments, their systems and processes and policies, and most importantly influence how the New Zealand offshoots respond to a crisis”. https://www.interest.co.nz/business/91672/ex-bnz-chairman-kerry- mcdonald-lambasts-rbnzs-oversight-banks-being-unacceptably The Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper 6 appropriate exemptions to avoid the burden of two lots of estate duty being incurred close together in the event of two deaths occurring within a relatively short time frame. Taxation on Tobacco and Alcohol 19. There is a role for taxes intended to modify behaviour however the regressive nature of these taxes needs to be balanced against their behaviour modifying role. Tobacco taxes are currently too high and are causing adverse social and economic consequences. Gambling winnings 20. These are realised gains and should be taxed. The tax should be deducted by the organisation paying out the winnings (Lotteries Board, Casino and so on) and the costs of setting up a system to gather and pay this tax should be also borne by the body organisation paying out the winnings . 21. It is inequitable and inconsistent to tax alcohol and tobacco but not gambling when the harm caused by gambling is well documented. Refer Appendix C for further information. SMEs and Medium sized employers 22. The lack of knowledge of the reality of SMEs, including SME employers, is evidenced in past tax policy decisions which both unfairly burden SMEs with taxation and require an inordinate amount of compliance. Recent changes as part of the tax simplification process and system changes should deliver considerable benefits to central Government in terms of tax administration savings, improved data collection and cash flow. However some of these changes while clearly beneficial for central Government as was their intent, for the SME business owner, have increased the workload. A simple example is Payday filing. An employer with a fortnightly payroll now has to file 26 times a year instead of 12. Another simple example if the inability The Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper 7 of SMEs to communicate with the IRD in a timely way via secure messaging in myIR. A response from the IRD can take two weeks or more. If the response is inadequate or raises additional questions, more weeks elapse before the taxpayer received the required information. However the responsibility and costs for any errors or delays falls on the taxpayer. In spite of the current inability to provide a timely response the IRD is understood to be cutting 1500 jobs. It is also understood that part of the reason for this reduction is because some analytical work will be undertaken by analytical software. This will raise more queries on SME accounts creating more work for SMEs which will further exacerbate the existing problem of not being able to communicate in a timely way with the IRD. Example 1: An example to illustrate the unfairness of applying large company business practices to SME businesses is FBT on company vehicles. 23. The general assumption behind FBT is that the employee is provided with a vehicle of up to three years old, often leased. In this situation the use of the cost price or tax value is reasonable. However the reality for many SMEs (including shareholder employees) is they retain vehicles for many years 4 even to the end of their useful life of 20 plus years. Yet these businesses are burdened for much of the life of that vehicle with a tax that assumes a new or nearly new vehicle. This is neither equitable or fair thus breaches the second of the principles of a good tax system. 24. While after five years of its inclusion in a FBT return there is some recognition of loss of benefit when the vehicle ages by allowing a minimum tax value, this value - based on an assumption of a vehicle purchased from new - is too high for what may be a very old vehicle. The current minimum value at five years be further reduced for older vehicles and be based on the age of the car. The Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper 8 Example two: 50% non-deductibility of some entertainment rule 25. An example that illustrates the inappropriateness of applying large company business practices to SME employers, plus is unfair, inequitable, inefficient, illogical in itself, and departs from the principles of low tax compliance costs, is the 50% non- deductibility of some entertainment rule. Refer Appendix C for two examples of the inequitable treatment of SME employers. Conclusion 26. I thank the Group for the opportunity to submit on this Paper. I would greatly appreciate the option to appear before the Group in support of this submission. Please contact me on if you wish to discuss any part of this submission or to obtain more background information on any of the points raised. Rachael K Dean ECE Services and Staff Ltd \[1\] \[1\] The Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper 9 Appendix A – Design issues with Capital Gains Tax If you think the Group should design a capital gains tax (CGT) for Government consideration, we need your feedback now on a number of detailed design issues: a) Should the CGT be a separate tax or part of the income tax? Most countries tax capital gains as part of the income tax. Income tax b) Should capital gains be taxed on an accrual basis or only when realised (i.e. only when the asset is sold)? Only when realised. Most countries tax on a realisation basis. How should matrimonial property settlements and disposal of assets on death be treated? Technically should be taxed if realised however consideration could be given to related party relief. c) What assets should be covered given that the terms of reference exclude any tax on the family home? Should it include just rental properties, shares, collectibles, private assets such as cars? Shares and sale of a business should be taxed, these are revenue generating assets. Collectibles -prima facie suspect the cost and complexity of tax calculation and collection would make a tax on collectibles not worthwhile. Plus would need to consider intention - is there intent to make a gain or is the collection essentially for private purposes. Private assets such as cars should not be taxed (unless part of a collection in the event that collections acquired for the purpose of making a gain, become taxable) d) Should assets held by KiwiSaver and other savings schemes be taxed? New Zealand is TTE, most developed countries are EET. Why New Zealand is different should be reviewed as prima facie it is hard to see how TTE is advantageous to most New Zealanders. e) Should assets held offshore be subject to tax? Yes 5 f) How would a capital gains tax integrate with current tax laws, such as when land sales are already taxable, our company imputation system and our CFC/FDR rules? Too complex an issue for me to answer here in the time available. 5 “The UK Government has announced that from April 2019, UK tax will be charged on gains \[corporation tax or CGT\] made by all categories of non-UK resident sellers on both direct and indirect disposals of UK real estate, extending existing more limited rules that apply only to residential property.” So any affected property will need to be rebased The Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper 10 g) When should non-residents be subject to tax? In most cases on realisation of gains. (There may be occasions when a wealth tax is appropriate). h) Should capital losses be ring-fenced to be offset only against capital gains income or should they be offset against any income? If capital gains are taxed on a realisation basis tax base maintenance considerations suggest that capital losses should be ring- fenced. Should be able to be offset against other income, would be inequitable otherwise. Is galling enough to lose on the sale of a business asset (including property) without the added fiscal burden of not being able to deduct the loss for tax. There may be no other capital to offset the loss against hence a small investor, single rental property owner or business owner would never be able to claim their losses whereas those for example with multiple rental properties would eventually make a gain and be able to use their losses. Again this would favour large organisations over SMEs and small investors. i) Should there be roll-over relief allowing capital gains re-invested in similar assets to be treated as unrealised? If so, when should roll-over relief apply? For example, should a farmer selling a farm and buying a new farm be taxed on the increase in value of the old farm? Depends on the assets. Too complex an issue for me to answer here in the time available. j) How should death, emigration and immigration be handled? Too complex an issue for me to answer here in the time available. k) How should gifts and gambling winnings be taxed? As income tax, could consider a special lump sum rate for a lump sum win over a certain amount. l) What should the rate of tax on tax on capital gains be – the normal income tax rates, or some other rate(s)? Normal tax rates. Could consider amount per annum an income equalisation approach for gains over a certain amount e.g. on the sale on retirement of a business of farm. The amount would need to be high enough to exclude gains from the sale of a single residential property. m) Should any allowance be given for inflation in calculating capital gains? Yes. Taxation should be on the real gain. The use of an existing index makes this considerably less complicated than many other tax matters. The Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper 11 n) Should there be a de minimis rule? Don’t believe this is necessary if CGT is part of income tax. o) What administrative implications would there be from a capital gains tax? Too complex an issue for me to answer here in the time available. p) What rules should govern the transition into a capital gains tax? The options seem to be cost of the assets (retrospective taxation of past accrued gains), valuation at date of introduction or only assets acquired post introduction (the Australian rule). Not the Australian rule as is neither equitable nor fair. Any gains made prior to the introduction of CGT would be locked out of being taxed if the base rate was valuation at date of introduction so existing asset holders would not be disadvantaged other than having to have a valuation done (which could be a deductible expense). Valuations are commonly done for other reasons, sale of a business, a Trust requiring an asset etc. q) How should family trusts be integrated into the system? Too complex an issue for me to answer here in the time available.

Every day New Zealanders lose $5.5 million on gambling. That is around $2 billion each year. Half of this, around $1 billion, is lost on pokie machines. b. It is estimated that approximately 54,000 people in New Zealand are gambling at pretty harmful levels. In addition, almost 110,000 people are also experiencing some low levels of harm and would be potentially at risk of further problems in the future. c. New Zealand has more than 18,000 non-casino pokie machines, each of which take in an average of $125 each day. d. The 2006/07 New Zealand Health Survey reports that almost 3% of adults (87,000) had experienced problems due to someone’s gambling in the previous 12 months. e. It is estimated that between five and 10 people are negatively affected by the behaviour of a serious problem gambler. f. One in five New Zealanders feel that someone close to them has had a day or occasion in the past 12 months in which they've spent too much time or money on gambling. g. Māori and Pacific adults are more than three and a half times more likely than adults in the total population to be problem gamblers. h. Two out of five regular pokie players is likely to have a gambling problem. i. The social costs of gambling are out of proportion to the numbers of problem gamblers. Gamblers may commit crimes to finance their gambling, causing harm to their victims and their families as well as themselves, and incurring costs in the criminal justice sector. 6 https://www.hpa.org.nz/what-we-do/minimising-gambling-harm, accessed 26 April 2018 The Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper 14 Appendix D: The 50% non-deductibility of business expenditure by categorising it as entertainment Example One: Staff functions IR268 says “The following types of entertainment include a private element and can't be 100% deducted. In general, an entertainment away from work or out of usual work hours has a private element.... Offsite food and drink - Food and drink provided away from your business premises is only 50% deductible” Issue: Site of staff function 1. An increasing number of SME businesses including employers do not have work premises in the traditional or large employer, sense of the word. Cloud based systems, home based offices, staff who work on clients sites or from their own homes have all combined to increasingly create an environment in which there is no “place of work” at which the employer can have a function for their staff. 2. There is no reasonable logic in any event of the location of a staff function being a determinant of whether a staff functions has a private element. 3. There is no reasonable logic in allowing businesses with premises to fully deduct the cost of light refreshments for staff at a function whereas those without premises cannot. Issue: “out of usual work hours” 1. What are “usual work hours” for a SME? Does “usual work hours” include the evenings and weekends spent stocking shelves, dealing with email queries, taxation matters, payroll preparation, filling web generated orders, communicating with overseas suppliers and customers in different time zones, supporting customers through your helpdesk, and writing submissions to Select Committees and tax working groups? The reality for many SMEs is that there are very few hours that are not “usual working hours”. 2. If a business’s revenue is generated, for example, by chargeable staff time on client sites Monday to Saturday then it may not be possible to hold staff functions at any time other than Sundays or possibly Monday to Saturday evenings. There is no The Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper 15 reasonable logic in the nature of the business, being the determinant of whether a staff function has a private element. 3. There is no private element for a SME owner in hosting, organizing and attending staff functions. Such events are an important part of being a good employer and are business activities. Private activities are time spent with family and friends, pursuing personal interests such as sport or music, reading and so on, things that SME owners have little time for. To not be able to deduct 100% of a business cost because of some flawed logic and understanding about the reality of being a SME employer is risible. Example Two: Deductibility of food and drink at a conference or education course. IR268 says “ You can deduct 100% of the food and drink you provide at a conference, education course or similar event that lasts for four consecutive hours or more (not counting meal breaks).” Using education and training as the example this thinking appears to have been based on the assumption of a large employer with a course not involving significant travel and who can take staff off the job in traditional working hours, say between 8 and 5.30. Issue: travel. Where staff have to travel one or two hours each way to attend a course then the combination of travel time and course is a full day. The course itself spans the lunchtime and it is unreasonable that a business who has staff at dispersed geographical locations cannot claim 100% of food and drink provided simply because the actual training time itself is under four hours Issue : timing of training. SME employers are more likely to run courses and training in the evenings, for example, from six to eight or nine p.m. maybe over a couple of weeks. Providing some food and drink for staff arriving straight from their place of work is appropriate and reasonable, 100% business and should be fully deductible

We support the initiative of the Tax Working Group to involve the public in developing recommendations for the future of New Zealand Tax, and are grateful for the opportunity to share our own recommendations. EDOR recommends that the New Zealand Government tax working group considers new taxes aimed at improving the health of all New Zealanders. These would include a tax on sugar- sweetened beverages and removing GST from certain foods such as fruit and vegetables. Globally, governments are recognizing the urgency of promoting healthy diets, in order to lower the alarming rates of obesity, diabetes and other diet-related noncommunicable diseases. (1) Government led initiatives, such as taxes and subsidies to encourage healthier life styles, are a powerful and cost-effective public health measure that results in both health gains and health care cost savings (2,3) Evidence is mounting to support taxation of products high in sugar, specifically sugar- sweetened beverages. (2,4) Mexico was the first country to introduce a ‘sugar tax’ in 2014. Since then more than a dozen countries as well as independent states have followed their lead in order to tackle the obesity and diabetes epidemic. (4) On the 1st of April this year the United Kingdom also introduced a “soft drinks industry levy”, aimed to reduce consumption, to encourage manufacturers to reformulate sugar-sweetened beverages to contain less sugar, and to focus marketing efforts on products containing less sugar. While we acknowledge that a sugary drinks tax on its own will not solve the obesity and diabetes issue, it is an important first step towards this goal, and a relatively easy initiative to justify, given that sugary drinks offer no nutritional value.

One of the key recommendations that resulted from these public events was the introduction of a sugar tax in New Zealand. A summary of these events, including the recommendations, was published in the New Zealand Medical Journal (publication attached) and is widely supported by colleagues from other New Zealand research institutions.

Taxation is not theft of one’s market income, but is the method of payment for the services that government provides.” What is the purpose of taxation New Zealand has adopted a ‘broad-base, low-rate’ philosophy to tax policy. The concept of this approach is that taxing across a broader base provides for overall lower tax rates. While some tax policy adheres to this approach, there are some significant gaps that challenge the coherence of the approach. The most obvious gap is the almost complete absence of taxes on capital in New Zealand. It is notable that the primary group benefitting from this absence of taxes on capital is the wealthy who own capital assists. The groups most disadvantaged from increases in rates of GST and GST in general are those who have the lowest incomes. It must be acknowledged that a broad-base, low-rate tax regime cannot be achieved when a key component of the tax base i.e capital gains is excluded. A tax system that did more to address this unfairness and unjustified inequality would have several elements. The first is a higher top rate for income tax. New Zealand’s 33% top rate is extremely low internationally (the UK and Australia, for instance, both have a 45% top rate). Other options are to implement the polluters pay principal, but make sure the cost is not passed on to customers. Make sure that harmful practices like smoking, sugary foods, chemical pollution are severely discouraged by taxing the producers. Just because something may not be easy, is no excuse to not do it. We need action and strict regulation. Why wait? EHHA supports a progressive taxation system where people on high incomes and businesses with large profits pay more, while those on low incomes pay less. Flat taxes such as GST hit those on low or fixed incomes the hardest. A fairer system would also include tax on financial transactions. This would also dampen speculation on the financial markets. A fair tax system based on the ability to pay will then provide sufficient revenue to fully fund public services. All New Zealanders would benefit from free education, free health care, and a more stable, secure society. Do we tax the right things? No we don’t! Yes, to a proper capital gains tax on everything except the family home. Also tax companies properly see above). We need a GST reform urgently. It is highly unfair and regressive. In New Zealand we pay GST on ridiculous things, for instance university fees, food, etc. It’s time to reform GST and make it less regressive and more progressive i.e. tax more GST the higher value a good is e.g. expensive cars. We should also remove GST on building material to encourage building and renovating houses. www.ehh-aotearoa.org\[Type text\] 30 th April 2018 \[Type text\] Changing demographics? Changing demographics are irrelevant, if we change to a progressive tax system. We suggest that it is time to return overall to a proper progressive tax system. It is time high income earners paid their fair share. Restore progressivity to the personal income tax system, in particular for anyone earning over, say $5million in a year, a rate of 90%; above $1 million 80%, above $500000 70%, under $20000 no tax. Eliminate all tax loopholes and eliminate tax haven loopholes, both through international bodies such as the OECD, and through putting taxation on a place-of-sale rather than a headquarters basis. Ensure progressivity in corporate taxation so that those corporates earning more than $1 billion pay at least 90% on earnings above that level (similar to proposed personal income tax rates above). Again, measures need to be taken to prevent companies avoiding such taxes by heading offshore: sourcing tax by sales, and careful watching of transfer pricing and of pricing of centrally-charged services, would be necessary accompaniments. We support the following policies:  Introduction of a more progressive income tax regime with tax cuts for the majority of New Zealanders and increased taxes for those on higher incomes.  Restore progressivity to the personal income tax system, in particular for anyone earning over, say $5million in a year at a rate of 90%; above $1 million 80%, above $500000 70% etc. First $20 000 tax free.  Introduce a progressive and selective GST. Immediate elimination of GST on food and education.  “KiwiCare” health tax, whereby 1.3% of total taxable income be treated as dedicated to health.  Introduction of financial transactions tax (FTT) at the low rate of 2 cents per $100, to be charged on withdrawals only, not deposits.  Introduction of capital gains tax. Inheritance tax on amounts over $100 0000, at 20 cents in the dollar.  Increasing taxes on casinos and all other forms of gambling to Australian levels or above.  Introduce taxes on sugar, chemical and other pollution. Some information of EHHA Environmental & Human Health Aotearoa (EHHA) is concerned with the impact of pollution on both ecosystem and human health locally, regionally and globally. Our current focus is on:  chemical, pharmaceutical and biological pollution and waste disposal  water pollution, water rights and water use Please visit our website at www.ehh-aotearoa.org

BACKGROUND This submission is made by the Employers and Manufacturers Association (Northern) Inc. \[EMA\]. EMA’s membership of over 4000 companies, including 1700 manufacturers, is based in the top half of the North Island. Those companies are represented by 7500 operating or business units, which in total employ over 250,000 staff. Our highly diverse membership includes companies and organisations involved in the manufacture, importation, supply, distribution and retail of most product types and the provision of services in a wide range of service sectors including governmental, contractual, tourism, IT, banking, insurance and business advisors. EMA seeks to have the principles of international best practice, and recognition of compliance costs, fully addressed in any legislation. As the leading voice of business in the upper North Island we actively participate in both the submission process and any development of regulatory proposals that may impact on our membership. The EMA is considered the leading employers’ organisation by most business and on issues that affect employment relations. It also takes an active role in cross industry initiatives and cooperates with government activities that will assist or improve the growth and development of business within New Zealand. 2.

Submission The EMA submits the following points to the questions raised by the Tax Working Group in its background paper. We have chosen to address each point raised in the background paper in order to give full weight to our recommendation points under each heading. The Future Environment While some trade protection is evident outside of New Zealand, we are a commodities and trading nation that relies heavily on the external trade to ensure the tax incomes we generate continue to occur. New Zealand is also heavily reliant on international capital investment within the country and tax policies can harm future investment in New Zealand if not carefully applied. New Zealand is increasingly dependent on tourism and the spend by tourists within the country to generate GST however in general terms this sector is not a high wage sector. In the medium term some of this sector can transform to higher wages. We believe it is unlikely that the service parts of the sector will see this occur due to the pressures for tourist operators, accommodation and food and beverage providers to be competitive. In the near to medium future we do not see that these three key aspects of the country’s economy will change. This said, there are changes occurring with growth in sectors such as technology and innovation and even some non-traditional export focused sectors of manufacturing showing significant growth. It is important that tax policy does not stifle the growth sectors and if government truly wishes to see a change to a high wage economy then continued promotion of these sectors is necessary. This may include tax incentives to promote new investment and innovation, however the EMA does believe that tax incentives on their own will not achieve this outcome. Other vehicles are also necessary to generate transformation over time away from a commodities based economy. Tax will not generate the desire for reinvestment in New Zealand business by New Zealanders but it may play a part and reduce New Zealand’s high level of dependence on foreign direct investment. We do not support any form of trade barriers in the form of tax penalties however in order to achieve such outcomes. New Zealand businesses use the internet to reach global markets but this also has the reverse challenge in that the internet already reaches deep into the New Zealand market and will continue to grow in the near future. This globalisation has the potential to both benefit and harm the New Zealand tax base. Tax law around this needs to be robust but flexible as changes will continue to occur and the ways products and services are sold will evolve.

As a country we should not be focused on company tax providing the substantial part of the tax base it currently does. This is in part due to the need for New Zealand’s company tax to be competitive with the global economy. Key points for the future • Tax must not penalise the existing economy in order to drive a transformation to a high wage economy • Tax may be used to incentivise growth in the sectors that will provide higher wage • Inequality is a fact of life in a freely operating market however some targeted tax reduction and redirection of taxes such as working for families can reduce this inequality and is more appropriate than wealth taxes. • Transactional taxes such as GST must be applied evenly but in a way that does not provide either a burden to business or cost more than is recovered for government agencies. • Transaction and income taxes remain the best long term method for retaining the tax base against the growing globalisation created through online sales. • Company tax must be internationally competitive if we are to retain and grown business within New Zealand The purpose and principles of a good tax system Purpose A tax system has the purpose of providing to the government the funds necessary to provide the functions of government for agreed services and facilities, protection and wellbeing of its citizens. A tax system must not over burden its citizens with taxation and must be fair in the application of the taxes on all citizens while providing the funding necessary for government for functions. A tax system should ensure that compliance with the system is maintained but the methods of compliance not be burdensome to the citizens and businesses required to comply. Where ever possible the tax system should tax at source unless the compliance cost in doing so is unfair and for the likes of independent contractors would harm their ability to contract their services. Enforcement is key to a good tax system being maintained Principles The government must identify the budgets it needs to achieve the functions of government and match that expectation to the achievable levels of tax from the tax system.

We believe excessively high tax thresholds has causational effects when in fact high incomes by their very nature will pay significantly more tax even if a flat tax rate were applied. Company tax should match the countries we compete with, in order to retain business investment and continuity within New Zealand. Company tax should be low rather than differing income thresholds as this may provide an incentive of splitting of companies and other adverse outcomes. We support a low tax rate with the natural effect of reducing the imputation credits for New Zealand shareholders as the best way to assist smaller businesses to grow and retain earnings for reinvestment. We recognise that any change in the company tax rate does have a short term effect before the decreased imputation tax credits take effect but the long term effect is more beneficial. Tax should significantly come from transactional taxes. Transaction tax should not have exemptions unless the practical application of the tax to an area would create undue complexity and compliance costs. By example, GST should not have food or other exemptions applied, but may continue to exempt financial transactions or domestic rentals. Key points • Retain a fair and equitable thresholds for personal income that are do not excessively target high incomes • Retain a single tax rate for companies but look to lower that rate to make it highly competitive globally and accepting that the reduced imputation credits would see shareholders paying more tax where personal income tax rates are higher than the company tax rate • Retain transactional taxes such as GST without unnecessary exemptions and aim to have more of the total tax take coming from this form of tax The Current New Zealand Tax System The current tax system is robust but does need to review where the majority of tax comes from. The income tax thresholds are generally accepted as fair for personal income with this providing a significant part of the tax base necessary to retain. The company tax system needs to be reviewed in order to ensure it is competitive and therefore attractive to investors. GST has been established well in New Zealand and the distorting effects that are seen in other jurisdictions around particular socially targeted exemptions have been seen those jurisdictions and businesses operating in them with unduly complex obligations to comply.

For example the UK removed its heating oil exemption from VAT and ultimately even the differing rate for this reason. In Australia we see supermarkets having to take extra time to price the exempt foods from the non-exempt and the difficulties when product crosses over from one category to the other. The existing working for families is effectively a redirection of taxes to those needing support due to low incomes and with families. We recognise this is a social policy and not necessarily something that should be part of the tax system but is applied here due to the efficiency it offers for the employee against the payroll taxes they may pay. Key Points • Retain income tax thresholds at the current levels • Retain GST without exemptions • Whether social policy redirection of taxes under the working for families’ scheme should remain within the tax system should be reviewed with consideration of how it might be more appropriately resourced outside of the tax system. The Results of the Current Tax System The current balance between the productive system and the speculative system is about right. The current bright line test at 5 years does provide an appropriate level of speculative reduction however we believe that the intent of selling for profit has been long standing around speculation for capital gain. The previous lack of visibility of the IRD on these types of transaction has been overcome by both this test and the need for IRD numbers to be recorded. As a result capital gain can be effectively taxed under the existing income tax law. The current system has be adapted over time to reduce the compliance costs to business and this includes the pay as you go system that allows business to pay their tax at the time they file a GST return. We feel this could have been more widely available even for larger companies who have steady year round cash flow in order to reduce the end of year and provisional tax burdens. It is however, the modern accounting systems, which have provided the best compliance cost reductions with their integration to file directly with IRD and direct debits of tax. Removing the manual processes improves significant time costs and we encourage any additional improvements at the operational levels. Such work does not require regulatory change just a willingness to engage with business by IRD in order to develop ongoing improvements. The current cross border situation for purchased goods and services does provide some disparity for local businesses when particularly goods are able to be purchased without GST or any border taxes included due to the value being below the threshold. This is a complex issue where the cost of recovery can outweigh the amount recovered and there is a reliance on the company shipping the goods to correctly declare the value.

This is particularly noted in areas such as conference calling and software able to be purchased only in a foreign currency such as Euro or US currencies and in the latter area only able to be downloaded. The payment for services on bitcoin or other similar crypto currencies is also an area for concern as it can be both tax avoidance and in relation to criminal activities, however action on this would need to be applied internationally by all nations in order to be effective. Key points • The current methods for addressing the speculative versus the productive sector is adequate. • The pay as you go system for company tax should be extended to a wider and higher threshold for those companies that wish to opt in • The issues around cross border transactions and GST need to be resolved to remove the disparities • New Zealand needs to work internationally to address the use of bitcoin or crypto currencies to move transactional money in or out of the country whether legal or illegal. Thinking outside of the system A major issue for the New Zealand tax system is profit shifting and where multinational companies opt where to take most of their profits using licensing fees, management fees or similar fees to reduce the profit within New Zealand. While some may be legitimate it can be difficult to assess whether they are fairly representative of what should be applied to the New Zealand business. Any significant change downward to the company tax rate would discourage such activities and make it more attractive to take the profits within New Zealand. The EMA is strongly opposed to the introduction of any new taxes. The suggestion of including capital gains tax to punish speculation is unnecessary due to the bright line test and the existing tools that have now been established to allow IRD to identify and target those speculators. We believe the existing law is adequate and the application of a new tax adds cost without any real benefit. Other jurisdictions that have applied a capital gains tax still have issues with high housing prices and speculation and therefore there is no quantifiable evidence that such a tax will be effective in New Zealand outside of the current rules. The hypothecation of taxes does have some merit when we look at fuel and road taxes being applied to the areas they were intended. Such Hypothecation does not stop a government applying greater funding for specific projects in order to get them in place earlier. If the taxes on tobacco and alcohol were allocated to health this may be a benefit but given the greater spend required in this area and that in the case of alcohol there are also costs around policing, we believe hypothecation of these is not justified and the consolidated fund can be used.

Key points • No new taxes should be applied • A capital gains tax is unnecessary due to previous changes • Hypothecation of taxes should only be for fuel and road user charges Specific Challenges Most of the points raised in the background paper are suggestions of possible action or focus rather than challenges and only become a challenge if they are seriously being considered for introduction. We have addressed many of the points raised under this heading earlier in this document and explained them at those points. However for the sake of clarity the following points are made to address the suggestions. • Housing affordability is a social issue and tax is not where this needs to be addressed other than to ensure that speculation on housing prices is fairly taxed. The need for IRD to have visibility of house sale transactions by IRD numbers being recorded and the application of the bright line test achieves this • There is no need for a capital gains tax and should it be applied to rental properties it will have the effect of reducing the rental properties available from the private sector. • A land tax has no justification and arguably this is already in place through local council rates. Such an addition to other than the family home will impact on businesses, farmers and rental properties from the private sector. Such a tax will be onerous to apply and will be open to interpretation about when it should be applied meaning the onus will be on the home owner to prove they are actually living at the property. For those with more than one property such as the beach Bach/Crib it is effectively a penalty for having the wealth to own that property. The cost of application of the tax may exceed the tax value collected due to such difficulties. • Environmental taxes are not part of the purpose or principles for a good tax system. The current Carbon tax applied is intended to achieve an outcome of reduced carbon emissions however with the ability to buy credits there is considerable doubt it will achieve such an outcome in the longer term. Companies will seek to be carbon neutral for commercial benefit around their products and services. We believe the carrot versus the stick will provide a better outcome in this area. • We believe having a progressive tax rate for companies will make tax more complex and may drive perverse outcome. We favour a lower tax rate for all business as this will assist greater investment and reinvestment within companies. • We believe that the application of GST should remain across as wide as possible goods and services to keep it simple. There is no evidence that removal of it from produce will drive more to eat healthier. The lost to the tax base will also mean that either income tax must rise or the rate of GST on other goods must rise to compensate. We do not support either of these options.

BACKGROUND This submission is made by the Employers and Manufacturers Association (Northern) Inc. \[EMA\]. EMA’s membership of over 4000 companies, including 1700 manufacturers, is based in the top half of the North Island. Those companies are represented by 7500 operating or business units, which in total employ over 250,000 staff. Our highly diverse membership includes companies and organisations involved in the manufacture, importation, supply, distribution and retail of most product types and the provision of services in a wide range of service sectors including governmental, contractual, tourism, IT, banking, insurance and business advisors. EMA seeks to have the principles of international best practice, and recognition of compliance costs, fully addressed in any legislation. As the leading voice of business in the upper North Island we actively participate in both the submission process and any development of regulatory proposals that may impact on our membership. The EMA is considered the leading employers’ organisation by most business and on issues that affect employment relations. It also takes an active role in cross industry initiatives and cooperates with government activities that will assist or improve the growth and development of business within New Zealand. 2.

Submission The EMA submits the following points to the questions raised by the Tax Working Group in its background paper. We have chosen to address each point raised in the background paper in order to give full weight to our recommendation points under each heading. The Future Environment While some trade protection is evident outside of New Zealand, we are a commodities and trading nation that relies heavily on the external trade to ensure the tax incomes we generate continue to occur. New Zealand is also heavily reliant on international capital investment within the country and tax policies can harm future investment in New Zealand if not carefully applied. New Zealand is increasingly dependent on tourism and the spend by tourists within the country to generate GST however in general terms this sector is not a high wage sector. In the medium term some of this sector can transform to higher wages. We believe it is unlikely that the service parts of the sector will see this occur due to the pressures for tourist operators, accommodation and food and beverage providers to be competitive. In the near to medium future we do not see that these three key aspects of the country’s economy will change. This said, there are changes occurring with growth in sectors such as technology and innovation and even some non-traditional export focused sectors of manufacturing showing significant growth. It is important that tax policy does not stifle the growth sectors and if government truly wishes to see a change to a high wage economy then continued promotion of these sectors is necessary. This may include tax incentives to promote new investment and innovation, however the EMA does believe that tax incentives on their own will not achieve this outcome. Other vehicles are also necessary to generate transformation over time away from a commodities based economy. Tax will not generate the desire for reinvestment in New Zealand business by New Zealanders but it may play a part and reduce New Zealand’s high level of dependence on foreign direct investment. We do not support any form of trade barriers in the form of tax penalties however in order to achieve such outcomes. New Zealand businesses use the internet to reach global markets but this also has the reverse challenge in that the internet already reaches deep into the New Zealand market and will continue to grow in the near future. This globalisation has the potential to both benefit and harm the New Zealand tax base. Tax law around this needs to be robust but flexible as changes will continue to occur and the ways products and services are sold will evolve.

As a country we should not be focused on company tax providing the substantial part of the tax base it currently does. This is in part due to the need for New Zealand’s company tax to be competitive with the global economy. Key points for the future  Tax must not penalise the existing economy in order to drive a transformation to a high wage economy  Tax may be used to incentivise growth in the sectors that will provide higher wage  Inequality is a fact of life in a freely operating market however some targeted tax reduction and redirection of taxes such as working for families can reduce this inequality and is more appropriate than wealth taxes.  Transactional taxes such as GST must be applied evenly but in a way that does not provide either a burden to business or cost more than is recovered for government agencies.  Transaction and income taxes remain the best long term method for retaining the tax base against the growing globalisation created through online sales.  Company tax must be internationally competitive if we are to retain and grown business within New Zealand The purpose and principles of a good tax system Purpose A tax system has the purpose of providing to the government the funds necessary to provide the functions of government for agreed services and facilities, protection and wellbeing of its citizens. A tax system must not over burden its citizens with taxation and must be fair in the application of the taxes on all citizens while providing the funding necessary for government for functions. A tax system should ensure that compliance with the system is maintained but the methods of compliance not be burdensome to the citizens and businesses required to comply. Where ever possible the tax system should tax at source unless the compliance cost in doing so is unfair and for the likes of independent contractors would harm their ability to contract their services. Enforcement is key to a good tax system being maintained Principles The government must identify the budgets it needs to achieve the functions of government and match that expectation to the achievable levels of tax from the tax system.

However, the whakatauki’s real message is to be persistent and not to let obstacles stop you from reaching your goal: we offer our submission as a supportive contribution to the Group and this important kaupapa (cause). We believe a more efficient and equitable tax system is necessary for inclusive growth. That system is achievable in the medium term. The Government will need to make a substantial commitment to tax reform if enduring improvements are to be delivered. New Zealand’s tax system isn’t broken A broad-based income tax with taxing points closely matching cash-flows, a withholding tax based approach, and a comprehensive GST has many benefits. Our tax system has served us well for decades and retains the ability to raise approximately 30% of GDP from our current economy. We do not want the strengths of the existing system to be undermined. See Chapter 1. We do not see the current system as sustainable beyond 2028 The Group’s Terms of Reference require you to consider the economic environment over the next five to ten years. This time frame is too short. Reforms enacted after the 2020 election will have little impact in this period. Instead, our tax system – although able to continue to function well for the next decade – needs to adapt to reflect the changing world over the next several decades: ►Technology is changing the nature of business, and of society, faster than at any time in history. ►Workforces, workplaces and the nature of work are changing. ►Environmental issues, particularly climate change, will shape our future. ►New Zealand society is aging and inequality is increasing. These forces are challenging the broad-base low-rate (“BBLR”) approach and how taxes are collected. They seem to us to set out a likely direction of travel for the tax system – more targeted, greater use of behavioural taxes, flexible, transparent and making more use of technology. In more detail: The future of work Onthe future of work, technological change and the gig economy are leading to more short- term roles and rising numbers of contractors. More automation is on the horizon. That’s both empowering and threatening for workers. For our tax system, we believe there’s a need to re-examine the current employee/contractor definition and rules around the treatment of allowances and work-related expenses. IRD currently estimates the self-employed under- report their income by around 20%. That cannot be allowed to continue. There’s potential for real simplification, and the opportunity to enforce the law by using technology and smart withholding techniques to ensure tax is right first time, every time. See Chapter 2. Taxes and productivity In the long-runour living standards depend on productivity. New Zealand’s productivity growth has lagged behind our competitors for Executive summary Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY2 at least 60 years. BBLR takes no account of productivity enhancing behaviour. There are no easy answers to New Zealand’s productivity deficit, but we suggest targeted measures towards capital intensive investment are worth investigating as a way of attracting and retaining investment capital. We acknowledge any form of incentive has issues but the potential gains could be greater than, for example, a small cut in the headline rate of corporate tax. There could be merits in special rules for infrastructure investment, drawing on the Australian and Singaporean experiences. Small and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”) in particular are often capital constrained. While there is some logic behind calls for a progressive company tax, the UK experience gives rise to pause on its design. We see SMEs as a prime candidate for an integrated tax system. A truly integrated tax system has the potential to remove the significance of entity form for tax purposes and would be essential to the success of any progressive company tax. See Chapter 3. Opportunities for effective environmental taxation New Zealand’s taxes are poorly aligned with the environmental and climate costs of our economic footprint. At 1.3% of GDP, New Zealand’srevenue from environmentally related taxes is among the lowest in the OECD. It is time to assess the role which environmental taxes - on carbon, on energy, on transport – can play in changing human behaviour. See Chapter 4. Capital taxation The current level of wealth inequality challenges the concept of inclusive growth. New Zealand has a private savings shortfall, yet returns from investment are arguably overtaxed. There is a case for tilting the balance of capital taxation from flows – such as interest and dividends – towards stocks – such as land and other stores of wealth. There seems a greater need for tax related tools to address inequality, potentially rebalancing our systemtowards taxing wealth, real income and consumption, and away from taxing nominal incomes. Taxation of capital gains needs to be seen as a part of the overall taxation of capital income and household wealth, not as an isolated issue to address concerns in the housing market. We retain doubts about the worth of a separate capital gains tax (“CGT”) given the family home is to be excluded. See Chapter 5. GST is New Zealand’s most effective tax No tax is perfect, but in our view GST comes close in its efficiency as a revenue raiser. While its horizontal equity has been challenged, we see equity as best examined across the tax system as a whole, with changes to GST on these grounds not justified. See Chapter 6. Time for a new tax reform process? When it comes to the process of tax reform, New Zealand has rightly prided ourselves on theGeneric Tax Policy Process (“GTPP”). GTPP has delivered tax law meeting the objectives of the government of the day. Given the forces changing today’s world, it is now too narrow and too slow. Has the time come for radical reform? See Chapter 7. Established criteria for tax reform retain merit New Zealand is fortunate to have many choices to strengthen our already successful tax system. In making those choices, we endorse the value of established criteria for assessing tax reform. Fiscal adequacy, efficiency, equity and fairness, revenue integrity, compliance and administrative costs and coherence remain important. While trade-offs and weightings between these objectives vary, our suggestions tend to weight efficiency highly. We of course accept others will form different judgments. Our interest in efficiency leads us to suggest the current tax system takes too little account of the impact of taxes on behaviour. Our BBLR tax system is designed to be neutral between activities. In effect, BBLR is a second best approach to taxation. At least in theory, taxes can be designed to alter behaviour in Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY3 efficient, productivity enhancing ways. With ever increasing ability to analyse sophisticated data in real time, there could be opportunities to reform business taxation in productivity enhancing ways. Given the long term focus of the Group, the intergenerational aspects of the Living Standards Framework will also guide decision- makers. The changes we suggest will, in our view, contribute positively to its Four Capitals. See Chapter 8 for a summary of our recommendations. Further analysis needed Many of the matters raised in our submission need further analysis and research before final recommendations can be made, which hasn’t been possible in the time available for submissions. We will play our part in the national conversation. Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY4 Chapter 1 Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY5 “The original concept of taxation was a simple one; taxes were the means of raising revenue for subsequent expenditure by the ruling authority. In a modern society taxation continues to serve this purpose and remains the primary source of the revenue required by the State to ensure the protection, social welfare, and prosperity of its citizens. But as the political and economic structure of society has become more complex so have the responsibilities of Government increased and, as a consequence, taxation now serves far wider purposes than the simple raising of revenue 1 .” Snapshot The New Zealand tax system outperforms those in comparable economies. While sustainable over the next decade, in the medium term the current tax system will find it increasingly difficult to finance spending at around 30% of GDP. Recommendations 1. Endorse and use established criteria to assess whether the tax system is sustainable. 2. Draw on the Living Standards Framework as a pointer for future work, but not yet for policy recommendations – it remains insufficiently developed. 3. Changes should first be assessed against whether they will damage our existing strong position. Fifty-one years ago, the Ross Committee - this Group’s predecessors - set out the central dilemma for tax policymakers. A tax system needs to generate revenue, but that alone is not sufficient. How should the Group think through the inevitable trade-offs and complexity? 1 The Ross Committee (1967) Report of the Taxation Review Committee. EY sees five key principles for sustainable tax reform 1.The tax system should be capable of raising sufficient revenue to fund the operations of government. 2.Taxes should be raised in a way that is least detrimental to inclusive and sustainable growth. 1.Framework for a good tax system Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY6 3.Changes to the tax framework must have broad community support and buy-in, which in turn requires our tax system to be clearly progressive. 4.The tax framework needs to be robust, yet adaptable, to changing social, economic and technological trends and developments. 5.The tax system and reforms to it should be consistent and coherent, administratively efficient and operationally transparent. These principles apply regardless of the efficiency of governments in determining operating costs. Benchmarking New Zealand’s tax system The New Zealand tax system is not currently broken. In our judgment, it outperforms systems in comparable economies such as Australia. Applying the established criteria for tax reform: 2 Benchmarking approach The scale (1 to 5 on the benchmarking chart) indicates how our tax system performs across established criteria – with a score of 5 representing absolute best practice and zero an absolute failure across a particular dimension. We do not expect all tax systems to target a score of 5 across all dimensions. There are trade-offs. For example, a tax system with a high degree of revenue integrity is likely to face high compliance costs and fall short of maximum efficiency due to complex anti-avoidance legislation. A system which raises little revenue by design may well have a narrow tax base due and therefore be simple to administer, but is unlikely to achieve horizontal equity. 2 At 19 of the Paper. 0 1 2 3 4 5 Fiscal adequacy Efficiency Vertical equity Horizontal equityRevenue integrity Compliance and administration...

Tax revenues currently meet government’s public finance objectives and, in general, have done so for many years. None.The changing nature of economies and a failure of the tax system to evolve will means it becomes increasingly difficult over time to finance the level of spending the community expects.

In a world where it is difficult to measure and isolate taxpayer elasticities, the BBLR system is a good second best. Boost from pending R&D tax incentive (if well- designed and administered). Challenges from potential digital economy taxes, pending BEPS reforms. In a globalised world there is mobility of economic activity – both in capital and labour. In the medium term the tax system will have to be re-balanced in favour of indirect taxes relative to income taxes. Business taxation will need to be reassessed. The current model of a source-based approach to taxing business profits may need to be adapted to alternative approaches better able to incorporate digital presence factors. Equity ↔ ↘ Reality and perceptions about equity both essential to sustainable reform. Capital taxes have not been fully integrated into New Zealand’s tax system, which cannot be categorised as taxing those in similar circumstances in an equal way. Whether income is earned via a PIE, company, trust or individual affects tax liability; income from employment, self- employment, gifts, inheritances or capital gains are all taxed differently. Ambiguous effects from potential CGT. Challenges from growth in territorial taxation.

Technology could both simplify and complicate aspects of compliance. Coherence ↘ Components of the tax system need to sit well when working together. A BBLR system minimises boundaries, with different forms of income taxed similarly. Pressure points exist around the capital/revenue boundary, notably for property transactions, differential treatment of entities (such as PIEs and Māori authorities) and cross-border taxation. Pending BEPS reforms, potential CGT excluding family home. Likely need to redesign building blocks of international tax to take account of digital world and changing balance between direct and indirect taxes. Our changing world As the nature and structure of the economy and society changes over time, the tax system must adapt in parallel. Just as GST was introduced as part of a wholesale reform to a broken and outdated tax system, new challenges are unfolding for the revenue base as digital transformation reshapes many aspects of economic activity. It is changing the way people interact and is raising important issues around jobs and skills, and privacy and security, as well as opening up new opportunities for value creation and fostering new and transformed business models. The Government could do well to stand still when faced with these challenges though New Zealand cannot stand still for ever. However, a tax system which fails to raise sufficient revenue – whatever its other merits – is a failed tax system. Changes should first be assessed 3 Refer World Bank Doing Business Guide, OECD comparisons. 4 On the subjective life satisfaction measure used by the OECD (the share of people who report a life satisfaction level below 4 (on a 0/10 scale)), New Zealand outranks all other OECD countries. 5 These statistics are taken from: OECD (November 2017) How’s Life in New Zealand, OECD Publishing, Paris, on which the Living Standards Framework draws with approval. against whether they will damage our existing strong position. Using the Living Standards Framework The Living Standards Framework provides a tool for policy makers, although it’s not in our view sufficiently developed to act as a guide for specific policy recommendation. A well-designed tax system will have a positive impact on all four living standards quadrants - natural, human, social and financial/physical. Taking a Living Standards approach, on average we’re well-satisfied with life 4 . Even so, human and social capital problems which should be examined include 5 : ►Jobs- labour market insecurity remains relatively high compared to 2005, and the incidence of job strain has risen by almost Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY9 7 percentage points. Working hours are long and time off limited. What implications do the current working environment and the future of work have for our tax system? ►Earnings – real earnings growth is moderate and earnings remain low by OECD standards. Ultimately, earnings are driven by productivity. Can the tax system help us become more productive? ►Housing affordability – a longstanding problem, which has worsened in the past decade, with the proportion of income spent on housing costs increasing from 25.8% in 2005 to 26.2% in 2014. Is this a tax problem? We have overlaid the Four Capitals within the Living Standards Framework as a directional tool when assessing the impact of our various recommendations in Chapter 8. Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY10 Chapter 2 Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY11 “A tsunami of change is coming, and we need to prepare now so that no one is left out or left behind.” 6 Snapshot The gig economy is seeing more short-term roles and rising numbers of contractors. That’s leading both to empowered workers benefitting from flexibility and to an increasingly insecure workforce. The next step is likely to be a greater use of automation, but the speed of transition in New Zealand should not be overstated. Recommendations 1. Tax reforms should allow for flexibility in working arrangements. 2. One option would be to create a class of “dependent contractors”; those who have a contractor relationship, but are effectively under a high degree of control. 3. Simplify the tax obligations for dependent contractors, potentially by way of restricting deductions. 4. Develop smart withholding techniques to replicate income tax for dependent contractors (and potentially contractors in general). 5. Apply “dependent contractor” status in a standardised way across all employment laws. 6. Use technology, such as Blockchain, to strengthen integrity of tax administration for individuals. Our working world is undergoing significant shifts. The future of work provides a nuanced challenge to our tax system. Quiet concerns of the recent past will come increasingly to the fore. Contractors and the gig economy Contractors are becoming a significant 6 Andrew Little,The Future of Work, New Zealand Labour Party (2016). 7 EY (2016)Is the gig economy a fleeting fad, or an enduring legacy? Ernst & Young, Oceania. proportion of the workforce. Forty percent of organisations expect to increase their use of contingent workers by 2021, with 25% expecting to have 30% or more of their workforce made up of them 7 . Labour’s Future of Work Commission reports the insecure workforce in New Zealand to be as high as 30% 2.The future of work Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY12 as of 2015 8 . Traditional approaches to employment tax will not in the long-term assist with driving inclusive growth in a modern economy. Nor will they collect tax as easily as in the past. Why is the gig economy growing? The model of part-time contractors who hold more than one job is not new. Seasonal agriculture, oil and gas, and other primary industries have been employing similar models for decades 9 .We are seeing more of this trend because there is a significantly increased demand for that type of work. Both employees and employers are increasingly attracted to a contingent workstyle. Lifestyle is one of the key drivers of demand for gig work. Working in the contingent workforce brings an increased degree of freedom over working days. People increasingly dislike the “nine to five” way of working. From EY reports, we know that 80% of contingent workers see flexibility as the top benefit 10 . Clearly there is an increasing attraction for individuals to shift towards this style of work. Employers see the benefits of gig workers in the workforce as well. Industries that have employed the model for much longer, such as in agriculture, have done so in response to booms and busts in seasonal demand. While many businesses do not run to the season of crops, there are still seasonal elements. Demand for information technology professionals will peak when new systems need to be rolled out, but in between these updates these skills are surplus to employers. Forty-two percent of businesses surveyed reported they were using contingent workers to meet these needs 11 . There is also increasing demand for specific skills for specific projects. More freelance experts are being demanded by companies to satisfy a need for expertise not otherwise available in-house. Our reports indicate that 56% of businesses use contingent workers for this purpose 12 .Digital recruitment tools are also making it much easier to fill these gaps. 8 The Future of Work, New Zealand Labour Party. 9 Is the gig economy a fleeting fad, or an enduring legacy? At 6 10 Is the gig economy a fleeting fad, or an enduring legacy? At 12 11 At 9 EY operates a platform called GigNow – a global project based employment portal for opportunities with us. This style of recruitment is becoming more common. What external forces will influence this change? During the economic downturn of 2008 businesses became attracted to the minimisation of cost that contractual work provides. EY reports show among the S&P 500 organisations, the growth of employment of fulltime workers slowed by nearly a third (2.7% growth, down from 3.9% prior to the recession) 13 . For those affected by this, contract work offered an attractive option. Discovering the benefits of contract work, many have stayed on even after economic recovery. Recessions are often said to occur, on average, every ten years. With New Zealand’s last recession being in 2008/09, it is possible we could see an economic slowdown with a degree of financial hardship within the next decade. We are highly likely to see another frontier push by the gig economy in such an event. It is crucial that the Group recognises the impact this movement is having, and will have, in the work force. Automation, low wage workers and the near-future The future of work is increasingly challenged by a global trend towards automation. With labour costs for companies growing in many areas, and automated systems becoming cheaper and more reliable, automation is becoming an increasingly attractive way to shrink costs. Why has there been comparatively little automation? Low-skill workers are still comparatively cheaper than machines in many processes. The cost of an employee in New Zealand on the minimum wage is $660 per 40 hour work week. 14 Attaching variable costs such as training and fringe benefits the employee is 12 At 9 13 At 6 14 Employment New Zealand,Current Minimum Wage Rates, sourced at 20 April 2017: https://www.employment.govt.nz/hours-and- wages/pay/minimum-wage/minimum-wage-rates/ Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY13 often still more competitive than the costs of implementing and maintaining an automated system. Indirect costs also pose significant barriers to entry for mass automation. For example, self- service checkouts in supermarkets have been a common sight for years, yet most checkouts are still operated by low wage employees. Self- service checkouts are responsible for a significant increase in theft, with a lack of human oversight emboldening shoppers. 15 The cost of this is significant when tallied, with nearly one in three shoppers reporting some degree of theft. 16 Similar unforeseen costs and inefficiencies are common across all industries, and significantly decrease the attractiveness of automation. However, at the point where the costs associated with training and maintaining employees outstrips the cost of automation, businesses are highly likely to automate those positions. Further, as the rate of innovation increases, the rate at which companies can minimise the indirect costs of automation will increase as well, incentivising automation. New Zealand as a target for automation testing New Zealand is an attractive testing ground for new processes. New Zealanders are (on a global scale) highly educated, have high incomes and speak English. We share a strong similarity with consumers of key markets such as the US and the UK. Our relative distance from those key markets is important too. The poor reception of a particular new process or product influences the opinion of consumers in California less than the same reception coming from customers in another state of America. Because of this New Zealand is often the first consideration as a test environment for tech companies. Facebook and Microsoft are increasingly testing more features and apps in our market first and making changes to their models from our reactions. 17 15 Emmeline Taylor (2016)Supermarket self- checkouts and retail theft: The curious case of the SWIPERS,British Society of Criminology. 3. 16 At 4 17 The Economist (2015),Kiwis as Guinea Pigs, sourced 19 April 2017 at: Wages increasing the speed of automation New Zealand has recently announced it will increase its minimum wage to $20 by 2021. With a 27% increase in the cost of minimum wages the cost of each employee will shrink significantly compared to automated systems. In a global environment conscious of the cost saving potential of automated systems, New Zealand will present a timely test environment for these systems. We are likely to see a unique degree of labour displacement in the coming years. More and more New Zealanders in low-wage employment will change the nature of their work, and in turn, change the nature of the working world around them. What form that work is likely to take is a broad and difficult question, but it will certainly increase the population of those participating in a more mobile and digitally- dependent workforce. Growing difficulty with the tax process For those participating in this kind of work there is a growing difficulty in reporting tax properly. Many individuals transitioning into the contingent work force have never been responsible for their own reporting – relying on PAYE to manage their obligations where such reliance can be misplaced. Recent research by IRD and Victoria University highlights this issue, estimating the average underreporting of self- employed and contractual workers at 20% on average. 18 As emphasised in that report however, this does not necessarily mean that is wholly the result of intentional underreporting. The same research indicates 90% of New Zealand’s workforce feels that properly paying tax is the right thing to do. The figures indicate there is a significant proportion of this population of taxpayers that are simply making mistakes. IRD has recognised the need to simplify the tax process, especially for the contingent workforce. https://www.economist.com/news/business/216518 58-small-technophile-country-great-place-test-digital- products-kiwis-guinea-pigs 18 Victoria University (2018),Estimating self- employment income-gaps from register and survey data: Evidence for New Zealand, Victoria University Press. Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY14 The future of workplace tax The greatest challenge we face is ensuring we don’t throttle innovation in the working world with a taxation structure that is too inflexible. New Zealand is often praised as a world leader in its taxation structure – we should endeavour to maintain this reputation. A blurred line – who is an employee and who is a contractor? The current legal scheme for determining who is a contractor and who is an employee is too ambiguous. With the scheme dependent on interpreting case law rather than legislation businesses and contractors are often confused. If the trend towards increased gig work continues we need to clarify who a contractor is for tax reporting purposes. What solutions might exist? In the case of contingent workers, there can be real confusion as to who is ultimately responsible for withholding and reporting tax. Legislative intervention to create new classifications of workers would be highly helpful. There is a compelling case from a recent UK report to create a classification of “dependent contractor”; those who have a contractor relationship as per the current scheme, but with a higher emphasis on the degree of control. 19 A new class such as this would allow for the proper classification of contingent workers, and attach to those individuals specific reporting requirements. 20 As the contingent workforce grows the number of individuals with personal reporting obligations will grow. Importantly, this will mean the population of contractors will be comprised increasingly of individuals who historically had their tax obligations handled by their employer. The risk of these individuals getting their tax obligations wrong is likely to be high. IRD will be faced with an increasingly large task of investigation if this is not resolved. In the interests of an equitable and efficient taxation system, we would stress the importance of a change. 19 Mathew Taylor (2017),Good Work: The Taylor Review of Modern Working Practices, Royal Society of Arts. 35. 20 At 35 One possibility could be to replicate the position of employees – no tax deductions for costs associated with delivering services as a dependent contractor. If this is seen as a step too far, deductions could be simplified and standardised. Innovations in tax collection With many of the more ambiguous gig economy roles facilitated by the digital economy there is scope for experimenting with methods of withholding tax at the point income is earnt. Russia has recently implemented a Value Added Tax (VAT) that specifically targets the provision of digital services. 21 Where a digital service is provided to a Russian resident, regardless of the country of residency of the digital service provider, the value of the service is taxed at 15.25%. 22 The tax is deducted at the point of the sale, but rather than the tax being withheld by the service provider, it is immediately debited to the Russian Government. 23 This system has allowed the Russian Government to effectively create an income tax withholding system for gig workers. This system has the potential to significantly minimise the revenue lost from reporting errors. It also provides a valuable asset in real- time data of earnings of contractors, allowing smarter policy to be formed into the future. New Zealand could greatly smooth the reporting obligations of those who are confused by their reporting obligations by exploring a similar model. The changing demands of employment rights One of the core benefits an employee has over a contractor is access to statutory employer requirements. An employer must pay at time and a half over holidays, to provide a minimum number of days off in a given year, and to provide KiwiSaver contributions to an employee’s scheme. Contingent workers are increasingly reporting that while they enjoy the 21 EY (2018),Russia revises VAT rules for electronic services provided by foreign companies, Ernst & Young Russia. 2. 22 At 2. 23 At 3. Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY15 relative freedom gig work offers, the loss of these benefits is a significant concern. 24 There have been many challenges to the legal status of gig workers during the past four years, and different jurisdictions with similar legal frameworks have come to very different answers. 25 As a result, there are serious concerns for businesses with large populations of gig workers. By clarifying the rights of gig workers with tighter employment relationships than status-quo contractors we would ensure that disputes about proper classification are minimised. There is a distinction between who is a contractor for tax purposes and who is a contractor for employment rights purposes, but this is often misunderstood. In the interests of both equity and efficiency it is our view there would be significant value in aligning the definitions. Should there be a review of the classifications for tax purposes, this should be replicated for employment rights as well. Blockchain as a solution One of the biggest vulnerabilities of the tax system to the growth of the contingent workforce comes from the wide spread of tax information. Information needed to properly complete a return is required from many sources, and the more people responsible for providing information the more likely you are to see errors or double ups in data. Where there are errors, people (intentionally or unintentionally) will under report taxable income by going with the most favourable set of information. An interesting solution to this problem is Blockchain. The diagram overleaf demonstrates how this system might work. 24 Is the gig economy a fleeting fad, or an enduring legacy? At 13. How might Blockchain be utilised? As the diagram shows, the most significant benefit of Blockchain in tax reporting is that it requires everyone to update just one source of information. Blockchain also allows you to specify who is and isn’t allowed to alter information, ensuring self-interested or careless individuals cannot interfere with proper reporting. By doing both of these things reporting can be made much easier for everyone involved, while also minimising otherwise significant administrative costs. Further IRD would have access to a much tidier pool of information, making its role of verifying reporting much less burdensome, and making investigating fraud or errors much easier The Future of Government Assistance Given the trend of automation, in the long run there is likely to be a rise the number in marginalised workers. Demographic trends dictate there will be many older New Zealanders, with more complex needs and requiring a higher standard of care. We predict higher demands will be placed on government assistance in future decades and fewer employees in the traditional sense. As this trend grows, income sourced exclusively from employment is going to become increasingly scarce. We don’t have a ready solution without making radical changes to the tax and transfer system going beyond the Group’s mandate. 25 University of Oxford (2017),The Employment status of Uber Drivers, University of Oxford, Oxford. 13-95.

A country’s ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker 26 .” Snapshot New Zealand’s productivity growth has lagged our competitors for at least 60 years. That feeds through to the living standards of us all. Ensuring the tax system doesn’t inhibit productivity and innovation can play a part in inclusive growth over the next decades. Our current BBLR system takes no account of productivity enhancing behaviour. Recommendations 1. Consider reforms to the corporate tax system to enhance productivity. 2. To that end, further investigation of: a. Targeted measures which may have a more significant impact on business investment, b. Bespoke rules for SMEs based on the integration principle, and c. Whether design challenges associated with progressive corporate tax rates for SMEs can be overcome. 3. Consider rebalancing taxes towards immobile factors such as land. 4. Where possible, tax at the corporate level should be fully integrated with tax at the ownership level: a. For smaller businesses, seek to achieve full integration. b. For larger businesses, imputation remains the best approximation of integration. c. Extend Māori authority regime to include wholly owned subsidiaries. 5. New Zealand should respond to tax challenges caused by digitalisation of the economy: a. Investigate nexus, profit allocation rules and place of consumption for digital businesses. 26 Paul Krugman (1994),The Age of Diminishing Expectations,MIT Press, New York. 3.Taxes and productivity Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY19 b.Monitor digital services tax developments, for example, current EU proposals. 6. Radical reform to New Zealand’s corporate tax base or taxation of SMEs is not currently required. Note these recommendations are finely balanced, as: 1. Economic literature provides sufficiently strong advice on a general direction of reform, but not on the size or enduring growth effect. 2. Studies are not based on New Zealand data so take little or no account of imputation. 3. Other policy priorities, such as coherence or ease of administration may outweigh the productivity benefits of corporate tax reform. 4. Both economic theory and country practice will develop in the next decade. Other countries may overcome the practical and theoretical challenges of radical reform. In that case, New Zealand should consider becoming a fast follower of other productivity enhancing reforms. New Zealand’s current tax structure aims to be coherent. In general, it: ►taxes a broad base of income at low rates, ►makes extensive use of withholding taxes at times close to the associated cash flows, ►attempts a neutral treatment between different assets and entities, and ►historically sought to align the tax rate of entities with the top personal tax rate. BBLR is a second-best approach to taxation There is much to be said for this simple neutral treatment. But it is not perfect.“In principle, the most efficient taxes are not broad-based and low-rate taxes but taxes whose rates are higher the less sensitive are activities to tax (or, in economists’ jargon, the less elastic are activities).” 27 New Zealand has backed away from seeking to tax more efficiently in favour of using a broad- based, low-rate approach because governments over several decades have doubted their ability to make distinctions based on elasticities or on value judgments around fairness. But is that selling New Zealand productivity potential short? New Zealand depends on 27 Victoria University (October 2009),Company tax issues facing New Zealand: Background paper for Session 4 of the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group, Victoria University Press, Wellington. 28 For New Zealand, FDI is the main form of inbound equity investment. As at December 2015 the stock of foreign direct equity investment was $66.4 billion and the stock of FPI equity investment was $33.5 billion. inbound investment 28 for which there is no obvious best means of taxation. Many commentators have concerns about the high levels of capital taxation and some economic models suggest it is optimal for a Small-Open Economy (SOE) such as New Zealand to levy no tax on inbound capital. We are not suggesting zero taxation on inbound investment or that economics gives a strong case for substantially lower capital taxation. We are, though, suggesting the time is right to reassess whether our system of corporate taxation could do more to enhance productivity. In particular: ►Does our relatively high corporate tax rate reduce productivity? ►Is there a case for targeted investment incentives given the potential importance of keeping the corporate tax rate high? ►Is there a case for differential taxation of small, domestically owned businesses, based on the integration principle? ►Should our tax base be rebalanced towards immobile factors of production such as land? Existing policy choices New Zealand has already chosen to depart from neutral, broad based, low rate taxation for Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY20 fairness, efficiency or coherence reasons in certain areas: ►The top personal tax rate has not been aligned with the corporate tax rate since the 1999/2000 income year 29 . ►The PIE rules set a maximum tax rate for investment vehicles of 28%. ►The income of a Māori authority is taxed at 17.5%. ►Charities are not taxed on trading income. ►R&D activities will shortly be in receipt of a 12.5% tax incentive. ►Certain capital gains are not taxed, with - in the case of the family home – an all- party agreement not to tax them. We therefore have form when it comes to adapting BBLR as evidence emerges that such changes are necessary. Importance of productivity New Zealand’s productivity has been in a period of relative decline for at least the Past 60 years, during which time we have gradually drifted down the OECD productivity ladder (we’re now 21st). 30 While our national income can be divided in different ways, and there are real questions about inequality, without growth in that national income, living standards – however measured – will remain below those in richer countries. Any moves towards greater fairness depend ultimately on increasing productivity. “Generally speaking, the higher the productivity of a country, the higher the living standards that it can afford and the more options it has to choose from to improve wellbeing. Wellbeing can be increased by things like quality healthcare and education; excellent roads and other infrastructure; safer communities; stronger support for people who need it; and improved environmental standards.” 31 29 The period of non-alignment – 18 years and counting – now exceeds that of alignment (11 years). 30 OECD Productivity Indicators (2017). 31 Productivity Commission (2017)Why is productivity important?,accessed 9 April 2018 from: https://www.productivity.govt.nz/about-us/why-is- productivity-important Lifting productivity is a priority for the current Government. There is no single way to achieve this, and we would not argue tax settings are central to productivity. Even so, factors include an attractive business environment, investment and smart technology. Tax can influence these factors. Corporate tax rate can impact on economic growth The economic literature around corporate taxes and growth has limitations. Nevertheless, it paints a suggestive picture. Generally speaking, several propositions emerge: ►Tax increases appear to reduce growth. ►Tax increases appear to reduce investment more than consumption as components of GDP (although both fall). ►The effect is heterogeneous in that smaller firms are more impacted in their investment decisions than larger firms, possibly supporting a progressive/differentiated corporate tax. ►The tax rates of a country negatively affect decisions to direct investment in that country. We accept these studies do not directly account for imputation systems, that high corporate taxes may be required to keep New Zealand’s tax system coherent, and that location-specific economic rents and sunk investment costs provide reasons to keep New Zealand’s corporate tax rate high. Probably the leading macroeconomic study in this area (Romer and Romer) 32 demonstrates the negative effect an increase in tax levels has on growth. Investment appears to be more sensitive to tax levels than consumption as noted above. Arnold et al 33 draw similar conclusions in a more policy-based paper. This paper sets out to 32 Romer, Christina D. and Romer, David H (2010), The Macroeconomic Effects of Tax Changes: Estimates Based on a New Measure of Fiscal Shocks, American Economic Review 100. 763–801 33 Jens Matthias Arnold, Bert Brys, Christopher Heady, A ̊sa Johansson, Cyrille Schwellnus and Laura Vartia (February 2011),tax policy for economic Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY21 consider the implication of tax structures on long-run growth. It uses a panel of 21 OECD countries over 34 years to estimate the effect of tax structure on growth in the short and medium run. It also takes a look at micro mechanisms by using data at industry and firm level to estimate the effect of tax structure on investment and productivity growth, which the researchers consider to be the two main drivers of economic growth. Findings: ►Empirically, economic growth can be increased by gradually moving the tax base towards consumption and immovable property. ►Ranking of tax instruments for growth (from least to most harmful): ►Recurrent taxes on immovable property. ►Consumption taxes and other property taxes. ►Personal income taxes. ►Corporate income taxes. While such studies appear robust at an aggregate level it is fair to note there is scepticism about the ability to place strong reliance on them through the need to control for outside factors such as the economic cycle, or changes in the quantum and incidence of tax through planning. It is also unclear whether the growth impact would endure beyond the short-run (say five to ten years). Corporate tax impact on investment location choices Anecdotally, we already see US tax reform influencing investment location decisions among our clients. This is backed up by the Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation. Taxes and the Location of Targets 34 . This demonstrates how the corporate tax rates of a host country and the tax system of the acquirer’s country (territorial or worldwide) affects the merger and acquisition target recovery and growth, The Economic Journal, 121 F59–F80, choices of domestic and multinational enterprises. Findings include: ►Host country tax rates have a negative effect on the probability of an acquisition in that country. ►But where the corporate rate of the target is lower than the acquirer’s country, and when the acquirer’s country operates a worldwide tax system that allows a credit for foreign tax paid, the corporate tax of the target country plays a much less significant role, or no role at all. While the study does not take account of imputation, imputation credits are of little use to overseas investors, therefore its conclusions remain broadly valid. We understand the strong reasons for continuing to charge high levels of corporate tax on foreign investment, including location-specific economic rents, sunk costs of existing investment, coherence of our tax system, and perceived equity issues. No immediate cut to corporate taxes The various reservations are sufficiently strong and the economic case insufficiently compelling for us to recommend an immediate cut in corporate taxes. One reason is that our existing, well- functioning, imputation rules mean much of the of a corporate tax rate benefit might flow offshore. Also, the revenue and growth from new investment would take time to emerge. The issue is one to keep under medium-term review. Tax incentives Is there a case, alternatively, to target interventions towards capital intensive investment? Historically, most tax incentives have failed but there may now be grounds to revise that viewpoint: ►Globally, interest in incentives is increasing, there are valid grounds for that interest, and proper targeting and design is essential to the success of an incentive. 34 Arulampalam, W, Devereux, M, and Liberini F (2017),Taxes and the Location of Targets WP 17/04, Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation. Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY22 ►The strongest case for incentives appears to be as a form of tax competition in a constrained world, as a way of attracting and retaining investment capital. Targeting reduced taxes at the most mobile forms of capital may be a rational position. ►The test for the beneficial impact on investment by firms benefiting from tax incentives should be analysed in light of the effect of aggregate investment. ►Availability of sophisticated data, analysed in real time, gives a better chance of designing and administering a smart, targeted incentive than ever before. This is a new factor, giving advocacy of tax incentives to alter behaviour greater weight than before. This is a subtle argument – it’s not as clear-cut as “tax incentives = good for business”. We acknowledge tax incentives are fraught with risks, including their use by immobile local firms, distortions of capital allocation, increased complexity, administrative difficulty and reduced transparency around effective tax rates. These drawbacks will need to be traded off against the potential economic advantages of being able to combine raising high capital income taxes while remaining competitive for mobile activity. Incentive design Any incentives should be transparent, predictable and stable over time if they are to influence investment decisions. That tends to support investment allowances and tax credits rather than tax holidays, financing incentives, special economic zones or tariff/trade tax exemptions. Generous depreciation schemes or capital allowances/tax credits tend to work well for marginally profitable capital intensive projects, which could be relevant given New Zealand’s infrastructure shortfall. Infrastructure Infrastructure is an area of particular interest. The costs of delay are substantial. Adequate infrastructure is a key element of enhanced productivity, which augments population and participation to build economic growth 35 . Transport infrastructure to enhance the logistics of transporting goods, and people located in cities, is as important as communications and other social infrastructure. If enabling infrastructure development during the last ten years was characterised as being a question of financing (“how should the investment be structured?”), then the next decade is likely to be about funding (“who has the desire to cover the cost?”) Many infrastructure projects are too big to be funded within New Zealand: an international component is essential. Currently, infrastructure funding tends to occur through special purpose vehicles. Would a more nuanced tax system help to speed infrastructure development? Is it worth giving up some tax revenue now in exchange for the economic advantages of faster infrastructure development in the future? Many potential international infrastructure funders are tax exempt. Any New Zealand tax impost on sovereign wealth funds or pension funds is likely to be irrecoverable and to act as a disincentive to New Zealand investment. The case for special treatment of inbound infrastructure investors is strong. As a counter argument, allowing international investors access to special treatment can be seen as problematic. Various countries have sought to reconcile the need for foreign direct investment into infrastructure with appropriate domestic tax collections. The recent Australian experience shows both sides of the equation. 35 The Australian Treasury uses the 3Ps of population, productivity and participant as key factors in driving economic growth: see the for example Where is the Growth Going to Come From? Reserve Bank Assistant Governor (Economic) – 15 November 2017, at https://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2017/sp-ag- 2017-11-15.html Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY23 Example: Productivity and the infrastructure investment pipeline in Australia Innovative financing approaches are having a greater role in Australian infrastructure development and the PPP model, encouraging private sector investment and outcomes for state and local governments. Australian governments have used multiple funding mechanisms to finance infrastructure development including asset sales, debt, PPPs, federal grants, value capture and concessional loans. PPP investment opportunities attract Australian superannuation funds (pension funds) and international investors. When combined with existing concessions used by foreign pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, some foreign investors can pay tax rates of 15% or less (in some cases, almost tax-free), rather than 30% on Australian business income. 36 There has been concern about the overall income tax framework as, over recent years, a growing number of taxpayers have sought to re-characterise trading income into more favourably taxed passive income. 37 The use of stapled structures to access reduced Managed Investment Trust (“MIT”) withholding tax has been the subject of Australian Taxation Office and Government scrutiny. 38 This led to the release of a revised Australian Taxation Office infrastructure investment framework on 31 January 2017 and recent announcement of integrity measures to apply from 1 July 2019 to limit access to the lower MIT rate, with 36 Levelling the playing field for Australian investors: Taxation of Stapled Structures http://sjm.ministers.treasury.gov.au/media- release/024-2018/ 37 https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?DocID= TPA/TA20171/NAT/ATO/00001 38 The MIT regime was aimed at increasing the attractiveness of Australia’s fund management industry (especially commercial and retail property funds) to mobile foreign investment. It did this by lowering the withholding taxes on certain distributions of passive income to foreign investors, particularly rental income. In recent years, the transitional rules for certain existing projects. 39 Example: Singapore tax based incentives to help fund infrastructure development Singapore sees infrastructure financing incentives as important. It has a package of discretionary tax incentive schemes for project and infrastructure finance which are targeted to promote the attractiveness of non-bank infrastructure financing for investors seeking alternatives for long-term investments in infrastructure-related projects in Asia. The incentives include: ►Exemption of qualifying income from qualifying project debt securities ►Exemption of qualifying income from qualifying infrastructure projects or assets received by approved entities listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX), and ►A 10% concessionary tax rate on qualifying income derived by an approved infrastructure trustee manager or fund management company from managing qualifying SGX-listed business trusts or infrastructure funds in relation to qualifying infrastructure projects or assets. withholding tax rate has generally been 15 per cent. It followed that foreign investors in certain stapled business structures could also access reduced withholding rates on certain passive income (rather than be effectively subject to tax at the corporate tax rate) if the trust side of the staple was a qualifying withholding MIT. These stapled structures included a broad range of infrastructure projects including in social infrastructure and privatisation of Government businesses. 39 Tax treatment of stapled structures https://treasury.gov.au/publication/p2018- t273732/ Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY24 Integration and Imputation Business taxation can follow one of two broad approaches – taxing the business in its own right or attributing that tax base directly to its owners – in substance, integrating the company with its owners. In principle, we prefer the latter approach, as it allows the individual circumstances of the owners to be taken into account. Look-through treatment is not always possible, particularly where there are many owners. And it may not always be desirable, for example, where New Zealand wishes to tax income beneficially owned by non-residents on a withholding basis. Imputation provides an effective step towards integration for domestic residents and we endorse its retention. An imputation system therefore reduces the case for a corporate tax cut. One possible improvement would be to allow for refundability of surplus imputation credits to New Zealand tax residents as fiscal conditions allow. This would be a step towards integration. The default tax treatment for widely-held entities should be the corporate treatment (including approximations of that treatment). The default tax treatment for closely-held entities should be the partnership treatment (including approximations of that treatment). A particular benefit of full integration is that entity form and tax rate become much less significant. It supports progressivity as it stops income sheltering through entities. If tax liability will in some form be attributable to the beneficial owner of an investment, then the treatment of income in a widely-held company, trust, limited partnership, portfolio investment entity etc. becomes of much less significance. Small business taxation – integration in practice? In a further productivity study, 40 Gemmell et al find higher rates of corporate taxation slow the rate of convergence to the productivity frontier for small firms (defined as twenty or fewer employees). One possible explanation for this is that because smaller firms are more likely to be credit constrained, they are more reliant on retained profit for investment, which is reduced by corporate taxes. Gemmell et al’s findings suggest there is a case for investigating a separate regime for SMEs. Conversely practical experience to date suggests differential taxation for SMEs can be distortionary and ineffective/inefficient at stimulating job growth or innovation. Example: UK Experience withcorporatetaxreform The UK sought to encourage growing businesses by reducing corporate taxes for SMEs. Over the period 2001/02 to 2006/07 (at which point the incentive was abolished): ►Corporate tax rate was reduced to 10% (0% from 2002/03 to 2006/07) for profits between £0 and £10,000. ►A lower small-profits rate applied up to £300,000 ►Tapering marginal relief applied for profits between £300,000 and £1,500,000 Amendments occurred during this period attempting to ensure the system worked as intended. Devereux and Loretz examined the UK’s experience with marginal corporate tax rates in the 2000s. 41 Findings included: 40 Gemmell, N, Kneller, K, McGowan, D, Sanz, I and Sanz-Sanz, J (2018),Corporate Taxation and Productivity Catch-Up: Evidence from European Firms, Scand. J. of Economics 000(0). 1–28.. 41 Michael P. Devereux and Simon Loretz (2011), Corporation tax in the United Kingdom, Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation, Oxford. Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY25 ►A spike in new incorporations coinciding with the implementation of a 0% starting rate. ►Profit ‘bunching’ at kinks in the marginal corporate tax rate. ►Closely held companies changing the way the owners extracted income from the companies, switching between wages/self-employed income and dividends. (This is less of a problem with an imputation system.) ►Distortions to investment patterns in situations where the value of “capital allowances” (depreciation) depended on marginal tax rates. The chart below, taken from Devereux and Loretz shows the ‘bunching’ effect at the £10,000 threshold. Lessons learnt from this failed reform include: ►Size linked with legal form, as in a progressive corporate tax, is a poor design for special relief. ►Failed reform of this kind is expensive. ►Targeting specific activities or particular market failures has a greater prospect of success. The UK experience suggests a conflict in developing a progressive corporate tax model for SMEs. Giving lower corporate tax rates for SMEs has productivity advantages (Gemmell et al) but integrity disadvantages (Devereux and Loretz). Singapore will shortly expand its range of incentives for SMEs. Example: Singapore incentives for smaller firms Currently, Singapore has in place two broad- based tax schemes to support smaller firms and start-ups without eroding the premise that every profitable company should pay some taxes. During its recent 2018 budget, there were further refinements starting in the 2020 year of assessment 2020: Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY26 ►A Partial Tax Exemption scheme which provides for 75% exemption on the first S$10,000 of normal chargeable income (NCI) and 50% exemption on the next S$190,000 of NCI. ►A Start-Up Tax Exemption scheme for qualifying companies which provides for 75% exemption on the first S$100,000 of NCI and 50% exemption on the next S$100,000 of NCI. In addition, Singapore has also in place some temporary targeted measures to tide firms especially the small and medium entities with near-term cost pressures. We are not convinced it would yet be possible for New Zealand to overcome the problems apparent in the UK. Given the theoretical appeal of such rates as a productivity tool, further investigation on potential design would be worthwhile. Full integration between small companies on a progressive tax rate and their owners would be an essential component of reform. Otherwise it would be too easy for a high net worth individual to route funds through a series of small companies. We do, however, see differential treatment about integration as being justified. A truly integrated approach for all small businesses would allow owners to take advantage of progressive personal tax rates more completely than is currently the case. Māori authorities – integration in practice One example of semi-integrated taxation is the system of Māori authority taxation. Tax rules specific to Māori authorities follow on from the unique way Māori freehold land and other tribal assets are administered and owned, including communal ownership and restrictions on the ability to sell. Māori authority taxation sits between imputation and full integration. A Māori authority pays tax at a low rate of 17.5% on retained earnings, and operates a credit attribution system, similar to the company imputation model. A crucial difference is the Māori authority tax credit is refundable to the extent the members do not have a tax liability against which it can be offset. This model in practice works well and we endorse its retention. Improvements needed are: ►Wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries of Māori authorities should also qualify for Māori authority status. We understand this was proposed by officials at the introduction of the regime. The policy merits still hold, and this omission has created unnecessary tax and compliance costs for Māori authorities. ►Post-settlement governance entities (PSGEs) for Treaty of Waitangi settlements should be permitted to be established after the settlement process is complete (e.g., within a 12 month period from the settlement date). The current legislation and policy requires PSGEs to be established before receipt of settlement redress and contemplated in the deed of settlement. This limits flexibility needed for innovative settlements or under-resourced claimant groups. ►The default RWT rate for Māori authority distributions when the recipient does not provide an IRD number (currently 33%) should be the Māori authority tax rate. A significant proportion of distribution recipients are unknown (particularly in long-established Māori land entities) meaning there is likely a significant excess of RWT being withheld by IRD for these distributions. Tax challenges caused by digitisation of the economy Digitisation is a leading example of technological change. The digital tax landscape is altering and will alter the future of business in unpredictable ways. Put simply, digitisation now underpins business, and allows businesses to operate globally with much less friction, in a more mobile manner. This digitisation was a key driver of the OECD’s work program to counter base erosion and profit shifting. However the analysis of tax policy directions for the digital economy, Action 1 of the BEPS project, was held over pending the other actions. So the OECD’s valuable BEPS recommendations have in effect patched up existing international tax law but not yet set out a compelling vision Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY27 for the future. We – and the G20 – await its final recommendations to be developed in coming months for delivery by 2020. The digital economy will be the next battleground for fundamental tax reform. Three areas provide particular challenges for taxing authorities: ► Businesses can supply digital services where they are not physically established – “scale without mass”, ► The development of specific software such as social platforms allowing user interaction –“reliance on Intellectual Property assets (IP)”, and ► The value from the business perspective comes from the participation of the users in the digital activities that they offer – “user value creation.” In response we recommend the Group looks further into nexus, profit allocation and place of consumption. A watching brief on digital services tax in New Zealand There is significant global political support for an interim digital services tax, led by the European Commission. The OECD rightly notes: “There is no consensus on the need for, or merits of, interim measures, with a number of countries opposed to such measures on the 42 OECD Secretary-General Report to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (March 2018). basis that they will give rise to risks and adverse consequences.” 42 For New Zealand, we do not feel the time is right to follow the European Commission push for a 3% digital services tax. Interim taxes such as a digital services tax tend not to be temporary. Other challenges include: ► advertising revenue splits between countries, ► potential economic incidence of taxation on business — loss making businesses, ► difficulties in achieving compliance (use of algorithms, etc.), ► location of users, ► insufficient rewards to developer of IP, ► double or over taxation, and ► barter services. While these challenges are as relevant for New Zealand as for other economies, we have a strong corporate taxpaying culture and no immediate pressing revenue problem. We are concerned that if New Zealand moves quickly to tax the digital economy, that may actually encourage unilateral moves and foster further instability in international tax systems. Instead, we recommend taking a watching brief on digital tax developments. We would not rule out following experiences in other countries as a part of wholesale corporate tax reform in the medium term. Reducing corporate taxes could be a reasonable trade-off for entering into a digital services tax in the future. Radical company tax reforms A substantial body of literature, dating back to Meade 43 , has put forward the case for radical corporate tax reform under a range of economic models. Many of these reforms have strong theoretical appeal, in that they target an alternative corporate tax base with potential gains to the overall efficiency of revenue raising. 43 J.E. Meade (1978),The Structure and Reform of Direct Taxation: Report of a Committee chaired by Professor J.E. Meade,Institute for Fiscal Studies. Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY28 In particular, both the Allowance for Corporate Equity (ACE) and the Comprehensive Business Income Tax (CBIT) target an arguable systematic bias in favour of debt over equity in standard corporate taxes. The ACE does this by allowing a notional deduction for the cost of equity, the CBIT by way of denying a deduction for interest costs. The different tax bases targeted by ACE and CBIT are shown below. They have been implemented rarely in practice, making it difficult to assess their likely impact. The Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group put this dilemma well, in its discussion of one such alternative – a dual income tax combined with an ACE: “While the TWG thought this approach was innovative and may be worth considering at some time in the future, a system like it is untested (it has never been implemented) and it also raises significant transitional and implementation issues.” 44 While ACE in particular has seen a degree of uptake, 45 this comment remains valid in our view and radical company tax reforms are not discussed further in our submission. 44 Victoria University (January 2010)A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future,Victoria University Press, Wellington.. 43. 45 Variants of ACE systems have been introduced in Belgium, Cyprus, Italy, and Turkey but this is not yet a sufficient sample to assess the system’s long-term sustainability.

But unlike the roads in Robert Frost's familiar poem, they are not equally fair. The road we have long been traveling is deceptively easy, a smooth superhighway on which we progress with great speed, but at its end lies disaster. The other fork of the road — the one less traveled by — offers our last, our only chance to reach a destination that assures the preservation of the earth.” 46 Snapshot The Government has committed to action on climate change. Our taxes are poorly aligned with the environmental and climate costs of our economic footprint. At 1.3% of GDP New Zealand’s revenue from environmentally related taxes is among the lowest in the OECD. Recommendations 1. Tax should be part of the Government’s toolkit for dealing with environmental issues. 2. The Group should agree good principles for environmental taxation including: a. An initial presumption against the introduction of selective taxes tempered by the understanding that the Government’s international commitment to take transformative action on climate change is compelling. b. Environmental tax bases should be targeted to the pollutant or polluting behaviour. c. The scope of an environmental tax should match the scope of the environmental damage. d. The tax rate should be commensurate with the environmental damage. e. The tax must be credible and its rate predictable. f. Distributional concerns should be addressed through other policy instruments. 3. There is a prima facie case for further investigation of: 46 Rachel Carson (1962).,Silent Spring,Houghtin Mifflin, New York. 4.Opportunities for effective environmental taxation Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY31 a.Including agriculture within the NZ ETS or any future carbon tax. We believe there is a case for bringing agriculture within the NZ ETS sooner rather than later. b. Pricing roading taxes taking into account environmental factors as well as transport needs. c. Broadening roading taxes from ad valorem to include an element of congestion charging. d. A resource rent tax or royalty on the exploitation of natural resources that are not currently subject to royalties, such as water. e. Considering how the Group’s preferred principles for environmental taxation apply to water quality and usage. The time to act is now The mass of scientific evidence shows our climate is changing, with carbon emissions the single biggest cause. The Government has committed to a target of a net zero emissions economy by 2050 under a Zero Carbon Act, a Green Investment Fund, a Provincial Growth Fund and an independent Climate Change Commission. Should tax reform complement these initiatives? New Zealand’s environmental issues “In this summer of 2017-18 there can surely be little argument that the effects of global warming are already with us. To think otherwise is probably to belong to a small, but not select, group of people who believe Elvis is alive and well and has changed his name to Donald Trump. 47 ” As stated in the Paper, New Zealand’s economy and the wellbeing of New Zealanders are heavily dependent on protecting our natural capital base. However, this natural capital base is under pressure 48 .

New Zealand currently adopts a light touch when it comes to environmental taxation. Like many other OECD countries, our taxes continue to be poorly aligned with the costs of our economic footprint on the environment and climate 49 . We don’t think environmental taxes should be relied on as major revenue raisers 50 . By definition, if they succeed in changing behaviour, the direct revenue raised will be small. Nevertheless, at 1.3% of GDP New Zealand’s revenue from environmentally related taxes is among the lowest in the OECD 51 . 50 Supported byDimensions of Tax Design, Vol. 1 of the Mirrlees Review (September 2010), Oxford University Press: Ch. 5Environmental Taxes by Don Fullerton, Andrew Leicester, and Stephen Smith, https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/mirrleesreview/ (as at 19 April 2018). 51 OECD Environmental Statistics Database (OECD average is 1.6%).

There is no market incentive for consumers and business to take into account environmental damage, since its impact is spread across many people with little or no direct cost to the polluter 52 . Environmental taxes are by no means the only way for government to respond to environmental issues, nor should they be the only response. However, we believe environmental taxes are an essential part of the Government’s toolkit and can play a key role in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes in both the medium and long term. The Government will no doubt develop a clear set of environmental outcomes it wants to pursue both socially and environmentally. Establishing desired outcomes will enable a clear path to investigate whether tax mechanisms are the best option to achieve those outcomes. In some instances a straight elimination of a social-ill could be more appropriate than placing a tax on it. The OECD has recommended New Zealand expands the use of environmentally related taxes, charges and prices, possibly within the framework of an overall reform of the tax structure with a view to encouraging more efficient use of energy and resources 53 .

In our view, environmental taxation can contribute to each of the various capitals – notably natural, but also human (the environment plays a part in the physical and mental health of New Zealanders) and, in the medium term, social and financial (provided the environmental taxes are efficiently designed). Burden of proof In 2001, the McLeod review noted: “Our view is that the appropriate burden of proof on those advocating eco-taxes should be identical to the burden placed on those seeking concessionary tax treatment for particular activities or sectors. We consider the initial presumption should always be against the introduction of selective taxes.” 56 While we agree with the logic of this test, climate change and environmental issues are now more prominent and urgent and we believe there is a stronger case for examining environmental taxes than in 2001. Environmental taxation faces challenges Recently, Hon Sir Michael Cullen committed, in his own words, the “ultimate heresy” in putting forward the notion that a particular tax being distortionary might be a good, not a bad, thing 57 . The case for using taxes to help achieve environmental goals rests on efficiency. Can tax reform achieve a given level of environmental protection at lower cost than non-tax alternatives such as trading schemes or regulation? Will the tax change behaviour for the public good? 54 Tax Working Group (2018),Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper.17. 55 Treasury (2018),Living Standards New Zealand, sourced at 17 April 2018 from: https://treasury.govt.nz/information-and- services/nz-economy/living-standards-0 ( 56 Treasury (2001),Issues Paper – Tax Review 2001 New Zealand Treasury, Wellington. 57 Hon Sir Michael Cullen, Chair Tax Working Group Purpose, principles, and possibilities: The Tax Working Group, Speech to the New Zealand International Fiscal Association (IFA) Conference, Queenstown, 2 March 2018. Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY33 Environmental taxes have difficulties. They can foster inefficient avoidance activities, such as increasing emissions to purchase fuel at a lower cost outside the Auckland area. They can often be equivalent to consumption taxes with regressive consequences, requiring compensation for vulnerable groups. Environmental taxes also raise challenging questions and intergenerational issues, such as whether current polluters should incur the cost of any future financial loss being caused by their activity, and whether they should also pay for a possible loss in New Zealanders future quality of life. They tend to work well when wide-ranging changes in behaviour are needed across a large number of businesses and individuals 58 . Given the global nature of climate change, and the insignificant impact that could be made by unilateral action, coordinated international action will be important 59 . The design of environmental taxes is one of the crucial determinants of their overall success 60 . We set out some suggested design elements b e l o w. Benefits of a well-designed environmental tax As recognised by the OECD 61 , taxes can directly address the failure of markets to take environmental impacts into account by incorporating environmental impacts into prices. Changing prices in this way provides consumers and business with flexibility to determine how best to reduce their environmental “footprint”. This flexibility 62 : ►Enables lowest-cost solutions – consumers and business decide how to change their behaviour, with market forces 58 Supported byDimensions of Tax Design, Vol. 1 of the Mirrlees Review (September 2010), Oxford University Press: Ch. 5Environmental Taxes by Don Fullerton, Andrew Leicester, and Stephen Smith, https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/mirrleesreview/ (as at 19 April 2018). 59 SeeDimensions of Tax Design, Vol. 1 of the Mirrlees Review (September 2010), Oxford University Press: Ch. 5Environmental Taxes by Don Fullerton, Andrew Leicester, and Stephen Smith, https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/mirrleesreview/ (as at 19 April 2018). determining the lowest-cost way to reduce environmental damage. ►Encourages innovation – the cost to a polluter of generating pollution is increased, which incentivises business to develop new innovations and adapt existing ones. ►Reduces the need for the Government to “pick winners”. ►Provides an ongoing incentive to abate at all levels of emissions, unlike a target or technology-based regulation which provides no incentive to abate once the target or standard is met. ►Improves competitiveness of low- emission alternatives, for example public transport and cycling in the case of vehicle fuel taxes. What makes a successful environmental tax? To lead to improved outcomes, an environmental tax must: ►Change the price of the affected item to reflect the cost of the environmental harm that it imposes on others 63 , and ►Lead to a change in behaviour – either lesser consumption of environmental "bads”, such as fuel, or greater consumption of environmental “goods”, such as reforestation. For the tax to be truly effective, there needs to be 64 : ►A comparable degree of environmental damage from the consumption of each taxed item across the tax base, 60 OECDEnvironmental Taxation – A Guide for Policy Makers(September 2011), based on the OECD’s book Taxation, Innovation and the Environment(October 2010). 61 Ibid. 62 Ibid. 63 Ibid. 64 These three principals are supported by the McLeod review – see Treasury, Issues Paper – Tax Review 2001 (June 2001). Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY34 ►The ability to measure consumption – either directly or by proxy, and ►An assessment of the marginal damage caused by consumption. Designing environmental taxes The OECD suggests the following design elements 65 : ►Environmental tax bases should be targeted to the pollutant or polluting behaviour, with few (if any) exceptions. ►The scope of an environmental tax should ideally be as broad as the scope of the environmental damage. ►For example, greenhouse gas emissions from one location contribute to climate change on a global basis – greenhouse gas emissions would therefore ideally be addressed by a global tax. ►The tax rate should be commensurate with the environmental damage. ►The rate should generally be set to reflect society’s value of the environmental damage, other negative spill-over effects of the activity, and the need to raise public revenue. ►The tax must be credible and its rate predictable in order to motivate environmental improvements. ►Well-designed taxes are highly transparent – it is generally clear what is taxed, who is being taxed, and what the cost to polluters will be per unit of pollution generated. ►Environmental tax revenues can assist fiscal consolidation or help to reduce other taxes. ►We place little weight on this comment because, as previously noted, if environmental taxes 65 OECD (2011) Environmental Taxation – A Guide for Policy Makers, (September 2011), based on the OECD’s book Taxation, Innovation and the Environment (October 2010). succeed in changing behaviour, direct revenue raised will be small. ►Distributional concerns, for example the possibility of certain taxes having a significant impact on low-income households, should generally be addressed outside the tax through other policy instruments to preserve the incentive effect of the tax. ►Competitiveness concerns need to be carefully assessed. Ideally taxes should not be adapted for competitiveness reasons as other more suitable instruments are available for providing compensation without compromising effectiveness 66 . Responses could include: ►International co-ordination to reduce gains from relocation. ►A transitional period to allow affected firms to undertake mitigation measures. ►Recycling revenues to affected firms (on a basis different from the collection). ►Clear communication is critical to public acceptance. ►The utilisation of independent green tax reform commissions can help to ensure the policy prescriptions are perceived as credible and not as politically driven. ►Environmental taxes may need to be combined with other policy instruments to address certain issues. Having outlined some design elements for the Group’s consideration, we now turn to some specific considerations relating to what we consider to be two of the largest environmental issues in New Zealand: greenhouse gas and agricultural emissions, and issues around roading and transport. We also discuss the possibility of a resource rent tax or royalties on certain natural resources (water in particular), followed by some other options the Group may wish to consider. 66 OECD (2018),Taxing Energy Use 2018: Companion to the Taxing Energy Use Database, OECD publishing, Paris Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY35 Greenhouse gas emissions According to the OECD, New Zealand’s greenhouse gas gross emissions increased by 6% from 2000 - 2014, while decreasing by 5% in the OECD as a whole. 67 Emissions per capita and per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) are among the top five in the OECD. New Zealand’s Emissions Trading Scheme (“NZ ETS”) is the Government’s principal policy response to climate change. The objective of the NZ ETS is to support and encourage global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 68 : ► Assisting New Zealand to meet its international obligations, and ► Reducing New Zealand’s net emissions below business as usual levels. While we believe the NZ ETS is the right instrument for addressing emissions issues, the emissions issue is of such magnitude that the Group should consider tax reform as part of the toolkit for New Zealand’s response. Greenhouse gas emissions are different to more localised issues such as water use, as emissions from one location contribute to climate change on a global basis. Given the relatively small size of New Zealand, action taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in New Zealand alone is very unlikely to have a significant impact on the level of global emissions. The emissions issue would therefore ideally be addressed by global cooperation. However, despite New Zealand’s limited ability to impact global emissions levels, New Zealand should take action as early as possible to lead by example and encourage other countries to do the same. There is a question whether the NZ 67 OECD Environmental Performance Reviews: New Zealand 2017.

ETS should return to allowing the use of international emissions credits, which may be of dubious provenance. Agriculture greenhouse gas emissions The composition of New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions is unusual, with agricultural emissions dominant: New Zealand has committed to reducing net emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030 under the Paris Climate Change Agreement (“Paris Agreement”), and the Government has announced it will develop a new emissions target of net zero emissions for 2050 69 . Due to the amount of emissions coming from the agriculture sector, where emissions- reduction options are limited, New Zealand may face higher costs than other countries to meet its emissions reduction targets 70 . It has been suggested the cost to the economy of buying international carbon units to offset our own emissions will be $14.2 billion over 10 years 71 . Taking action to reduce climate pollution could reduce the cost to the New Zealand economy of meeting Paris Agreement targets. 70 Hon David Parker, Minister for the Environment, Economic Growth within Environmental Limits, Address to the Resource Management Law Association Seminar, Auckland, 28 March 2018.

Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY36 Although agricultural emissions make up around half of New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions, agricultural emissions are currently excluded from the NZ ETS. The treatment of agricultural emissions has been flagged as an initial area of focus for Government’s recently announced Climate Change Commission 72 , and the Government is assessing whether to phase agriculture into the NZ ETS over a transition period 73 . Westpac NZ report A recent report commissioned by Westpac NZ 74 analyses two modelled economic scenarios for New Zealand out to 2050: 1.A smooth “central scenario” where New Zealand takes early and planned action to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and 2.A “shock scenario”, where New Zealand delays action on climate change until 2030, when it’s forced to take more aggressive action to reduce emissions in a shorter timeframe. The most significant difference between the two scenarios is the timing of the agriculture sector’s inclusion in the NZ ETS. Agriculture’s faster phase-in into the NZ ETS in 2030 is the “shock” in the “shock scenario”. The report finds that earlier, planned action on climate change under the “central scenario” is modelled to save $30 billion in GDP growth by 2050 compared with the “shock scenario” and results in a 32% lower greenhouse gas emissions price by 2050. Both scenarios would achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the second half of the century. However, the Government is pursuing a more ambitious target of net zero emissions by 2050. 75 The graph below shows 72 Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper.

Agricultural sectors are ultimately better able to manage their economic impacts through a longer, better signalled transition period within the central scenario. What should be done? The OECD has previously stated that New Zealand needs to reassess its decision to indefinitely postpone the entry of biological emissions from agriculture into the NZ ETS 76 . Based on the evidence outlined above, we believe there is a case for bringing agriculture into the NZ ETS or any future carbon tax sooner rather than later. The OECD has stated that if agriculture is not brought into the NZ ETS, alternative pricing or regulatory measures should make agriculture contribute to achieving climate mitigation objectives 77 .

While agriculture is New Zealand’s largest emissions sector, one of the largest increases in emissions since 1990 has been in road and transport 78 . Seventeen percent of emissions production in New Zealand is from transport 79 . We have one of the highest rates of motor vehicle ownership in the OECD 80 . The number of vehicles has increased by 65% since 2000, with a rising share of diesel vehicles and an average fleet age touching 14 years 81 . Our fleet is highly emission-intensive 82 . New Zealand is the only OECD country to apply an excise duty only on petrol, with diesel vehicles subject to a distance based road user charge instead 83 . Given its current roading rather than environmental focus, merits of the current road user charge include the exclusion of boats and other machinery which do not impact on road use. Disadvantages of this unique approach include 84 : ►Apart from a weight based component, the road user charge doesn’t encourage behaviours that would reduce fuel use 85 and ►Diesel vehicles tend to be favoured by the differential charging system due to their higher fuel efficiency.

In addition, the tax and charge rates are based on roading infrastructure needs rather than on environmental externalities 86 . For example, the largest external cost of motoring comes from congestion, yet existing taxes are based on fuel purchases 87 and distance travelled. Significant gains could be made by a more precisely targeted structure of economic instruments 88 . While car users respond to increased fuel taxes by driving less, they also invest more in fuel economy which does not reduce congestion – to allow for better congestion management and also anticipating a possible eventual decarbonisation of road transport, it might be better to argue for more sophisticated congestion pricing than for increasing fuel taxes to reflect average congestion 89 . Developments in technology may affect the traditional base of fuel excise duty as vehicles become more fuel efficient 90 . This development further supports the need to re- consider New Zealand’s current approach to taxing our transport system.

The OECD believes road pricing would help improve transport demand management in large urban areas, especially Auckland 92 . Resource rent taxes? New Zealand currently imposes royalties on the extraction of certain natural resources to ensure the public gets a fair share of any profits generated. The royalties usually try to capture the profit generated by a miner over and above a reasonable economic return (the “rent”) and are generally a percentage of either the revenue or profit generated by a miner. An alternative approach is a resource rent tax, which attempts to estimate the rent generated by a miner and directly apply a tax to that rent 93 . The Government has banned new offshore oil and gas exploration but will allow 22 active offshore permits to run until their expiration, which is as far out as 2030. 94 The exploitation of various natural resources, most notably water, is currently not subject to royalties or any form of resource rent tax. Should royalties or a resource rent tax be imposed on the exploitation of these natural resources? 91 The OECD recommends New Zealand considers introducing an excise duty on diesel: OECD Environmental Performance Reviews: New Zealand 2017.

In particular, New Zealand faces several challenges around freshwater pollution and over-allocation of water. Water contamination from the cumulative effects of diffuse agricultural and urban storm water run-off is a growing environmental and public health concern 95 . Water demand in some regions is exceeding what is available and sustainable 96 . The options of a royalty or resource rent tax, water taxes / pollution charges or water quality trading should be considered in further detail. These options may have the potential to internalise the environmental and opportunity costs to diffuse pollution from rural and urban sources and promote innovation in pollution control 97 .

Utility incentives ►From energy providers to encourage energy efficiency as mandated by government regulations. Feed-in tariffs ►Production-based incentives for renewable energy producers. Low-interest Government loans ►Allowing organisations to finance renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. An environmental tax credit? The Group should also give consideration to environmental tax credits. As stated by the OECD: “Innovation plays a critical role in delivering improved environmental outcomes at lower costs. Environmentally related taxes can encourage the development and adoption of market-ready innovations; however, the breakthrough technologies that will lead to fundamental environmental improvements are less likely to be developed under a tax-only regime than under a regime that includes particular incentives for research and development 103 .” New Zealand has a strong background when it comes to environmental related research and innovation, with particular achievements in renewable energy, water pollution and wastewater management and agricultural research. With the Government already committed to re- introducing a tax incentive for R&D, can the new credit be used to boost environmental related research even further? Could the Government provide tax incentives for investments in, or production from, renewable and alternative energy assets? An enhanced environmental tax credit could be effective, giving businesses the space they need to make decisions without any second guessing by the Government. 103 OECD (September 2011),Environmental Taxation – A Guide for Policy Makers based on the OECD’s book Making the most of technology Tax systems are changing fast. Technology may be the game changer that gives Sir Michael’s “heresy” more support. Advances in technology, including artificial intelligence and robotics, can enable the collection of a high volume of sophisticated data that can be analysed in real time. Technological advancements provide a better chance of designing and administering a smart, targeted tax intervention targeted at changing behaviour and provide a much stronger case for re-examining the longstanding existing broad- based, low rates tax system. As already mentioned, the case for using taxes to help achieve environmental goals rests on efficiency. One way of achieving efficiency is by ensuring producers and consumers face the social costs of their activities. Can we use technology to approximate the social costs of an activity? For example, can we use technology to estimate the social costs of traffic congestion and then impose a tax on traffic congestion which reflects the social cost? A hypothetical solution may be using technology to find out how many plastic bottles are being produced, who is producing them, who they are being used by and what proportion are being recycled. Any tax instrument in relation to pollution from plastic bottles can then be targeted based on an informative string of data. Fringe benefit tax on motor vehicles, currently calculated based on the value of the vehicle, provides another example. Smart use of Taxation, Innovation and the Environment (October 2010). Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY41 emissions monitoring technology could easily change that to taxing on the level of pollution caused, potentially in real time. Hypothecation In 2012-15, the National Land Transport Fund (which receives all revenue from the petrol excise duty and road user charge) mostly financed investment in highways and local roads – public transport, cycling and walking infrastructure received only 10% of the fund 104 . Could technology be used to enable hypothecation in the area of environmental tax, such that tax revenues are allocated to environmental spending objectives? Any such hypothecation would need to be done in a way that does not limit Government spending on environmental matters to the tax revenue received. 104 NZTA, 2015 – see OECD Environmental Performance Reviews: New Zealand 2017, http://www.oecd.org/newzealand/oecd- environmental-performance-reviews-new- zealand-2017-9789264268203-en.htm (as at 19 April 2018).

Snapshot The current level of wealth inequality challenges the concept of inclusive growth. It is much more concentrated than income inequality. It adversely affects social and human capital. Taxation of capital gains needs to be seen as a part of the overall taxation of capital income and household wealth, not as an isolated issue to address concerns in the housing market. The overarching tax principles of efficiency, horizontal and vertical equity and coherence all suggest an integrated system of taxing capital income and wealth is required. In our view, the tax system needs to be clearly progressive if it is to be sustainable. The main potential instruments for capital taxation are capital income taxes, CGTs, capital transfer taxes (such as inheritance or gift taxes) and ownership-based taxes (wealth tax or land tax). Redistribution style taxes need to be balanced against the current over-taxation of certain savings. Capital income taxation is ripe for reform. 105 OECD, seehttp://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/better-design-of-taxes-on-personal-savings-and- wealth-is-needed-to-support-inclusive-growth.htm (as at 20 April 2018). 5.Capital taxation Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY44 Recommendations 1.There is a case at the margin for tilting the balance of capital taxation from flows – such as interest and dividends – towards stocks – such as land and other stores of wealth. 2.The impact of the tax system on income and wealth needs to be considered on a holistic basis: a.Reconsider the current TTE approach towards taxing private savings. b.Move towards taxing real rather than nominal gains. c.Investigate the possibilities of wealth taxes and land taxes (noting their potential substitutability and overlap). 3.If the Government has concerns regarding residential investment property, consider reforms targeted to the specific problem. 4.If the Government has concerns regarding all forms of capital investment, consider a broad-based CGT. 5.When designing a CGT: a.The best theoretical design would be wide-ranging, on a broad asset base, with an element of accrual taxation. Given the exclusion of the family home and the familiar difficulties with accrual taxation, we are into a “second best” world. b.Ideally, tax should be imposed on real rather than nominal gains. 6.We accept that a realisation-based CGT is a much more likely outcome. Design of such a tax should be based on: a.Minimising the number of realisation events b.Approximating real gains, for example, by way of taper relief c.Ring-fencing capital losses d.Taxing gains from a valuation day e.Minimising exemptions and reliefs 7.We retain doubts regarding the value of a separate CGT given the family home is to be excluded. Addressing wealth inequality One of the key criteria by which we should assess our tax system is through equity and fairness. Our current tax system focuses heavily on taxing income. However, income is not the only or major source of affluence for many New Zealanders. Wealth inequality is much more concentrated than income inequality. When considering the Living Standards Framework, wealth inequality adversely affects both social and human capital. It tends to reduce social cohesion, 106 According to Credit Suisse Research Institute Global Wealth Report (November 2017). particularly in relation to trust between different groups in society. Wealth inequality is an issue in many parts of the world: 106 Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY45 New Zealand is not exempt from the inequality effect despite our progressive income tax rates. The Paper attempts to illustrate the level of wealth inequality among households in Figure 17 107 . Figure 17 is based on Statistics New Zealand figures for median household net worth by quintile for the year ended 30 June 2015. In our view, splitting households into quintiles disguises the extent to which wealth is concentrated.We suspect wealth inequality is more significant than suggested by Figure 17. Looking at the figures at a more granular level, for the year ended 30 June 2015, the top 10% of New Zealand households accounted for around half of total wealth, while the bottom 40% held only 3% of total wealth 108 . When looking at individuals, the top 10% owned approximately 60% of total net worth, with our wealthiest 1% accounting for approximately 22% 109 . In addition, there is evidence that inhabitants in some developed economies may underestimate the actual extent of wealth inequality in their own country. Research has shown that, on average, Australian adults overestimate the wealth of the poorest quintile by a factor of more than seven, while underestimating the wealth of the wealthiest quintile by more than a fifth 110 . Their American counterparts were prone to similar misperceptions about wealth distribution in the United States 111 . Intergenerational equity Individual net worth is skewed towards older 107 Tax Working Group,Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper (March 2018), p37. 108 Statistics New Zealand household net worth statistics for year ended 30 June 2015.

See New Zealanders. Statistics New Zealand figures for the year ended 30 June 2015 show that young people (15–24 years) had the lowest median individual net worth ($1,000) and older people (65+) had the highest ($288,000) 112 . These figures raise issues around intergenerational equity, with a prima facie case that equity would be enhanced should capital stocks (mostly held by older people) bear a greater burden than is currently the case. Increased capital taxation could allow for some reduction of labour income taxation, mostly generated by New Zealanders under 65. On a static lifetime basis, there is no intergenerational inequality and any reform could prove difficult for cash-poor, asset rich older people. The impact of technology The inequality debate is not immune from the impact of technology. A small number of entrepreneurs involved in the development of successful new technology may accumulate significant wealth and therefore raise the level of recorded wealth inequality while increasing the wealth of all. It is important not to discourage entrepreneurial developments, given that technological advancements are likely to be good for the economy and the wellbeing of many New Zealanders.

Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY46 Holistic approach required The overarching tax principles of efficiency, horizontal and vertical equity and coherence all suggest an integrated system taxing all capital income and wealth is required. We particularly take that view given we see New Zealand’s tax system needs to be clearly progressive if it is to be sustainable. The extent to which the tax system is currently progressive needs to be considered holistically, taking into account our transfer system and both income and capital taxes. Given exclusions from the Group’s Terms of Reference 114 , we concentrate our comments on capital taxation. The main potential instruments for capital taxation are: ►Capital income taxes, notably the taxation of private savings, ►CGTs, ►Capital transfer taxes – such as inheritance or gift taxes, and ►Ownership-based taxes – including other wealth taxes and land tax. These instruments cannot be used in combination too heavily or capital taxation will compound to very high rates. We discuss each of these areas further below, with the exception of capital transfer taxes since an inheritance tax has been excluded by the 114 Terms of Reference: Tax Working Group (November 2017), https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/terms- reference-tax-working-group (as at 20 April 2018). 115 Terms of Reference: Tax Working Group (November 2017), https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/terms- reference-tax-working-group (as at 20 April 2018). 116 Better saved than sorry: The Treasury's position on New Zealand's saving performance, Speech Delivered by John Whitehead, Secretary to the Treasury on 13 August 2007, https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/speech/better- saved-sorry-%C2%A0treasurys-position- new%C2%A0zealands-saving-performance (as at 24 April 2018). 117 Tax Working Group,Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper (March 2018), p5. 118 Tax Working Group,Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper (March 2018), p26. Group’s Terms of Reference 115 . Taxation of private savings “Better saved than sorry. 116 ” New Zealand appears to have a private savings problem New Zealand’s approach to the taxation of retirement savings is unique. Our tax system does not offer large concessions for retirement savings 117 . As the Paper states “some commentators think that New Zealand should tax income from capital at a lower rate to encourage more saving, particularly for retirement. New Zealand’s lack of concessions for retirement savings is rare among OECD countries 118 .” The current level of savings is likely to be insufficient to support many New Zealanders in their retirement. Despite KiwiSaver and the Government’s provision of New Zealand Superannuation (“NZ Super”), it’s unlikely that the level of savings is high enough to allow people to retire with a similar lifestyle to what they had during their working days 119 . Most New Zealanders consider about twice the current level of NZ Super is needed for a comfortable retirement 120 . Research conducted for the Financial Services Council last year shows a $218 average after tax weekly gap between what the retired need to live comfortably and what they actually have 121 . Accordingly, there is a strong need 119 Savings Working Group,Saving New Zealand: Reducing Vulnerabilities and Barriers to Growth and Prosperity: Final Report to the Minister of Finance (January 2011), https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/saving-new- zealand-reducing-vulnerabilities-and-barriers-growth- and-prosperity-final-report-minister (as at 24 April 2018). 120 Financial Services Council,The Tax Barrier to Retirement Prosperity in New Zealand(2013), https://www.fsc.org.nz/site/fsc/files/SuperSize%20C onference%202013/FSC- Taxation%20and%20Savings%20Paper- Final%20copy.pdf (as at 24 April 2018). 121 Great Expectations: Retirement Realities for Older New Zealanders,Research Paper No. 2, Research conducted for the Financial Services Council (December 2017), https://www.fsc.org.nz/site/fsc/Great-Expectations- FINAL.pdf (as at 24 April 2018).

A recent OECD report found there is significant scope to improve the way countries tax savings, including taxing savings types more equally to improve both efficiency and fairness 123 . There are clear indications that New Zealanders save less than those in similar countries 124 . New Zealand’s tax system is seen as biased towards investment in the property market and against long-term savings such as KiwiSaver and bank term deposits 125 . This bias not only has adverse impacts on retirement savings but may also mean the savings we do have are being put to relatively unproductive use. New Zealand’s savings problem will become even more pertinent over the next decade or so as the population ages and life expectancies increase, calling into question the long-term viability of NZ Super. Intergenerational concerns arise around whether the younger population should face the costs of the ageing population. In 2011, the Savings Working Group took a strong view of the available evidence. It stated 126 : 122 Financial Services Council,The Tax Barrier to Retirement Prosperity in New Zealand(2013), https://www.fsc.org.nz/site/fsc/files/SuperSize%20C onference%202013/FSC- Taxation%20and%20Savings%20Paper- Final%20copy.pdf (as at 24 April 2018). 123 OECD (2018), Taxation of Household Savings, OECD Tax Policy Studies, No. 25, OECD Publishing, Paris,http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264289536- en (as at 24 April 2018). 124 Savings Working Group,Saving New Zealand: Reducing Vulnerabilities and Barriers to Growth and Prosperity: Final Report to the Minister of Finance (January 2011), https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/saving-new- zealand-reducing-vulnerabilities-and-barriers-growth- and-prosperity-final-report-minister (as at 24 April 2018).See alsoBetter saved than sorry: The Treasury's position on New Zealand's saving performance, Speech Delivered by John Whitehead, Secretary to the Treasury on 13 August 2007, https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/speech/better- saved-sorry-%C2%A0treasurys-position- new%C2%A0zealands-saving-performance (as at 24 April 2018). 125 Financial Services Council,The Tax Barrier to Retirement Prosperity in New Zealand(2013), “New Zealanders – the people and the government – are not saving enough. Unless we make some rapid changes, we are risking a major economic disruption likely to leave practically all New Zealanders worse off. It’s as if we are standing on top of a cliff that may collapse dramatically or crumble slowly. Either way, it would be a bad fall. We need to move back from the brink – and fast.” We acknowledge there are limitations when looking at data and statistics around savings. The policy analysis is difficult because no one set of data provides the ability to draw categorical conclusions 127 . Savings can be measured in many different ways, there are data uncertainties at both a micro / household level and at a macro level 128 . In addition, findings are often dependent on particular assumptions. Our judgment is the evidence points towards a private savings problem in New Zealand. We believe there is a case for reconsidering the balance between private and public savings and the role of the tax system. Our judgment is based on a least-regrets approach. We agree with the position previously put forward by Treasury that when it comes to savings it is https://www.fsc.org.nz/site/fsc/files/SuperSize%20C onference%202013/FSC- Taxation%20and%20Savings%20Paper- Final%20copy.pdf (as at 24 April 2018). 126 Savings Working Group,Saving New Zealand: Reducing Vulnerabilities and Barriers to Growth and Prosperity: Final Report to the Minister of Finance (January 2011), https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/saving-new- zealand-reducing-vulnerabilities-and-barriers-growth- and-prosperity-final-report-minister (as at 24 April 2018). 127 Better saved than sorry: The Treasury's position on New Zealand's saving performance, Speech Delivered by John Whitehead, Secretary to the Treasury on 13 August 2007, https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/speech/better- saved-sorry-%C2%A0treasurys-position- new%C2%A0zealands-saving-performance (as at 24 April 2018). 128 Better saved than sorry: The Treasury's position on New Zealand's saving performance, Speech Delivered by John Whitehead, Secretary to the Treasury on 13 August 2007, https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/speech/better- saved-sorry-%C2%A0treasurys-position- new%C2%A0zealands-saving-performance (as at 24 April 2018). Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY48 better to take action now than to be sorry later 129 . Current approach New Zealand currently taxes savings on a TTE basis 130 . In effect the money will be subject to another layer of tax, GST, when it is spent. In comparison, if the income is spent immediately it’s only taxed twice – as initial income and when it’s spent. This difference discourages saving 131 . While this TTE approach is consistent with a BBLR tax system, many other countries take a different approach. A number of OECD countries take an Exempt-Exempt-Taxed (“EET”) approach where tax is imposed only at the withdrawal stage 132 . This EET approach could be partially explained by the fact that social security pensions are subject to means- testing in many countries 133 . Moving towards a fairer TTE system As stated by the Financial Services Council, common sense calls for change but the tax reform options are not easy 134 . 129 Better saved than sorry: The Treasury's position on New Zealand's saving performance, Speech Delivered by John Whitehead, Secretary to the Treasury on 13 August 2007, https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/speech/better- saved-sorry-%C2%A0treasurys-position- new%C2%A0zealands-saving-performance (as at 24 April 2018). 130 New Zealand’s “TTE” tax system means •Contributions are made out of income that is taxed (usually an individual’s labour income). •Income earned from the investment, such as interest and dividends, is taxed (whether earned before or during retirement) though the portfolio investment entity tax rates are available. •Amounts “withdrawn” from the investment are not taxed. See Tax Working Group,Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper (March 2018), p26. 131 Savings Working Group,Saving New Zealand: Reducing Vulnerabilities and Barriers to Growth and Prosperity: Final Report to the Minister of Finance (January 2011), https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/saving-new- zealand-reducing-vulnerabilities-and-barriers-growth- and-prosperity-final-report-minister (as at 24 April 2018). 132 See Tax Working Group,Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper (March 2018), p26. In an ideal system all savings would be taxed to the same extent. The next best alternative is to remove or reduce the bias in the tax system towards investing in the property market as opposed to long-term savings. An ideal system also needs to be sustainable – it should encourage long-term savings where possible, but recognise that some individuals have no or low ability to save. There are a number of possible reform options available, many of which have already been canvased and explored by others 135 . There is not necessarily one superior option for reform: the best solution could be a combination of options. Adopting an EET approach is likely to be fiscally costly and would also translate to considerable compliance costs for existing providers. Changes within a TTE system are more manageable. This suggests remaining in a TTE system with a reduced level of taxation both at the contribution stage and the income earning stage. In particular: ►Reducing the level of taxation at the contribution stage may incentivise some 133 See Tax Working Group,Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper (March 2018), p26. 134 Financial Services Council,The Tax Barrier to Retirement Prosperity in New Zealand(2013), https://www.fsc.org.nz/site/fsc/files/SuperSize%20C onference%202013/FSC- Taxation%20and%20Savings%20Paper- Final%20copy.pdf (as at 24 April 2018). 135 See, for example: Financial Services Council,The Tax Barrier to Retirement Prosperity in New Zealand (2013), https://www.fsc.org.nz/site/fsc/files/SuperSize%20C onference%202013/FSC- Taxation%20and%20Savings%20Paper- Final%20copy.pdf (as at 24 April 2018);Savings Working Group,Saving New Zealand: Reducing Vulnerabilities and Barriers to Growth and Prosperity: Final Report to the Minister of Finance (January 2011),https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/saving- new-zealand-reducing-vulnerabilities-and-barriers- growth-and-prosperity-final-report-minister (as at 24 April 2018);Taxation of Savings and Investment Income, joint report IRD and Treasury (September 2012), http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2013-other- savings-investment/taxation-savings-and-investment- income (as at 24 April 2018). Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY49 individuals to invest their money into saving for retirement. ►Behavioural economics suggests encouragement is required to ensure people act in their own interests. Policies based around nudging or making the preferred behaviour easy are frequently influential. Some people behave in predictable ways, such as hyperbolic discounting of future benefits, which can be corrected through relatively small upfront incentives. ►Consideration should be given to whether a reduction in the level of taxation at the contribution stage should be targeted towards people on lower incomes. ►Reducing the level of taxation at the income earning stage is likely to have a significant positive impact on the level of savings over the longer term. This “middle T” can significantly reduce a person’s retirement savings, particularly in relation to long-term or accumulated savings that are reinvested into the savings instrument. Other options the Group should give further consideration to include: Compulsory KiwiSaver membership Compulsory KiwiSaver membership may solve some of the behavioural factors around why people fail to adequately save for retirement. People are often prone to short-term bias, where they prioritise their current needs and desires over long-term ones. There has already been a change in behaviour from requiring people to opt out of KiwiSaver rather than opt in. However, there are individuals within our society who do not have the capacity to make KiwiSaver contributions without a noticeable decrease in their current quality of life. Accordingly, we believe it would be worthwhile considering whether KiwiSaver should be made 136 Better saved than sorry: The Treasury's position on New Zealand's saving performance, Speech Delivered by John Whitehead, Secretary to the Treasury on 13 August 2007, https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/speech/better- compulsory only for those earning over a certain income threshold. Concessionary tax treatment for investment in PIEs PIEs and other similar investment vehicles are beneficial to the economy and should be supported. They are managed by professional fund managers who have greater knowledge around investment decisions and greater accountability to investors. Professional fund managers are also more likely to invest in a diverse range of different risk investments, whereas individual investors are more likely to be risk averse. The collective nature of such investment vehicles means investors are more insulated against those risks on a collective basis. Consideration should be given to lowering prescribed investor rates for PIE funds and locked-in savings such as KiwiSaver and similar schemes. If New Zealand introduces a CGT, concessionary treatment for gains made by PIEs should be retained. Specific support for people on low incomes It should come as no surprise that inadequate retirement saving affects a higher proportion of people on low to middle incomes 136 . People who are on low incomes are already subject to relatively low taxation on the “middle T”. However, thought should be given as to how the level of taxation on the “middle T” can be reduced further for those on low incomes, such as taxing only a fraction of the total income earned from the investment. Other options could include a lower tax rate on contributions to savings accounts, or a “top up” for those who save above a certain portion of their income. Real vs. nominal gains In our view, a significant issue that needs to be addressed is whether tax should be levied on a real or nominal basis. The starting point of any tax is that it should only be levied on real gains, not nominal gains – meaning there is no taxation of gains solely saved-sorry-%C2%A0treasurys-position- new%C2%A0zealands-saving-performance (as at 24 April 2018). Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY50 attributable to inflation. However, this principle is difficult to apply in practice and most of our tax system currently taxes nominal gains. We consider taxing nominal gains as opposed to real gains to be problematic, especially in a low interest rate environment. As stated in the Paper, “As nominal income is fully taxed (that is, income including the inflation component), a 33% tax on the nominal return (that is, the real return plus inflation) on savings in a bank account is actually a materially higher tax on the real return 137 .” Example: an effective 100% tax For example, if an individual has a bank account with an interest rate of 3% per annum and they have deposited a total of $100: ►At the end of the year they will have $103 – a nominal return of $3. ►Assuming an inflation rate of 2%, $2 is inflation and the real return is only $1. ►If the nominal return of $3 is taxed at 33%, the entire $1 real return is taken. A fairer base would be to tax the real return. There are a number of options for accounting for inflation, 138 including: ►A risk free return method (an annual inflationary adjustment set at a rate based on real capital returns), ►Taper relief, and 137 Tax Working Group,Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper (March 2018), p39. 138 The issues caused by taxing nominal gains as opposed to real gains are even more significant in the context of a CGT on property that has been held for a number of years. This matter, along with the possible options for accounting for inflation, are discussed further below in the context of CGTes. 139 Better saved than sorry: The Treasury's position on New Zealand's saving performance, Speech Delivered by John Whitehead, Secretary to the Treasury on 13 August 2007, https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/speech/better- saved-sorry-%C2%A0treasurys-position- new%C2%A0zealands-saving-performance (as at 24 April 2018). ►Indexation. Decreased tax revenue Reducing the level of taxation at the first and middle “T’s”, in combination with the assumption that a reduced level of taxation results in a higher level of private savings, there will be less tax revenue. This decrease in tax revenue may cause NZ Super to become less affordable than it already is. However, an increased level of private savings should reduce the need for public savings in the future. It is also important to note that increased savings are likely to have a positive flow-on effect for the New Zealand economy as a whole. As stated by the Treasury, “higher saving creates higher income for New Zealand and New Zealanders. It makes more money available for investment in productive assets, and therefore increases our wealth over time 139 .” CGT and the housing market In New Zealand, the debate around CGT has largely focussed on gains made by investors in the residential property market 140 . While housing availability and affordability is a significant issue, we do not think CGT is the answer. Is residential rental property under-taxed? There is evidence to suggest investment in residential rental property is currently under- taxed when compared to other forms of investment or savings 141 . This distortion in the tax system may have encouraged investment away from other areas and into the residential rental property market. However, this evidence is generally highly dependent on 140 See, for example: https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/inland-revenue/31- 03-2018/why-the-lack-of-a-capital-gains-tax-is- letting-property-companies-off-lightly/; http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/07/ housing-capital-gains-are-soaring-in-new- zealand.html; andhttps://www.tvnz.co.nz/one- news/new-zealand/capital-gains-tax-on-investment- property-bold-call-from-reserve-bank-6288439 (as at 20 April 2018). 141 A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future: Report of the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group (January 2010). Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY51 underlying assumptions and should not be relied upon as the sole reason for introducing a CGT. For example, Figure 21 of the Paper shows a marginal effective tax rate (“METR”) on savings of 29.4% for rental property, which seems low when compared to the next lowest METR of 47.2% for portfolio investment entity, superannuation fund and non-distributing company investments 142 . However, Figure 21 is based on assumptions around what proportion of the return is on rental yield and what proportion represents real capital gain 143 . Changing these assumptions to show a slightly higher rental yield and lower real capital gain would produce a different result. The variability of results is demonstrated by comparing the findings of Figure 21 to a recent OECD study which shows residential rental property to be taxed relatively highly in New Zealand compared to other asset types 144 . Even if residential rental property is under- taxed, many other aspects contribute to housing price inflation Any under-taxation of capital gains on residential investment properties is unlikely to be the main cause of housing price inflation. A growing population, immigration, internal migration to urban centres, construction skills shortfalls, changing housing expectations, housing regulations and a shortage in the number of new houses being built may all be bigger contributors to the current state of the housing market. The tax system cannot deal with many of these issues. Even so, there is value in structuring our tax system to ensure incentives to invest are not distorted in a way that favours residential housing. Is a CGT the best option for addressing housing concerns? CGTs tend to address wealth inequality by targeting capital which is typically held by high 142 Tax Working Group,Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper (March 2018), p40. 143 See Tax Working Group,Charts and Data - Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper(March 2018). Small, but credible, changes to those assumptions – such as a reduced real gain in asset price – could reverse the effect. 144 OECD (2018), Taxation of Household Savings, OECD Tax Policy Studies, No. 25, OECD Publishing, wealth individuals. However, for many New Zealand households a lot of their wealth is tied up in the family home 145 . Accordingly, while a CGT may help to address wealth inequality in some ways, the exemption of the family home means much of that wealth may not be targeted by any potential CGT and limits revenue-raising potential. In fact, a CGT which exempts the family home may encourage individuals to invest more into their family home as an untaxed source of capital. We acknowledge the practical challenges associated with the family home and also the international precedents as a consequence. One way of addressing concerns regarding the family home while still contributing to a progressive tax system could be to include gains on high-value owner occupied homes, for example, if the proceeds exceeded a certain threshold. Other options for taxing residential rental property There are many options available to address the taxation of residential investment property (and other similar property-related transactions), with a CGT being one. However, the scope of a CGT could go far beyond taxing these types of gains. As the debate around CGT has focussed heavily on the housing market, there has been insufficient consideration of other types of gains that might be taxed. If the Group’s view is that New Zealand should tax investment gains in the property market, consideration should be given to more specific, tailored approaches to tax only those particular types of capital gains, such as a risk free return method, discussed below. In addition, as New Zealand is largely a small business economy, a significant source of capital gains exist in business goodwill. Consideration will need to be given as to the extent to which these gains are taxed.

Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY52 Current approach New Zealand currently taxes real property gains through a series of provisions in subpart CB of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA 2007”). These provisions cover certain types of land- related businesses such as land dealing 146 and land development and subdivision 147 . Other general property transactions are covered by s CB 6 of the ITA 2007, which requires income tax to be paid on gains made on property acquired for the purpose or intention of disposal. In our view, IRD has not sought to apply this test with sufficient rigour, resulting in a perception that residential property gains are untaxed. The introduction of the “bright-line” test in 2015 has gone some way to providing clear rules that tax gains made on short-term property investments, however the impetus remains on IRD to enforce the law appropriately. The test currently requires income tax to be paid on any gains that arise from residential property disposed of within five years of acquisition, subject to some exemptions 148 . As this test has only applied to interests in land acquired after 1 October 2015 149 , it is difficult to evaluate its success in capturing certain types of property transactions or to assess its impact on the housing market. As is the case with CGT in most overseas jurisdictions, s CB 6 of the ITA 2007 and the bright-line test focus on taxing realised capital gains – i.e. gains which arise at the point of sale (or certain other disposal events). This timing has little effect on the problems faced by New Zealand’s housing market and can in fact exacerbate these problems. Many residential investment properties are held by their owners for a significant period of time. The investment can often be seen as a form of retirement savings or used as security against further borrowing. Taxing realised gains provides further encouragement for property investors to defer sale of the property to defer taxation, 146 Section CB 9 ITA 2007. 147 Section CB 10 ITA 2007. 148 Section CB 6A ITA 2007. 149 Taxation (Bright-Line Test for Residential Land) Act 2015. 150 Tax Review 2001, Final Paper also known as the “McLeod Report”. or to potentially avoid it altogether in the case of a bright-line test. Such deferral impacts the availability of houses for sale and consequently the affordability of houses. Risk-free rate of return method Another option for taxing investment in certain capital gains (including in the residential rental property market) was supported by both the McLeod Report in 2001 150 and the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group 151 in 2010. The Report published by the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group states “\[t\]he majority of the Tax Working Group support detailed consideration of taxing returns from capital invested in residential rental properties on the basis of a deemed notional return calculated using a risk-free rate 152 .” A risk free return method (“RFRM”) of taxation on certain capital gains should be considered as a way of targeting issues in the housing market without any of the associated issues of a CGT. We agree with both the McLeod Report and the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group that significant research and analysis would need to be undertaken before such a tax could be implemented 153 . We encourage the Group to consider inviting further submissions on an RFRM-based tax. An RFRM-based tax seeks to tax the capital gain in an asset’s value based on an annual notional rate. The notional rate is calculated based on a risk-free real rate of return - i.e. the rate at which the return would be if the funds had been invested in risk-free government bonds (with an adjustment for inflation). An RFRM-based tax is calculated as follows: (Net asset value at start of the year) x (statutory risk-free real rate of return) x (investor’s tax rate). The primary appeal of a RFRM-based tax is that it could address the current distortions in the 151 A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future; Report of the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group (January 2010). 152 A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future; Report of the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group (January 2010), p11. 153 McLeod Report, p27;A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future; Report of the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group (January 2010), p53. Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY53 taxation of different investment vehicles and types. 154 Key issues for consideration include: ►The accuracy of the method in taxing gains in the value of capital, ►What assets would be subject to the tax (possibly including commercial property), ►Methods for determining asset value at the start of the year, ►Integration with other aspects of the tax system (including company taxation and the personal tax rate), ►Liquidity issues for taxpayers paying such a tax annually, ►How within year sales or acquisitions of assets should be accounted for, and ►Transitional measures. We would be happy to make further detailed submissions on a RFRM-based tax on assets, specifically addressing the issues raised above. We recommend the scope of any RFRM-based tax be limited, at least initially, to property transactions (excluding the family home, due to the Group’s Terms of Reference). This limitation would specifically seek to solve the current problem of under-taxation of this type of capital without capturing other forms of capital which are already sufficiently taxed. CGT applying across asset classes The Government has charged the Group with examining the merits of a system of taxing capital gains on assets more broadly than residential property. The Group therefore seeks comment on detailed CGT design, regardless of the merits of such a tax. The insert below does not presume we see a broad-based CGT as desirable.

Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY54 We set out a summary of suggested design elements in the table below, followed by further elaboration on these points.

If a CGT is to focus on reducing wealth inequality, it should apply to all forms of capital including real property, personal property, shares, intangibles, collectibles etc. b.While there may be various public policy reasons to support certain types of exemptions, these are often difficult to apply, exacerbate compliance costs and continue to distort investment behaviours. In a study of CGT in Australia and the UK, complexity was found to be the biggest driver of compliance costs in both countries: “\[i\]t is difficult to envisage any other tax where compliance costs will often exceed the tax payable. And yet the majority of UK respondents and nearly 30% of Australian respondents were able to agree that this was often the case with CGT. 155 ” c.Both the UK and Australia have a number of carve-outs including personal property exemptions, roll-over relief, a venture capital exemption in Australia and entrepreneur’s relief in the UK. d.A broad-based CGT, levied on real gains from all classes of capital asset likely to appreciate on an accruals basis, has strong theoretical appeal. Given the exclusion of taxation of the 155 Evans,The operating costs of taxing the capital gains of individuals: a comparative study of Australia and the UK, with particular reference to the compliance costs of certain tax design features (2003). Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY55 family home from the Group’s Terms of Reference 156 , the discussion below concentrates on second-best alternatives. e.Given our comments above on increasing private retirement savings, the Australasian share exemption for PIEs should be retained and should be extended to cover global shares. (This recognises the fact that with a CGT, the current foreign investment fund regime would need to change). 5.Real vs. nominal gains a.As noted above, the starting point of any tax is that it should only be levied on real gains, not nominal gains – meaning there is no taxation of gains which are solely attributable to inflation. However, this principle is extremely difficult to apply in practice and most of our tax system currently taxes only nominal gains. b.For the majority of capital income, inflation can be immaterial given that tax is levied relatively close to the time of its derivation over a short period. For assets held over a longer-term, the effects of inflation may be significant necessitating some form of allowance to attempt to minimise the taxation of inflation created gains. c.We believe the single biggest CGT design issue is how to account for inflation, particularly on assets held long-term. 6.Inflation. There are several options that can be adopted to account for inflation. Our preferred options, in order of preference, are: a.An accrual based CGT, such as the RFRM discussed earlier. This method makes an annual adjustment for inflation which is relatively easy to apply and can be set at a rate based on real returns on capital. We believe this method would most easily and accurately allow for adjustments for the effect of inflation. b.Taper relief. Many countries have taper relief systems – where the amount of tax levied on the capital gain decreases or is eliminated if the asset is held for a certain period. c.In Australia, assets held for over a year qualify for a partial exemption from CGT (a 50% discount for individuals and trusts and 33.33% for complying superannuation entities). d.Holding period thresholds for taper relief vary significant across countries. Australia and the United States have a one year minimum holding period whereas Germany and France have a minimum period of 10 and 30 years respectively. e.We recommend a taper-style system with a scale for different rates. For example, an asset held for five years might qualify for a 10% discount CGT rate, and an asset held for 10 years might qualify for a 25% discount CGT rate. Such a scale would allow the taper to more accurately reflect the trend of inflation over time, rather than marking a single point in time and applying the concessionary rate at that point. We would not recommend any discount rate beyond 50% because it is unlikely that inflation would effect a gain to this extent except over a very long time (e.g. 30 years). The taper could be periodically reset approximating to inflation outturns over the holding period. f.Indexation. While indexation is likely to be more accurate than a taper relief system, it would also be more complex. Australia previously had an indexation system but this system was replaced in 1999 with tax relief. The UK has also wound back indexation both for individuals and, more recently, companies. 156 Terms of Reference: Tax Working Group (November 2017),https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/terms- reference-tax-working-group (as at 20 April 2018). Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY56 7.Accrual vs. realisation basis a.All OECD countries with a CGT tax capital gains on realisation 157 . However, an accrual basis may be preferable as realisation based CGTs cause “lock-in” where there are incentives to retain assets to defer taxation. In addition, it can take a long time for steady revenue to arise from a realisation-based capital gains system, making it hard to assess the trade-off with compliance costs. 8.Realisation events a.If a realisation-based CGT was to be introduced, we support a system that has relatively few “realisation events” as these are often complex and create a large compliance burden. Looking at CGTs internationally, there are a variety of different definitions of “realisation events”. For example, Australia has over 55 separate “CGT events” which can give rise to capital gains or losses. This is in part because of the wide variety of capital assets and transactions which are subject to CGT. b.Particular consideration should be given to finding a balance between minimising complex realisation rules and reducing opportunities to subvert the CGT through certain tax structuring activities, for example granting exclusive rights to an asset without transferring actual ownership. Realisation rules will also need to cover a number of other situations, including: i.Assets or asset holders leaving New Zealand, ii.Different rights to use assets, and iii.CGT assets becoming subject to other tax rules such as the trading stock or financial arrangements rules. 9.Calculating capital gains and losses a.Most countries with a CGT determine the amount of capital gain or loss by taking the difference between the value of the asset on the date of acquisition and the value on the date of realisation 158 , possibly subject to transitional concessions (discussed later). b.One of the more significant challenges a CGT will face is how to determine the value of assets at the date of acquisition. Some assets may have a natural cost base, for example assets purchased from a third party, however other assets, such as shares in a privately held company, do not have any clear cost base. For all assets other than listed shares, the opportunity to manipulate value based on the market concerned and the availability of different valuation methods is problematic. c.We would expect to see significant valuation activity following the introduction of a CGT, leading to subjective but defensible valuations by taxpayers using specialist resources which may not be available to Inland Revenue. While commercial valuations are a forward-looking measure generally based on the net present value of future cash flows, professional valuers frequently quote a wide range of possible valuations and buyer/seller valuations differ substantially. 10.Treatment of capital losses a.We believe any CGT should ring fence losses similar to the system in Australia – i.e. capital losses can only be offset against capital gains and cannot be offset against other forms of 157 Harding, M. (2013), “Taxation of Dividend, Interest and Capital Gain Income”,OECD Taxation Working Papers,No. 19, OECD Publishing, Paris, p32. Seehttp://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k3wh96w246k-en(as at 26 April 2018). 158 Harding, M. (2013), “Taxation of Dividend, Interest and Capital Gain Income”,OECD Taxation Working Papers,No. 19, OECD Publishing, Paris, p32. Seehttp://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k3wh96w246k-en(as at 26 April 2018). Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY57 income. Capital losses should be able to be carried forward subject to standard loss continuity rules. b.Allowing capital losses to be offset against other forms of taxable income would likely lead to tax planning opportunities where individuals try to maximise capital losses to offset against other forms of taxable income, while deferring gains. 11.“Black hole” and feasibility expenditure a.Implementation of a CGT strengthens the case for ensuring all “black hole” and feasibility expenditure is deductible. b.An Australian provision that allows a deduction (spread over five years) for capital expenditure not otherwise deductible could be a useful model to follow. 12.Transitional measures.There are two choices for transitioning to a CGT. A CGT could: a.Apply to any asset sold after the effective date, based on the gain over valuation at the effective date. This approach was adopted by Canada when introducing a CGT, or b.Apply to any asset acquired after the effective date. This approach was adopted by Australia when introducing a CGT. c.We prefer the first approach which results in an effective date where all assets are brought within the scope of the CGT. No specific “grandparenting” provisions are required which have been a source of complexity in the Australian system. d.While this approach could lead to a flurry of activity before the effective date (as taxpayers try to offload capital assets to avoid taxation), we believe this outcome is preferable to a complex system of “grandparenting” provisions and an extended period where many capital assets will remain outside the scope of the CGT. We understand the practical issues with this approach. Asset-based taxes Capital income taxation alone doesn’t tackle wealth inequality. It is also necessary to consider asset-based taxes. There are two main forms of asset-based taxes: wealth taxes and land taxes, with land taxes being a subset of wealth taxes. These taxes are considered further below. Wealth taxes Globally, net wealth taxes have become unfashionable in practice. In 1990, 12 OECD countries levied net wealth taxes 159 . In 2017, only France, Norway, Spain and Switzerland imposed them (with Iceland having reinstated its wealth tax as a temporary fiscal measure). 159 OECD (2018),The Role and Design of Net Wealth Taxes in the OECD, OECD Tax Policy Studies, No. 26, OECD Publishing, Paris,http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264290303-en (as at 26 April 2018). 160 Seehttp://www.ey.com/gl/en/services/people-advisory-services/hc-alert--france-publishes-2018-finance-bill(as at 26 April 2018). 161 OECD (2018),The Role and Design of Net Wealth Taxes in the OECD, OECD Tax Policy Studies, No. 26, OECD Publishing, Paris,http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264290303-en (as at 26 April 2018). As of January 2018, France has replaced its net wealth tax with a “real estate wealth tax” on high value immovable property 160 . Nevertheless, the perceptions of high levels of wealth concentration have spurred a renewed interest in the redistributive potential of wealth taxes 161 . Wealth taxes in practice Wealth taxes can take many forms and overlap with other taxes to the extent to which those other taxes are also imposed on wealth as opposed to flows of income or expenditure. An accrued CGT is an example of a wealth tax, being a tax on appreciation. Land taxes are Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY58 effectively a wealth tax restricted to stocks of land. Our comments here centre around wealth tax in the form of an annual tax on net worth. In principle, a wealth tax would apply to the net value of all assets held by an individual – shares, houses, pension funds, beneficial interests in trusts, chattels etc. The Group’s Terms of Reference narrow the scope of any potential wealth tax by excluding changes which would apply to the family home 162 . Advantages of wealth taxes Potential benefits of an annual tax on net worth include: ►Wealth taxes contribute to horizontal and vertical equity, or fairness. ►Wealth taxes contribute to horizontal equity as they are indifferent to the form in which wealth is held. ►In terms of vertical equity, wealth is far more concentrated than income – wealth taxes would therefore be strongly progressive, more so than any plausible personal income tax scale. ►Wealth taxes promote efficiency. ►Given the tax is based on assets held, active income generating use of those assets is encouraged, including potentially disposal to a more productive user. ►Administering the wealth tax also promotes coherence within the tax system. ►The data required by Inland Revenue to assess the tax should prove useful in administering other parts of the tax system. ►Wealth taxes can encourage a substitution from physical to human capital (assuming human capital will be exempt). ►As human capital is important for long-term growth, the actual harm of 162 Terms of Reference: Tax Working Group (November 2017), https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/terms- reference-tax-working-group (as at 20 April 2018). wealth taxes to economic growth may be overstated. ►Where asset values are updated frequently, a net wealth tax effectively functions as a tax on accruals, avoiding the “lock-in effect” promoted by taxation on realisation. Disadvantages of wealth taxes Various counter arguments exist: ►New Zealand would become a less attractive place for non-residents to allocate capital. ►Revenue raising potential may be limited. ►Owner-occupied housing accounts for about 30% of a household’s total assets 163 . If the Government decides to introduce a land tax (effectively a wealth tax on a subset of wealth), and if the family home is exempt from any wealth tax, the revenue on offer could be limited. ►Capital is increasingly mobile. ►Individuals could seek to shift assets outside the scope of IRD’s ability to locate them. While tax transparency is increasing, it remains possible that individuals may seek to hide many forms of wealth – whether in the form of cryptocurrencies, precious metals or gemstones, or behind discretionary trusts. ►Valuation may be difficult. ►For those assets which are disclosed, beyond land and listed investment, valuation would be at best inexact. ►As discussed above, New Zealand is often regarded as having a savings problem. Any meaningful wealth tax would include KiwiSaver and other forms of superannuation – would such a reform be desirable or sustainable? 163 Statistics New Zealand household net worth statistics for year ended 30 June 2015. See also http://archive.stats.govt.nz/browse\_for\_stats/people \_and\_communities/Households/HouseholdNetWorthS tatistics\_HOTPYeJun15.aspx(as at 20 April 2018). Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY59 ►Asset allocation issues may arise. For example, if residential property is exempt, that would seem to exacerbate any perceived bias towards investing in housing. ►Individuals with high value assets but low realised income may encounter cash flow issues when paying the tax. ►Individuals who save more while young to consume while older will pay more tax compared to those who spread their income more equally over their lifetimes, resulting in horizontal inequity. While a potential wealth tax may be worth further investigation as part of a review of New Zealand’s system for taxing capital income, the disadvantages outlined above may mean a wealth tax could be impractical for New Zealand at the current time. In particular, a wealth tax is likely to be hard to implement and could send a negative signal to investors. Land taxes “When applied uniformly across a broad base, land tax is one of the most efficient means of raising revenue.” 164 Land taxes are essentially a subset of wealth taxes. As with wealth taxes, on balance land taxes promote efficiency – they are likely to increase the efficiency with which land is used. Of the different forms of wealth, land is well- suited to a tax – the stock is fixed and the tax non-distortionary. Expanding these arguments: ►Land tax has the ability to collect sustainable and substantial amounts of taxation using a low rate, provided there are few exemptions (like in Denmark which collects 1.3% of GDP per year from land tax 165 ). 164 Australia’s Future Tax System: Final Report: Part 1 – Overview – Chapter 6: Land and resource taxes (released in May 2010), http://taxreview.treasury.gov.au/content/FinalRepor t.aspx?doc=html/publications/papers/Final\_Report\_P art\_1/chapter\_6.htm (as at 26 April 2018). 165 Morgan Foundation, Alex Staples and Geoff Simmons,Taxing Wealth & Property: What Works? A review of wealth and property taxation around the world (April 2016), http://morganfoundation.org.nz/wp- ►Revenue can be used to fund other tax rate reductions while using a low broad rate of taxation. ►A land tax will improve the equity and fairness of the current system as property, an investment, will be taxed as other investments are. ►Administration is unlikely to be complex - based on the ability of local councils to levy “rates” based on land or property values – and the costs of administering a land tax are likely to be low in proportion to revenue raised 166 . Implementation will be challenging Should a land tax be introduced, there are concerns which would need to be resolved prior to introduction. When considering the desirability of a land tax, the Group should focus on how to mitigate the following issues: ►The reaction to past land tax proposals has tended to focus on the ability to pay for individuals and businesses that may be asset rich but cash poor. This impact would most likely be on retirees, Māori authorities and farmers. ►In relation to cash poor farmers, the obligation to pay land tax could reduce the purchase of fertiliser and/or reduce or prevent money being put towards other productive investments. In effect, the promoted efficiency gains may go into reverse for cash-constrained farmers. ►A land tax might not be politically sustainable and could be vulnerable to repeal. Concerns around the political sustainability of a land tax were raised by the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group in 2010 167 . content/uploads/2016/04/MF\_WealthTaxation\_Repo rt.pdf?bcsi\_scan\_01d939382f6c0b14=0&bcsi\_scan\_ filename=MF\_WealthTaxation\_Report.pdf (as at 26 April 2018). 166 Most of these, and other points in this note, were made by the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group or the Morgan Foundation. 167 A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future: Report of the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group (January 2010). Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY60 ►Even if a land tax is not repealed, pressure is likely to build for exemptions which have historically tended to undermine loopholes. Which exemptions are justified? ►It is possible that uncertainty around the longevity and scope of any potential land tax could result in unstable land prices and a reduction in efficiency. A land tax could cause investment decisions to be made based on uncertainty around future rates of return as opposed to current rates of return. ►Land tax is likely to depress land values. By how much? What impact will that have on existing finance secured over land? ►It is possible that depressed land values could delay land development. Cash that could have been used for land development may need to be used to decrease debt levels and smooth equity values. ►Given the likelihood of exemptions, land tax burdens tend to fall on the middle class, as exemptions exclude the poor and the wealthy find loopholes to exploit. ►The introduction of a land tax will put pressure on the accuracy of land valuations. Revenue raising potential The Group’s Terms of Reference exclude the land under the family home from the ambit of any land tax 168 . While we are not aware of any recent estimates of the total value of New Zealand land, a conservative estimate could be around $500 billion in total, of which perhaps $200 billion is residential owner-occupied land 169 . A 1% per annum land tax, before exclusions beyond the family home, could potentially raise $3 billion per annum. Assuming the land tax would be a deductible expense for income tax purposes, perhaps $2 billion would be realistic. This revenue could be recycled into a range of enhancements to other parts of the tax system 168 Terms of Reference: Tax Working Group (November 2017), https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/terms- reference-tax-working-group (as at 20 April 2018). and/or go towards managing the impact of the tax on selected individuals. Possible measures to reduce impact Cash flow issues could be managed by way of deferral for selected taxpayers until the property is sold (for example, retirees or Māori land). Use-of-money interest could be charged on the deferred amount, perhaps at rates linked to inflation rather than at the standard IRD rate. Māori land is typically held in perpetuity so deferral could in substance become permanent. Taonga/heritage land assets will particularly need consideration. Furthermore, much of the land held by Māori organisations may either be undeveloped or employed in low yield industries (e.g. forestry). Rates could be varied based on the class of land. For example, farmland or Māori land could attract a differential rate of tax. Low value land could potentially be excluded entirely to manage equity concerns. Given the fixed nature of land supply, it would be possible to vary land tax rates by region should this be seen as desirable for regional development or other purposes. 169 Land tax: Background Paper for Session 3 of the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group, drawing on Fiscal Distribution and Efficiency Impacts of Land and Property Taxes, Coleman Andrew and Arthur Grimes (2009).

So they pay twice as much GST on food and six times more GST on clothing. Only 15% of the benefit from an exemption on food in New Zealand would have gone to the bottom 20% of households by income.” 170 Snapshot The GST system is an exemplary revenue raiser. New Zealand captures 97% of GST’s potential revenue. The OECD average is 56%. Taken in isolation, GST is mildly regressive, but GST is not paid in isolation. It forms part of a tax system which is progressive in overall terms. Recommendations 1.Maintain existing GST base as the case for selective zero rating or lower rating is weak. 2.Address any distributional concerns through other parts of the tax system. Of all the VAT/GST systems in the OECD New Zealand has the second most efficient model in terms of potential revenue captured (behind Luxembourg) 171 . In the 2016 OECD report on consumption tax trends New Zealand captured 97% of GST’s potential revenue 172 – significantly above the next closest country Switzerland (71%) and the OECD average (56%) 173 . In 2017 the Government collected around 20% of its 170 Douglas, Sir Roger (2007),The New Zealand GST Policy Choice and its Political Implications,GST in Retrospect and Prospect, Thomson Brookers. 171 OECD (2016),Consumption Tax Trends 2016: VAT/GST and excise rates, trends and policy issues, OECD Publishing, Paris. 106. 172 At 105 173 At 105 174 New Zealand Treasury (2017),Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand for the year ended 30 June 2017,New Zealand Treasury, Wellington. 7. total revenue from GST 174 , despite the GST rate being significantly lower than income tax rates. An efficient and comprehensive tax This efficiency comes from our long-standing policy of having a comprehensive rate of GST on all goods and services, with very few exceptions. New Zealand’s GST system is the most functional element of our overall tax 6.GST is New Zealand’s most effective tax Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY63 system, altering the scheme with new exceptions should be approached with caution. Weak case for GST exemptions on particular goods or services GST is a great tool for revenue-gathering but not for redistributing wealth. Because GST is applied on all goods and services equally there is no variation in tax burden depending on income levels. This has led to suggestions of lowering GST on specific goods and services to give GST a more progressive nature. One of the more popular subjects for GST reduction is fresh fruit and vegetables. The inefficiencies of lowering GST can be demonstrated through this example: ►Limited benefit to low income consumers: high income earners will typically purchase more fruit and vegetables than lower income earners. This will in fact be the case for virtually all goods and services. As such, while the price of a given vegetable will decrease uniformly, those with higher incomes will see the greatest benefit in terms of money saved. ►Alternative mechanisms would be better targeted: it is also argued the policy incentivises lower income earners to purchase more fruits and vegetables as a result of lower prices. The issue here is one of poor targeting. More effective relief could be provided to lower earners by adjusting income support. ►Inefficient administration and scope creep: from a retailer perspective, additional difficulty compounds the issue of efficiency. Once an exemption has been granted for “fruit and vegetables” it is in the interests of a retailer to classify as many goods as “fruit” or “vegetables” as possible. While something like a bag of potatoes is obviously covered, we can start placing goods along a spectrum of “vegetable”. Does a bag of frozen potato wedges count? Should potato fries at fast food restaurants be exempt? There is significant scope to apply exemption to goods that perhaps should not be 175 Dimitris Chronopoulos (2016),Future Issues in Bank Taxation, University of St Andrews, Fife. 14. captured; and the cost of regulating this is likely to be high. The GST and financial services conundrum The main GST exemption is the provision of financial services. Banks make money through interest rate spreads. Having higher interest rates on money lent than interest paid from deposits. For example a bank may lend $100 with an interest rate of 6%. The loan would yield $6. The bank may also offer 1% on deposits, so if an account holder deposited $100, the bank would pay $1. The bank’s net interest is $5, though GST cannot currently be applied to that earning. The issue is that there is no explicit transaction that has granted that $5; it is the result of two other transactions that in real terms are completely disconnected. In theory, it should be possible to overcome this difficulty, but in practice we have yet to see good outcomes. For example: ►Unbundling: some financial institutions have sophisticated activity based costing systems and funds transfer pricing systems which could be developed in future to calculate the value added on each transaction. Widespread implementation of these systems is not currently commonplace however, and attempting to force compliance at present is likely to yield low tax revenue. Research into a similar system in the US reported a yield of only 0.4% more revenue to the IRS 175 . Where the US has a much higher proportion of financial services as part of its GDP. ►Proxy taxes: for example, the IMF floated a Financial Activities Tax in 2010 176 . The tax would proxy GST by taxing the sum of cash-flow profit and remuneration for each tax period. The effect being that a tax is applied to the net financial intake of the financial institution, representing the service they provide. Such a tax would require detailed information about the bank in question, some of which is unlikely to be available. To apply the tax an element of estimation or speculation would 176 European Commission (2010),Financial sector taxation, Taxation papers, Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, Luxembourg. 14. Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY64 be needed. Because of the difficulty in creating a fair system in those circumstances we believe that a Financial Activities Tax is difficult to justify at present. GST as part of a wider progressive tax system At any given point in time, GST is regressive as individuals who consume a higher proportion of their income are taxed proportionately more as a fraction of that income. Taking a lifetime basis, the picture changes. Most savings are eventually converted into spending on goods and services. A regressive element remains in that unspent income is not taxed on death. But GST does not exist inside a vacuum, and is better considered as part of the wider tax system. The combination of our GST, income tax and transfer system is redistributive, and the extent of that redistribution is better managed through its non-GST elements. Moving away from the current broad GST base comes with significant concerns for efficiency and equity. We recommend it is in New Zealand’s best interests to maintain the current system. GST and managed funds and link to retirement savings Under this heading of GST, we also wish to add our support to the submissions made by others about the GST treatment of fees charged to managed funds and the flow-on link to retirement savings. As we have noted above, New Zealand has a private savings problem which will not be helped by investors suffering a layer of non-recoverable GST on fees charged to managed funds either directly or indirectly.

The Generic Tax Policy Process has fallen short of its potential The Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) has served New Zealand well. It has three main objectives: ► To encourage early, explicit consideration of key policy elements and trade-offs, ► To provide an opportunity for substantial external input into the policy formation process, and ► To clarify the responsibilities and accountabilities of participants in the process. 178 In substance, GTPP has tended to take the form of the Government proposing change through some form of consultation document, considering written submissions, and legislating its final decisions. Implementation and review of policy has been a particular weakness: Parliament is not well- placed to oversee detailed, technical rules while post-implementation reviews have at best been a token rubber stamp, if they have in fact occurred at all. 179 GTPP is no longer sustainable in its current form The world of tax has seen more transformation in the past five years than in the past 50; the next five are likely to bring even more change. Fatally, GTPP assumes it is possible for a small group of (mainly IRD) officials to gather sufficient, high quality external views in this changing world. Small open economies, however, no longer have autonomy on tax policy issues – no country is an island. Our agenda is driven from overseas (as with the BEPS and digital tax issues), through non-tax priorities (environmental 178 Sir Ivor Richardson, Report on the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department (1994) 179 Emerging problems with GTPP were detected as early as the McLeod Review (2001) and reaffirmed by the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group (2010). issues, housing) and forces outside the ambit of tax professionals (technology, population ageing). Forces impacting on New Zealand tax policy Even a well-run and well-resourced GTPP will be unable to respond to all of these forces. It needs institutional support. Tax policy struggles to deliver efficient outcomes Voters will always be poorly informed on tax policy. 180 Chances are, any given issue will be seen in isolation, with disconnected policy debates on the rise. 181 Institutional reforms which improve transparency and public understanding can mitigate, but not eliminate, this problem. There are also inherent biases in policymaking: ► Retention of the status quo - any government policy creates a support group which will argue in favour of its retention. That policy will be built into pricing and industry eco-structures – so will be hard to eliminate if the government priorities 180 This will be so even for the Group, notwithstanding the innovative social media techniques adopted and the Group’s open approach to communications beyond the tax professional audience. 181 Discussion around sugar taxes is a case in point. Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY68 change. R&D tax incentives and film production incentives are two such examples. If New Zealand wishes to be an innovative, creative country with a screen production industry, these two items will be part of its toolkit. ►Official orthodoxy predominates– fora technical subject such as taxation, the ability to implement technical changes lies with the executive, which in turn depends on IRD officials. Unequal access- concentrated, organised groups have a disproportionate advantage in seeking policies from which they benefit, as the costs will be spread across the entire population, which will be unlikely to oppose what may be a small or invisible impost. Parliamentary scrutiny is weak Parliament is not well placed to address these biases. It is unreasonable to expect the current Finance and Expenditure Select Committee to devote scarce Parliamentary time to correcting legislation, or to carrying out in-depth post- implementation reviews of policy. The reality is that Parliament has neither the time nor the skill nor the desire to undertake any systematic or effective examination of whatever tax rules the government of the day places before it for its approval. A stronger Parliamentary consideration of tax issues would include a meaningful and informed debate about taxation policy. Parliament needs to discuss the economic implications of proposals and alternative policy choices. It is hard to see that fixing technical errors in draft legislation is a good use of Select Committee time. One option would be to create a separate Taxation Select Committee giving members more exposure to tax issues and with greater access to specialist expertise. A strong focus on supply of taxation statistics to inform policy debate will assist As outlined in this submission, tax policy requires a complex interaction of global competitiveness with policy drivers, applied to 182 http://www.afr.com/news/ato-tax-statistics-top- 10pc-pay-45pc-of-net-tax-top-1pc-pay-17pc- 20180427-h0zcn1 the actual facts of New Zealand incomes, wealth and tax payments. As noted earlier, the natural behavioural desire of participants to seek their own agendas, there are challenges if the population does not have access to high quality tax statistics. We observe for example that Australia has seen in recent months a strong debate about perceived inequality of income and tax “fairness” of payments but the top percentage or quintile bands of Australian taxpayers. The debate release by the Australian Taxation Office of statistics demonstrating the significant tax payments by the top income bands 182 has added significant light onto the debate, but the delay in that release has potentially distorted the debate in the intervening period. For this reason we highlight the need, in today’s knowledge economy, of timely, consistent and frequent releases of key data about relevant data relevant in the tax policy context. We see that such data and statistics are important to retain public confidence and political confidence in the appropriateness of New Zealand tax policies. We suggest therefore a substantial focus on tax statistical transparency and information, to drive the debate going forward. A board of taxation could improve scrutiny In 2000, Australia established a Board of Taxation, charged with contributing a business and broader community perspective to improving the design of taxation laws and their operation. A comparable board for New Zealand could: Through its membership, broaden the range of skills and interests brought to bear on tax policy issues. ►Bring an enduring focus on tax reform to government. ►Review “exposure draft” or equivalent legislation to ensure it works on a technical level: that is, the legislation delivers government policy. ►Carry out post-implementation reviews of Future of Tax EY’s submission to the Tax Working Group EY69 tax policy, operations and legislation. ►Recommend remedial amendments to tax law within the framework of government policy. Membership could appointed on a rotating basis, according to the needs of the government of the day, to include business, Māori, academic, civil society and tax professional skills. The appointment criteria used for Crown entity and State Owned Entity boards could prove a useful model to follow.

FANZ member companies are Ballance Agri-Nutrients Ltd and Ravensdown Limited. Both these companies are farmer co-operatives with some 45,000 farmer shareholders, and between them supply over 98% of all fertiliser used in New Zealand. 2 The cooperative base of the fertiliser industry means the industry is driven by delivering best value to its farmer shareholders. The industry is focussed on fertiliser effectiveness and efficiency enabling profitable farming operating within environmental limits. 3 FANZ on behalf of the industry supports and encourages an environmentally responsible, science-based approach to nutrient management and regulation. 4 FANZ member companies provide product that is critical to New Zealand farming systems with interests and responsibility across all agricultural sectors, including dairy, sheep, beef, arable and horticulture. The industry has an almost unique pan-sector perspective. 5 To promote good management practices, FANZ has funded training programmes, and developed codes of practice, information booklets and fact sheets. FANZ also funds research, partners with government on research and development projects, and works closely with other organisations in the agricultural sector on industry-good issues. Along with AgResearch and the Ministry for Primary Industries, FANZ is a part owner of OVERSEER ® . OVERSEER is discussed in the body of this submission. It is an agricultural management tool which assists farmers and their advisers to examine nutrient use and movements within a farm system. (see appendix A for background information on OVERSEER) FANZ’s philosophy and approach 6 The industry supports systems that provide flexibility for land users to achieve desired outcome from an environmental and production perspective by managing farm system losses. This allows farmers to choose the most effective way of achieving outcomes for their particular property. It helps avoid regulation un-intentionally constraining business growth and allows for flexibility, innovation and transition to achieve both primary production goals and environmental outcomes. 7 In an environmental context FANZ supports ‘effects’ based measures as prescribed under the RMA. Effects in this context result from the losses from the farm system. Many losses cannot be measured directly. In the absence of direct measurement, modelling approaches can be used for management of effects. The model OVERSEER estimates a farm system’s annual average inputs and outputs of nutrients per hectare per year. 3 8 This Fertiliser Association of New Zealand (FANZ) submission on The Future of Tax primarily addresses issues relating to tax considerations as they apply to agricultural emissions and nutrient management. Executive summary 9 Taxes are accepted for the purpose of revenue gathering and/or to drive behaviour. 10 Environmentally focussed taxes are considered to have the primary purpose of driving behaviour leading to favourable environmental outcomes. A secondary purpose could be raising revenue to deal with negative externalities or to support investment in innovation. 11 In the context of an environmentally focussed tax, key considerations for a national tax are to avoid a blunt ineffective tool and provide for flexibility and innovation to address locally diverse impacts on the environment, while providing for efficient and internationally competitive productivity. Dealing with varied environmental impacts under taxation policy 12 One difficulty in implementation of environmental taxes is due to the complex and varied relationship, between land use activities and impact on natural resources. For an issue such as water quality, the impact will vary catchment by catchment. In one catchment the impact of concern might be bacteriological contamination, in another the issue could be the adverse impact of nutrient, in another sediment load. 13 A nationally applied tax system to achieve environmental outcomes under these circumstances, is likely to be inefficient and ineffective. Coherence of taxation policy with other policies 14 A key consideration for an ‘environmental’ tax policy is that it should be coherent with other government objectives and forms a part of a suite of measures rather than being a blunt stand- alone instrument. This means that as well as being coherent with central government policy, coherence is also needed between any tax regime and local government policies. 15 Environmental controls are essentially implemented by regional and district councils under the Resource Management Act, so there is a need to evaluate how central government taxation measures integrate with the wide range of territorial and industry initiatives to target and address local environmental issues. 4 Taxation as a tool for driving behaviour change 16 Driving behaviour change though a taxation approach requires a direct link between behaviour and what being taxed. There are potential risks in using tax alone to drive behaviour. A low tax could prevent a proper focus on mitigations – because it will be cheaper to pay the tax rather than bear the costs of mitigation. A high tax can have a significant impact on national economic productivity and social well-being. 17 Nitrogen fertiliser is an essential component of modern farming practices and nitrogen fertiliser use is relatively inelastic to changes in price. Taxation on nitrogen for environmental controls, either as a straight input control or an output-based tax, as proposed by some, are unlikely to effect behaviour change nor deliver any improvements above and beyond existing initiatives in development, including regulatory and non-regulatory controls. A tax on nitrogen would introduce unnecessary complexity and administrative burden to the tax regime for little direct environmental benefit. Taxation targeted at revenue generation 18 Tax can also generate revenue with which to address mitigations, community programmes, compensate for degradation, or allow for government investment in innovation. Administrative efficiency has to be a key consideration in gaining revenue this way. Equally important the tax must be recognised as fair and justified. International competitiveness 19 New Zealand agriculture sells products in a global market so international competitiveness needs to be a consideration. Should New Zealand land-based industries face unique costs which are not borne by their competitors in the international market place? Consideration to ensuring retention of international competitiveness in light of any added tax burden imposed on land users is key, not least because of the primary industry generates more than 50 % of New Zealand’ export earnings. 20 International (global) greenhouse gas commitments based on absolute limits for emissions must be addressed, however food security considerations and production efficiency consideration require provision for intensity-based measures as part of a suite of options. Can international approaches be translated to a New Zealand context? 21 Examples of fertiliser taxes used internationally cannot be transferred to a New Zealand circumstance because of New Zealand’s unique position compared to OECD countries with its reliance on agriculture and its absence of subsidies. 5 22 It is noted and supported that New Zealand’s current tax system was rated by US based Tax Foundation in 2017, as second in the world for competitiveness. The Foundation states that the taxation system was changed in 2010 in response to trends where New Zealand was losing its international competitiveness. By this measure New Zealand may be deemed to be in a favourable position overall under the current tax system, requiring only adjustment of the components of which the overall rating is comprised. Principled based approach to taxation 23 The Fertiliser Association supports the principles that: o Tax systems should avoid complexity o Tax systems must be seen as fair and equitable o Tax systems achieve or drive desired outcomes 24 And to ensure economic and social well-being for New Zealand, a tax for revenue collection or behaviour change should: o operate neutrally and as much in the background as possible, (meaning impose as little distortion on economic decisions as possible), and, o retain as much international competitiveness as possible 25 These very broad principles are consistent with the Government’s stated principles and objectives for tax which are articulated in the Terms of Reference for the Tax Working Group. 26 Taxes that might apply to environmental outcomes and agricultural production, is the focus of this submission. Submission 27 In the recent past discussions, environmental tax has been proposed in the form of taxes on: nitrogen fertiliser input; nitrogen leaching losses; greenhouse gas losses. 28 Other taxes impacting on agricultural production may include: land tax, resource rental tax, water take or water use tax 6 Environmental Taxes – Nitrogen 29 Nitrates are raised in the discussion in the Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper under environmental considerations, in relation to monitored water sites in New Zealand. 30 The paper states; “Nitrate levels have generally worsened at monitored water sites, although phosphorous levels have improved” 31 To address the issue effectively, it is important to understand the context of this statement. Ministry for the Environment and Statistics New Zealand report, “Our fresh water 2017” notes (page 7), that: “The water quality information largely comes from regional and unitary councils, NIWA, and GNS monitoring networks. For the regional council networks in particular, many monitored sites tend to be in areas of known, or suspected, issues so that regional councils can make management decisions; however, this potentially leads to a biased view of national water quality. To overcome this issue, we used modelled water quality data to estimate water quality in areas where we do not have data. We also use models to estimate nitrate leaching and periphyton growth, to help us build the story around water quality pressures and impacts. We currently have limited data on the pressures and impacts related to water quality, particularly monitored data at a national scale.” 32 and states (page 10); “However, the trends for nitrate-nitrogen and dissolved reactive phosphorus vary across the country. For some monitored sites, nitrate nitrogen concentrations were improving and dissolved reactive phosphorus concentrations were worsening. For some sites we could not determine a trend direction.” 33 The Fertiliser Association would argue that it is very clear that the management of nitrogen and phosphorus levels in New Zealand waterways, is a complex issue, which varies by catchment and land use, soil type, terrain and climate. 34 Therefore, nitrate and phosphate losses are unlikely to be successfully managed by a blunt tax instrument applied a national level. It would not be efficient or effective. 35 The drivers of water quality deterioration are different in different catchments. A national level tax would not be able to be proportionate to the impacts in different catchments which vary enormously. To be fair and equitable, such a system would, by necessity, be very complex and cumbersome and would not readily meet the criteria listed in the Principles of a Good Tax System as described in the Future of Tax submissions background document. 7 36 The Resource Management Act (RMA) requires controls to avoid, remedy or mitigate the adverse effects of activities on the environment for the purpose of sustainable management of natural resources. 37 The RMA is an effects-based statute which addresses activities that have the potential to cause adverse effects on the environment. In respect to water quality it is not just nutrient losses from activities, but also sediment and microbial contaminant losses which give rise to the adverse water quality effects. Managing losses from these activities on productive land is particularly important in the New Zealand context, because New Zealand is unique amongst OECD countries due to its reliance on the primary industries for its export income and to support our economy and our standard of living. 38 An output, (effects-based) control, addressing catchment specific conditions provides flexibility for primary sector to develop innovative solutions to address the losses, while maintaining productivity to support our economy. An effects-based approach can be tailored to meet the appropriate standards for different catchments and communities. (e.g. Appropriate water quality standards and limits for productive lowland pasture will different to those for productive tussock or steep hill country regions. Nitrogen losses in a sub-catchment of a shallow lake will have very different environmental implications to the same losses in a sub-catchment of a river system near the coast). 39 A nationally applied tax system on nitrogen inputs, or even nitrogen losses, will not provide an effective outcome for environmental management across New Zealand. 40 The regional council approach under the RMA generally gives effect to the knowledge that nitrogen losses from the farm system come from multiple sources, and generally recognises that direct losses from fertiliser are one, relatively small component, compared to the overall system losses from pastoral agriculture i . 41 In pastoral agriculture nitrogen fertiliser is principally used strategically to fill feed gaps. Nitrogen fertiliser provides for increased pasture growth, and therefore provides an alternative to importing more expensive supplementary feeds into the farm systems. This strategic input is particularly important for dairy farms at times of low commodity prices. It is important to recognise also that in the absence of nitrogen fertilisers, supplementary feed also introduces nitrogen into the farm system. As stated above, it is recognised that most nitrogen loss from a pastoral farm system is driven by livestock urine deposits, not the fertiliser inputs themselves. 42 A tax to address all nitrogen inputs (e.g. clover fixed nitrogen, supplementary feed and fertiliser) would be even more cumbersome, inefficient and inequitable than a tax on nitrogen fertiliser alone. 8 43 Furthermore, for most farm systems the fertiliser cost is the single biggest farm expense, (excluding labour, and for some dairy farms, feed supplements). There is already a strong financial incentive to use these products effectively and efficiently. Accountability for nutrient use has been redoubled with regional council regulation being introduced in most intensive farming areas, which is requiring the reduction of nitrogen losses from the farm systems. 44 Fertilisers are an essential component of modern farming. Where there is a tax imposed on essential inputs, the taxation may be viewed as a revenue collecting exercise rather than specifically addressing behaviour change. 45 Recent history of the relatively inelastic nature of nitrogen fertiliser use in response to price, is demonstrated when considering average change in urea prices in New Zealand from one year to the next, relative to the annual estimate of total nitrogen use in New Zealand, (Figure 1). 46 Using industry estimates, Figure 1 shows clearly that despite some occasions with reduced nitrogen fertiliser use at times of increased price, there are also many times of significant increase in urea fertiliser price where the annual nitrogen fertiliser use has remained relatively static or marginally increased. And there are several examples showing a reduction in nitrogen use, regardless of a fall in the price of urea. 47 The relatively inelastic nature of nitrogen fertiliser use in New Zealand in response to price, means that any tax imposed to drive behaviour change would have to be so significant it would have a detrimental effect on the agriculture productivity and international competitiveness of our primary industry. (Tax on petrol provides a good example of a tax on an essential input where demand and use is relatively inelastic to price, and therefore a tax to drive behaviour change would have to be so high, it would risk significant economic impacts) 9 Figure 1 : Relative changes in average urea price compared to changes in estimated national nitrogen consumption 48 Several international reports, in particular from Europe, address taxes on nitrogen fertiliser inputs to achieve environmental benefits. In general, these reports confirm some reduction on fertiliser use as a result of tax, however, the circumstances are not directly applicable to New Zealand because of the subsidies provided for farms. Furthermore, the application of environmental tax has only been one part the approach, which is also reliant on significant investment in education and extension support. 49 In some countries the fertiliser tax revenue was used to subsidise agricultural exports. In some European countries, (e.g. Finland and Austria) where significant fertiliser taxes were introduced, these were later abolished ii . 50 Therefore, for a combination of reasons, a tax system on nitrogen inputs as applied to European agricultural settings is not comparable to the New Zealand economic circumstance where there are no subsidies and there is full exposure to economic signals. 51 Through industry programmes and regional council approaches to managing water quality there are already a number of regulatory and non-regulatory controls which limit nitrogen losses. There are a number of regional council and industry- based education programmes targeting improved farm systems and environmental accountability. -300 -200 -100 0 100 200 300 400 1999200020012002200320042005200620072008200920102011201220132014201520162017 Relative changes in N use and urea price Urea PriceConsumption Vol (Nitrogen) 10 52 Introducing a blunt nitrogen fertiliser tax to achieve similar initiatives would be at best, unnecessary, and at worst, counterproductive, as a tax would be unlikely to drive behaviour change beyond what is being achieved by current programmes, and would impose a cost on what is an essential component of many farm systems, as demonstrated by the relative inelasticity to price. OVERSEER ® 53 Many regulatory controls being implemented by regional councils to address nitrogen losses to freshwater bodies recognise the importance of providing for economically viable agricultural production with flexibility to respond to market forces and to adopt innovative solutions. Measuring these farm system losses is prohibitively expensive so a modelling approach has been adopted. OVERSEER Nutrient Budget model has been recognised as the best available tool and has been incorporated into regulation in many regional councils. 54 The election manifesto of the Green Party clearly recognises the value of OVERSEER Nutrient Budget model, but has recommended a tax based on nitrogen losses modelled using OVERSEER. 55 While this approach of taxing farm system losses is consistent with an effects-based approach supported by the fertiliser industry, the industry is opposed to this taxation for several reasons. 56 In the first instance, the effects-based limits on nitrogen loss are being developed under Resource Management Act legislation and further significant farm system change is anticipated under the soon to be developed climate change mitigation requirements. If an output tax is applied on top of the costs for farm system changes, or on top of the additional production costs and new investments required by the primary industry to meet nutrient loss limits to achieve these environmental targets, then the proposed tax becomes a punitive taxation measure with no benefit other than to gather revenue. 57 It is proposed by the Green Party that the tax revenue will be targeted to environmental programmes (reinvested to ‘sustainable farming’) however, the cost of RMA compliance will be very significant for many farms, driving adaptation and change. Adaptation and change will be expensive and difficult to sustain under existing legislation. An additional tax burden on nutrient loss which meets obligations under the RMA, will very likely have significant impact on the economic viability of the primary industry. 58 Such an approach could not be seen as fair and equitable, because it imposes a ‘double whammy’ of costs on the producers already obliged by legislation to achieve environmental limits. 11 59 The proposed tax burden based on output limits using OVERSEER Nutrient Budgets faces an additional obstacle if the nature of modelling at farm system level is well understood. 60 The OVERSEER Nutrient Budget model is a long-term, annual average model used to understand nutrient cycling in a farm system. It assumes the farm system is in equilibrium and not undergoing change. The model cannot measure nutrient losses, but provides for a benchmark and an estimate based on the farm management system. 61 The model can be run using information that is owned by the farmer or easily accessed by the farmer. As the model has become more sophisticated, it requires, particularly if applied for regulatory purposes, an expert user who understands the model (such as a Certified Nutrient Management Adviser) and applies data following OVERSEER Data Input Standards. This ensures more consistent and reliable use of the model, and minimises differences arising from different operators. The model represents the best available science and is updated as new science and information becomes available. 62 Updates and introduction of new science inevitably introduce changes to the results of the model. The impact of these version changes have yet to be fully addressed in those regional plans which rely on a constant absolute value for nitrogen loss for the regulation. For most regulatory applications, the consequence of the version change is to alter the activity status and consent requirements. Because OVERSEER provides a benchmark against which relative change is estimated these regulatory consequences of the OVERSEER version change can be managed, albeit through some difficulty. 63 It is not at all clear how a taxation (direct financial obligation) based on a modelled N loss, expressed as an absolute value, can be managed fairly and equitably if difference in N loss estimates occur with each version change. 64 Under the principles which apply to taxation – it introduces an extra layer of complexity to taxation, is not fair and equitable and is unlikely on its own to drive behaviour change, particularly if Regional Council regulatory limits already apply. 65 If primary industry is already investing heavily in developing improved sustainable systems then, rather than impose an addition burden of cost on the primary sector alone, any further investment for sustainable primary production should be supported by the wider community which benefits from the commerce. Environmental Taxes – Greenhouse Gases 66 New Zealand has a unique profile amongst OECD countries in relation to greenhouse gas emissions due to its reliance on the primary industry sector for export income and due to the fact that agricultural emissions account for almost 50 % of New Zealand GHG emissions. New 12 Zealand already has 85 % renewable energy resources. This means there are currently few mitigation options readily available to quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 67 Agricultural GHG emissions are predominantly from enteric methane (approximately 75%) and then nitrous oxide (approx.15%) associated with livestock. Only a very small percentage of the agricultural emissions are attributed to fertiliser (approx. 4%) and lime (approx. 3%), with the remainder coming mostly from cropping systems. 68 It is considered that the government’s commitment to the Paris Agreement will inevitably require agricultural emissions to be accounted for and reduced. The mechanism to achieve this is yet to be developed by government policy, and while a carbon tax could be straight forward, it is not easily applied to agricultural settings if the outcome sought is behaviour change when few mitigations available. 69 The fertiliser industry recognises that to effect behaviour change at farm level, some form of accountability is required at farm level. 70 It is considered that OVERSEER Nutrient Budget provides for a good farm level of accountability. It models GHG emission using methods consistent with the national inventory and if already being used for managing nitrate losses, GHG accountability at farm scale can be provided for with little to no additional effort. 71 Human resources and skill capability (e.g. Certified Nutrient Management Advisers) to deliver OVERSEER Nutrient Budgets for every farm in New Zealand is not currently available and so a pragmatic approach which provides for detailed assessment of mitigation for more intensive farm systems using OVERSEER and a parallel, complementary system for less intensive farms with few mitigations available may be required. 72 A simple carbon tax and variation of an Emissions Trading Scheme have scope for addressing greenhouse gas emissions at farm scale. 73 A carbon tax imposes a price on the unit output. Where it is cheaper to pay the tax, there is no incentive to reduce overall outputs. For this reason, and if seeking maximum efficiency in emissions reductions, a carbon tax remains a crude instrument, unlikely to be effective in addressing agricultural emissions where mitigations are limited. It is likely to be most effective where mitigations or alternatives exist or can be readily developed. 74 An emissions trading system approach, places a cap on the unit outputs, and issues permits which can be traded. It provides an opportunity for control of outputs in absolute terms, and signals for reductions required over longer timeframes. It provides for market-based decisions on the most efficient use of the limited allocations. 13 75 The system employed must adhere to the fundamental principles of: Driving behaviour change Avoiding complexity Being seen as fair and equitable Apply readily measured and well-defined units. 76 International (global) greenhouse gas commitments based on absolute limits for emissions must be addressed, however food security considerations and production efficiency consideration require provision for intensity-based measures as part of a suite of options. 77 Use of revenue should be applied with transparency and clarity to ensure it is seen as fair and appropriate to address international obligations and climate change objectives. This could include meeting international obligations through investment in mitigation offsets or investment in locally based climate change mitigations or climate change solutions. Environmental Taxes – Behaviour change 78 Environmental taxes should ultimately drive behaviour change – but as discussed above, can have positive or negative effects. A low tax could prevent a proper focus on mitigations – because it will be cheaper to pay the tax rather than bear the costs of mitigation. A high tax will have impact on economic productivity and social well-being. 79 A key principle is that tax policy is coherent with other government objectives – is part of a suite of measures rather than a stand-alone instrument. 80 There could be difficulty in the implementation of national environmental taxes in NZ because many environmental controls are essentially set by regional and district councils – so there is a need to think about how central government taxation measures integrate with regions council initiatives. Environmental Taxes – Land tax, resource rental tax, water take tax. 81 Other taxes impacting on agricultural production may include land tax, resource rental tax, water take or water use tax. 82 These ‘other’ taxes are not specific to addressing nutrient management issues, but are related to nutrient management if they are proposed to drive efficient use of resources or to reduce adverse environmental impacts while providing for a competitive rural economic economy. 83 Many of the considerations discussed under the nutrient issues will apply. Resource rental or land tax are likely to add cost and complexity to the tax system both for administration and for 14 compliance. This could impact on international competitiveness, but is unlikely to effectively address the environmental impact of land use activities. 84 Revenue gained could be invested in mitigation options and development programmes, however, there is also an argument that the wider community which benefits from the primary industry should also contribute to these schemes, not just this businesses to which land tax, or resource rental tax might be applied. 85 With more than 50 % of New Zealand export income generated by primary industry, maintaining international competitiveness is essential. An added tax burden on rural communities may adversely affect this competitiveness. 86 The Principles of Resource Rentals as described by B.C. Land iii , discusses circumstances which are primarily applied to extractive industries rather than primary sector production involving multiple land use activities. However, under ‘lessons learned’, the paper concludes: “Government appetite to take fiscal risk and bear administrative costs depends in part on the scale of revenue at stake and availability of resources to achieve effective administration. This factor would seem to go some way to explaining why Resource Rental Tax has featured more prominently in the oil industry than in the mining industry. (where key determinants impacting on resource rent potential are more complicated, e.g. key determinants of quality are ore tonnages, mineral grades, rate of recovery of ore from a deposit taking into account dilution, the efficiency of ore extraction methods and the efficiency with which a saleable mineral product is obtained from the ore.) 87 International experience has, in several circumstances, shown that complexity and high administrative costs typically associated with resource rental tax, significantly erode the anticipated revenue where resource rental taxes have been introduced. 88 In consideration of the discussion points raised by Land in relation to resource rentals, it seems unlikely that the balance of revenue measured against administration complexity and fiscal risk would be favourable when weighed against requirements of resource rental tax for complicated and varied land-use activities. 89 Environmental gains and effective management of land use activities are likely to be more effective and efficient through working with industry programmes, combined with existing regulatory and non-regulatory approaches under the RMA. Flexibility for land users to adapt and respond to market pressures remains essential, provided the farm system losses which impact on environmental bottom line are accounted for and controlled. It is unlikely these outcomes will be achieved effectively by a broad, national application of resource rental tax to address a variety of land use activities. 15 90 Land taxes and water taxes provide an opportunity for revenue collection for community programmes - however, a direct fiscal risk applies where the tax requires a balance between opportunity for revenue collection and enabling economic viability and competitiveness for the wide range of land-use activities to which these taxes will apply. These considerations must apply also during cycles of economic downturn. As with resource rental tax, benefits of revenue collection and behaviour change would need to be weighed against administrative and fiscal risks. 91 If the driver is for improved environmental outcomes, then as with previous discussion, the Fertiliser Association considers a crude national tax approach will be less effective than industry programmes working with a mix of regulatory and non-regulatory initiatives targeting specific environmental outcomes for regional localities. Indeed, these approaches will be required to give direction and to assist and support land-use managers, regardless of the tax regime imposed. 92 The effectiveness of the approach and the effects of a double whammy of costs imposed on land-use managers by these other land or resource taxes must be considered in light of international competitiveness. 16 Specific questions in the Future Tax Submissions Background Paper. Chapter 2: The future environment What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium- to long-term? Which of these are most important? How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future-focussed tax system? Chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system Principles for assessment What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? 93 Comment: A good tax system must: Achieve its intended purpose, (drive intended behaviour change, raise revenue) Avoid unintended consequence Remain relatively neutral to market signals for productive agriculture, Ensure international competitiveness, and generation of wealth Avoid complexity, for administrative efficiency and ease of application Be seen as fair and equitable Apply readily measured and well-defined units. Defining ‘fairness’ How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? What would a fair tax system look like? 94 Comment: A fair tax system (in relation to environmental considerations of nitrogen or phosphorus losses to address water quality, and greenhouse gas emissions to address climate change) would enable primary sector producers to respond with appropriate management practices to improve 17 efficiencies, while meeting both environmental limits and market demands for international competitiveness. A fair tax would be seen as necessary as well as effective: without imposing unnecessary additional costs which do not have clear relationship to the objectives of the tax. Provide for past investments, infrastructure and development in land-use activities without undue penalty and provide for suitable transition for businesses to respond to taxation and market signals. Provide for consistent and stable business operating environment, e.g. long-term signals to changes in cost structures to protect business from sudden price shock. (That is, provide for business confidence and stability in long term planning and investment.) Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system Frameworks New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? 95 Comment: New Zealand’s current tax system was rated by US based Tax Foundation in 2017 iv , as second in the world for competitiveness. The Foundation states that the change in taxation system was introduced in 2010 in response to trends where New Zealand was losing its international competitiveness. By the measures of the Tax Foundation competitiveness has been retained. By this measure New Zealand may be deemed to be in a favourable position overall, perhaps requiring only adjustment of the components of which the overall rating is comprised. Taxes and behaviour Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? 96 Comment: Taxes to modify behaviour require a direct relationship between the product cost and behaviour. 18 Tax on commodities or resources which are inelastic to price are unlikely to achieve behaviour change outcomes until the tax is sufficiently high that it will have negative social or economic effects. (e.g. increasing tax on petrol, may change driving behaviour and reduce fuel consumption only for a short period as a direct response to price.) Taxes designed to drive behaviour change, require that mitigation options are available for a specific activity, or that the activity should cease entirely. The latter introduces fiscal, administrative and social risks. Where options for behaviour change are limited, tax incentives may play a more powerful role, than an increased cost burden from tax on businesses. Retirement savings Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system Fairness and balance Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? 97 Comment: New Zealand’s current tax system has a very broad and even base compared to many international tax systems. It was rated by US based Tax Foundation in 2017, as second in the world for competitiveness. The Foundation states that the taxation system was changed in 2010 in response to trends where New Zealand was losing its international competitiveness. By this measure New Zealand may be deemed to be in a favourable position overall, requiring only adjustment of the components of which the overall rating is comprised. By this measure of competitiveness and neutrality- A competitive tax code is one that keeps marginal tax rates low, and neutrality seeks to raise the most revenue with the fewest economic distortions. 19 Tax and business Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? 98 Comment: The US Based Tax Foundation ranked New Zealand as 2 nd overall for competitiveness amongst OECD countries. Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? 99 Comment: Natural capital of land use cannot be efficiently addressed by a national, centrally driven signal when natural capital for primary production is highly variable and influenced by natural resources of climate, soil type, terrain, access to water etc. It will require a complex and cumbersome tax system to effectively address natural capital at a national level. Better management through a mix of regulation, industry good programmes, and market assurance programmes will be necessary, as it is most unlikely a taxation based on natural capital can address the myriad of issues natural capital introduces to land use activities and business opportunities. Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? 100 Comment: To remain competitive, New Zealand has implemented a relatively simple tax system, which is easy to understand and apply, limiting administration costs. Top marginal individual income tax rate were lowered to 33 percent, corporate tax rate reduced to 28 percent with increased of reliance on the goods and services tax for revenue. The USA based Tax Foundation also notes further competitive characteristics of the existing scheme as including, no inheritance tax, no general capital gains tax, and no payroll taxes. By this assessment New Zealand has generally low rates but high revenues compared with other OECD countries It may be expected that New Zealand businesses and the New Zealand economy are benefiting from a high degree of relative international competitiveness. 20 Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? Chapter 7: Specific challenges Housing affordability How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? Capital gains tax Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Land tax Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? 101 Comment: As discussed in the submission, land tax alone, if applied to the rural environment, is unlikely to effectively address the environmental impact of land use activities. It would add cost and is likely to impact negatively on international competitiveness, as well as add complexity to the tax system. Revenue gained could be invested in mitigation options and development programmes, however, there is also an argument that the wider community which benefits from the primary industry should also contribute, not just this businesses to which land tax, or resource rental tax might be applied. With more than 50 % of New Zealand export income generated by primary industry, maintaining international competitiveness is essential and land tax introduces the potential to adversely affect this competitiveness at a time when regional regulation and controls are currently imposing a very significant burden on many primary industry businesses to achieve environmental outcomes. For these reasons a land tax should not apply to rural production land or the associated land necessary for supporting infrastructure and services. Environmental taxation What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? 21 102 Comment: A form of carbon tax, or Emission Trading Scheme provides for a nationally consistent approach to address the limits required for greenhouse gas emissions. The effects of these emission are felt at not just a national scale, but global scale. Therefore there is opportunity to provide for mechanisms addressing both a cap in emissions and supporting improved efficiency in production of food, for increased food security, using intensity-based measures. A national taxation instrument to address local water quality issues will be cumbersome, inefficient and ineffective in comparison to other measures which can account for the highly variable nature of the local uses. These include working with industry programmes and a combination of regulatory and non-regulatory methods. Progressive company tax Should the tax system do more to support small businesses? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? GST exemptions for particular goods Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? If so, what should be excluded? What else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue Concluding comment 103 Thank you for the opportunity to present this feedback and comment on the ‘Future of Tax’. Greg Sneath Executive Manager The Fertiliser Association of New Zealand i Over the last twenty years, sales of nitrogen fertiliser have increased steeply. But while some nitrogen entering waterways will have come from nitrogen fertiliser, this fertiliser is a much smaller source of nitrogen than animal urine. However, the increased use of urea fertiliser has, along with irrigation and supplementary feed, enabled higher stocking rates, and more animals mean more urine.

It assists in decision making for nutrient use to optimise production and manage the risk of losses to the environment. It is a science-based model that is regularly updated to incorporate improved science. 2 OVERSEER provides a long-term annual average estimate of nutrient cycling in a farm system. It does not provide for day to day management, but rather provides estimates for each of the pathways for nutrient sources and losses for a farm system. It assumes the farm system is in a stable state and not undergoing transition from one system to another, or from one level of development to another. 3 These diffuse nutrient losses from farm systems cannot easily be measured. Modelling provides estimates of these nutrient movements and can be used to understand nutrient requirements to maintain soil fertility at its current levels, and also, to understand the relative change in nutrient losses under different scenarios for a farm system. (Nutrient losses include outputs to saleable product, to the atmosphere or to surface runoff and leaching below the root zone). 4 Use of OVERSEER for critical evaluations, such as for regulation, requires qualified and experienced advisers who have a good understanding of the model’s operations and underlying assumptions. It also requires standardised data inputs and a good understanding of farm systems and nutrient management. 5 Use of OVERSEER has required significant development of capability in farm advisers. Nutrient Management Adviser Certification Programme 6 The Nutrient Management Adviser Certification Programme (NMACP) was developed with the aim of building and upholding a transparent set of standards for nutrient management advisers to meet, so that they provide nationally consistent advice of the highest standard to farmers. 7 There are currently over 172 certified nutrient management advisers throughout New Zealand.

NZIER report -Taxing times i Key points Federated Farmers of New Zealand Inc., B+LNZ (Beef + Lamb New Zealand Ltd), DairyNZ, Horticulture NZ, and IrrigationNZ have asked us to review a range of proposed taxes on the primary sector against principles of good tax policy. Taxes are necessary to fund government services, but involve potentially large economic costs The Tax Working Group convened by Victoria University of Wellington proposed a set of principles for a good tax system in its 2010 report that we have applied in assessing a series of proposed new taxes on the primary sector: • Efficiency and growth • Equity and fairness • Revenue integrity • Fiscal cost • Compliance and administration cost • Coherence. No tax that raises the levels of revenue required by modern economies can meet these criteria at the same time: trade-offs are required In practice, public finance economics recommends that governments adopt a ‘broad- base, low-rate’ (BB/LR) approach to designing tax systems: • Taxes should apply to wide ranges of activities • Individual taxes on specific sub-sectors of the economy should be avoided • Rates of taxation should be as low as possible, while still meeting revenue needs and equity concerns • Taxes should be seen as a system, not a collection of individual measures designed to meet specific policy objectives. New Zealand’s current tax system has been consistently assessed as being one of the best in the OECD at raising revenue at least cost While reviews by local and international bodies have recommended changes at the margin, no serious case has been made for moving away from the BB/LR approach. Most of the tax policy proposals advanced prior to the 2017 general election by parties now forming part of or supporting the Government find little support in our framework • Applying a resource rental tax on all uses of water might be justified on efficiency grounds, but should be compared with other regulatory instruments, following a robust assessment of the actual public policy problem such measures are seeking to address • Taxing exported bottled water in isolation is difficult to justify on any grounds: it would be an outlier within the New Zealand tax system (i.e. it NZIER report -Taxing times ii would be the only tax applied exclusively to an exported product), is likely to have high compliance and administrative costs because it is applied on a very narrow base (i.e. one product) and would likely raise very little revenue • Applying a tax to one by-product of farming (nitrate) is difficult to justify: it would be an additional tax on one production process; is likely to have high compliance and administrative costs because it would be applied on a very narrow base and would likely raise very little revenue. Using the proceeds of this tax to finance specific expenditure would likely lead to sub-optimal spending or taxation levels • Extending the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to agriculture can be justified, but would need to be undertaken as part of a comprehensive policy programme if unintended consequences, especially international leakage and loss of competitiveness, are to be avoided.

Introduction Leading up to the 2017 general election, the political parties now forming or supporting the Government proposed a range of new taxes on the primary sector. A number of these proposals, with some modifications, are on the new Government’s agenda. Federated Farmers of New Zealand Inc., B+LNZ (Beef + Lamb New Zealand Ltd), DairyNZ, Horticulture NZ, and IrrigationNZ have asked us to assess these proposals against principles of good tax policy. In undertaking this review, we have adopted a systems approach. Rather than look at individual proposals in isolation, we have examined how they would fit within the whole New Zealand tax system. The Tax Working Group (TWG), which conducted the last major review of taxes in New Zealand, stressed that system-wide coherence was one of the key principles it used. We return to the TWG’s other principles below. 1.1. New Zealand tax policy Given our focus on the tax system, we first outline the basic structure of that system and the policy considerations have been used to arrive at where we are today. After a series of reforms undertaken in the 1980s and 1990s, the New Zealand tax system has long been regarded as one of most efficient within the OECD. 1 The guiding principle that has led to this result goes by the general name broad-base low-rate (BB/LR). Major features of the BB/LR approach in New Zealand have been: • Repeal of many small, ad hoc, taxes and charges, like stamp duty and the TV licence fee • Repeal of taxes that might be justified on equity grounds, but which raised a limited amount of revenue, were costly to administer and were relatively easy to avoid, like gift and death duty • Replacing taxes on business inputs (like tariffs 2 and the wholesale sales tax) with taxes on outputs (income and consumption), i.e. Goods and Services Tax (GST) • Progressive removal of tax incentives – departures from treatments applied to sectors or the whole economy designed to promote specific economic developments – and the resulting increases in revenue used to fund across- the-board rate reductions. Today, the New Zealand government annually raises about $67 billion or 91% of total revenue from the income tax and GST. Of the remaining 9%, 4.5% is road user charges 1 Mourougane (2007), p. 2. 2 While the removal of tariffs was undertaken as part of a trade liberalisation programme and wider economic reform agenda, tariffs had been a major source of general revenue for successive governments. For example, in 1915, customs and excise duties contributed 56.03% of total revenue, falling to a modest 33.26% in 1934 (Statistics New Zealand 1935). NZIER report -Taxing times 2 and fuel excise; 3.5% is excises on tobacco and alcohol and the remaining 0.8% is comprised of a range of smaller taxes. 3 Successive governments wishing to change tax revenue have altered the rates of income tax and GST, rather than add or repeal specific taxes. Figure 1 Income tax and GST raise over 90% of the Government’s annual revenue Projections for financial year ended 30 June 2018 Source: Treasury 1.2. A much-reviewed system Since BB/LR was adopted as a guiding principle for tax policy, there have been many reviews of the New Zealand tax system undertaken both locally and by international bodies like the OECD and the IMF. Three major local reviews have been: • The Committee of Experts of Tax Policy (1999) 4 • Tax Review 2001 (2002) 5 • The Tax Working Group (2010). 6 Comprehensive reviews of the tax system were undertaken by the OECD in 2000 and 2007. Successive biennial Economic Surveys of New Zealand by the OECD have also 3 Tariffs ($148m), gaming duties ($240m), motor vehicle fees, ($237m), petroleum and mineral royalties ($200m). Approved Issuer Levy and cheque duty ($31m) and energy resources levies ($31m). All figures are revenue raised for the year ended 30 June 2017. 4 https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/1998-other-tax-compliance.pdf 5 http://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/reviews-consultation/taxreview2001 6 https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cagtr/twg Income tax: individualsIncome tax: companiesGSTRoad transportExcisesOther NZIER report -Taxing times 3 considered tax matters to greater or lesser degree. 7 Likewise, the IMF’s routine consultations with the New Zealand authorities also address tax policy. 8 While each of these reviews have made recommendations for specific changes to the tax system, none has suggested moving away from the current overall BB/LR approach. 1.3. Principles of good tax policy The BB/LR approach is the result of applying a set of consistent principles. In this report, we have used the six principles of a good tax system proposed by the TWG in 2010. These principles are very similar to those applied by successive governments and recommended by the OECD and the IMF. 9 The TWG explained its principles as: 10 • Efficiency and growth: Taxes should be efficient and minimise as far as possible impediments to economic growth. That is, the tax system should avoid unnecessarily distorting the use of resources (e.g. causing biases toward one form of investment versus another) and imposing heavy costs on individuals and firms. Another term used to describe efficient taxes is “neutrality”. • Equity and fairness: The tax system should be fair. The burden of taxes differs across individuals and businesses depending on which bases and rates are adopted. Assessment of both vertical equity (the relative position of those on different income levels or in different circumstances) and horizontal equity (the consistent treatment of those at similar income levels, or similar circumstances) is important. The timeframe is also important, including how equity compares over peoples’ life-times. • Revenue integrity: The tax system should be sustainable over time, minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage, and provide a sustainable revenue base for government. • Fiscal cost: Tax reforms need to be affordable given fiscal constraints. 11 • Compliance and administration cost: The tax system should be as simple and low cost as possible for taxpayers to comply with and for the Inland Revenue Department to administer. 12 • Coherence: Individual reform options should make sense in the context of the entire tax system. While a particular measure may seem sensible when viewed in isolation, implementing the proposal may not be desirable given the tax system as a whole. 7 Reviews since 1975 can be found online at: http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/oecd-economic-surveys-new- zealand\_19990162 8 See http://www.imf.org/en/Countries/NZL. 9 See Brys et al. (2016) and International Monetary Fund (2017), especially Chapter 2. 10 Tax Working Group (2010) p. 15. 11 As none of the proposals we are examining involve reductions in revenue, we have not needed to apply this criterion. 12 The TWG was focused mainly on income tax, hence the reference to Inland Revenue. New Zealand Customs administers tariff duties, excise taxes and GST on imports. The New Zealand Transport Authority (road user charges and motor vehicle licence fees), the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (mineral royalties) and the Department of Internal Affairs (gaming duty) also administer various tax regimes. NZIER report -Taxing times 4 1.4. The special case of taxing economic rents There is one case where public finance economics recommends a departure from the general principle of neutrality, and that is the taxation of natural resources like minerals where the owners of rights to exploit those resources can earn excess profits, or economic rents. Partly because mineral resources are not a large part of the New Zealand economy, whether departing from the BB/LR approach is justified in the case of natural resource taxation has not featured prominently in local tax policy debates. 13 However, the Labour Party’s proposal to impose a tax on all commercial uses of water was an example of such a tax, and therefore we will provide a brief discussion of the main elements of such taxes. One important feature of economic rents is that they can be taxed with little or no efficiency cost. 14 This is because economic rents are an extra return above that required to compensate the owner of the capital earning the rent for risk and the opportunity cost of their investment. Taxing away that extra return, or a part of it, does not diminish the attractiveness of the investment compared to investment that only earn “normal” (i.e. rent-free) profits. So just taxing rents would not cause investors to reduce the amount that they have invested. Under a traditional income tax, economic rents are taxed at the same rate as all other returns to capital and labour. 15 Some countries, therefore, impose additional taxes on owners of natural resources that can earn rents. The Australian Treasury has long favoured resource rental taxes, given the importance of extractive industries to Australia’s economy. 16 While the case for taxing rents is conceptually sound, differentiating between normal and excess rates of return is difficult in practice. Most countries do not include additional taxes on rents in their main income taxes. Royalties on extraction, which are easier to measure (because they are often charged on the quantity mined, rather than the profits earned) are, however, common. New Zealand applies royalties to a small number of minerals (petroleum, coal, gold), raising about $200 million annually. 13 Resource rental taxes are different from the more common environmental taxes used to correct market failures that lead to sub-optimal levels of pollution. We discuss this issue further in Section 2.3. Although environmental taxes were out of scope of the 2010 TWG, the 2001 Tax Review did discuss ‘Eco Charges’. The Labour Party and the Green Party have advocated for environmental taxes in their tax and environmental policies and we note that the terms of reference of the recently announced review of the New Zealand tax system includes how the tax system can help deliver positive environmental and ecological outcomes. 14 Garnaut (2010). 15 It is possible, at least conceptually, to design a broad-based tax that taxes rents at a higher rate than normal returns. A cash- flow tax is one such instrument, and implementing such a tax remains the goal of many tax policy experts in the United States. In its 2017 review of the United States economic policy, the IMF recommended that the United States convert its income tax to a cash-flow tax and elements of this proposal were enacted as part of the President Trump’s tax bill. Some years ago, the New Zealand Treasury investigated whether a cash flow tax was practical in New Zealand and decided it wasn’t, mainly for reasons to do with the fiscal and economic cost of a transition. See Katz (1999) and Wilson (2002). 16 See Australian Treasury (2009). NZIER report -Taxing times 5 1.5. New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme Introduced in 2008, the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ ETS), while technically not a tax or a charge, is a significant economic instrument used to change behaviour. A carbon tax is an alternative instrument often used to achieve the same goals as an ETS, and indeed, the Green Party proposed in its manifesto that the NZ ETS be replaced by such a tax. It is, therefore, appropriate to provide a brief description of the scheme here. 17 The NZ ETS puts a price on greenhouse gas emissions. This is intended to create a financial incentive for people to invest in technologies and practices that reduce emissions. The NZ ETS requires all sectors of New Zealand’s economy to report on their emissions and, with the exception of biological emissions from agriculture, to purchase and surrender emissions units to the Government for those emissions. Just over half of New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions are covered by the NZ ETS’ surrender obligations. The scheme also encourages forest planting by allowing eligible foresters to earn emission units as their trees grow and absorb carbon dioxide. An emission unit represents one metric tonne of carbon dioxide, or the carbon dioxide equivalent of any other greenhouse gas. Currently, the only eligible emissions unit in the NZ ETS is the New Zealand Unit (NZU). Figure 2 provides a schematic overview of how the NZ ETS works. Figure 2 How the NZ ETS works Source: Ministry for the Environment 17 For an explanation of the economics behind the NZ ETS, see Wilson (2011). NZIER report -Taxing times 6 1.6. What has the Government proposed? Prior to the election, the Labour Party, New Zealand First and the Green Party all issued manifestos that proposed changes to the taxes applied to the primary sector. More details are in Appendix A. Following the government formation process, a number of these proposals are to proceed, at least in a modified form. Some of the proposals to be adopted are amalgams of the various parties’ positions, others are conditional on further study and, in some cases, the policy announcement is not to proceed with proposed initiatives in the first term of the Government. The proposals that we have analysed in this report are: • A tax on all commercial users of water (which is not to proceed this term, but could conceivably be considered post-2020). Included in this analysis is a discussion of the proposal to tax exports of bottled water • A tax on nitrate (while this not proceeding this term, the proposal is a good example of how taxes on narrow bases can have high costs) • Including agriculture in the NZ ETS (which is to be subject to further study by the newly established Climate Commission). NZIER report -Taxing times 7 2. Assessment of the proposals Just because a tax can be imposed, or has been imposed in some other place or at some other time, doesn’t mean that it should be imposed. In this section, we provide our initial assessment of the policies the new Government has said it will be advancing to determine whether they might be justified on grounds of improving the overall tax system. We have also included an analysis of some of the proposals that the Government has indicated will not be progressed immediately, because they represent interesting examples of how to analyse taxes within our framework, and because such taxes could be considered at a later date by government. This analysis is only preliminary, as many of the important details of what has been proposed have yet to be announced. 2.1. Summary of assessment In Table 1, we provide a high-level summary of our assessment against the TWG’s principles.

Resource rental tax on water Table 2 The water royalty could be justified on efficiency grounds Efficiency Equity Revenue integrity Compliance and administration cost Coherence ✓  ✓   Source: NZIER The coalition agreement between the Labour Party and New Zealand First specifically states that the proposal to place a royalty on the commercial uses of water will not proceed this Parliamentary term. Given the prominence of this issue prior to the election, we include some high-level commentary on this matter. Again, detailed analysis is not possible given the lack of detail on these specific proposals. As we noted above, there is a conceptual case for applying an additional tax on owners of rights to use natural resources where they can earn economic rents. However, there are many steps required from that case to deciding in practice whether a royalty should be applied to users of water in New Zealand. The first, and perhaps most important, is whether rents are actually being earned and, if so, why. Using water for agricultural purposes is often capital intensive, as it requires investment in water storage and irrigation equipment, in addition to operating costs of irrigation (electricity, etc.) and resource management costs. The return on this investment will not likely give rise to rents and should thus only be subject to normal income tax treatment. This is a further example of the potential complexity of a resource rental tax. In the case of most natural resources like minerals, rents arise because of the finite supply of the resources, which is a product of nature. Water itself is not a finite resource in New Zealand (notwithstanding droughts) in the way that minerals are. Minerals, once mined, are not replaced by nature. Water, however, is continually going through a cycle as rain water eventually returns to clouds via evaporation. 18 18 Tietenberg and Lewis, (2012), p. 206. NZIER report -Taxing times 9 Figure 3 The water cycle is complex Source: US Geological Survey The water cycle, can however, be measured in millennia. Water that seeps into deep aquifers (groundwater storage in the picture above) may be trapped for thousands of years, as is water that falls as snow and forms glaciers and ice sheets. 19 Water that is taken from anywhere in the cycle, from rivers and streams or underground bores and used for man-made purpose (drinking, irrigation, etc.), will eventually be returned to the cycle in some form. 20 Rights to use water in New Zealand are the product of law, not nature. If it is established that these laws give rise to rents (which is far from certain or simple), then a better approach would be to question whether the laws are efficient. If they are found not to be, then addressing the conditions in law that give rise to rents, rather than using the indirect measure of a tax on excess profits would make sense. More generally, the entire question of water use and its regulation is a complex matter that is still under active consideration. 21 We note, in particular, that the stated aim of the policy is “encourage the best and most efficient use of freshwater”. 22 It is not clear to us that using a tax would represent the best and most efficient way of achieving this aim. Using taxes to align private and social costs, as is the case with externalities, requires the government to know the difference between those costs. That is, how 19 For a description of the hydrological cycle, see the United States Geological Survey’s website at: https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclesummary.html#infiltration. 20 This raises the point of where in the water cycle any royalty should apply: should it just apply to water taken from rivers, streams and aquifers, or also to rain water? 21 See Ministry for the Environment (2017). 22 Labour Party Manifesto 2017: Water, p.8. NZIER report -Taxing times 10 much the tax should be. (We return to this point below when considering the nitrate tax). The Labour Party’s proposal was to apply different rates of tax to different uses of water in each region. This would give the royalty the nature of a charge for use, which would be more efficiently imposed by way of tradeable permits or auctions, because these regimes have the advantage of revealing the true social value of the resource. Applying a resource rental tax on all uses of water should, therefore, be compared with other regulatory instruments, following a strong assessment of the actual problem such measures are seeking to address. 2.2.1. Bottled water royalty Following the coalition formation negotiations, the Government announced that it would introduce a “royalty” on exports of bottled water. No details have been announced regarding the rate of the royalty, on whom it will be levied and by whom it would it will be administered. Also unavailable is any clear discussion of what policy problem the royalty is intended to address. This tax is not specifically directed at the agricultural sector: if anything, it is a tax on part of the manufacturing sector. The context of the proposal, however, is clearly the Labour Party’s proposal for a wider tax on commercial users of water, which the new Government has announced is not going to proceed in the term of the current parliament. We have included this tax in our report because it represents a recent example of how very specific proposals can emerge from the government formation process without the usual input from experts and consultation with affected parties. Table 3 The royalty on bottled water is very hard to justify Efficiency Equity Revenue integrity Compliance and administration cost Coherence      Source: NZIER The Labour Party’s original proposal was based on concerns about the way in which water use rights are allocated. If that is the case with the narrower proposal, then it might be better to change that over time, rather than introducing a new narrow tax. This all points to the need for a clear problem definition and for all alternative solutions to be considered. One possible way to impose this tax would be to use the current excise regime, administered by New Zealand Customs, which is a product-specific tax regime, albeit one that applies only to domestic consumption. As excises are not charged on exports NZIER report -Taxing times 11 the system used for items like wine and spirits would require modification if it were to apply to exported water. 23 Because it will apply to a narrow sub-sector of the economy, it is likely to involve proportionately high administrative and compliance costs. To put this in context, the value of bottled water exports from New Zealand is very small, as shown in Figure 4. 24 If the tax was set at the GST rate (15%), it would have raised about $1.8 million in 2017. Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have advised Parliament that taxing water exports could breach New Zealand’s trade agreements. 25 If it were subject to a tax, bottled water would be the only manufactured export that would be taxable by New Zealand (under New Zealand’s GST regime, exports are zero- rated and royalties on minerals apply equally to exports and domestic consumption). Figure 4 Bottled water exports are very small Value of exports in NZD at FOB of bottled water for the year ending 30 June Source: Statistics New Zealand Taxing exported bottled water in isolation is difficult to justify on tax policy grounds. It goes against the BB/LR approach. We note that commercial bottlers of water are subject to income tax on their profits. If the industry continues to grow at its current 23 Under the Customs and Excise Act, the manufacture of goods subject to excise in New Zealand must take place in a Customs controlled area. Goods that are intended for home consumption are taxed at the time they leave the controlled area (called “entered for home consumption”). Goods that are intended for export are either exported immediately after they leave the manufacturing area or are moved to a licensed export warehouse and are exempt from duty. 24 The data in Error! Reference source not found. relates to exports of natural and mineral water without additives. We take this to be the target of the Government’s proposal. Exports of drinks that contain or are made from water (like soft drinks and beer) are clearly much higher. However, they are not “water”. This point shows another problematic aspect of the proposal: what is to be counted as “water”. 25 New Zealand Herald 30 November: “Tax on water exports would breach NZ trade agreements says top MFAT official”. http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c\_id=1&objectid=11950475 0 2,000,000 4,000,000 6,000,000 8,000,000 10,000,000 12,000,000 14,000,000 1998200020022004200620082010201220142016 NZIER report -Taxing times 12 rate, then, assuming bottlers continue to be profitable, the sector will make a greater proportional contribution to the tax take. It is unclear why an additional tax is required. 2.3. Nitrate tax Table 4 A nitrate tax scores poorly Efficiency Equity Revenue integrity Compliance and administration cost Coherence ✓  ✓   Source: NZIER The Green Party proposed a specific levy of $2 per kilogram of nitrate leached per hectare per year. The levy is an impost on an input, while the principles of good tax policy state that outputs (income and consumption) should be taxed. It is also a tax on one input into dairy farming, rather than applying generally. This levy is also an example of an important finding in public finance economics about the difference between regulation of prices versus quantities. 26 In cases of environmental externalities, the desired outcome is to reduce the quantity of pollution to an optimal level. Environmental economics does not consider pollution a bad thing in its own right, due to a reduction in amenity values. 27 Rather, the environmental economics framework considers pollution undesirable only if it is the result of a breakdown in the decision-making process of the relevant market, most often in the form of externalities, 28 but also due to public goods 29 or instances of common property. 30 Provided economic decision-makers are taking all the costs and benefits of their actions into account (along with other conditions), markets will operate to produce an equilibrium outcome and this outcome will be optimal. 31 The central contribution of 26 The seminal article is Weitzman (1974). 27 Not to be confused with a large body of literature on how to value the conservation of natural resources, especially national parks, which is critically interested in amenity values. 28 Where the full benefits or costs of an activity are not accurately reflected in market prices. 29 Where it is not possible for firms to set prices equal to marginal cost. Maler (1985) presents an extensive welfare framework for environmental economics based on “the environment" being a public good (although he does also suggest that it is a common property good). 30 Where profit-maximising firms do not face the true scarcity value of an input. 31 Pigou (1920/2005) is often credited as being the first person to state this result, although Sedgewick is also credited at having touched on the matter in his Principles of Political Economy. Baumol (1972) was an early developer of the formal version of the modern concept of Pigouvian taxes and Baumol and Oates (1988) did much to popularise its use. NZIER report -Taxing times 13 economics to the study of environmental issues is that there may be a non-zero optimal level of pollution. 32 This is still a current view. 33 Government will seldom be able to predict with much certainty what the optimal level of pollution will be. While economics predicts that applying a tax will reduce the quantity produced, the amount of that reduction is an empirical matter that can only be determined by measurement of the responsiveness of supply and demand to price (known as elasticities). We are not aware of whether the $2 levy proposed by the Green Party will be sufficient to achieve an optimal level of nitrate use. An alternative approach, which is in use in Taupō, is to set the quantity of nitrate that can be used and then use a rights-trading regime to deliver the optimal outcome of social marginal cost equalling social marginal benefit. 34 The Green Party’s proposal is that the revenue raised by the levy will be used to fund sustainable farming programmes and the clean-up of waterways. We assume that means “environmentally sustainable” given the traditional focus of the Green Party. Thus, the levy would be what is called a “tied-tax”. But not only is the revenue tied to a particular expenditure, that expenditure is to be directed at reducing the very thing that is being taxed. It is possible, therefore, that the tax would be the victim of its own success. If the tax is very successful in reducing nitrate use, then the amount of revenue raised will fall and it may be that the amount raised would be insufficient to fund the desired level of expenditure. 2.4. Extending the NZ ETS Table 5 Extending the NZ ETS could be justified Efficiency Equity Revenue integrity Compliance and administration cost Coherence ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Source: NZIER Extending the NZ ETS to agriculture can be justified within the tax policy framework we are using to assess proposals, but would need to be undertaken as part of a comprehensive policy programme if unintended consequences are to be avoided. 32 See Bator (1974) for an early contribution along these lines. 33 Stavins (2008) begins his entry on environmental economics in the New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics with: “The fundamental theoretical argument for government activity in the environmental realm is that pollution is an externality: an unintended consequence of market decisions, which affects individuals other than the decision maker". 34 Lake Taupo nitrogen cap and trade programme was established in 2011 as part of Waikato Regional Council’s Regional Plan. For details, see: https://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/Community/Your-community/For-Farmers/Taupo/Nitrogen- management-in-the-Lake-Taupo-catchment/. For reviews of the scheme, see OECD (2015) and Duhon, McDonald and Kerr (2015). NZIER report -Taxing times 14 Issues of leakage (where production shifts to another country that does not impose a carbon charge) and export competitiveness are critically important issues to address to avoid imposing a cost for limited or no environmental benefits. Although there is some evidence that it is possible to lower emission rates from agricultural activity without reducing livestock numbers (for example, by use of nitrogen inhibitors in fertiliser application, or by feed management in growing cattle), measurement of emissions from a specific agricultural activity (for example, by individual livestock) is currently not achievable. 35 The aim of any domestic policy decisions regarding agriculture (and indeed any sector subject to emissions reduction initiatives) should be to minimise the total long-run cost of meeting New Zealand’s climate change commitments in a global context, including the cost of fulfilling any obligations arising from failure to meet these commitments. Ensuring that the benefits are greater than the costs, even if the costs seem very large and global in scale, is a core part of public policy. Benefits, however, are not just financial, nor are costs. Matters like international reputation, support for rules-based global solutions for global problems and burden-sharing between developed and developing countries are all important, but are unlikely to determine optimal domestic policies. This objective captures the relatively simple point that the lowest cost means of meeting the climate change target should be adopted. Although this is a simple point, it is not necessarily one that is easy to achieve. The reality is that it may prove cheaper to pay emitters in another country to reduce emissions rather than to achieve any reduction within New Zealand. This is not a failure of policy. All emissions regardless of where in the world they are emitted will become part of the global atmosphere and thus make the same contribution to climate change as any other emissions. 36 All costs should be considered when designing policy, for example, a balance should be sought between the benefit of including all emitters in any scheme, and the cost of monitoring individuals who have only a small effect on overall emissions. In most cases, the initial entity on whom the costs fall will not be the party who eventually pays, as the costs are diffused through the economy. The exception is where entities are exposed to international competition. In this case, they are unlikely to be able to increase prices to reflect the cost of climate change mitigation policy (unless the policy is international). This means that the party that receives the benefit of the emission (the consumer) does not also bear the cost of the emission. As much of New Zealand’s agricultural production is destined for export markets where it is a price-taker, there are clear risks to competitiveness if New Zealand imposes commitments on agriculture when other countries have not. The design and effect of the free-allocation system that the Government has proposed will therefore be very important for determining the outcome of extending the scheme. 35 Kerr (2016) and Hollis et al. (2016). 36 However, the process of international carbon trading has been controversial and the New Zealand Government decided in 2015 to limit the ETS to domestic market. NZIER report -Taxing times 15 The compliance and administration costs of the NZ ETS will depend very much on how the scheme is extended to cover livestock emissions, including key issues like point of obligation, and there is still a lot of policy uncertainty over the how the scheme will work in practice. For example, if the obligation to surrender units is applied at the processor level (the current default in the legislation), then providing individual farms with an incentive to reduce emissions without reducing stock numbers will be dependent on how the economic impact of the scheme is passed down the production chain. 37 In a major report to Business New Zealand in 2007, when plans for the NZ ETS were in their infancy, NZIER set out a series of pre-conditions that would need to be met before establishing such a scheme would be justified. 38 While much has transpired since, those pre-conditions remain relevant to considering the question of whether agriculture should be included within the NZ ETS. At the international level, the pre-conditions we proposed were: • Acceptance that climate change presents a sufficient risk, albeit one with uncertainty, for it to be prudent to take action now to reduce the probability of significantly larger damage and costs later; • Understanding of the potential for significant amelioration of climate change through reductions of emissions from human activities; • International commitments to reduce emissions with an internationally agreed means of counting net emissions; and • New Zealand and international agreement among a significant number of countries on emissions reduction targets. These conditions now seem to have been largely met, particularly following the Paris Accord. At the domestic level, the pre-conditions we proposed were: • An accurate and comprehensive emissions monitoring and reporting system, for measuring performance relative to targets and reconciling abatement with allowances and credits; • The conditions required for a market to operate – a clearly and specifically defined tradable unit, transferability of units and enforcement of transfer, sufficient numbers of competitive buyers and sellers, institutions and infrastructure for trade and exchange, and reasonable transaction costs; • Established accounting, financial reporting and tax rules for participants in the ETS to use; • Sufficient economic efficiency benefits from trading to outweigh the costs of establishing and operating an ETS; • Public and social consensus that emissions trading will deliver the intended policy outcomes such as controlling emissions, without significant 37 If processors add a charge per head for animals processed at an abattoir or per kilo of milk solids in the case of dairy farming, then the economic impact on farmers would be invariant to the amount of effort applied to reduce emissions at the level of individual animals. 38 Branson et al. (2007). NZIER report -Taxing times 16 unintended side-effects. This will require there to have been a thorough economic analysis of the potential impacts of any ETS for New Zealand; and • Sufficient public and social consensus on the need for moving towards emissions trading to ensure durability and avoid disruptive policy reversals that undermine the value of investments and confidence in the system. Experience with the NZ ETS to date means that there is now more evidence available regarding whether these pre-conditions can be met than there was in 2007. We note that Federated Farmers and other sector groups have been active in continuing to engage with the Government on these issues, for example in its submission to the last review of the NZ ETS. 39 Despite its conceptual appeal, applying the NZ ETS to biologically-based emissions would still be a world-first and the case for doing so is yet to be made. The above list of pre-conditions remains, in our view, an appropriate starting point for further official consideration of this matter. 39 We note that in addition to Federated Farmers also made a submission to the Productivity Commission’s inquiry into a low emissions economy. Federated, Horticulture NZ, Beef+Lamb NZ, and Dairy NZ are all members (along with some other agricultural sector groups and the Ministry of Primary Industries) of the Biological Emissions Reference Group (or BERG) which has been working over to jointly build an agreed evidence-base on current and future opportunities to mitigate biological (methane and nitrous oxide) greenhouse gas emissions on-farm and the costs and opportunities and barriers of doing so.

NZIER report -Taxing times 19 Appendix A Detailed proposals This appendix outlines the details of the taxes studied in the main body of this report. A.1 Labour policy A.1.1 Freshwater royalty In its manifesto, the Labour Party proposed a “freshwater royalty”, that would be applied to “large commercial users”, including water bottlers, irrigators and other industrial users. The stated purpose of the royalty was to “encourage the best and most efficient use of freshwater”. Some features that were to apply were: • The royalty would be set on a per cubic metre basis • Different rates would apply in different regions, and different uses would also attract different rates • A premium would be charged on the taking of pristine water suitable for bottling • Details of the scheme would be developed by experts, including the Treasury, with input from users, councils and other stakeholders. A.1.2 Climate change The Labour Party committed to setting a target of net zero for greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with legally binding emissions reduction targets, and carbon budgets to keep New Zealand on track to this goal. It also promised to establish an independent Climate Commission to recommend interim emissions reduction targets and provide advice on the ramifications of not achieving them. A Climate Commission has independently been recommended by the New Zealand Parliamentary Commission for the Environment, based on the model of the UK Climate Change Act. 40 A.1.3 Emissions trading In its environmental manifesto, the Labour Party proposed that it would reform the NZ ETS so it puts a price on carbon that drives behaviour change away from carbon- polluting goods and services towards low or zero-carbon options. As part of these reforms, the Labour Party announced that it would not allow the importation of international units until “it is clear that they have environmental integrity, are from a reputable source and a mature international market, and are realistically priced; and for the foreseeable future will manage access to any such units through direct acquisition by the Government”. More generally, it proposed that at least 50% of all units surrendered to meet obligations under the NZ ETS would need to be NZUs issued by the New Zealand Government. 40 Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment (2017). NZIER report -Taxing times 20 It also proposed to bring agriculture into the NZ ETS in its first term with a free allocation of 90%. 41 A.2 Green Party policy A.2.1 Nitrate tax In its policy paper, Clean Water, Great Farming, the Green Party proposed to implement a nitrate pollution levy, calculated using the nutrient management tool OVERSEER, to incentivise farmers to pollute less. For an initial period of three years, the levy would only apply to dairy farmers. Over an unspecified timeframe, the Green Party said that the levy would be extended to include beef and sheep farming, other agriculture, horticulture, and other sources of nitrogen pollution. The levy would be set at a rate of $2 per kilogram of nitrate leached per hectare per year. The levy would be collected from dairy processors, not individual farmers. The revenue (estimated by the Greens at $136.5 million), would be used to fund sustainable farming programmes and the clean-up of waterways. A.2.2 Replacing NZ ETS in favour of carbon charges The Green Party’s Climate Protect Plan proposes replacing the NZ ETS with a “Kiwi Climate Fund”. The fund will be a combination of a tax of carbon emissions, a bounty on carbon absorption by forests and a universal payment system to recycle revenue to adult New Zealand citizens and residents. While an independent Climate Commission will advise on rates of any taxes, the Green Party expects prices at the following levels to be indicative of what would be set in 2020: • $40 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions (excluding biological emissions); • $6 per tonne of nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture; and • $3 per tonne of methane emissions from agriculture. The policy states that levels of taxes would rise over time “in line with the necessity of reaching net zero emissions by 2050”. Foresters would receive a “guaranteed minimum payment” for every tonne of carbon dioxide sequestered. This would “initially” be set at the same rate that applies to emission, i.e. $40 per tonne. A.3 New Zealand First New Zealand First proposed to repeal the NZ ETS and replace it with a UK/Norway- style Climate Change Act and to establish a new Parliamentary Commission for Climate Change as an Office of Parliament. The Parliamentary Commissioner would be responsible for reporting against both the Kyoto and Paris Accord by setting a three- 41 Under transitional provisions in the NZ ETS, when trade-exposed sectors become covered by the scheme, emitters are given a free allocation of emission units, based on emission levels in the past. NZIER report -Taxing times 21 yearly ‘Carbon Budget’ designed to reach these commitments (first Budget to become operative in 2021). Resources previously devoted to the NZ ETS would be applied to research and development and climate change adaptation. The Parliamentary Commissioner would also provide independent advice to central and local government on meeting the Carbon Budget and preparing for climate change. A.4 The Government’s agenda The new Government’s policy programme is based on a coalition agreement between the Labour Party and New Zealand First and an agreement on confidence and supply between the Labour Party and the Green Party. A.4.1 Labour Party and New Zealand First coalition agreement Specific tax and related provisions directed at the primary sector in the coalition agreement are: • Introduce a royalty on exports of bottled water • No resource rentals for water in this term (2017 to 2020) of Parliament • Introduce a Zero Carbon Act and an independent Climate Commission, based on the recommendations of the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment • If the Climate Commission determines that agriculture is to be included in the NZ ETS, then upon entry, the free allocation to agriculture will be 95% but with all revenues from this source recycled back into agriculture in order to encourage agricultural innovation, mitigation and additional planting of forestry. 42 A.4.2 Labour Party and Green Party confidence and supply agreement The agreement between Labour and the Green Party includes the following matters: • Adopt and make progress towards the goal of a Net Zero Emissions Economy by 2050, with a particular focus on policy development and initiatives in transport and urban form, energy and primary industries in accordance with milestones to be set by an independent Climate Commission and with a focus on establishing Just Transitions for exposed regions and industries • Introduce a Zero Carbon Act and establish an independent Climate Commission • All new legislation will have a climate impact assessment analysis • A comprehensive set of environmental, social and economic sustainability indicators will be developed 42 Note that the Labour Party’s proposal of 90% free-allocation has been increased to 95% and there is now a proposal to recycle “revenues” from the agricultural sector. It is unclear what this relates to, as the ETS operates by way of units, not money. NZIER report -Taxing times 22 • A new cross-agency climate change board of public sector CEOs will be established. A.4.3 Climate change Under the Paris Agreement, New Zealand has committed to reduce its emissions to 30% below 2005 levels by 2030, and under the Climate Change Response Act 2002, has committed to reduce its emissions to 50% below 1990 levels by 2050. The new Government has stated its intention to adopt and make progress towards the goal of a net zero emissions economy by 2050, with a particular focus on policy development and initiatives in transport and urban form, energy and primary industries. It will establish a Climate Commission to provide independent advice and, in particular, to consider whether and how agriculture should be included within the NZ ETS. Some details of the Government’s proposed action plan are contained in a Cabinet Paper from the Minister for Climate Change considered by the Cabinet on 17 December 2017. 43 In that paper, the Minister acknowledged the transition to lower emissions will be challenging and will require a fundamental economic shift, saying: 26. New Zealand has an existing 2030 target (our Paris Agreement contribution). This commits us to a reduction in emissions to 11% below 1990 levels by 2030 (30% below 2005 levels). 27.Based on current estimates, approximately 193 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO 2 e) abatement (ie reduce emissions, absorb through forests or buy international emissions reductions) is required over the 2021-2030 period to meet this target. Achieving the 2030 target will require significant action across multiple sectors of the economy, particularly if the target is primarily to be met by domestic efforts. For example, the forecast abatement from forestry would only mitigate approximately 18 MtCO 2 e across the 2021-2030 period (I understand that the proposed Billion Trees Planting Programme could lead to between 10 and 30 MtCO 2 e of additional carbon dioxide being stored). 28. Taking bolder action on climate change will require further investment, policy intervention, social adjustment, and economic transformation. This could include moving towards 100 per cent renewable electricity generation, with: fossil fuel generation only called upon in years of hydroelectric electricity generation shortages; the electrification of low grade industrial heat sources; and a shift to mostly electric vehicles with more domestic freight carried by rail. New methane inhibitors and techniques to reduce biological emissions would also need to be developed, and we will 43 See: http://www.mfe.govt.nz/more/cabinet-papers-and-related-material-search/cabinet-papers/100-day-plan-climate- change NZIER report -Taxing times 23 need changes in land use, including substantial afforestation.

INTRODUCTION 1.1 Federated Farmers of New Zealand welcomes the opportunity to submit to the Tax Working Group on its Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper. 1.2 Overall, Federated Farmers supports New Zealand’s current ‘broad-base low-rate’ tax system and its adherence to well-established principles of good taxation which are well summarised on page 5 of the Background Paper:  Efficiency;  Equity and fairness;  Revenue integrity;  Fiscal adequacy;  Compliance and administration costs; and  Coherence. 1.3 New Zealand has relatively low tax compliance costs by international standards and we congratulate successive Governments for their work to achieve this. The tax system is also relatively neutral and non-distortionary. 1.4 Any Tax Working Group proposals to change the tax system should be assessed against the above principles and consistency with the need to retain a broad-base low- rate system with low compliance costs. They should also be fiscally neutral – the revenue raised by any new tax or increase in an existing tax should be offset by reductions in other taxes. 1.5 Federated Farmers undertook a comprehensive member survey to inform this submission. The results of the survey are attached as Appendix 1. Generally speaking, farmers are satisfied with the current tax system and consider it to be fair. 1.6 Our members endorsed the Government objective 1 that the tax system should support a sustainable revenue base to fund government operating expenditure around its historical level of 30% of GDP 2 . Any decisions on the quantum of tax revenue (increases or decreases) should be made on their own merits and on wider macroeconomic considerations. 1.7 Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) are not well represented in the world of tax policy. While we do not pretend to speak on behalf of all SMEs, Federated Farmers is a key representative of SMEs. The perspectives we bring to the table on behalf of our farmer members will apply to a significant number of enterprises throughout the wider economy. As outlined on the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment’s website, SMEs of up to 20 employees are an important part of the New Zealand economy, accounting for 97% of all enterprises, 29% of all employees and an estimated 26% of New Zealand’s Gross Domestic Product. 3 1 One of the terms of reference of the Tax Working Group at page 53-54 of the Background Paper. 2 81% of the members that responded agreed with this, 5% disagreed, and 14% did not know. 3 http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/business/business-growth-and-internationalisation/small-enterprise 3 1.8 Federated Farmers acknowledges individual submissions from its members and we have read and support the submissions made by Dairy New Zealand, Horticulture New Zealand, and Irrigation New Zealand. 1.9 Federated Farmers would appreciate the opportunity to meet with the Tax Working Group to discuss this submission. 1.10 The remainder of this submission is in four sections:  Submission Points;  Goods & Services Tax and Income Tax;  Taxes on Capital (Capital Gains Tax and Land Tax); and  Tax and the Environment. 1.11 We have also attached four appendixes: 1.

SUMMARY OF SUBMISSION POINTS 2.1 Goods & Services Tax and Income Tax General (a) Federated Farmers endorses New Zealand’s current high-level GST and Income Tax settings including the imputation regime. Goods & Services Tax (b) Federated Farmers endorses the comprehensive nature of the current GST. Thus, we disagree with any suggestion of targeted GST exemptions. Income Tax (c) The top rate of personal income tax and the trust rate should continue to be aligned so as to prevent aggressive tax planning of the sort that occurred in the 2000s when these rates were not aligned. (d) The margin between the top rate of personal income tax and the company tax rate should be as small as practicable and should not be any larger than the current margin of 5%. We understand that Inland Revenue is concerned that tax planning is occurring because the current margin already provides a sufficient incentive. (e) The removal of intra-family enterprise resident withholding tax (RWT) obligations on interest and dividends would further reduce compliance costs without real risk to the tax base. (f) We do not agree with the proposal for a progressive company tax rate. 2.2 Taxes on Capital (Capital Gains Tax and Land Tax) Capital gains tax (a) Federated Farmers supports the current taxation regime that provides the ability to tax the earnings of individuals and firms that are in the business of trading property but we are opposed to a ‘comprehensive’ capital gains tax (CGT). Our opposition is both philosophical and pragmatic. There are considerable challenges in making a capital gains tax workable. These include:  How to deal with double taxation or double losses (caused by capital gains and losses in the company being reflected in the share price, which is also subject to CGT);  How to deal with livestock Herd Scheme gains and losses which are currently regarded as being on capital account;  How to index gains so the inflation component is not taxed (the same issues currently exist with income tax on revenue account property and monies on deposit for interest); and  How to deal with roll-over relief for intra-family and intra-group company transactions and for transactions involving Maori land and its owners. (b) The ‘KISS’ (keep it simple ......) principle should apply. If there is a particular problem about ‘speculation’, then perhaps the bright-line test might be a better solution. (c) Without prejudice, we submit that no commitment to a CGT should be made until it has been established that the practical concerns can be addressed in a manner 5 that is appropriate in the New Zealand context. This includes the need to keep compliance costs low. Land tax (d) Federated Farmers is opposed to land tax. A land tax would be punitive and inequitable on farming. (e) A land tax is suffered by the owner of the land when the tax is introduced – as that value will decrease by the present value of the future land tax payments. Future owners pay a lesser price to acquire the land, but this is offset by the annual obligation to pay land tax. (f) Land tax has the potential to turn highly geared enterprises equity-negative, potentially with a flow on effect to banks and other financiers. Further, developing businesses, or businesses whose annual income fluctuates, may not have sufficient cash flow in any one year to pay a land tax. This is a particular concern for farming that can have significant and often unpredictable variations in gross revenue due to the vagaries of international commodity prices, exchange rates, interest rates, and the weather. (g) There may also be cash flow problems for owners of fallow land, and this could particularly affect Maori land. 2.3 Tax and the Environment (a) The consideration of taxation in isolation as a response to environmental issues is flawed. There is a range of levers, including regulation and industry-led initiatives, as well as taxation, that can be used. These other levers are efficient and can work in a way that is more targeted and is iterative. Indeed, New Zealand has been focusing on regulation for some time now, along with some support from the taxation system (in the form of deductions for some environmental expenditure). (b) As is illustrated in Appendix 4, there are a significant number of regulatory frameworks that are currently in place that affect farmers that are working well and that actively encourage (by specifying) remedial activities. Unless there is clear evidence that these frameworks are irretrievably broken there is little point in trying to substitute taxation for these frameworks. (c) Further, we note in this context a tax might not encourage appropriate remedial activities. Taxpayers might decide it is cheaper to simply pay the tax, particularly if they have limited ability to change/respond. At the least the law of diminishing returns will apply and the tax rate will likely have to be significant to encourage the outliers, as is the case with cigarette smoking. In contrast, regulation is compulsory. (d) Any further projects in the environment space should start with a robust problem definition which is based on science. It is only once the problem has been defined that solutions, which may or may not include taxation, can be considered in the context of the wider economic framework. Obviously, compliance and administration costs will be an important part of any solution and these must always be considered. (e) The costs of maintaining QE II covenanted land should be expressly deductible. 6 3. INCOME TAX AND GOODS & SERVICES TAX 3.1 Federated Farmers believes that the current New Zealand income tax and GST settings are about right. We agree with the general high-level findings of the Tax Review 2001 and the Victoria University Tax Working Group (VUTWG) that the “broad base low rate” approach that was entrenched in the late 1980s is the correct approach for New Zealand. 3.2 In particular, we note that past tax reviews have enunciated six principles considered important when considering change to the income tax and GST regimes. These are reiterated in the Background Paper:  Efficiency and growth;  Equity and fairness;  Revenue integrity;  Fiscal cost;  Compliance and administration costs; and  Coherence. 3.3 We endorse the concepts that underpin these principles and agree that all taxation proposals should be considered against these principles. 3.4 However, having regard to the Tax Working Group’s mandate, we have some specific comments about features we regard as important. Goods & Services Tax 3.5 New Zealand’s comprehensive GST regime is regarded as being the best in the world. It is simple and certain and has, by international standards, very low compliance (taxpayer) and administration (Inland Revenue) costs. 3.6 We disagree with the suggestion that certain basic items, such as food, should be removed from the GST regime. The simplicity and certainty that the current regime provides should not be abandoned in any circumstances. The “slippery slope” rule would apply as the lobbying for relief would be intense (as it was when GST was introduced). There are other government policy mechanisms that are better placed to address concerns about the affordability of basic items. 3.7 Further, a targeted reduction in GST may only have a short-term effect on consumers and we note that food prices in particular can be very volatile and seasonal. 3.8 66% of respondents to our member survey opposed exempting basic items from GST while 29% supported doing so. Company tax 3.9 New Zealand’s company tax rate is currently 28%. While this is a judgement call, we think that this is at an appropriate level. Our member survey confirms this, with 66% saying it is ‘about right’. 3.10 New Zealand’s company tax fills two roles: 7 1. With imputation, company tax is a withholding tax for New Zealand shareholders. This would suggest that there should not be a gap, or too big a gap, between the company tax rate and the top individual tax rate or the trust tax rate; and 2. Company tax is a final tax for foreigners who invest into New Zealand (inbound investment). If the New Zealand company tax rate gets too much higher than those of our major inbound investors this could put pressure on base maintenance as the inbound investors’ taxation behaviour would be more aggressive. Yet if the rate is not as high as it reasonably can be we could be ‘giving away’ tax to inbound investors. Imputation 3.11 New Zealand and Australia are the only two countries in the world that have imputation. Imputation gives shareholders a tax credit for New Zealand taxation paid by the company. Thus, as noted above, company tax is a withholding tax for a New Zealand shareholder and imputation ensures that there is no double taxation, as would occur under the classical dividend regime where shareholders get no credit for company tax paid. Federated Farmers endorses the imputation regime. Individual and trust tax rates 3.12 The top individual marginal tax rate is 33% and the trust rate is the same. When these rates were out of alignment in the 2000s there was a significant amount of inappropriate tax planning and tax avoidance. 3.13 As noted above, the bigger the gap is between the company tax rate and the top individual rate the more risk there is of inappropriate tax planning. Care should be taken to ensure that this gap is as small as is practicable. Even with the current 5c gap we understand that Inland Revenue is concerned about some of the tax planning that is currently taking place. Compliance costs 3.14 The fact that New Zealand’s income tax regimes all link together coherently mean that compliance and administration costs in New Zealand are low. However, as is the case all around the world, compliance costs as a percentage of net income are higher for SMEs, and this is particularly apparent when an SME has its first employee. We congratulate the Government on the recent extension of the Payroll subsidy and for ongoing efforts to simplify tax compliance costs. 3.15 We do have a suggestion on SME compliance costs. RWT on interest and dividends was understandably introduced to counter evasion – the non-returning of the interest and dividend income. However, this evasion was not occurring in the intra-family entity transactions that typically occur in the family business. Rather, it was interest from commercial deposits and dividends from listed shares that was the concern. There would be reasonable compliance costs savings for SMEs if RWT on SME intra-family entity interest and dividends was abolished. It would be replaced by provisional and terminal tax. We do not think that there would be fiscal risk in this area. 8 SME company tax rate 3.16 The background paper asks for submissions on whether a 26% tax rate would assist SME companies. While we appreciate the intent of this suggestion, we believe that there are a number of problems with this, including:  A significant percentage of SMEs are not companies. There are individuals and sometimes trusts and there may or may not be partnerships of these persons. Further, look-through companies are treated for tax purposes as a partnership, or, if there is one shareholder, as a sole trader. This is particularly the case for farming. According to Statistics NZ’s Business Demography Statistics 2017, only 36.6% of agriculture, forestry and fishing businesses were structured as limited liability companies, compared to 55.6% for all businesses. There are still more partnerships than companies in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sector.  The benefit is only a timing benefit – with the imputation regime it reverses when the company income is paid out to the shareholder(s).  The temporary saving would only be $2,000 per $100,000 of taxable income – while all savings are helpful, this is not likely to be very significant.  It would significantly complicate the imputation regime as there would have to be two separate company tax rates, and as companies move over or under the SME threshold (whatever that is) they would be required to keep an imputation account for each rate of company tax.  Given that New Zealand can’t discriminate vis-à-vis tax rates with foreign companies some New Zealand companies owned by multi-nationals may qualify for the lower tax rate.  The increase in the gap between the SME company tax rate and the individual’s top marginal tax rate would likely cause even more inappropriate tax planning.  How would SMEs be defined – turnover, taxable income, assets or number of shareholders? This will be difficult.  There would be transitional issues to work through. 3.17 In our member survey those opposed to a progressive company tax rate outnumbered those who supported it by 2 to 1 (i.e., 26% to 12%). There were a large number (55%) who said ‘maybe’ but judging by the comments many of them were aware of the problems listed above. Therefore, Federated Farmers does not support a progressive company tax. Submission points – Goods & Services Tax and Income Tax General 3.18 Federated Farmers endorses New Zealand’s current high-level GST and Income Tax settings including the imputation regime. Goods & Services Tax 3.19 Federated Farmers endorses the comprehensive nature of the current GST. Thus, we disagree with any suggestion of targeted GST exemptions. Income Tax 3.20 The top rate of personal income tax and the trust rate should continue to be aligned so as to prevent aggressive tax planning of the sort that occurred in the 2000s when these rates were not aligned. 9 3.21 The margin between the top rate of personal income tax and the company tax rate should be as small as practicable and should not be any larger than the current margin of 5%. We understand that Inland Revenue is concerned that tax planning is occurring because the current margin already provides sufficient incentive. 3.22 The removal of intra-family enterprise resident withholding tax (RWT) obligations on interest and dividends would further reduce compliance costs without real risk to the tax base. 3.23 We do not agree with the proposal for a progressive company tax rate. 10 4. TAXES ON CAPITAL (CAPITAL GAINS TAX AND LAND TAX) 4.1 The background paper discusses two taxes on capital:  A tax on capital gains (CGT); and  A land tax; 4.2 In both cases the proposed tax base excludes the family home. 4.3 The VUTWG discussed both of these taxes in its January 2010 report. Its conclusions were:  A comprehensive CGT was supported by some members of the VUTWG, seemingly because of its conceptual attractiveness, however, most members opposed it because they were concerned about the practical challenges and the efficiency implications of introducing a CGT; and  Most members of the VUTWG supported a low-rate land tax but noted that there were concerns over political sustainability and other issues. 4.4 Conceptually, the base for a CGT or a land tax should be comprehensive, that is have few exemptions. While we understand the political reasoning for the exclusion of the family home from the bases of both a CGT and a land tax, this means that neither of these tax bases would be fully comprehensive. Likely necessity for further exemptions will further exacerbate this problem. An outcome is that family homes would (if overseas guidance is any indicator) become over-capitalised and this could cause house prices to rise overall. If the goal of these taxes is to address housing affordability, then neither are likely to succeed. CGT discussion 4.5 The long-standing separation of income from capital assets (the fruit) from any gains from the capital itself (the tree) emanates from old English trust law. New Zealand’s income tax law is based on this separation. New Zealand should only deviate from this successful separation of income from capital model if very good reasons exist. To date no general case has been made to change this model. 4.6 Conceptually an ideal capital gains tax will:  Tax gains on assets that are within the base as they accrue. In practice this cannot be achieved as it would require annual valuation. Thus, any CGT would apply on a realisation basis, with the resulting lock-in effect as CGT would then become a transaction tax; and  Apply to all assets other than consumable assets (such as depreciating cars, white- ware etc.) so as to prevent distortions in investment. This cannot be achieved because of, most notably, the exclusion of the family home. 4.7 Thus, any CGT in New Zealand will not be conceptually correct. We acknowledge that these two issues are a general problem in countries that do tax capital gains, but in combination they will distort economic behaviour. 4.8 Our member survey indicated strong opposition to a CGT, with 81% opposing and only 11% supporting the proposal. 11 Bright-line test 4.9 In some circumstances New Zealand currently taxes capital gains when undertaken by people regarded as ‘traders’. Land is the most notable example. To buttress the intention test (property acquired with the intention of sale is on tax account) the previous Government enacted a rule (known as the bright-line test) that taxes gains on residential property, other than the primary residence, if it is sold within two years of acquisition. This two-year rule has just been extended to five years. 4.10 We understand that the two-year rule has resulted in ‘over-reach’ in that it has captured ordinary New Zealanders selling property for non-profit related reasons as well as genuine property traders/speculators. That is, it applies to some sales of residential property that were clearly held on capital account (as opposed to the tax account). This over-reach will be exacerbated by the recent extension from two years to five years. 4.11 The bright-line test means New Zealand already taxes residential property that is held on capital account where that property is sold within five years of acquisition. Federated Farmers did not oppose either the two-year rule, or the extension from two years to five years. 4.12 If the problem that a CGT is supposed to address is speculation in land, then the effect of the five-year extension to the bright-line test should be analysed first. We believe that the five-year rule will substantially address any real concerns about land speculation, in which case a CGT as well would be largely redundant. 4.13 According to our member survey, opposition to a CGT did reduce if it were framed as a bright-line test. 47% supported the bright-line test, with five years the most favoured period. That said, 45% still opposed a CGT under any circumstance. Implementation issues 4.14 If the Tax Working Group does want to recommend a CGT, it should only do so after it has satisfied itself that it can be implemented in a fair fashion without the incurrence of onerous compliance and administration costs. 4.15 There is a plethora of issues that would have to be addressed as part of its implementation. In no particular order these include:  Presently the portfolio investment (PIE) rules exempt from income tax certain trading gains that ordinarily would be taxable. These rules would have to be rethought.  The issue of double taxation or double losses caused by capital gains and losses in a company being reflected in the company’s share price if both bases are subject to a comprehensive CGT has to be addressed (see Appendix 2 for examples);  Livestock Herd Scheme gains and losses which are currently treated as being on capital account would have to be reconsidered. Intuitively this would likely cause the herd scheme to be abolished as there seems to be no appropriate halfway house (and this itself would create issues as farmers have paid (taxation on entry) to enjoy the benefits of the herd scheme);  Special rules will be needed where the primary residence is a component of a larger land-owning activity, such as farming (and given that some farms are companies, will the primary residence rule actually apply to these residences?); 12  Where there is no change in ownership, the treatment of houses that move in and out of the CGT tax base as their usage changes from being a home to a rental house and vice versa will have to be considered. Will this require valuations at the point of the change, or apportionment or what;  Indexing asset cost base so the inflation component is not taxed will be an issue (the same issues currently exist with income tax on revenue account property and monies on deposit for interest and this would have to be addressed at the same time);  Dealing with roll-over relief for intra-family and intra-group company transactions and for transactions involving Maori land and its owners will be essential (see Appendix 3 for an example);  The same roll-over relief problem exists for transactions within a group of companies. This is of particular relevance where the group is a wholly-owned group of companies as in an intra-group transaction there is no change of the ultimate owners; and  The question of which assets should be included in the CGT base will have to be considered. For example, almost all cars depreciate over time, but some do appreciate. For example, a car may not be an appreciating asset until it has been owned for a (large) number of years – if cars that appreciate are included in the base, when is this appreciation determined and how is their CGT cost ascertained. If this is not handled carefully there could be considerable compliance costs. 4.16 Clearly, addressing these implementation issues will be complex and will lead to complex tax law. The biggest winners will be accountants and lawyers. A number of our members strongly believe in the KISS principle, and almost by definition, a CGT is not simple. Simplicity as a design objective is very important. 4.17 Obviously transitional issues would have to be addressed as well as implementation issues. Land tax discussion 4.18 The VUTWG considered land tax in some detail. While a majority of the TWG thought that a land tax was appropriate, they noted the issue of political sustainability. 4.19 VUTWG noted that land tax has some conceptual advantages:  The supply of land is finite;  A low rate land tax will raise a reasonable amount of revenue; and  Collection is relatively easy. 4.20 However, they also went on to comment:  A land tax would be suffered by those who owned the land at the date the land tax was introduced, because land values would fall (conceptually) by the present value of the future land tax payments. This fall could cause highly geared land owners to have negative equity, and could adversely affect mortgagors;  Any resultant fall in land values might not affect rents as the landlords would have an extra expense to suffer. If the present value of the land tax is not fully reflected in land values landlords may even expect to increase rents to ensure that their net return is unchanged;  As a land tax would only tax one form of wealth and not others, it would seem to cause horizontal equity problems between land owners and other taxpayers; 13  Annual payment of a land tax could give rise to cash-flow difficulties, particularly for activities that are based on extensive landholdings, such as farming and forestry. For a single cycle forest where there is no income until harvest (25 or more years after planting) this would could be particularly acute;  The more exemptions are provided (such as land under the family home), the less sustainable a land tax would be; and  There would also be concerns about some Maori land and other fallow land. Presumably land that is subject to QE II covenants would also have to be exempted. 4.21 Farmers have a particular concern about local authority rates. Rates are a charge on land or capital values to fund local authorities. Federated Farmers has always contended that rates should reflect a charge for services provided to ratepayers or categories of ratepayers rather than be ‘just a tax’. However, many in local government argue that rates should simply be regarded as a tax on assets owned rather than a payment for services provided. Because of this, many of our members, with some justification, believe rates have an element of unjustified taxation. 4.22 This concern was certainly reflected in our member survey where 91% opposed a land tax and this opposition remained overwhelming (80%) no matter the option to ameliorate it (such as making it fiscally neutral, applying a lower rate for farmland, or having it apply across all land with no exemptions). 4.23 Federated Farmers therefore strongly opposes a land tax. Submission Points - taxes on capital (capital gains tax and land tax) Capital gains tax 4.24 Federated Farmers supports the current taxation regime that provides the ability to tax the earnings of individuals and firms that are in the business of trading property but we are opposed to a ‘comprehensive’ capital gains tax (CGT). Our opposition is both philosophical and pragmatic. There are considerable challenges in making a capital gains tax workable. These include:  How to deal with double taxation or double losses (caused by capital gains and losses in the company being reflected in the share price, which is also subject to CGT);  How to deal with livestock Herd Scheme gains and losses which are currently regarded as being on capital account;  How to index gains so the inflation component is not taxed (the same issues currently exists with income tax on revenue account property and monies on deposit for interest); and  How to deal with roll-over relief for intra-family and intra-group company transactions and for transactions involving Maori land and its owners. 4.25 The ‘KISS’ (keep it simple ......) principle should apply. If there is a particular problem about ‘speculation’, then perhaps the bright-line test might be a better solution. 4.26 Without prejudice, we submit that no commitment to a CGT should be made until it has been established that the practical concerns can be addressed in a manner that is appropriate in the New Zealand context. This includes the need to keep compliance costs low. 14 Land tax 4.27 Federated Farmers is opposed to land tax. A land tax would be punitive and inequitable on farming. 4.28 A land tax is suffered by the owner of the land when the tax is introduced – as that value will decrease by the present value of the future land tax payments. Future owners pay a lesser price to acquire the land, but this is offset by the annual obligation to pay land tax. 4.29 Land tax has the potential to turn highly geared enterprises equity-negative, potentially with a flow on effect to banks and other financiers. Further, developing businesses, or businesses whose annual income fluctuates, may not have sufficient cash flow in any one year to pay a land tax. This is a particular concern for farming that can have significant and often unpredictable variations in gross revenue due to the vagaries of international commodity prices, exchange rates, interest rates, and the weather. 4.30 There may also be cash flow problems for owners of fallow land, and this could particularly affect Maori land. 15 5. TAX AND THE ENVIRONMENT 5.1 The Tax Working Group’s mandate for this discussion flows out the terms of reference: “What role \[can\] the taxation system can play in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes, especially over the longer term.” Given this wording it is clear that this could involve further taxes or further tax incentives and that “tax” can be widely defined. 5.2 The request for submissions on tax and the environment is contained in three paragraphs in Chapter 2 (The future environment), three paragraphs in Chapter 5 (The results of the current tax system) and six paragraphs in Chapter 7 (Specific challenges) of the Background Paper. Environmental taxes in context 5.3 Federated Farmers believes that it is inappropriate to consider tax in isolation as ‘the solution’ to environmental issues. Like the environment itself, consideration of how to care for the environment is complex and has a number of layers to it. Further, a number of environmental aspects, including those discussed in the background paper, are already being dealt with by other policy and regulation. 5.4 Thus we question whether the Tax Working Group, which solely has a focus on tax, is the most appropriate forum for considering the environment and tax issues. However, we do acknowledge Tax Working Group’s mandate. 5.5 Federated Farmers’ member survey showed strong opposition (82%) to environmental taxes. Opposition did reduce provided the revenue raised was spent to fund on-farm environmental expenditure, but 51% still opposed them no matter what. Compliance and administration costs were as significant a concern as the amount of tax paid. 5.6 Federated Farmers believes that if the Government wishes to further consider environmental issues it should first identify the problem or problems, and then should prioritise these. This would then allow for full consideration, in the context of the wider economic environment and existing frameworks, of the range of potential solutions. Taxation might be one and regulation another, but a combination may be the best option. There are also industry-led initiatives, such as the Clean Streams accord which was developed by the dairy industry. 5.7 This consideration should be based on empirical data. While a lot of anecdotal evidence exists, a properly prepared body of scientific data is necessary. Further, behavioural implications and potential unintended consequences should be considered. 5.8 We suggest that the use of tax to encourage better environmental behaviour may be inappropriate because it puts a price on the non-complying behaviour which some taxpayers may simply accept (as do New Zealand’s diminishing, but not disappearing, cigarette smokers). 5.9 We also note that some of the taxes that have been proposed to address environmental issues fail against the principles of good taxation. We attach as Appendix 3 a report by NZIER for primary sector organisations assessing a resource rental on water, a nitrates tax, and extending the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to include biological agricultural emissions. Only extending the ETS would not fail comprehensively against the principles and even then much depends on how it would be designed. 16 5.10 This is not to say that taxation might not have a role, it is just that the wider questions need to be considered before solutions (which may or may not include tax) can be prioritised and considered. In some cases, a combination of carrots and sticks may be appropriate. For example, regulation requires farmers to plant alongside fenced waterways, and the current tax rules incentivise this expenditure. 5.11 We note that over the last few years, farmers have been subject to a considerable amount of regulation, a lot of it in the environmental space. For example, dairy farms are subject to strict regulations imposed at a regional level concerning dairy shed effluent and its disposal. For a number of farmers this requirement caused significant costs. However, almost all dairy farmers accepted and met their obligations because they were properly marketed and were regionally targeted. 5.12 These regulations are starting to show positive effects. LAWA (Land, Air, Water Aotearoa) in their Press Release dated 16 April 2018 stated that “for all river quality parameters monitored over a 10-year period, more sites were improving than deteriorating and that about 90% were either improving or stable. This encouraging national picture has been welcomed by scientists and local government who pointed to freshwater ecosystem management practices as likely contributing to the progress.” 5.13 The graph from the LAWA media statement follows below: It illustrates that there has been a net improvement in water quality 5.14 We attach as Appendix 4 a number of examples of national regulatory frameworks in the environment space that affect farmers. The fundamental point is New Zealand already has existing regulatory frameworks for addressing sustainable management of identified environmental issues. These frameworks are iterative and constantly changing, as details around threats to the environment, or new information/practices aimed at protecting these environmental goods, emerge. These regulatory frameworks are able to adapt to, and are better targeted to, addressing issues at a local level in response to specific ecosystems and issues. A taxation approach, particularly one developed at a national level, would be nowhere near as adaptable. 17 5.15 Gaps in the regulatory response to these regulatory issues have largely been driven by resource management frameworks being too slow to adapt, and not forward thinking enough. Many of the resource management issues we are dealing with today were not even on the radar 20 years ago. There is also a paucity of both information and understanding of the interaction between different resource management issues. Taxation is a blunt tool that will not address these nuanced needs. The fact these issues are emerging or are still issues is not because of any great failure in legislative/regulatory frameworks, more it is the fact we are playing catch-up and the understanding of often complex and interacting environmental functions has lagged. 5.16 Federated Farmers is concerned about the narrow definition of “environmental tax” that the Tax Working Group is using. This is “a charge levied on a tax base that has a proven, specific, negative impact on the environment.” Tax concessions that support the environment (the carrot), such as immediate deductibility for riparian planting, are not included within this definition. Thankfully the Tax Working Group mandate in this space and some of the detail in Chapter 7 of the Background Paper indicate that this is not a limitation. Detailed comment on the Background Paper’s environmental discussion 5.17 The following points are made on the thirteen paragraphs in the Background Paper which relate to the environment: TWG paragraph Federated Farmer’s comment Page 14, last paragraph. Climate change background including comment that New Zealand’s emissions reduction options are limited because of the proportion of emissions that come from the primary sector. New Zealand has a detailed emissions reduction plan in place. This is currently being reviewed with the likely outcome that farmers will be more exposed to carbon pricing. Page 15, paragraph 1. Notwithstanding the recently established Climate Change Commission and its focus TWG suggests that the tax system could be used. We recommend that the TWG leave this issue to the Interim Climate Change Commission which is specifically charged with addressing it. Page 15, paragraph 2. Biodiversity is a major problem and the use of pricing and taxation instruments may be (part of) an answer. As we have submitted, tax needs to be put into a perspective and discussed as one of a range of potential tools, not talked about in isolation. Further, we wonder if this presumes that the present mechanisms are perceived as not working, or if tax might be a better solution. However, we note in this submission that QE II covenants can encourage biodiversity and that it would be appropriate for expenditure on QE II land to be expressly tax deductible. Page 40, paragraph 1. “New Zealand’s resource-based economy and the wellbeing of New Zealanders are heavily dependent on protecting our natural capital.” There is then discussion on biodiversity and surface water use. No association is made between these paragraphs and taxation. Nor is there a discussion on the potential impacts of existing and pending regulation in addressing loss of natural capital. The acknowledgement that “protection” \[regulations\] have stemmed the loss of especially native forest” is constructive. It has been contended by some that the single greatest threat to terrestrial and freshwater 18 Page 40, paragraph 2. Nitrate levels have generally worsened, although phosphorous levels have improved. New Zealand’s carbon emissions are increasing, and not withstanding comprehensive fishing quotas, fishing stocks are at risk. ecosystems is from introduced species. If so it is difficult to see how this could be a tax issue. It is interesting that water quality is not directly discussed, nor are the issues to do with nitrate and phosphorous put in context. There is good discussion of water quality issue in MfE’s 2015 report Environment Aotearoa. The high-level water quality finding of that report is (unsurprisingly) that “water quality is poorer where there are pressures from urban and agricultural land use”. Page 41, paragraph 1. New Zealand charges royalties on extraction of \[certain\] natural resources. An alternative would be a resource tax to ensure that what economists call “rents” are taxed. In this context we agree that a royalty is a tax, but to our knowledge the royalties in place in New Zealand have nothing to do with the environment. Page 49, paragraph 1 under the environmental heading. “Environmental taxes are levied on tax bases that have a proven, specific negative impact on the environment.” It is acknowledged that environmental taxes sit alongside regulation, incentive programmes as policy options. The acknowledgement that tax is only one of the relevant levers that can be used to enhance the environment is appropriate and constructive. Page 49, paragraph 2. “New Zealand collects relatively little revenue from environmental taxes as a percentage of GDP compared to other OECD countries.” The paragraph acknowledges that fuel taxes, even if hypothecated to roading, is regarded as an environmental tax. The paragraph goes on to note that “The OECD notes that many environmental taxes in OECD countries are poorly designed and targeted.” The paper’s own evidence at Figure 22 shows that New Zealand’s environmental tax to GDP is only marginally below the OECD average. The bigger problem is that the OECD data is misleading because of its treatment of fuel taxes (usually excise, but also road user charges) that are hypothecated to roading. This suggests that environmental taxes need to be carefully thought through and targeted. Page 49, paragraph 3. “Environmental taxes can be a powerful tool .... . Other tools .... include government regulation (fines and penalties under industry specific regimes) and limiting supply through quota systems. It is correct to recognise that there is a range of tools that can be used. However, as noted above, before tools can be discussed it is appropriate to first define the environmental problem(s). It is also notable that New Zealand is well down the regulatory path in addressing environmental issues, and in particular those discussed in the Paper. Page 49, last paragraph. “New Zealand offers some tax incentives \[carrots\] to promote activities that align with environmental objectives. However, tax incentives can have disadvantages relative to the levying of an environmental tax \[sticks\].” Further they can involve picking winners and are fiscally costly. It would be interesting to tabulate the present environmental tax incentives contrasted with comparable regulation. Put another way, are they always substitutable? The costs of planting and maintaining forests is currently immediately deductible – it is tax incentivised. Can we even design a regulatory system that would not lead to a decrease in the area planted (whether for harvest or only for conservation)? Riparian planting is deductible to farmers – when this was enacted no fiscal cost was forecast because this 19 was simply codifying the current actual tax treatment. However, in general we accept there is a fiscal cost to providing tax incentives, - the question is, as always, what is the “public good” created by the incentive. Page 50, paragraph 1. This paragraph describes some of the existing incentives, including forestry and the electric vehicles from road user charges. As noted above, to the extent road user charges are hypothecated to roading we do not regard this as a tax incentive although we agree that the EV exemption from road user charges is an incentive. Page 50, paragraph 2. This paragraph comments on taxation rules that unintentionally may favour certain activities that might not be appropriate from an environmental perspective. The lack of FBT on \[most\] employer provided car parks is provided as an example. We understand the point being made, but with regard to FBT on car parks we would recommend proceeding with caution. Previously governments have tried repeatedly to address this issue – the problem is defining which car parks should the FBT apply to? The nurses’ parks at Wellington Hospital and the teachers’ parks at Flemington School (a rural Hawkes Bay primary school) are two examples that illustrate the difficulties. QE II covenants 5.18 It is Federated Farmers’ understanding that all costs incurred by a farmer in looking after land subject to a QE II covenant are treated as deductible expenses. This is completely understandable given the “greater good” (biodiversity etc.) nature of the covenants. However, if this deductibility was made expressly enacted it may short-cut discussions between famers and Inland Revenue about the nature and purpose of the costs. It would confirm present treatment and therefore come without a fiscal cost. 5.19 It is not only farmers who own covenanted land. We are aware of some QE II covenanted land that is not owned by farmers. Again, given the “greater good” principle deductions should be available to all businesses or individuals that own such land. We cannot comment on any fiscal cost that this might cause as we have no information. 5.20 Our member survey indicated strong support for this sort expenditure being tax deductible – 84% supported tax being used as a ‘carrot’ for the environment. We believe this is particularly useful approach when regulation is being used as a ‘stick’. Submission points – tax and the environment 5.21 The consideration of taxation in isolation as a response to environmental issues is flawed. There is a range of levers, including regulation and industry-led initiatives, as well as taxation, that can be used. These other levers are efficient and can work in a way that is more targeted and is iterative. Indeed, New Zealand has been focusing on regulation for some time now, along with some support from the taxation system (in the form of deductions for some environmental expenditure). 5.22 As is illustrated in Appendix 4, there are a significant number of regulatory frameworks that are currently in place that affect farmers that are working well and that actively encourage (by specifying) remedial activities. Unless there is clear evidence that these frameworks are irretrievably broken there is little point in trying to substitute taxation for these frameworks. 20 5.23 Further, we note in this context a tax might not encourage appropriate remedial activities. Taxpayers might decide it is cheaper to simply pay the tax, particularly if they have limited ability to change/respond. At the least the law of diminishing returns will apply and the tax rate will likely have to be significant to encourage the outliers, as is the case with cigarette smoking. In contrast, regulation is compulsory. 5.24 Any further projects in the environment space should start with a robust problem definition which is based on science. It is only once the problem has been defined that solutions, which may or may not include taxation, can be considered in the context of the wider economic framework. Obviously, compliance and administration costs will be an important part of any solution and these must always be considered. 5.25 The costs of maintaining QE II covenanted land should be expressly deductible 21 6. ABOUT FEDERATED FARMERS 6.1 Federated Farmers is a member based organisation that represents farmers and other rural businesses. Federated Farmers has a long and proud history of representing the needs and interests of New Zealand’s farmers. 6.2 The Federation aims to add value to its members’ business. Our key strategic outcomes include the need for New Zealand to provide an economic and social environment within which:  Our members may operate their business in a fair and flexible commercial environment;  Our members’ families and their staff have access to services essential to the needs of the rural community; and  Our members adopt responsible management and environmental practices. 7.

The survey (which was open from 5- 14 March) attracted 1,393 responses, an impressive number given the survey’s length (30 questions) and indicative of the interest farmers have in tax. The responses were representative of the make-up of Federated Farmers’ membership in terms its provinces and industry groups. Many of the respondents also took the time to provide comments on each question. 1. TAX SYSTEM Do you generally agree with the following statement? “Tax revenue should recover enough to fund government spending of no more than 30% of GDP and the maintenance of operating surpluses. If there are structural surpluses we have preferred tax cuts and repayment of debt to more spending.” Results Flavour of Comments Yes 80.45% Most comments were strongly in favour of the statement. For example,  “Like any good business you need to use any surplus wisely and repaying debt is wise. It is our money not the government’s”; and  “Critically important. Government spending above that basic level is too often for political purposes, can be wasteful, and too frequently produces perverse outcomes” Others were mostly in agreement. For example  “Not sure about the 30% of GDP but certainly agree taxes should be enough and no more than is necessary for the running of prudent government expenditure and balancing the books including sensible repayment of debt” However, a few respondents disagreed and felt more spending might be needed. For example  “We need to pay back the debt but not at the expense of social obligations e.g. health, education, aged care etc. Need a balance. NZ infrastructure has been let down of years”. No 5.23% Don’t know 14.32% 2 The Government doesn’t view the tax system as ‘fair’ and instead thinks ‘asset owners’ and ‘speculators’ are not paying their fair share of tax. Do you agree? Results Flavour of Comments Yes 16.49% Most comments wanted a differentiation between ‘asset owners’ and ‘speculators’. They consider most farmers to be ‘asset owners’ who are in it for the long-term. They felt such asset owners should not be put in the same box as ‘speculators’ who many felt perhaps should pay more tax. For example:  “That is a rather broad sweep to put asset owners and speculators in one question. Speculators can be considered risk takers. Asset owners are often conservative, save rather than spend over many decades”;  “Long term asset holders do pay fair share due to longer term investment in their assets to improve productivity and therefore pay in income and company tax. Speculators not so as shorter term with often little investment in asset development i.e. land or house banking”; and  “We've worked very hard i.e., no holidays, days off, etc. via the sharemilking system for over 14 years before we purchased our 450 cow farm. Why should people who work long and hard to achieve be penalised by taxes for this. Growth should be encouraged not discouraged”. Some noted that the tax system already addresses speculation by ‘traders’. For example  “There is already a tax on people who just buy and then flick a farm for a quick buck” No 75.89% Don’t know 7.62% 3 2. TAXES ON ASSETS 2.1 Capital Gains Tax New Zealand does not have a comprehensive capital gains tax. Would you support the introduction of a capital gains tax that, as has been proposed, excludes the family home? Results Flavour of Comments Yes 11.50% Most comments were strongly against a CGT. Many were totally against any CGT for the impact it would have on farming. For example:  “No I would not, especially not in relation to inter-generational family farming operations. Grass roots farming is not an easy life, and many sacrifices are made by farming families that cannot be quantified for tax purposes.”  “Where is the incentive to get ahead? We didn't inherit the family farm and worked our butts off living on next to nothing for many years to achieve farm ownership.”  “It could reduce the value of our business. We started with nothing 25 years ago and have reached our goal of owning our own farm. Land prices have gone up considerably but our profit level has not changed much. Through hard work, we have put ourselves in a position where our assets have grown through factors outside our direct control (demand) so why should we be taxed on that?”  “The modest capital gain in many small businesses is the only way that the owners would reach the minimum wage let alone get a return on capital”  “Rural farming businesses are already marginal and a capital gains tax would see many farmers quit the industry. It just adds to our cost structure. We are price takers and are not able to put our price up. Upset the balance and there will be consequences that create other problems.”  “Just makes work for accountants and lawyers. Helps make tax avoidance a national pastime (USA example)”.  “Absolutely not. This could leave people that are asset rich, but cash poor to be locked into not selling because of the fear of a wealth depletion. What about succession between families, this could kill any transaction.” Others opposed a CGT excluding the family house. For example:  “If they were to look at a capital gains tax, farming should be the last type of business that should be considered. Start with investment property owners who neglect tenants first and leave farmers alone”  “Needs to target the problematic areas i.e. housing.”  “Excluding the family home would exacerbate the present dilemma where tax free status drives investment toward housing and real estate rather than business”.  “I have no issue with a comprehensive CGT provided it is based around realised gains rather than an assessed value on unsold assets, but it should include the 'family home'. Australia brought in a CGT in 1985 that excluded the family home, so we saw investors sell their rental properties and sink the proceeds into a huge family mansion, to avoid the CGT. Exemptions always lead to distortions but we know that politics rule here as the government will seek to ruffle as few feathers as possible so any CGT will always exclude the family home.” No 81.14% Don’t know 7.36% 4 Some supported a CGT if farms, especially family farms, were exempted. For example:  “Family farms should be excluded too, but corporate farms should be included.”  “No, unless the family farm was excluded also if it was being sold to the next generation of the family.”  “No way, unless it excludes family farm. The only time our family is going to make any real money is if we sell” A few were supportive even if farms were included. For example:  “It would take the speculators out of the industry, and farms would be for the farmers who can farm. Land prices may even come back closer to productive worth so young farmers can get a good start.” Are there any circumstances where you would support the introduction of a capital gains tax? Results Flavour of Comments If it were applied equally across all assets, including the family home, without any exemptions 14.74% Again there were a lot of negative comments about any CGT, as mentioned in relation to the previous question. These won’t be restated here. Most of the remaining comments related to the bright-line test option:  “The 'bright line' test is the best way to weed out the speculators”.  “The bright line test sounds good in theory to stop so much speculating, but there can be times when it could end up very unfair. We bought a farm nearly 3 years ago but then my husband died suddenly about 18 months ago. We have managed to stay on at this stage but it is a battle. A 5-year bright line test would not be kind if we needed to sell.”  “If there had to be at capital gains tax, reluctantly the bright-line option, that is a property is solid within say 2 to 5 years. In our situation we are in it for the long term. What if we were to sell part of or subdivide a couple of sections off our farm to enable a viable purchase?”  “I am happy with the bright-line test for housing speculation but not a full CGT that may encompass other assets. A CGT increases the complexity when buying & selling businesses and intergenerational asset movement.” Examples of comments about exemptions included:  “All assets would need inclusion to avoid anomalies and not dis-incentivise investment in producing assets. Overall tax take should remain neutral - we already suffer ever unconstrained increasing local body taxes - farmers receive no service for these.”  “Only if as above it exempted the family home or family farm where only one is owned. It should only target multiple ownership” If other tax rates were cut so it was ‘fiscally neutral’ 13.24% If it were applied as a ‘bright-line test’, that is would only take effect if the asset is sold within a period (say 5 years) of its purchase 46.63% No, I would never support a capital gains tax 44.71% 5  “There has to be more tax for speculators and not touch farmers who buy land and may possibly sell to buy another block or older farmers selling their farms to their families”. Examples of other comments relating to the operation of a CGT included:  “Any capital gains tax should tax only real, rather than inflationary, gains so gains should be indexed for inflation, as in Australia.”  “Who sets the initial value if the asset has not been sold for thirty plus years?”  “But only if taxed when profit realised. Not a tax on un-realised capital gain.”  “How would it be calculated? Would capital losses be credited? Would it take account of capital expenditure which is not eligible for tax deductions?” What period of time would you prefer for a bright-line test? Results Flavour of Comments 2 years 14.54% Again there were negative comments with many saying ‘never’ or restating previous reasons for opposing a CGT. Some of those who supported a bright-line test raised the need for exemptions (e.g., sales due to death or illness or sales to family members or sales to move up to better farms). For example:  Should a family farm be purchased and then a medical event/death/marital/financial situation occur which necessitates a sale then a capital gains tax could be severely damaging to the owner. Corporate farms could be taxed after a 10 years but difficult to determine some owner structures.  Apply on when farm was sold outside the family Liability should be passed on to the next generations.  Should allow for improvements or development to increase value.  I have found farming clients working to improve properties and sell, so that they can improve their farm size. Sometime these transactions are less than 5 years, but I think a 5 year limited would then keep those genuinely farming out of the tax net. Interestingly, some respondents suggested even longer periods for the test, 20 years and upwards. 5 years 40.17% 10 years 22.52% Don’t know 11.34% Other 11.45% 6 2.2. Land Tax New Zealand currently has a land tax through local government rates. A land tax would be an additional tax for central government. It would be a flat percentage per annum (e.g., 1%) of the property’s unimproved land value. It would exclude the value of the land under the family home. Would you support such a land tax? Results Flavour of Comments Yes 2.07% A lot of strong opposition in the comments, with many noting they already pay more than enough ‘land tax’ to their councils in the form of property value based rates that don’t reflect ability to pay and would be unaffordable. For example:  “Tax on asset value has nothing to do with your ability to pay, you would always be paying even in bad years such as drought or commodity price slumps”  “Local government already taxes/rates farmers well above the costs that farmers incur to district councils. The rural rate payers are subsidising their urban counterparts. Also rates are increasing well ahead of the rate of inflation. Local government has its own consumer price index which again is totally ahead of the nationally accepted Rate of Inflation.”  “This would have the effect of driving many small family farmers off their land as they would struggle to be able to pay this. This would result in more corporate farming taking up land as they could manage the tax implications better. This would seriously change the face of farming in New Zealand, with likely environmental impacts as farmers not owning land would no longer have an incentive to do the right thing for future generations.”  “A land tax would effectively render many farms uneconomical, the value of a farm is often entirely unrelated to its productive value especially for large scale sheep farms where amenity value vastly over-inflates land values and returns on capital value are as low as 1-2%”.  “We have land which cannot be developed due to biodiversity, RMA constraints, very unfair to tax us on unimproved value”. Some noted problems with relying on property valuations. For example:  “Who will judge the unimproved value? We were the leaseholders of a 'West Coast Lease' block. It was not very developed when purchased. As the other blocks around also developed, there was no longer a bench mark for swampy, gorse and blackberry infested areas for comparison and the unimproved value increased dramatically”.  “Determination of values is subjective. There are problems with valuations. I have a 10.42 ha QE11 covenant area it has recently been assigned a Land Value of $25,000 and a Capital Value of $25,000. There has been no value attributed to Improvements. Yet the QU11 is dependent on having a fence surrounding it?” Others observed that the burden of a land tax (especially one that exempted land under the family home) would be unfair. For example:  “Not Fair. Many people make a lot of money with little land e.g., share brokers and financial advisers” No 90.99% Don’t know 6.94% 7  “That means that mostly only farmers would be paying this tax!”  “Totally unfair as rural get nothing for their current local body rates but rural provides income tax, GST and foreign exchange whilst urban gains access to all urban facilities with residential properties providing minimal of the above.”  “Why should businesses that own land be taxed more than other businesses that don't?” Are there any circumstances where you would support the introduction of a land tax? Results Flavour of Comments If it were applied equally across all land, including land under the family home, without any exemptions 9.24% Almost all the comments were strongly opposed to a land tax regardless of the options. They were very similar to the comments for the previous question so won’t be restated here. If there was a lower rate set for farmland compared to rates for businesses or residential land 9.66% If other tax rates were cut so it was ‘fiscally neutral’ 13.10% No, I would never support a land tax 79.85% 2.3 Stamp Duty Another possible new tax on property would be stamp duty. Stamp duty is a 'one-off' tax paid by the purchaser at the time of purchase, usually a flat percentage of the purchase price. Would you support a stamp duty? Results Flavour of Comments Yes 5.45% Comments were overwhelmingly negative. Many observed that stamp duty had been abolished some years ago and that reintroducing it would be a backward step. For example:  “There was stamp duty tax in the past, and it didn't raise a great amount of income but it made transferring land titles between family members and amalgamation of property titles expensive and difficult to do.”  “We have had a stamp duty in the past. It was abolished mainly because of its compliance and administrative costs were high relative to the revenue it raised.”  “Stamp Duty discourages efficient land use., people hold on to land rather than pay the stamp duty when it could be sold and put to better use.” A few comments supported stamp duty, especially for sales to foreigners. For example: No 82.33% Don’t know 12.22% 8  “Stamp duty would be a more appropriate form of taxation on land because out would only bite when the property was sold and would not therefore impose additional cash costs on the land owner during the period of ownership.”  “For overseas purchasers of NZ land”. Are there any circumstances where you would support the re-introduction of stamp duty? Results Flavour of Comments If it were applied equally across all property, including the family home, without any exemptions 8.91% Again, most comments were strongly negative (as mentioned in relation to the previous question). These won’t be restated here. Some though supported the idea of foreigners being taxed through a stamp duty. For example:  “I think it would be fair if foreign investors were asked to contribute”  “Don't mind foreign investors if they live in NZ and pay tax in NZ. Would really like to see foreign investors taxed higher.” If there was a lower rate set for farmland compared to rates for businesses or residential property 6.70% If other tax rates were cut so it was ‘fiscally neutral’ 7.63% If it only applied to foreign investors 30.79% No, I would never support stamp duty 58.86% 2.4 Capital Tax A capital tax, as proposed last year by Gareth Morgan’s Opportunities Party, would apply a person’s or company’s tax rate to a deemed rate of return on all productive assets, regardless of a person’s income or a company’s profit. Would you support such a capital tax? Results Flavour of Comments Yes 2.90% A lot of comments were critical of the high cost this would impose on farmers, whose incomes and profitability fluctuate wildly thanks to world commodity prices, exchange rates, and weather. For example:  “For businesses that have a very high value of "productive assets" but actually have a very low rate of return, like a lot of farms, that would unfair to tax them on that value when it already does not generate much of a return.”  “I do not know much about it but it would hit the productive sector and leave the city companies laughing I would think.”  “Which God is going to allocate such deemed rate?” There was also concern about high administration and compliance costs.  Administratively cumbersome and complex. Can't see how this type of tax is fair or logical when it is not related to actual income or profit (ability to pay). No 82.71% Don’t know 14.40% 9  “Will just end up with an " avoidance industry". There were also a lot of comments that they did not understand how the tax would work. There were some lone voices of support though. For example:  “An imputed (deemed) rate of return is more likely to discourage farming for capital gains or if profitable to farm for capital gains make the farm owner pay a fair share of tax.” Are there any circumstances where you would support the introduction of a capital tax? Results Flavour of Comments If there was a lower deemed rate pf return for farmland compared to other assets 6.06% Most comments were strongly negative (as mentioned in relation to the previous question). They won’t be restated here. If other tax rates were cut so it was ‘fiscally neutral’ 12.20% No, I would never support a capital tax 84.68% 2.5 Inheritance Tax New Zealand has no inheritance taxes like death duties, estate duties and gift duties. Would you support the reintroduction of inheritance taxes? Results Flavour of Comments Yes 0.94% Virtually all comments were strongly negative, w3ith particularly strong concern about affordability, double taxation, compliance costs, and succession. For example:  “How on earth can family farms ever be handed to the next generation if estate duties had to be paid. There isn't the cash to pay it.”  “Definitely not. It caused so much stress to farming families as they often had no alternative but to sell their farm to find payment of this unfair tax. Their asset is the farm and taxes such as these, hinders the next generation to continue the business. After all, tax has already been paid on the principal capital when the previous family descendant paid it off. This is a double whammy tax. Payed twice.”  “Have had it in the past - disaster. Good for the lawyers and valuers only.”  “This is a double taxation. Taxing people once to earn the money, then again when they die.”  “Again very costly to administer compared to tax paid and has devastating effect on a high capital business like farming. A sheep and beef farm would not be viable post-inheritance tax.” No 97.02% Don’t know 2.04% 10  “Estate duties crippled my family financially when my father died effectively putting a mother with 5 children into poverty. I would not wish that on anyone”. There were a handful of more supportive comments though. For example:  “Provided there is a reasonable tax-free level for each person inheriting - say $1,000,000”. 11 3 TAXES ON INCOME 3.1 Personal Income Tax The top rate of personal income tax is 33%. Is this rate: Results Flavour of Comments Too high 34.53% Most comments were that 33% is too high or about right, with a number noting that higher rates incentivise avoidance.  “The higher the rate, the more incentives for tax avoidance.”  “Going higher than this creates profit shifting motives that will be used by those targeted by the high rates, who can afford to develop the schemes required.  “Plenty of studies have shown that the higher the personal tax rate the higher the rate of tax avoidance and tax evasion, and the greater the time spent in tax planning rather than income generation and business investment and growth. A lower rate often results in more tax being collected as the desire for avoidance reduces and people are incentivised to work.” Some suggested the 33% rate could be cut or the $70,000 threshold increased with a few suggesting it be done in combination with an increase in GST. For example:  “If you raise anything, raise GST. A higher income person who spends rather than invests is then paying more”.  “I prefer upping GST lowering personal tax rates and increasing the base level before tax paid. Everyone pays GST and very difficult for the rich to avoid.” Some thought the top personal income tax rate should be aligned to the company or trusts tax rates. For example:  “Should be the same as company and trust rates”.  “I believe in a simple tax system. A single flat rate for personal, trust, and company. Therefore, less opportunity to avoid tax by juggling things in different entities” Some commented that a new higher rate could be introduced at a significantly higher income threshold. For example:  “There should be higher rates for the top earners or the threshold should be raised so that middle income earners are not paying the same amount of tax as the highest income earners.”  “Threshold for top rate kicks in too low. Extremely high earners i.e., those earning over $250,000 should have higher rate say 40%”. About right 58.97% Too low 3.16% Don’t know 3.33% 12 The top rate of personal income tax applies to income over $70,000. Is this threshold: Results Flavour of Comments Too high 6.52% Most comments were that the threshold is too low, with some mentioning that it is getting close to the average income. For example:  “I feel that the $70,000 threshold is far too low for a 33% tax rate.”  “$70,000 is not a large income these days - it's what is needed to survive for most families.” A number made suggestions for where it should be, with $100,000 a popular choice. A number also suggested thresholds should be inflation-adjusted. For example:  “Take this out of politicians’ hands - tax thresholds should be automatically adjusted with incomes so that the average rate that taxpayers pay stays the same.” About right 39.54% Too low 50.86% Don’t know 3.09% Personal income tax thresholds have been unchanged since 2010. Should income tax thresholds be adjusted annually for inflation? Results Flavour of Comments Yes 55.08% A number of comments said regular changes would be disruptive and would impose administration and compliance costs. For example:  “Too confusing to change them all the time”  “Don't change annually - every chance requires updates to computer systems / people's thinking. This extra work creates inefficiencies.” Even amongst those who supported the idea, a number suggested less frequent adjustments, mostly every three to five years. For example:  “Perhaps not annually but regularly (3 to 5 years)”. No 29.43% Don’t know 15.49% Would you support a new higher top rate of personal income tax applying at a higher income threshold? (say a 39% rate applying at income over $150,000) Results Flavour of Comments Yes 36.90% Most comments were negative, with some saying they pay more than enough tax already. For example:  “The current top rate of 33% is high enough.”  “No way - already pay more than our fair share. Why tax those who are working hard for the country and economy more?” Others commented it would discourage effort and would encourage more people to avoid tax, especially if a large gap opened up with the company and trust rates. For example: No 53.42% 13 Don’t know 9.67%  “This dis-incentivises people to work hard and achieve”  “Higher rates dis-incentivise productivity. Higher earnings grow the tax base”.  “Those with this level of income are going to have the means to use other ownership options to reduce tax exposure”. Some of those who supported the idea qualified their support by suggesting a higher threshold, with $200,000 a popular choice. For example:  Yes, but income should be at least $200,000 not $150,000 3.2 Company Tax The company tax rate is a flat 28% of a company’s taxable profits. Is this rate: Results Flavour of Comments Too high 18.32% Comments were very mixed. Some want it cut in order to be internationally competitive, and noted that many countries (including Australia) are considering further cuts in their rates. 25% was a popular choice. For example:  “Must be competitive with or to our trading partners/competitors.”  “Needs to align with Australia at 25%”  “Other OCED countries are considering lowering their company tax rates.”  “NZ is now one of the higher taxed countries in this area. This affects our competitive advantage and closes us off to some overseas industries which might otherwise consider doing business here.” Not everyone agreed though. For example:  “Reducing the rate would provide too much benefit for NZ companies owned by overseas residents.” Others noted that in most cases, company tax is a withholding tax with the personal income tax being the final tax. For example:  The effective tax rate on company income is 33% for most NZ tax residents as this is what you end up paying when the profits are paid out as dividends. The 28% rate is largely a timing difference. Some advocated for the company tax rate to be aligned with the trusts rate and/or the top rate of personal income tax. For example:  “Should be the same as Trusts. Reduce Trusts to 28%.”  “Prefer to align top personal tax rate with company tax rate.” Some were keen on a lower rate for small businesses. For example:  “It should be scaled, as small companies are very different enterprises to large companies.” About right 65.92% Too low 8.22% Don’t know 7.53% 14 The Tax Working Group has been asked to consider whether New Zealand should have a ‘progressive company tax rate’, a lower company tax rate for small businesses. It’s unclear how ‘small’ will be defined, but it could be based on net profit, employee numbers, or turnover. Would you support this idea? Results Flavour of Comments Yes 11.82% Most comments were critical of the idea, with many pleas to ‘keep it simple’. For example:  “Why penalise the guy that’s out pushing things along and growing his business and creating opportunities and jobs for New Zealanders!!”  “Any definition of 'small' would be likely to end up in a tax accountant and lawyers feast.”  “Too easy to split things up to make "small" fit if there is a significant tax advantage - also kiss principle - keep it simple the more complicated the more money wasted on lawyers and accountants and general nonsense”.  “A simple system that people understand would be best”.  “KISS principle.”  “An unnecessary complication in the system - good tax systems are simple systems. Is a disincentive to grow the business. Do we want to foster small mindedness?” Others noted it would do nothing for them as they are not structured as companies (being sole traders, partnerships, or trusts).  “Would a family farm partnership which was not a company benefit from a lower company tax rate? I think not!” Some noted that we already have progressive tax for company owners. For example:  “The current imputation regime enables companies to pass through tax credits for income tax paid by a company to its shareholders, effectively reducing the tax rate on company income to the rate paid by its shareholders. Because of this, a progressive rate is unnecessary except for changing the time at which tax would be paid.” But some were supportive of the idea. For example:  “Small businesses have a disproportionate amount of compliance requirement and are responsible for collecting family support, student loans etc. for the government. This takes time and this time is not remunerated.”  “OK but should follow personal tax scale as many small companies pay out profits as shareholder remuneration.” There was also uncertainty on how it would work. For example:  “More information would be needed to fully understand what this proposal means.”  “Question is too speculative for me to know what I think. Depends entirely on detail and tradeoffs.” Maybe but depends on definition of ‘small’ 55.42% No 26.19% Don’t know 6.57% 15 What would be the best way to define ‘small’, a threshold of Results Flavour of Comments Below a specified level of net profit before tax 30.30% Most comments expressed concern about how some or all of these options would work in practice, what thresholds would be ‘small’, and the associated administration and compliance costs. For example:  “There will always be ways of manipulating a figure so it's hard to know what would be the best definition.”  “Net profit and turnover can be too variable and therefore you won't know what level of tax you have to pay until the end of year. People will be creative to get around this. Number of employees could stop companies taking on more employees.”  “This is ridiculous - if you go on profit then you will work at adjusting levels of profit - good for accountants I guess, same with the others - turnover is irrelevant to profit so can't tax someone because high turnover as they may be making no money! Has to remain equal for all companies” Some thought it would have to be a combination of two or more of the options. For example:  “It would have to be a combination - a business could be really big but not have a particularly high net profit, especially if it was expanding. It could still own significant assets and be continually adding to them. This business would under current law stand to gain a lot on sale of the business and if it had been taxed at a lower rate, would not necessarily be paying very much tax over the years. Business turnover likewise could be very high but profit low in a business with very little asset so taxing higher on turnover would be unfair.” Below a specified level of business turnover (e.g., annual GST revenue) 22.73% Below a specified number of employees 14.48% None of these options would work 16.75% Don’t know 15.74% 3.3 Trusts Tax The tax rate for trusts is 33%, the same as the top rate of personal income tax. Is this rate: Results Flavour of Comments Too high 39.20% A number of comments were that the trusts rate should be aligned to the company tax rate or the top rate of personal income tax (or both).  “The trust tax rate needs to be the same as the top personal rate to stop people setting up trusts to avoid paying the top personal rate.”  “If aligned with company tax maybe stop a lot of shuffling around of incomes.” Some suggested that the trusts rate should be progressive with the same thresholds as for personal income tax.  “Trusts should have a progressive tax rate like personal tax does”. About right 47.18% Too low 0.66% Don’t know 12.96% 16 Some acknowledged that trusts have been used inappropriately, although not necessarily in farming (e.g., charitable trusts and family trusts crated to avoid paying for rest-home care).  “It should be applied across the board. I would very much like the "charitable trust" option to be taxed. Too many trusts do not pay taxes and only minimum money is distributed to recipients. It is our biggest tax dodge in NZ”  “Many trusts are set up to avoid taxes and avoid rest home cost”. Should the trusts tax rate continue to be aligned to the top rate of personal income tax? Results Flavour of Comments Yes, the two rates should always be aligned 47.99% Most comments preferred alignment with the company tax rate as well as or instead of the top rate of personal income tax. For example:  “Probably trusts and companies and personal tax should all be the same so people then choose the most suitable rather than how to pay the least amount of tax”.  “Should be aligned with Company Tax rate.” Others suggested the trusts rate should be progressive. For example:  “Trust tax rates should reflect its income”. No, the trusts tax rate should be higher than the top rate of personal income tax 1.68% No, the trusts tax rate should be lower than the top rate of personal income tax 28.73% Don’t know 21.61% 17 4. GOODS & SERVICES TAX The GST rate is 15%. Is this rate: Results Flavour of Comments Too high 19.79% Most comments were that it is about right. For example:  “We're used to it now. If it was lowered would result in too great a reduction in tax take. Would have to be gathered from somewhere else. Raising it would have people scrambling to try and get certain goods exempt, and would lead to unnecessary complications”.  “GST is a very efficient tax and very hard to avoid. It is simple with few exemptions. It has been increased twice already and at 15% it is high enough.” Some were concerned about the current 15% rate’s impact on low income people and suggested it should be reduced. For example:  “12.5% was fairer especially for lower income groups. Lower the rate as opposed to making exemptions.” On the other hand, some thought the rate should be increased, noting it is a good tax because it is hard to avoid and it taxes consumption rather than income. For example:  “If it was higher, say 20%, people on higher incomes cannot minimize their tax as much as they do now and lower income earners could be compensated making a much fairer system”.  “But if we need to increase tax revenue, increase GST and lower the bottom tax rates rather than increase top tax rate. Get the money when we spend it, not when we earn it.” About right 74.72% Too low 2.14% Don’t know 3.34% New Zealand’s GST has very few exceptions and is among the simplest and most efficient in the world. There have been calls to exempt certain ‘basic’ items from GST, such as food. Would you support making basic items, such as food, exempt from GST? Results Flavour of Comments Yes 29.21% Some comments were supportive of the idea of exempting ‘healthy food’ and/or to help lower income people. For example:  “Yes to Healthy food such as fruit and veg not processed food e.g., chips chocolate”  “On whole foods that are not processed e.g., fruit, vegetables or meat.”  “Food is an essential part of life. The cost of living is high as it is.” Even among those that did support the idea a number acknowledged it would be difficult to administer and comply with. For example:  “If it helped improve quality of life for New Zealander's, especially the vulnerable and was easy to administer, but I suspect it would be a nightmare to manage and determine what was exempt and what wasn't.” No 66.25% Don’t know 4.54% 18  “I like the idea, if it made good food options more affordable to people who are struggling financially, but it would be difficult to implement and I am sure there would be debate on which items should be GST exempt etc.” Most comments though were strongly opposed, agreeing that GST is simple and efficient and that it is important to keep it simple and have it apply broadly. They opposed adding what they consider would be too much complexity to the tax system. For example:  “Keep it simple. exemptions will cause great confusion and reduce tax take”  “It would take a lot more government employees to police this at a huge cost. Court cases of whether a particular food should be exempt or not by its presentation. Keep it simple.”  “Where do you draw the line, what is basic necessary items?”  “Let’s keep the tax system simple and efficient. More exemption the more ways of people got to avoid GST. Also more costs for places like supermarkets working out what has GST on and what not. The amount of GST on food is small and not likely to change people's behaviour. There would be many grey areas. GST exempted on apples but not on apple pies”  “It’s a simple system, leave it alone”  “GST is so successful because there are no exemptions. Golden rule of taxation: keep it simple stupid. No exemptions”.  “You've said it, 'simplest and most efficient'. Don't go there.” A number suggested that other government policy should address the problems. For example:  “A far better way is to adjust benefits to the needy.”  “The cost saving would outweigh the systems needed to be put in place to support this system. For people on low incomes/benefits there should be money available to support them”.  “Makes system to complicated with exemptions. Target relief though working for families.” 19 5. ENVIRONMENTAL TAXATION Farmers operate a biological system in the environment. Taxes can be used as both a 'carrot' and a 'stick' to encourage certain environmental practices and outcomes. In terms of the 'carrot' would you support tax incentives such as making capital expenditure on environmental improvements immediately deductible from taxable income? Results Flavour of Comments Yes 84.03% Comments were mostly supportive of using a ‘carrot’ approach, especially if environmental investment and behaviour change is being pushed on farmers by the public and politicians including through regulations.  “Anything to encourage investment into the environment is a no brainer!”  “Land owners need to be recognized for setting property aside for the common good, including environmental. this comes at considerable cost and often loss of future opportunity. Even a mandatory rates deduction as recognition would be of some benefit.”  “I think we need to start finding ways to finance the environmental outcomes society wants, without just keeping on expecting farmers to pick up the tab.”  “I far prefer carrots than sticks as a way to get people positively engaged in environmental initiatives.”  “Areas set aside for riparian planting should get permanent rates relief. It's a gift in effect to the wider local and NZ community from private land owners for the betterment of "community" owned water ways. Farmers should be recognized fiscally for the contribution. Very easy with modern satellite and GPS technology.”  “As the call for environment improvements is getting stronger everyone should contribute i.e. planting waterways and improved effluent systems helps waterways for everyone.”  “A lot of farmers do a lot for the environment out of their own pocket for no financial gain but because they care. A lot of us would do more if we could afford it or were helped out in some way.” There was acknowledgement that some on-farm environmental spending is already able to be deducted, including riparian planting, fencing-off waterways, pest and weed control, etc., but there was some support for it being made more generous.  “It largely is deductible now. I think incentives to grow amenity trees need to be much more than just tax deductible. The city also gains from amenity plantings both in lessening their carbon footprint and in improving their own vistas.”  “I'm sure farmers are getting tax breaks from this expenditure anyway. If farmers are profitable and in the black then farmers will by their very nature make good choices for the environment and be green.” However, a few did not believe environmental spending should be treated any differently from other spending.  “Tax incentives should not be necessary to promote activities that are required by regulation in any case.”  “Environmental improvements should be no different to other capital improvements.” And some were concerned about the possible consequences. For example: No 9.07% Don’t know 6.91% 20  “Not if it is a rob Peter to pay Paul situation. Can't imagine that there would be an introduction of a tax incentive without the introduction of a new tax. Lots of paper shuffling and jobs for administrators and no further ahead.”  “How much are we going to pay compliance people to check out if the capex was for environmental improvement and what criteria would you use to define something that was for environmental improvement?”  “Grey area. Open to manipulation and farmers have enough bad press now. Most environmental works we do with fencing and planting is covered.” In terms of the 'stick' would you support any of the following environmental taxes? (pick as many as you wish) Results Flavour of Comments Tax on water extracted for commercial use, including irrigation 9.11% Most comments were strongly opposed to environmental taxes, the ‘stick’. Many were concerned about additional costs for farming which will put them under financial pressure and could even make it unaffordable to invest in environmental improvements or to make behaviour change. For example:  “Costs are already exorbitant for the farming industry, so adding another tax will do no good for the environment.”  “All of these activities or expenditures are more or less necessary to carry on farming, so a tax on them would add to the cost of farming while having little impact on farming activity or the environment.”  “It’s hard to spend money on environmental improvements if the government takes it off you in taxes!”  “I can’t pass on any costs including taxes.”  “We honestly can't afford to pay anything else! They need to sit down and examine some farm annual accounts. I'm an ex rural manager for ANZ Bank and I know that this is not a feasible option for the majority of farmers!” Others noted that the additional costs would make New Zealand agriculture less internationally competitive. For example:  “Tax on production is unwise. NZ needs to be internationally competitive.”  “The difficulty is if NZ brings in these environmental taxes but other farming countries do not, so we end up transferring production to less efficient (and more environmentally damaging) other countries, such as Brazil. Some regarded the tax options as blunt instruments that would not have the desired effect. This would especially be the case if set nationally. For example: Tax on fertiliser purchased 2.62% Tax on agricultural chemicals purchased 3.54% Tax on energy consumption, such as electricity and fuel 3.12% Tax on ‘modelled’ environmental outputs, such as a tax on nitrogen leaching based on OVERSEER estimate 7.43% None of the above 82.36% 21  “We farm in the Taupo catchment so have effectively had our production levels capped due to the Nitrogen cap through Variation 5 - to add a tax on N discharge on top of that would be incredibly unfair and a huge issue for continued farming in the catchment.”  “Every farm is so different. A stick approach will penalise those who operate in more challenging places.” Many chose to make critical comments on the individual options. A number noted that science is still developing and in particular that OVERSEER is not currently an appropriate tool for regulation (or taxation). For example:  “Overseer is only an estimate and cannot be relied upon to base a tax on.”  “Overseer is an incredibly poorly designed programme and a ridiculous way of measuring nitrogen leeching. It would be disastrous to use this a tax tool as well! It is so open to manipulation.  “Overseer should not be used in a regulatory way. It has a very large variable and put this with someone’s interpretation leads to gross under or over reporting.”  “Overseer is a flawed model with an acknowledged variability of +/-30%.” Some noted that they already pay tax on their farm inputs – GST and (in the case of fuel) excise tax. Electricity and fuels already attract additional cost through the ETS. For example:  “Electricity and fuel are in the ETS.”  We are already taxed on all of our inputs through GST. Water is paid for through farmers’ use of water infrastructure. If agriculture is introduced into ETS this will effectively be a tax against outputs, I'm not sure farms could sustain much more. Some also felt it unfair to pick on farmers when there are major environmental problems in urban areas. For example:  “An environmental tax should be applied to all people urban and rural equally.”  “Tax on urban pollution would be needed to make such a suggestion fair.” However, there were a few supportive comments. For example:  “This moves NZ forward in environmental planning and I believe making these responsible changes in the future of farming increases the quality and reputation of our products.”  “I would support a tax on environmental outputs such as nitrogen leaching once the science around it becomes a lot more robust. I would support a tax on water taken for irrigation in new systems.” 22 Would you support these types of environmental taxes if the revenue were allocated to fund (either through grants schemes or tax incentives): (pick as many as you wish) Results Flavour of Comments Activities to improve water quality, such as planting trees for riparian strips or erosion control, fencing off waterways, stock crossings, stock water reticulation, etc. 30.98% Most comments were negative and along the lines of those made to the previous question. There some strong comments against subsidised farming. For example:  We don't need to follow the northern hemisphere system of farm subsidies disguised as environmental schemes.  “This is a slippery slope. I think that once you become subsidized you are allowing politics and bureaucracy to dictate how we will farm, e.g., UK.”  “This type of activities has a heading towards an EU/UK system, and they are very inefficient.” There were some conditionally supportive comments about the need for money raised being used to fund on-farm initiatives but some expressed opposition to ‘robbing Peter to pay Paul’ or that the wider public should pay for wider public benefit.  “These taxes are for robbing Peter to pay Paul, farmers both.”  “Society as a whole should be contributing, not just the land owner by way of this principle. Suburbia contributes more environmental degradation than the rural counterpart”.  “If the nation wants to support retiring land for environmental reasons then the whole nation should pay, not one sector. Farmers are already doing many of these things and it takes time and a lot of revenue, by adding a tax will slow that down and we know that government run schemes are very costly to administer, therefore wasting a lot of valuable resources that could be utilized to progress all of the above.” Others noted the likely compliance and administration costs, thinking it would be more efficient and effective to leave the money in the hands of farmers.  “Why not just leave the money with the businesses which are already undertaking and continuing to undertake sustainable environmental practices so that they are able to pay for them. Save on a collection and distribution fee.”  “It wouldn’t work. Most of the money would be sucked up in compliance costs, government consultants, etc.”  “Having to apply to a government department for the return of our own tax to spend on environmental improvements is inefficient and a waste of time.”  “Taxing and then allocating funds would not be ideal as this would be wasteful, investment should come from farmers with tax deductibility, rather than having to capitalize and depreciate.”  “After the bureaucrats got their hands on it be lucky to get 10 cents in the dollar back.” Activities to improve indigenous biodiversity, such as weed and pest control, planting and fencing off native bush and wetlands, retiring land from production, etc. 26.30% Activities to improve the protection of natural landscapes that are regarded or designated as 'outstanding' 16.60% Activities to improve on-farm energy efficiency 19.83% Payments which offset (either wholly or more likely in part) the costs farmers face in foregoing the right to undertake some land-use or development on-farm 21.11% No, I would never support environmental taxes 51.15% Don’t know 11.23% 23 There was concern about how these payments would be determined. For example:  “Governments are terrible at ‘picking winners’”.  “Politicians and bureaucrats are well meaning but bloody ignorant of the unintended consequences of feel good, sound nice policies. Look at some of the ridiculous examples of "significant natural landscapes/areas' that cover the country now. Look at Molesworth station history where weeds have taken over every time it has had less commercial focus and not had the state lift it's weed funding.”  “The problem with all of this is the people making decisions as to the 'why and how' are driven by ideology rather than reality, and generally without regard to the economic outcomes from their policy.” There was some (conditional) support for these options:  “Yes if the money went to the area it was generated from, for example Mid Canterbury farmer tax goes to helping farmers make their farms more environmentally friendly not to fixing Christchurch water ways. Plenty of farmers have been doing a fantastic job on their own accord to become more environmentally friendly planting trees and changing irrigation systems to be more effective and productive, newer equipment and better management.”
