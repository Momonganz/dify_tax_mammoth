The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 was enacted on 31 March 2023. The amendments give effect to changes that require operators of electronic marketplaces to collect GST on supplies of “listed services” that include: ▪ ride-sharing and ride-hailing ▪ delivery services for beverages, food, or both, and ▪ taxable accommodation, that are performed, provided or received in New Zealand. The changes take effect on 1 April 2024 unless otherwise stated. Following enactment of the GST rules for listed services in March 2023, additional changes have been made to ensure the rules are workable and consistent with the policy intent. These changes were included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023–24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Act 2024, which was enacted on 29 March 2024, and include: ▪ rules to address circumstances when a person, referred to as a “listing intermediary”, is interposed between an underlying supplier of taxable accommodation and the operator of an electronic marketplace ▪ adjustment rules for the flat-rate credit that will enable marketplace operators and listing intermediaries to self-correct errors related to the calculation of the flat-rate credit ▪ ensuring the value of the flat-rate credit is not reduced when marketplace operators provide a discount for listed services ▪ only allowing non-individual persons with sales greater than $500,000 in a 12-month period to choose to remain responsible for their own GST obligations ▪ a clarification to ensure that marketplace operators and listing intermediaries are able to recover their output tax liabilities on supplies they are treated as making from underlying suppliers without this giving rise to additional GST liabilities ▪ a transitional rule to ensure that marketplace operators and listing intermediaries do not have to account for GST on contracts for taxable accommodation entered into before 1 April 2024, and GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 4 of 68 ▪ other minor and technical amendments to ensure the legislation reflects the policy intent. These changes are explained in this report. For general enquiries not covered by the guidance included in this special report, email: platformeconomy@ird.govt.nz. All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) unless otherwise stated. Key features Scope of the GST rules for listed services From 1 April 2024, the supply of “listed services” made through an electronic marketplace will be subject to GST whether the person providing the services through the electronic marketplace is registered for GST or not. The new rules will require operators of electronic marketplaces to collect and return GST on supplies of listed services they are treated as making. Marketplace operators will only be required to collect and return GST on supplies of listed services if their total supplies in New Zealand including the listed services exceed, or are expected to exceed, the GST registration threshold of NZ$60,000 in a 12-month period. The following services, which are further explained later in this report, are included within the scope of “listed services”: ▪ accommodation other than accommodation that would be exempt under the GST Act ▪ ride-sharing and ride-hailing services ▪ delivery services for food, beverages, or both, provided that these services are performed, provided or received in New Zealand. The new rules apply to marketplace operators regardless of their residence for GST purposes. This means that resident and non-resident marketplace operators need to consider GST registration if they enable the supply of listed services. Flat-rate credit scheme A flat-rate credit scheme that requires marketplace operators to pass on a proportion of the GST collected on supplies of listed services to underlying suppliers that are not registered for GST, has been introduced. The flat-rate credit scheme provides a “credit” to underlying suppliers who are not required to be registered for GST because their total supplies are GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 5 of 68 below the GST registration threshold. This is intended to recognise the GST incurred by unregistered underlying suppliers on goods and services used to make supplies of listed services. Standard GST registration is available for underlying suppliers that do not have to be registered for GST and do not want to apply the flat-rate credit scheme. The flat-rate credit was determined with reference to the average amount of input tax that GST-registered suppliers of listed services recovered. It is not intended to recognise GST on capital assets such as land or vehicles used to make supplies of listed services. This is because a person that supplies listed services, and who is not registered for GST, would not account for output tax on the disposal of such assets. For underlying suppliers that are registered for GST, they will continue accounting for input tax on their expenses in their own GST returns. They will no longer be responsible for accounting for GST output tax on supplies of listed services as this will be done by marketplace operators unless the underlying supplier has opted out of the marketplace rules. Opting out of the marketplace rules New provisions enable certain underlying suppliers to opt out of the marketplace rules. The effect of opting out of the marketplace rules means that underlying suppliers, instead of marketplace operators, would continue to be responsible for accounting for GST on supplies of listed services. Some GST-registered underlying suppliers with larger-scale operations can opt out of marketplace rules provided they meet certain criteria. Agreement will be required between marketplace operators and underlying suppliers who choose to opt out of the rules in some circumstances. In other circumstances, underlying suppliers with more significant operations will be able to unilaterally opt out of the marketplace rules by notifying the marketplace operator. If an underlying supplier opts out of the marketplace rules, they choose to remain responsible for their own GST obligations in respect of supplies they make through electronic marketplaces. The provisions enabling underlying suppliers to opt out of the rules came into force on 1 April 2023 to enable these rules to be used ahead of the other rules applying from 1 April 2024. Listing intermediaries Legislative changes made in March 2024 introduce new rules for “listing intermediaries” to supplement the electronic marketplace rules to ensure that the rules for listed services GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 6 of 68 (particularly the flat-rate credit scheme for unregistered underlying suppliers) work effectively. In situations where a property manager or agent for an underlying supplier of taxable accommodation enters into an agreement with an operator of an electronic marketplace to list accommodation on behalf of underlying suppliers, the electronic marketplace rules may not work appropriately on their own because the marketplace operator might not have any information about the underlying supplier that is necessary for administering the flat-rate credit scheme. In this situation, the property manager or agent (referred to as a “listing intermediary”) will be responsible for all requirements related to the flat-rate credit (instead of those obligations being on the marketplace operator). The listing intermediary will also be treated as making a zero-rated supply of the accommodation provided by the underlying supplier to the marketplace operator, unless they are able to agree with the marketplace operator that they are liable for GST at the 15% rate on supplies of taxable accommodation. Certain conditions apply to determine whether the listing intermediary is eligible to enter into such an agreement. Consequential amendments The marketplace rules for listed services are based on existing rules in the GST Act that apply to marketplace operators. These rules have been present in the GST Act since 1 October 2016 when the rules for GST on remote services were introduced. They were expanded on 1 December 2019 with the introduction of GST on distantly taxable goods. Amendments have been made to the rules for electronic marketplaces, where appropriate, to ensure that those same rules continue to apply to marketplace operators that are treated as suppliers of listed services. Background GST is a broad-based consumption tax that applies to the supply of most goods and services made in New Zealand. To ensure GST remains simple, fair, and efficient, a fundamental principle of New Zealand’s GST system is that GST should apply to all consumption that occurs in New Zealand. GST came into force in New Zealand in October 1986 before the introduction of e-commerce and the growth and popularity of the internet. Since then, the scope of GST has been expanded to apply in circumstances not originally envisaged when GST was introduced. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 7 of 68 Changes were made in 2016 to ensure that GST applied to cross-border supplies of “remote services”. This included remote services that are supplied through electronic marketplaces such as app sales through app stores. Changes were also made in 2019 to ensure that GST applied to supplies of certain imported goods. These changes included requirements that operators of electronic marketplaces – instead of the seller on the marketplace – would become liable for collecting and returning GST on goods supplied through the marketplace to a consumer providing a delivery address in New Zealand. These changes were both premised on the principles of maintaining a broad-based GST system, under which GST applied to the broadest possible range of goods and services in New Zealand, and of promoting and protecting the sustainability of the GST base. The application of GST to these cross-border supplies of goods and services also removed distortions that arose when GST was typically being collected by those that provided the same goods and services within New Zealand. These prior reforms followed consideration and consultation by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In April 2021, the OECD published its report The Impact of the Growth of the Sharing and Gig Economy on VAT/GST Policy and Administration. This report outlined a range of options that jurisdictions could implement depending on their overarching policy objectives with its VAT/GST system. One option considered in this report is introducing rules requiring platform operators to collect and return GST on supplies of goods and services they enable sellers to make under a “deemed supplier” or “full liability regime” model. The Government enacted rules broadly aligned with this option as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 and following the Government discussion document The role of digital platforms in the taxation of the gig and sharing economy, which was published in March 2022. Effective date The amendments incorporating “listed services” into the GST Act generally take effect on 1 April 2024. The amendments enabling underlying suppliers to opt out of the marketplace rules, provided criteria are met, have effect from 1 April 2023, being the day after the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 received the Royal assent (31 March 2023). This includes the amendments enabling the Commissioner of GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 8 of 68 Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) to issue determinations that set out the criteria a person must meet before they can enter an opt-out agreement with a marketplace operator. Transitional rule for taxable accommodation In March 2024, the Government introduced a transitional rule that ensures listing intermediaries and operators of electronic marketplaces do not have to account for GST on contracts for taxable accommodation entered into before 1 April 2024, provided certain conditions are met. The transitional rule will apply where the relevant supplies under those contracts are made on or after 1 April 2024. For more information see "Transitional rule for taxable accommodation” on page 54. Key terms There are several terms that have a specific meaning under these new rules. Listed services – The services listed in section 8C(2) of the GST Act. The following services are included within the scope of “listed services”: ▪ accommodation other than accommodation that would be GST-exempt ▪ ride-sharing/ride-hailing services ▪ delivery services for food, beverages, or both, where these services are performed, provided or received in New Zealand. Further information about the scope of “listed services” is included on pages 9 to 13 of this special report. Underlying supplier – The person who would be the supplier of taxable accommodation, ride-sharing/ride-hailing, or food or beverage delivery services for GST purposes (and would therefore be responsible for returning GST on the services to Inland Revenue) in the absence of a specific provision of the GST Act deeming another person (such as the operator of an electronic marketplace) to be the supplier of those services. Generally, this refers to an accommodation host, driver, or deliverer who makes the supply of services to the consumer, using an electronic marketplace to find buyers for their services. Accommodation host or host – The person who would be the supplier of accommodation services, ignoring the effect of the marketplace rules that treat the operator of the marketplace as the supplier. This will generally be the owner of the land or property that is used to provide accommodation but could also include the person responsible for the operation of a hotel or motel, for example. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 9 of 68 Electronic marketplace – Defined in section 2(1) as a marketplace that is operated by electronic means through which a person (the underlying supplier) makes a supply of goods, or of remote services by electronic means, or of listed services, through another person (the operator of the marketplace) to a third person (the recipient). It includes a website, internet portal, gateway, store, distribution platform, or other similar marketplace but it does not include a marketplace that solely processes payments. Marketplace rules – Rules that require operators of electronic marketplaces to account for GST on supplies they are treated as making. These rules apply where an underlying supplier provides listed services through an electronic marketplace to another person (the recipient). Instead of the underlying supplier accounting for GST on the supply of listed services, it is the marketplace operator that accounts for GST on the supply. The supplier, if registered for GST, will be treated as making a zero-rated supply to the marketplace operator and would therefore account for GST on the supply at the rate of 0% (or, in other words, the underlying supplier should include the value of the supply in the “Zero-rated supplies” box in its GST return). Listing intermediary – Defined in section 60CB(8) as a person who lists taxable accommodation services on an electronic marketplace on behalf of an underlying supplier who makes those supplies through the electronic marketplace. The definition also requires that the person enters into an agreement with the marketplace operator to list or advertise the services provided by the underlying supplier. Flat-rate credit – Input tax that must be deducted by the operator of an electronic marketplace that is treated as the supplier of listed services where the underlying supplier has not notified the marketplace operator that they are registered for GST. Section 20(3N) sets out the prescribed rate of the flat-rate credit. For a supply of taxable accommodation, ride-sharing/ride-hailing, or delivery services for food and beverages, as at the date of publication of this special report, the prescribed rate is 8.5% of the value of the supply. The marketplace operator must pass this on to the underlying supplier. Where a listing intermediary is interposed between the underlying supplier of the listed services and the operator of the electronic marketplace, the listing intermediary will be treated as though they are the operator of the electronic marketplace for the flat-rate credit. This means that if the underlying supplier has not notified the listing intermediary that they are registered for GST, the listing intermediary (instead of the marketplace operator) must deduct input tax for the flat-rate credit and pass this on to the underlying supplier. The listing intermediary will also be required to provide the monthly statement to the underlying supplier. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 10 of 68 Detailed analysis Scope of the GST rules for listed services Sections 2(1) definitions of “electronic marketplace”, “flat-rate credit”, “listed services”, 8(3), 8C, 10(6B), 60C and 60CB(8) of the GST Act The definition of “electronic marketplace” in section 2(1) is amended to reflect the different types of goods and services that can be provided through an electronic marketplace by an underlying supplier. The definition now sets out that an electronic marketplace is a marketplace operated by electronic means through which another person (an “underlying supplier”) may make a supply of certain goods or services through the operator of the marketplace to a recipient of those goods and services. Those goods and services include a supply of remote services, distantly taxable goods, and listed services. The concept of an electronic marketplace remains unchanged, which is essentially an electronic medium that matches buyers and sellers, or allows them to interact, to facilitate the sale and purchase of goods and services. It includes a website, internet portal, gateway, store, distribution platform, or other similar marketplace and excludes a marketplace that solely processes payments. For these rules to apply, there must be an arrangement that involves an underlying supplier providing services through an electronic marketplace to a recipient. In circumstances where the recipient of the services contracts directly with a person and there is no third-party operator of an electronic marketplace involved, the marketplace rules for listed services will not apply. The GST treatment of the supply of these services will depend on whether the supplier of the services is registered for GST. New defined terms have been inserted for “flat-rate credit” and “listed services”. The flat-rate credit refers to the deduction a marketplace operator or listing intermediary is required to take as input tax, and that must be passed on to underlying suppliers that are not registered for GST in recognition of the GST on goods and services they use to make supplies of listed services. The definition of “listed services” refers to those services set out in section 8C(2). Listed services are not set out in the Interpretation provision of the GST Act and are instead set out in section 8C. Section 60CB(8) defines the term "listing intermediary” as a person who lists services described in section 8C(2)(a) on an electronic marketplace on behalf of an underlying supplier who makes those supplies through the electronic marketplace. The definition also GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 11 of 68 requires that the person enters into an agreement with the marketplace operator to list or advertise the services provided by the underlying supplier. Section 8C sets out the substantive rules for listed services and signposts to other provisions in the GST Act that are relevant. The “listed services” are: ▪ accommodation other than accommodation that would be GST-exempt (section 8C(2)(a)) ▪ ride-sharing and ride-hailing services (section 8C(2)(b)(i)), and ▪ delivery services for food, beverages, or both (section 8C(2)(b)(ii)). Section 8C(7) expands the scope of listed services to include services that are closely connected with these services that are advertised, listed, or otherwise made available through an electronic marketplace. Accommodation other than accommodation that would be GST-exempt Included in the definition of “listed services” is accommodation other than accommodation that is exempt from GST under section 14(1)(c). Accommodation is exempt under section 14(1)(c) if it is accommodation provided in a dwelling that is used by the person as their principal place of residence and for which they have rights of quiet enjoyment. All other forms of accommodation provided in New Zealand are taxable, usually at 15%. This includes short-term rental and visitor accommodation. However, the GST Act includes special rules for supplies of certain domestic goods and services provided during a stay of more than four weeks in a “commercial dwelling”. These rules provide for a special tax rate of 9% on these supplies. Section 10(6B) overrides these special rules when accommodation is supplied through an electronic marketplace. This is because it would be impractical for marketplace operators to identify whether the listed services would qualify as domestic goods or services supplied during a stay in a commercial dwelling or another type of taxable accommodation. Therefore, all accommodation services provided through an electronic marketplace (other than exempt accommodation) will be subject to GST at the standard rate of 15% where it is provided or received in New Zealand. For the avoidance of doubt, this also includes accommodation in a room provided to a guest in a host’s principal place of residence (that is, their own home). In these circumstances, the room being provided to the guest is not the guest’s principal place of residence, nor would the guest have rights of quiet enjoyment. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 12 of 68 It will generally be straightforward to determine whether accommodation has been provided or received in New Zealand. This is because underlying suppliers of accommodation in New Zealand will provide the marketplace operator through which accommodation is provided with the address of the property where the accommodation is provided. A person that owns a property in which taxable accommodation is provided through an electronic marketplace may engage the services of a property manager to manage the property, for example holiday house rentals or apartments with management rights arrangements. In such circumstances, it will generally be the case that the person that is supplying the accommodation through the electronic marketplace will be the owner of the property and not the property manager. This means that the owner of the property is the underlying supplier. In some circumstances, the rules for listing intermediaries may apply. This is likely to be the case when the property manager enters into a contractual arrangement in their own name with the marketplace operator to list accommodation on an electronic marketplace on behalf of the property owner. These rules are discussed further at “Listing intermediaries” on page 44. In some situations, such as motels, a person (the lessee) may purchase a business lease from the freehold property owner (the lessor) and will run the accommodation business. In this situation, the lessee is supplying the accommodation through an electronic marketplace. It is therefore the lessee who is the underlying supplier, not the lessor. The disposal of property used to provide accommodation through an electronic marketplace is not a listed service. Ride-sharing and ride-hailing The definition of ride-sharing and ride-hailing services is set out in section 8C(8). It sets out that these services are provided through an electronic marketplace that involves the engagement of a personal driver to transport a person to their chosen destination. Ride-sharing and ride-hailing services therefore would not include services where the travel route is pre-determined by the supplier such as a bus route, a ferry service, cruise, or flight between certain destinations. In these cases, the passenger is not usually able to direct the driver towards a particular place, destination, or route. The passenger will also not usually have control over both the time and the destination. Many types of transportation services involve the customer purchasing a service directly from a GST-registered supplier of transportation services, such as a bus company or boat GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 13 of 68 charter. In these cases, the services are not provided through an electronic marketplace so the rules for marketplace operators do not apply. This is because the rules for marketplace operators apply only where there is an underlying supplier (of, for example, a listed service), a marketplace operator, and a recipient of the services. In a situation where a person contracts directly with the supplier of the services, there is no marketplace operator involved. Delivery services for food and/or beverages The transportation of beverages, food, or both these goods is included as a listed service. This does not include the supply of beverages or food itself. It is only the delivery services that are included in the definition. The marketplace rules for listed services will not apply in circumstances where a business enters a contract with a person for the delivery of food and/or beverages, and that business engages the services of an independent contractor or an employee to carry out the delivery services. This is because in such circumstances the business is the supplier of the services (and not the independent contractor or the employee). GST will usually already apply to these services because the person providing them will generally be registered for GST. In contrast, where a person uses an electronic marketplace operated by a third party to enter a contractual relationship with other persons for food and/or beverage delivery services, the marketplace rules for listed services will usually treat the marketplace operator as the supplier of these services for GST purposes. It will therefore be the marketplace operator with the obligation to return GST on the services to Inland Revenue and not the deliverer. Example 1: Delivery services for food provided but not through an electronic marketplace Andraya’s Eats Ltd carries on a business of delivering restaurant meals to customers via its app. Andraya’s Eats Ltd is registered for GST and GST applies to its services. Andraya’s Eats Ltd’s business model involves arranging for independent contractors to undertake the delivery of restaurant meals to Andraya’s Eats Ltd’s customers. There is no contractual relationship between the independent contractors and Andraya’s Eats Ltd’s customers. The rules for marketplace operators do not apply because Andraya’s Eats Ltd is not an electronic marketplace. This is because the independent contractors that provide delivery services are not providing delivery services under any direct contractual GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 14 of 68 agreement with Andraya’s Eats Ltd’s customers. The independent contractors are instead providing services to Andraya’s Eats Ltd. Andraya’s Eats Ltd should continue to return GST under the standard GST rules. Closely connected services Section 8C(7) expands the scope of listed services to include services that are closely connected with a “listed service” referred to in section 8C(2). This means that marketplace operators are required to account for GST on these services if these services are advertised, listed, or otherwise made available through the electronic marketplace. This is intended to include services that are ancillary to the listed service, such as cleaning, where a fee is charged for such services as part of the overall supply of a listed service made through an electronic marketplace. Example 2: Cleaning services Jenny seeks accommodation on Waiheke Island for an upcoming holiday. She wants to stay in a holiday home on the beachfront and uses an electronic marketplace that offers accommodation to find a suitable place to stay. Geoff provides accommodation in his property through the electronic marketplace. Jenny pays a nightly rate to the electronic marketplace. Jenny is also charged a cleaning fee at the end of her stay. The electronic marketplace collects the cleaning fee as part of the total consideration that it collects from Jenny. The marketplace operator would be required to account for GST on the cleaning fee as it corresponds to a service that is closely connected with taxable accommodation, which is a listed service. Although cleaning services are a common example, the phrase “closely connected services” is intended to be broad and capture all services that are closely connected to the listed services and that are advertised, listed or otherwise made available through the electronic marketplace. An exception to the rule exists for closely connected services that are supplied by a marketplace operator to the recipient of the listed service. This is because the services are separate to the services provided by the underlying supplier. This is intended to exclude GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 15 of 68 services such as a foreign exchange reserve that a marketplace operator may provide its customers. Example 3: Reserving a foreign exchange rate David is overseas-based and is looking for accommodation in New Zealand for an upcoming holiday. He uses an electronic marketplace for these purposes. The marketplace operator offers a service to its customers that enables them to lock in a foreign exchange rate. David is not sure when he will visit New Zealand but wants to reserve the foreign exchange rate that is available to him at the time he is browsing for accommodation. This service is not closely connected with the supply of a listed service because the service is offered directly by the marketplace operator to David. The marketplace operator would not account for GST on the supply of this service under the rules for listed services. It may need to account for GST on the supply of this service to David under other GST rules. A service would not be considered closely connected with a listed service if the service did not arise because of the listed service itself. The effect of this is that services which are not ancillary to a listed service, such as rental vehicle hire or a tourist attraction, would not be included within the scope of listed services and the marketplace operator would not account for GST on these supplies under the rules for listed services. When marketplace operators are treated as suppliers Amended section 60C provides that the operator of an electronic marketplace is treated as the supplier of listed services if the marketplace operator: ▪ authorises a charge for the supply of listed services to the recipient ▪ authorises the delivery of the supply of listed services to the recipient, and/or ▪ sets a term or condition under which the supply of listed services is made, whether directly or indirectly. This applies whether the marketplace operator is a resident or non-resident for GST purposes in New Zealand. It also applies whether the underlying supplier of the listed services is a resident or a non-resident for GST purposes in New Zealand. These are the same tests that apply to determine whether a marketplace operator is treated as the supplier of remote services supplied in New Zealand. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 16 of 68 Marketplace operators will not be treated as the supplier of listed services if none of these tests are met. This means that a person that runs a website that contains a messaging board enabling a person to list properties available for rent may not be a marketplace operator. The following explains in more detail what is meant by “authorise the charge for the supply” and “directly or indirectly set a term or condition under which the supply is made”. Meaning of “authorise the charge for the supply” The meaning of “authorise the charge for the supply to the recipient” is broad, covering the situation where the marketplace authorises the charge on behalf of the underlying supplier of the services or as a processing agent for the underlying supplier. However, providers that only process payments are excluded from the definition of “electronic marketplace”. An electronic marketplace authorises the charge to the recipient if it communicates the liability to pay to the customer, or otherwise influences whether or when the customer pays for the supply. This may be done by initiating the process through which the recipient is charged and includes situations where the marketplace connects the recipient to a third- party payment processor who receives the marketplace operator’s instruction. To authorise the charge, it is not necessary for the marketplace operator to collect or receive the payment, or be involved in each of the steps in the payment authorisation process. Meaning of “directly or indirectly set a term or condition under which the supply is made” The meaning of “directly or indirectly set a term or condition under which the supply is made” is very broad. This concept looks beyond the formal contractual relationship to the influence exercised by the marketplace operator. The marketplace operator does not need to have any direct involvement in determining the contractual arrangements between underlying suppliers and buyers using the marketplace to be responsible for GST on supplies. A requirement for underlying suppliers to comply with the marketplace’s listing policies will in many cases mean that the marketplace does (at least indirectly) set a term or condition under which the supply is made, meaning that the marketplace operator will be responsible for GST on the supply. However, this may not be true in all cases and will depend on what the marketplace’s specific listing policies are. The “directly or indirectly” test is a proxy for the level of control or influence the marketplace operator has over the sale and any post-sales processes, such as customer complaints and refunds. A mere requirement that listings comply with New Zealand’s regulatory GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 17 of 68 requirements or, for example, that listings do not contain offensive language is not sufficient to meet this test. However, there are several marketplace listing policies that will meet this test, including: ▪ The offer, acceptance, payment, or delivery of the services is to be communicated through the marketplace. ▪ The underlying supplier must accept one or more specific payment methods. ▪ The marketplace operator has the right to withhold the recipient’s payment from the underlying supplier until the contractual performance of the services is completed. ▪ Use of the marketplace’s grievance or dispute management procedures for underlying suppliers and recipients. ▪ The marketplace operator has the right to set the price for which listed services are sold. ▪ Underlying suppliers are required to meet particular performance requirements, such as requiring them to maintain a minimum customer rating to supply listed services on the marketplace. ▪ Underlying suppliers are required to display a rating based on stipulated behaviours relating to that underlying supplier’s conduct. In practice this means there will be very limited circumstances where an electronic marketplace operator will not be responsible for GST on supplies of listed services though the marketplace. Example 4: Marketplace operator treated as the supplier of taxable accommodation Chaz Intermediaries Ltd is a New Zealand tax resident and runs a website that connects accommodation hosts with guests. Hosts create an account on the website where they can upload photographs of their property, list dates that the property is available, and set a nightly rate. Chaz Intermediaries Ltd offers this service for a fee that it charges hosts. Guests can book properties that are listed by hosts provided the property is available. Chaz Intermediaries Ltd connects the guest to a third-party payment processing portal which processes the payment for the booking. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 18 of 68 Because Chaz Intermediaries Ltd authorises the charge for the supply of taxable accommodation, it is treated as the supplier of the accommodation to the guests. Example 5: Website enables accommodation booking – website operator not a marketplace operator Kraymond’s List Ltd developed a smartphone app that lets users post community notices and classified advertisements for a small upfront listing fee. Several short-term accommodation hosts list properties available for rent on it. Guests can use the app to communicate with the hosts directly, although there are no rules preventing hosts and guests from communicating via other mediums such as email, phone, or other messaging apps, nor from posting links to listings on third-party websites. Hosts manage property bookings directly, often through the messaging service offered by the app. Guests typically pay the hosts a deposit via internet banking transfer before staying in the property, and at the end of their stay, pay the balance of the booking. However, hosts can set their own policies as to whether they require a deposit to be paid upfront and, if so, how much the deposit is. Aside from removing listings that are fraudulent or offensive, Kraymond’s List Ltd does not moderate listings or intervene in disputes between hosts and guests. Kraymond’s List Ltd does not set any terms or conditions under which the supply of accommodation is made. It also does not authorise the charge for the supply of the accommodation. It is therefore not treated as the supplier of accommodation. Listed services before 1 April 2024 The marketplace rules for listed services take effect on 1 April 2024. This means if a listed service is supplied through an electronic marketplace before 1 April 2024, the marketplace operator is not treated as the supplier of the services, and it would not account for GST on the sale of the services. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 19 of 68 Example 6: Listed services purchased before 1 April 2024 Gerard and Nicole are based overseas. They purchase accommodation in New Zealand through an electronic marketplace in March 2024. The accommodation is booked for June 2024. The marketplace operator is not treated as the supplier of the accommodation, and it therefore does not account for GST on the sale. There are no special rules that determine the time of supply for listed services. The time of supply for listed services will therefore generally be the earlier of the time an invoice 1 is issued, or a payment is received, for the supply. While there are no special rules that determine the time of supply for listed services, a transitional rule exists for contracts for taxable accommodation that were entered into before 1 April 2024. This transitional rule is explained under “Transitional rule for taxable accommodation” on page 54. When a supply of listed services is made through multiple electronic marketplaces Section 60C(3) contains an ordering rule to determine which marketplace operator is treated as the supplier when there is more than one marketplace operator involved in a single supply of listed services. Under this rule, it is the first marketplace operator that authorises the charge for the listed service or receives the consideration for the supply of the listed service that is treated as the supplier. When a marketplace operator is treated as the supplier of listed services, sections 8C(3) and 60(1C) apply. Under these rules: ▪ The person that provides the services through the electronic marketplace (the underlying supplier) is treated as having supplied those listed services to the operator of the electronic marketplace. These services are zero-rated under section 11A(1)(jc) and the underlying supplier therefore does not collect output tax on this supply. ▪ The operator of the marketplace receives the services from the underlying supplier and does not claim input tax for the services because the supply is zero-rated. The marketplace operator is also treated as supplying those same services to the recipient 1 This is a document notifying an obligation to make payment. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 20 of 68 of the services. The supply of these services is standard rated where the services are performed, provided or received in New Zealand. This means the marketplace operator is required to account for GST on the supply it is treated as making. The obligation for the marketplace operator to account for GST on the supply it is treated as making applies in all circumstances provided the relevant tests are met (see “When marketplace operators are treated as suppliers” on page 15. Whether a person is considered an operator of an electronic marketplace through which an underlying supplier makes a supply of listed services will depend on the specific facts. For instance, automated inventory tracking systems such as those used in the accommodation industry 2 or payment processing systems, would not be considered electronic marketplaces in and of themselves. How marketplace operators account for GST on supplies of listed services they are treated as making Section 8C(3) provides that section 60(1C) applies when a supply of listed services is made through an electronic marketplace. The effect of this is that, for a supply of listed services: ▪ The underlying supplier is treated as making a supply to the operator of the electronic marketplace and this supply is zero-rated (under section 11A(1)(jc)) if the underlying supplier is GST-registered, or if the underlying supplier is not GST- registered the supply is not subject to GST. ▪ The marketplace operator is treated as making this same supply, with the addition of GST at the standard rate of 15%, to the recipient of the listed services. Where a marketplace operator has an agreement that entitles the underlying supplier to the consideration paid by the recipient of the listed services, it will need to consider whether its contracts need to be altered to allow it to retain, and own, enough of the funds paid by the customer so it can fund its GST liability in respect of the listed services. For GST purposes, this would mean that the consideration paid for the supply that is treated as being made by the marketplace operator to the recipient of the listed services is more than the consideration paid by the marketplace operator for the deemed supply of listed services made by the underlying supplier to the marketplace operator under section 60C(1)(a). In such a situation, paying GST to Inland Revenue does not give rise to additional 2 For example, a Central Reservation System or Computerised Reservation System (CRS), or a Global Distribution System (GDS). GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 21 of 68 consideration for facilitation services the underlying supplier receives from the marketplace operator. Example 7: GST on a supply of listed services where marketplace operator is treated as supplier A supply of listed services with a value of $115 including GST is made through an electronic marketplace. For GST purposes, the marketplace operator is treated as the supplier under section 60C. The parties have agreed the marketplace operator is entitled to retain enough of the funds from the recipient of the listed services to fund its GST liability (in this situation, $15). Therefore, the value of the supply from the perspective of the underlying supplier is $100. This applies whether the underlying supplier is GST-registered or not. If the underlying supplier is GST-registered, they would account for output tax on the supply at the rate of 0%. GST does not apply if the underlying supplier is not registered for GST. The marketplace operator can use $15 of the $115 paid by the recipient of the listed services to satisfy its GST liability. The remaining $100, the GST-exclusive value of the listed services, is payable to the underlying supplier for its deemed supply to the marketplace operator. 3 For GST purposes, where a marketplace operator or listing intermediary recovers or deducts an amount from a payment due to the underlying supplier and uses this amount to satisfy its output tax liability for the supply it is treated as making, this does not give rise to any GST implications. This is because section 60C(3B) and (3C) provides that no consideration arises for the collected amount in this situation under the GST Act. When services are performed, provided or received in New Zealand The GST Act has rules that determine where the place of supply for goods or services is. The general rules stipulate that goods or services are deemed to be supplied in New Zealand if 3 For simplicity, this example ignores the fees charged by marketplace operators for providing facilitation services to underlying suppliers. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 22 of 68 the supplier is a resident in New Zealand, and goods and services are deemed to be supplied outside New Zealand if the supplier is a non-resident. These rules are contained in section 8. Amendments to section 8 override the general rules. The amendments (to section 8(3)(c) and new section 8(3)(d)) ensure that a supply of listed services that is performed, provided or received in New Zealand is treated as a supply made in New Zealand and will therefore be subject to GST. This applies even if the underlying supplier of a listed service is a non- resident (such could be the case for accommodation provided in New Zealand, as the underlying landowner could be a non-resident) or the marketplace operator is a non- resident. Unlike the rules for remote services and distantly taxable goods, there are no special rules that enable a different GST treatment for listed services. This means that they will always be subject to GST at the standard rate when they are performed, provided or received in New Zealand. It also does not matter if the recipient of the services is a non-resident. For example, a non-resident tourist staying in accommodation in New Zealand would be required to pay GST on their accommodation. There are also no special rules that apply to determine whether listed services are “performed, provided, or received” in New Zealand. The ordinary meaning of these terms will apply to determine whether the services are listed services that would be subject to GST when provided through an electronic marketplace. GST treatment of facilitation services and commissions related to listed services Marketplace operators typically charge underlying suppliers a fee for facilitation services related to the supply of listed services, often in the form of a commission on the sale. “Facilitation services” involve connecting underlying suppliers with buyers. The GST treatment of facilitation services will be subject to the ordinary GST rules if the supplier of the services (being the marketplace operator) is a tax resident in New Zealand. In this situation, the facilitation services will be subject to GST at the standard rate, regardless of whether the recipient (the underlying supplier of listed services) is registered for GST. The GST rules for remote services apply to determine the GST treatment of facilitation services supplied by a person who is a non-resident for GST purposes. In this case, a supply of facilitation services is subject to GST at the standard rate if the supply is to a New Zealand-resident person who is not registered for GST. Under these rules, GST does not normally apply if the recipient of the services is a GST-registered person, although the marketplace operator can choose in this situation to treat the supply as zero-rated. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 23 of 68 The following example sets out how GST applies in a situation where a marketplace operator is: ▪ treated as the supplier of listed services to a recipient (where GST applies at the standard rate of 15% if the services are performed, provided or received in New Zealand), and ▪ supplying separate facilitation services to the underlying supplier of the listed services. Example 8: Marketplace operator supplying facilitation services to a GST- registered underlying supplier and treated as supplying listed services to another person 2K’s Ride Services (2KRS) is an electronic marketplace through which underlying suppliers make supplies of listed services. It is not resident in New Zealand for GST purposes. Wiremu provides ride-sharing services through 2KRS. He is registered for GST and has notified 2KRS of his GST registration. Richeile also provides ride-sharing services through 2KRS and has notified the marketplace operator she is not registered for GST. 2KRS has an agreement with drivers that use 2KRS’s app that entitles it to retain 20% of the total GST-exclusive fare for ride-sharing services that drivers supply to passengers using 2KRS’s app. This 20% fee is the amount 2KRS charges for its facilitation services. Two passengers purchase rides from Wiremu and Richeile through 2KRS for $57.50 including GST (a GST-exclusive value of $50). Facilitation services Because Wiremu is GST-registered, 2KRS can choose whether the facilitation services ($10) it provides to Wiremu are treated as supplied outside New Zealand, in which case, there are no associated GST obligations with the supply. Alternatively, it can choose to treat the supply of facilitation services as zero-rated, in which case it would include this in its GST return (in the “Zero-rated supplies” box). Because Richeile has notified 2KRS she is not registered for GST, 2KRS is required to account for GST on the supply of its facilitation services to Richeile. It must include the GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 24 of 68 facilitation services supplied to Richeile in the “Total sales and income” box of its GST return. Listed services 2KRS is required to account for GST on the supply of listed services it is treated as making (that is, the rides provided by Wiremu and Richeile to their passengers). The value of the listed service ($50) is not reduced by the value of the facilitation services ($10) supplied by 2KRS to Wiremu or Richeile. Adjustments for supplies of listed services The amendments treat the marketplace operator, instead of the underlying supplier, as the supplier of listed services. It follows that when adjustments for inaccuracies need to be made, marketplace operators will need to apply the rules as if they were the supplier of services, even though another person (an underlying supplier) is the contractual supplier of the services. This means that, in these circumstances, it is the marketplace operators (instead of the underlying suppliers) that must provide the supply correction information to the recipient and make the adjustments. Section 25 applies when a GST-registered supplier returns too much or too little GST because of either a mistake, subsequent alteration to, or cancellation of a supply. This includes instances where, for example, the previously agreed consideration has been reduced through the offer of a discount or refund (whether partial or in full). In the situation where a marketplace operator has returned too much or too little GST to Inland Revenue as the result of an inaccuracy referred to in section 25(1) (such as an incorrect amount of consideration), section 25(2) provides that it should make an adjustment in its GST return when it is apparent that too much or too little GST has been returned. In the situation where there is an alteration to or cancellation of a supply of listed services, section 19NB also requires the marketplace operator to provide supply correction information to the recipient of the supply. GST-registered underlying suppliers In most situations, the marketplace rules for listed services apply regardless of the underlying supplier’s GST registration status. This means that for any listed services provided through an electronic marketplace, it is the operator of the marketplace that is responsible for collecting and paying GST to Inland Revenue. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 25 of 68 In limited circumstances, certain underlying suppliers can opt out of the marketplace rules. This enables them to continue accounting for GST on supplies of listed services they make through an electronic marketplace by including the supplies in their own GST returns. See “Opting out of marketplace rules” on page 38. GST-registered underlying suppliers will continue providing their own GST returns. They will need to keep a record of what supplies are made through an electronic marketplace and what supplies are made directly to their customers. This is because the supply of listed services made through an electronic marketplace is zero-rated under section 11A(1)(jc) and therefore must be included in the “Zero-rated supplies” box in the GST return. Other supplies will continue being accounted for in the usual way. GST-registered underlying suppliers will purchase or acquire goods and services they use to make supplies of listed services through an electronic marketplace. The process for deducting input tax for these goods and services does not change. GST-registered underlying suppliers will continue to deduct input tax on their expenses in their own GST returns in the usual way. Example 9: Accounting for sales and expenses associated with listed services as a GST-registered underlying supplier Manjula provides ride-sharing/ride-hailing services through an electronic marketplace. He is registered for GST because he also drives a taxi for a taxi company, and the company includes GST in its pricing which Manjula is required to use. Manjula has notified the marketplace operator that he is registered for GST. Manjula pays for goods and services that enable him to provide his ride-sharing/ride- hailing services such as fuel, vehicle maintenance, and insurance. The total cost of these goods and services for the month is $3,450 including GST. Manjula can recover the GST component of these costs as an input tax deduction by including these expenses in his GST return. Manjula earns $2,500 from providing ride-sharing/ride-hailing services through the electronic marketplace for the month. He also earns $5,000 that month from his activities conducted off the electronic marketplace. To complete his GST return, Manjula includes: ▪ $2,500 of sales in the “Zero-rated supplies” box on his GST return. These are sales of listed services that Manjula is treated as making to the marketplace GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 26 of 68 operator. By including the sales in the “Zero-rated supplies” box, he will not have an output tax liability on these sales. Instead, the marketplace operator is required to account for output tax on these sales. ▪ $5,000 of sales in the “Total sales and income” box in his GST return. These are the sales from Manjula’s activities conducted off the electronic marketplace. ▪ $3,450 of costs in the “Total purchases and expenses” box in his GST return. He will then calculate input tax deductions of $450. Flat-rate credit Sections 2(1) definition of “flat-rate credit”, 3A(1)(d), 8C, 20(3)(de), 20(3N), 20(3JD), 20(4E), 25AAA and 60H of the GST Act; section 141(1) and schedule 7, part A, clause 3B of the Tax Administration Act 1994; sections CX 1B and DB 2(2B) of the Income Tax Act 2007 The flat-rate credit is a credit available to underlying suppliers that are not registered for GST. The flat-rate credit represents the average amount of GST that underlying suppliers, if they were registered, would be able to recover as input tax on goods and services they purchase and use to make supplies of listed services. The prescribed amount for the credit is set out in section 20(3N). For listed services that are taxable accommodation, ride-sharing/ride-hailing services, or delivery services for food and/or beverages, the prescribed amount is 8.5% of the value of the listed services. This percentage was determined with reference to the average amount of input tax deducted by GST-registered taxi drivers and holiday homeowners. The 8.5% rate represents the average amount of input tax these suppliers would be able to recover if they were registered for GST and accounting for input tax deductions. It does not consider those with greater expenses and purchases than sales, as it was assumed that in such circumstances, the underlying supplier would prefer to be registered for GST and would do so voluntarily. The flat-rate credit is not available to GST-registered underlying suppliers. This is because GST-registered underlying suppliers will be entitled to deduct input tax for their actual expenditure. The flat-rate credit is also not available to a person in their capacity as an employee. This is because the employee of a marketplace operator who performs listed services as part of their employment duties is not an “underlying supplier”. If an underlying supplier considers the flat-rate credit inappropriate for their circumstances, they may choose to register for GST voluntarily. This will enable them to deduct input tax for their actual expenditure, but also means that they will need to account for GST on all GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 27 of 68 supplies they make from their taxable activities (including at the 0% rate on supplies of listed services made through an electronic marketplace where the marketplace operator is treated as the supplier of the services). This includes accounting for output tax on assets used principally for making taxable supplies in the event those assets are disposed of or the taxable activity ceases. Operation of the flat-rate credit Section 20(3)(de) requires marketplace operators that are treated as supplying listed services to deduct input tax for the flat-rate credit. The deduction is calculated based on the prescribed rate of the flat-rate credit for the relevant listed service that is set out in section 20(3N). It must be taken as a deduction if the underlying supplier of listed services has not notified the marketplace operator that the underlying supplier is registered for GST at the time of supply of the listed services. Marketplace operators are then required to “pass on” the flat-rate credit to underlying suppliers. They must also notify, at least monthly, underlying suppliers of the total amount of flat-rate credit that has been passed on. Example 10: Basic operation of the flat-rate credit on supplies of listed services Henry provides short-term accommodation through an electronic marketplace. The marketplace operator is responsible for collecting GST on these supplies. Henry notifies the marketplace operator that he is not a GST-registered person. Josie books accommodation from Henry through the electronic marketplace for $200 plus GST for the stay. The marketplace operator collects GST of $30 on the supply of accommodation they are treated as making to Josie. The marketplace operator applies the flat-rate credit scheme knowing Henry is not a GST-registered person. This results in the marketplace operator calculating: ▪ GST of $30 at 15% of the value of the supply of the accommodation, and ▪ the input tax deduction of $17 for the flat-rate credit at 8.5% of the value of the supply of the accommodation. The marketplace operator is required to deduct input tax of $17 from the $30 of output tax payable to Inland Revenue. It is also required to pass on the $17 to Henry as a flat-rate credit. The marketplace operator must also pay the remaining $13 to Inland Revenue as the net GST payable on the supply of accommodation. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 28 of 68 To enable marketplace operators to apply the flat-rate credit, section 60H(1) requires underlying suppliers to notify the marketplace operator of their name, tax file number (IRD number), and GST registration status. Section 60H(2) requires underlying suppliers to notify marketplace operators of any subsequent change to their GST registration status, as this would affect entitlement to the flat-rate credit. Section 60H(4) provides protection to marketplace operators that have relied on information from underlying suppliers if it is later discovered that the marketplace operator should not have passed on the flat-rate credit to an underlying supplier that was registered for, or liable to be registered for, GST. In such circumstances, absent the rules set out in section 60H(4), the marketplace operator could have a deficiency of tax equal to the amount of the input tax deducted for the flat-rate credit. Instead, section 60H(4) provides that the deficiency in tax attributable to a taxable period that arises because of the marketplace operator relying on the information provided by the underlying supplier is treated as a reduction in the total output tax allocated to the taxable period. Information requirements for underlying suppliers entitled to the flat-rate credit To enable marketplace operators to apply the flat-rate credit scheme, it is necessary for them to know whether the underlying supplier of listed services is a GST-registered person. Underlying suppliers are therefore required under section 60H(1) and (2) to notify marketplace operators of their name, tax file number (IRD number), and GST registration status. Underlying suppliers are also required to notify marketplace operators of any changes to their GST registration status as soon as practicable (that is, if they become a GST- registered person or cease to be a GST-registered person). If an underlying supplier does not notify a marketplace operator that they have become registered for GST, this could result in the marketplace operator passing on the flat-rate credit which the underlying supplier is not entitled to. In these circumstances, the underlying supplier would be required to account for this as an output tax adjustment in its GST return. They may also be liable for shortfall penalties. Conversely, if an underlying supplier ceases to be a GST-registered person but does not notify the marketplace operator of this change, the marketplace operator will not know to deduct input tax for the flat-rate credit and pass this on to them. A person who has appropriate authority to act on behalf of an underlying supplier can also provide information about the underlying supplier’s name, IRD number, and GST registration status. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 29 of 68 Reporting the flat-rate credit Marketplace operators are required to provide underlying suppliers with a statement showing the flat-rate credit passed on to them. Section 8C(6) requires this statement to be provided to underlying suppliers at least once a month. This could be based on calendar months or be provided monthly based on a date chosen by the marketplace operator or listing intermediary. If a marketplace operator wants to provide information about the flat- rate credit to underlying suppliers more frequently than monthly, this is also permitted. This requirement is necessary to ensure that GST-registered underlying suppliers who receive the flat-rate credit (which they are not entitled to) will be alerted to it. GST-registered underlying suppliers are required to account for any flat-rate credit they receive as output tax in their own GST returns. This reverses the benefit of the flat-rate credit for GST- registered persons who will be deducting input tax for goods and services related to their supplies under the usual GST rules. The statements to be provided by marketplace operators to underlying suppliers should show the total amount of the flat-rate credit passed on to them for the month (or, if the marketplace operator has chosen to provide a statement more frequently, for that period). The statement should show sufficient information that enables the underlying supplier to include, as an output tax adjustment, the amount of flat-rate credit they received in the correct taxable period. This information could be included in existing statements provided to underlying suppliers which show the total amount of consideration underlying suppliers are due, or have received, for services performed for the relevant period. If a marketplace operator offsets other fees and charges for services it provided to an underlying supplier against the underlying supplier’s flat-rate credit, the statement must still show the full amount of the flat-rate credit that was deducted as input tax by the marketplace operator in respect of the listed services made by the underlying supplier. In other words, the amount of the flat-rate credit reported to the underlying supplier should not be reduced or offset by other fees or charges. Process for resolving under-deductions and over-deductions of input tax for the flat-rate credit Section 25AAA applies when an operator of an electronic marketplace discovers that either too much, or too little, input tax has been deducted for the flat-rate credit. This might occur if, for instance, the supply of listed services is cancelled or the consideration for the supply changes after input tax for the flat-rate credit has already been deducted for the supply. In GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 30 of 68 such circumstances, the flat-rate credit may have already been passed on to the underlying supplier. Section 25AAA sets out the process that marketplace operators must follow when an over- deduction or under-deduction of the flat-rate credit is discovered. For over-deductions, the marketplace operator must return an amount of output tax that is equal to the excess input tax deduction. If the marketplace operator has already passed the flat-rate credit on to the underlying supplier at the time of discovering the inaccuracy, the amount of the excess credit may be offset against another amount of flat-rate credit required to be passed on to the underlying supplier. The rules in section 25AAA for over-deductions do not apply if the marketplace operator deducted input tax for the flat-rate credit for a supply by a GST-registered underlying supplier. If a GST-registered underlying supplier receives the flat-rate credit, they must account for this as an output tax adjustment in their GST return. Underlying suppliers are required to notify marketplace operators of their GST registration status, including any changes to their GST registration status, and marketplace operators should rely on this information when determining whether to apply the flat-rate credit scheme. For under-deductions, the marketplace operator must deduct further input tax for the flat- rate credit. It must then pass this on to the underlying supplier. If the marketplace operator chooses, it can pass this additional amount on to the underlying supplier by offsetting it against other amounts owed by the underlying supplier to the marketplace operator (for example, commissions and other charges). In this situation, the amount that is offset must still be reflected in the monthly statement provided to the underlying supplier. The amount that is offset does not need to be shown separately on the statement from the other flat-rate credit amounts passed on for the relevant period – it is sufficient to include this amount in the total flat-rate credit passed on to the underlying supplier for that period. The relevant adjustment of output tax or input tax to correct the inaccuracy must be made in the GST return for the taxable period in which the inaccuracy is discovered. Example 11: Flat-rate credit adjustment when the supply of listed services is cancelled An unregistered underlying supplier makes a supply of listed services through an electronic marketplace operated by a New Zealand-incorporated company that files its GST returns monthly. Time of supply for the listed services occurs in May 2024. The operator of the electronic marketplace calculates the flat-rate credit based on the value GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 31 of 68 of the listed services and takes an input tax deduction for the flat-rate credit in its May 2024 GST return. The supply is cancelled in October 2024 before the flat-rate credit is passed on to the underlying supplier (but after input tax has already been deducted for the flat-rate credit). The marketplace operator finds out about the cancellation (and therefore becomes aware that it has deducted too much input tax for the flat-rate credit for the cancelled supply) during that same month. The marketplace operator returns an amount of output tax that is equal to the excess input tax deducted (in this case, the entire amount of the flat-rate credit that was first calculated for the supply) in its October 2024 GST return – October 2024 being the taxable period in which the marketplace operator became aware the supply was cancelled. Requirement to pass on the flat-rate credit Marketplace operators that have taken a deduction of input tax for the flat-rate credit must then pass this on to the underlying supplier. This is required by section 8C(3)(b)(ii). The GST Act does not explicitly set out a timing requirement for marketplace operators to pass on the flat-rate credit to underlying suppliers that have purported to be unregistered persons. This ensures there is sufficient flexibility to allow marketplace operators to pass on the flat-rate credit to underlying suppliers alongside other funds due to the underlying supplier (for example, the fare for the ride-sharing/ride-hailing services or the amount of the booking for the accommodation). It also ensures that marketplace operators can choose not to pass on the flat-rate credit until the services are performed. This reduces the risk that a marketplace operator may pass on the flat-rate credit to an underlying supplier who ultimately does not end up providing the services to which the credit relates. For the avoidance of doubt, section 8C(4B) provides that an amount of flat-rate credit passed on to an underlying supplier is not consideration for a supply of any goods or services by the underlying supplier. Disclosure of GST registration status by Inland Revenue The Commissioner can, despite the confidentiality rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), provide information about a person’s GST registration status to a marketplace operator to ensure the effective operation of the flat-rate credit scheme. The Commissioner can disclose this information under clause 3B, part A of schedule 7 to the TAA. Section 8C(5) GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 32 of 68 sets out that if the Commissioner notifies a marketplace operator of an underlying supplier’s GST registration status, the marketplace operator must act on this notification as soon as practicable. Requirements of GST-registered persons who receive the flat-rate credit If a GST-registered person receives the flat-rate credit they must account for this as an output tax adjustment in their GST return. The output tax adjustment is required for the taxable period in which the flat-rate credit was received. These requirements are set out in section 20(3JD) and 20(4E). Example 12: GST-registered person receives flat-rate credit and must make an output tax adjustment to reverse the benefit In completing her GST return for the period ending 31 March 2025, Poppy realises she received flat-rate credits from a marketplace operator related to listed services she supplied through an electronic marketplace. Poppy identifies this by reviewing the statement she receives from the marketplace operator that informs her of her total flat-rate credit for the month of March. Poppy became a GST-registered person in February 2025. She forgot to notify the marketplace operator of this change in her circumstances. Poppy is keen to correct the error. The total amount of flat-rate credits Poppy received for February and March was $6,000. To correct this error, Poppy must include $6,000 as an output tax adjustment in her GST return for the taxable period ending 31 March 2025. The $6,000 of output tax will be offset by any input tax deductions that Poppy can take for the period. A GST-registered person who receives the flat-rate credit will also have a tax shortfall equal to the amount of the flat-rate credit they received. Section 141(1) of the TAA provides that a tax shortfall may arise because of a provision in an Inland Revenue Act. In these circumstances, a tax shortfall arises because of section 8C(3)(c)(ii), which means the person could be liable for shortfall penalties. Having a tax shortfall does not mean that penalties will be imposed automatically. The Commissioner may consider making an assessment of shortfall penalties in cases where a person continuously misrepresents their GST registration status to claim amounts of the flat-rate credit that they are not entitled to. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 33 of 68 Example 13: GST-registered person receives flat-rate credit resulting in a tax shortfall Bradd is a registered person and provides taxable accommodation through an electronic marketplace. He has notified the marketplace operator that he is not a GST- registered person. Bradd has a six-monthly taxable period. The only supplies Bradd makes are through an electronic marketplace. Between April 2024 and September 2024, Bradd makes supplies through the electronic marketplace equal to $46,000 excluding GST. Bradd acquired goods and services that he used in making supplies through the electronic marketplace. The total value of these goods and services was $17,500 including GST. He deducted input tax of $2,282.60 in his GST return. Because Bradd notified the marketplace operator that he was not a GST-registered person, the marketplace operator also passed on the flat-rate credit to Bradd for his listed services. The amount of flat-rate credit Bradd received totalled $3,910. Bradd therefore has a tax shortfall equal to this amount and could be liable for a shortfall penalty. If a GST-registered underlying supplier of listed services receives a flat-rate credit spanning multiple taxable periods (and therefore multiple GST returns), an output tax adjustment would need to be made in the GST return for each taxable period that the underlying supplier received the flat-rate credit. Section 20(4E) sets out the timing rules for the adjustments. Example 14: GST-registered person receives flat-rate credit spanning multiple taxable periods Marley is a GST-registered underlying supplier of listed services. He incorrectly receives the flat-rate credit because he had not notified the marketplace operator of his GST registration. Marley has a six-monthly taxable period, providing GST returns for the periods covering 1 April to 30 September and 1 October to 31 March. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 34 of 68 Marley receives the following flat-rate credits: ▪ $600 in February ▪ $400 in March ▪ $800 in April. Marley becomes aware of his mistake and notifies the marketplace operator of his status as a GST-registered person at the end of April. Marley is required to make an output tax adjustment of: ▪ $1,000 ($600 + $400) in his GST return for the taxable period ending 31 March, and ▪ $800 in his GST return for the taxable period ending 31 October. Income tax implications of the flat-rate credit The flat-rate credit is treated as excluded income for income tax purposes under section CX 1B of the Income Tax Act 2007, regardless of whether the underlying supplier receiving it is registered for GST. In this way it is treated the same as way as input tax payable under the GST Act to a GST-registered person. Section DB 2(2B) of the Income Tax Act 2007 treats a person that is not registered for GST as if they were registered for GST for determining deductions for income tax. This applies to the extent that the person would have a deduction for expenditure that is attributable to supplies of listed services that are made through an electronic marketplace. This means that deductions for expenditure incurred for income tax purposes must be taken on a GST-exclusive basis if the expenditure is attributable to deriving income exclusively through an electronic marketplace. This is because the flat-rate credit is a proxy for input tax that would be deductible if the person was registered for GST, and GST-registered persons are unable to take a deduction for GST-inclusive expenditure for income tax purposes. Expenditure related to income derived from other activities will continue being deducted on a GST-inclusive basis. A person may incur expenditure for goods and services that are used partly to derive income from sales through an electronic marketplace and partly for non- marketplace-based sales. In these circumstances, the person will have incurred expenditure with a mixed purpose, and they will only be able to take a deduction for income tax on a GST-inclusive basis for expenditure attributable to income they derive from activities that are not conducted through an electronic marketplace. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 35 of 68 If a person has mixed purpose expenditure – being expenditure related to deriving income through an electronic marketplace and through other means – the person should undertake the following process to determine their total annual deduction for income tax purposes: ▪ Identify the GST-inclusive and GST-exclusive amount of mixed purpose expenditure for the income year. ▪ Determine what proportion of expenditure must be taken on a GST-exclusive basis by applying the calculation under the heading “Formula for determining GST-inclusive and GST-exclusive deductions for expenditure with a mixed purpose”. ▪ Add deductions for expenditure incurred in deriving income that is not derived through an electronic marketplace. ▪ Include, in the total annual deduction, any amount deductible under the depreciation rules. For persons not registered for GST, the value of depreciable property for depreciation purposes will continue to be calculated on a GST-inclusive basis (if GST applies). The following paragraphs explain how to determine the proportion of expenditure to take as a deduction for income tax purposes on a GST-inclusive basis and on a GST-exclusive basis where the expenditure relates to both income derived through an electronic marketplace and income not derived through an electronic marketplace. Determining GST-inclusive and GST-exclusive deductions for expenditure with a mixed purpose To determine the total GST-inclusive deductions for mixed purpose expenditure, it is necessary to determine the proportion of income derived from sales that are not made through an electronic marketplace. This can be established by completing the following formula: a a+b =c Where: a is the income derived from making sales not through an electronic marketplace for the income year, and b is the income derived from making sales through an electronic marketplace for the income year. This is the GST-exclusive amount because GST output tax is not taxable income. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 36 of 68 c is the percentage applied to the total amount of GST-inclusive expenditure for income tax purposes that had a mixed purpose. Example 15: GST-inclusive deductions for mixed purpose expenditure Calvin derives income from sales of accommodation he provides through an electronic marketplace and through a website he maintains himself (which is not an electronic marketplace as defined in the GST Act). Calvin is not registered for GST and is not liable for GST registration. Calvin identifies that he derived income for the 2024–25 income year from sales of accommodation of: ▪ $20,000 (excluding GST) through an online booking platform, and ▪ $8,000 through his own website. Applying the formula above: 8,000 8,000+20,000 =28.57% Calvin can take a deduction equal to 28.57% of the GST-inclusive value of the expenditure incurred in deriving income from sales through an electronic marketplace and sales not made through an electronic marketplace. Calvin would then need to add this to the GST-exclusive value of his remaining mixed purpose expenditure to determine his total deduction for income tax purposes. This is explained in the following paragraphs. The remaining expenditure with a mixed purpose must be taken on a GST-exclusive basis. To determine the total deduction for expenditure on a GST-exclusive basis, the following formula can be applied: ( 100%−c ) ×d Where: c is the percentage of GST-inclusive expenditure with a mixed purpose that can be taken as a deduction for income tax purposes, calculated on the previous page d is the total amount of mixed purpose expenditure expressed on a GST-exclusive basis. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 37 of 68 Example 16: Income tax deductions for mixed purpose expenditure Calvin provides taxable accommodation through an online booking platform. He also advertises the accommodation himself through his own website. Calvin is not registered for GST or liable for GST registration. The sales he makes through the online booking platform are listed services and the marketplace operator accounts for GST on these supplies. The sales he makes through his own website are not listed services and are not subject to GST. For the 2024–25 tax year, Calvin identifies he made sales of: ▪ $20,000 (excluding GST) through an online booking platform, and ▪ $8,000 through his own website. Calvin incurred the following expenses, all inclusive of GST, for the year: ▪ $4,000 of commissions charged by the online booking platform ▪ $3,500 of local council rates ▪ $1,200 for house and contents insurance, and ▪ $600 for repairs and maintenance. For income tax purposes, Calvin would include in his income tax return: ▪ income from rents of $28,000 ($20,000 excluding GST from online bookings and $8,000 from sales Calvin made directly), and ▪ deductions of $8,284.67. The calculation of total deductions is explained below. Calvin had deductions related to his own sales of $1,514.21. This is the total of the GST-inclusive amount for the local council rates, house and contents insurance, and repairs and maintenance. These deductions can be attributed to Calvin’s activities outside of the electronic marketplace (that is, $8,000 / $28,000, being his sales through his own website divided by his total sales excluding GST). Calvin had deductions related to his sales made through an electronic marketplace of $6,770.25 excluding GST. This is calculated as: ▪ 71.43% multiplied by his total mixed purpose expenditure excluding GST, plus ▪ the GST-exclusive amount of commissions charged by the online booking platform of $3,478.26. Calvin cannot claim the GST-inclusive amount of the total commissions ($4,000) as an income tax deduction because he received the flat-rate credit. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 38 of 68 Effect of the flat-rate credit when person becomes registered for GST If a person becomes registered for GST, for the period prior to GST registration, assets that they used to make supplies of listed services will be treated as having a non-taxable use for the apportionment and adjustment rules. Once registered for GST, the person may choose to perform an adjustment at the end of their adjustment period (their balance date) which reflects the new percentage of use that relates to making taxable supplies – if this new percentage is a permanent change that is likely to be maintained for the foreseeable future. Inland Revenue has published a special report on recent changes to the apportionment and adjustment rules. 4 Further information is also available on Inland Revenue’s website (keyword search: GST apportionment). Opting out of marketplace rules Sections 60C(2BB), (2BC), (2BD), (2BE), (2BF) and (3D), 60H(3) and 85D of the GST Act Marketplace rules will generally treat the operator of an electronic marketplace that another person makes supplies through (the underlying supplier) as the supplier. This means that the marketplace operator becomes responsible for accounting for GST on these supplies. Marketplace rules may not be appropriate for larger suppliers that already have established accounting systems and practices in place for managing compliance with their GST obligations. This is because marketplace rules could require these taxpayers to change their existing accounting systems and practices which would increase compliance costs for limited benefit to tax collection and tax administration. The marketplace rules for listed services therefore include provisions that enable certain underlying suppliers to opt out of the rules. In certain circumstances, an underlying supplier can opt out of marketplace rules by notifying the marketplace operator that they will remain responsible for their own GST obligations. This is available to underlying suppliers that are required to maintain a monthly or two-monthly taxable period, which is those that make taxable supplies of more than $500,000 in a 12-month period. Some underlying suppliers may also be able to enter into an opt-out agreement with the marketplace operator. If an agreement was in place, these underlying suppliers would continue being responsible for their own GST obligations. Agreements can be entered into 4 See Special report on GST apportionment and adjustment rules published by Policy and Regulatory Stewardship, Inland Revenue (April 2023) available at: https://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2023/2023-sr-gst- apportionment-and-adjustment-rules GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 39 of 68 provided the underlying supplier meets specific criteria. If an underlying supplier stops meeting the criteria for an opt-out agreement, the agreement must be withdrawn. In these circumstances, the underlying supplier should notify the marketplace operator they no longer meet the criteria to opt out of the marketplace rules. Underlying suppliers who have opted out of the marketplace rules will need sufficient information from the marketplace operator so they can correctly account for output tax on the supply. This will include the price, inclusive of any commissions, mark-ups or other fees due to the marketplace operator for their services, that the recipient of the supply will pay to the marketplace operator directly. This means marketplace operators will need to provide underlying suppliers with this information. Suppliers over $500,000 in a 12-month period Underlying suppliers that are required to maintain a two-month or one-month taxable period under section 15 of the GST Act can unilaterally opt out of the marketplace rules by notifying the marketplace operator that they choose to be liable for the payment of GST on supplies they make and will continue to remain responsible for all obligations under the GST Act. This opt-out is only available to underlying suppliers who are required to maintain a monthly or two-monthly taxable period for their GST returns (that is, they are required to provide GST returns on a monthly or two-monthly basis). This means an underlying supplier who chooses to provide GST returns on this basis but does not exceed at least $500,000 in taxable supplies in a 12-month period is unable to opt out of the marketplace rules under this ground. This opt-out ground is further restricted to non-natural persons only under section 60C(2BF)(a). This is to mitigate a potential integrity risk that a natural person could purport to be eligible to opt out of the rules under this ground, despite not meeting the criteria, and the marketplace operator having to accept this, ultimately resulting in no GST being collected on supplies made by this person. If an underlying supplier no longer meets the criteria under this opt-out ground, they must inform the marketplace operator that they are no longer eligible to remain responsible for their own GST obligations. This will enable the marketplace operator to apply the marketplace rules, which will treat them as the supplier of the services and will therefore result in them having to collect and return output tax and provide taxable supply information. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 40 of 68 Marketplace operators will not be required to verify that an underlying supplier meets this criterion. They will be able to rely on information they receive, by election, from the underlying supplier. This information must be retained by the marketplace operator in accordance with the general record keeping requirements for GST set out in section 75. This provides that records must generally be kept for seven years following the end of the taxable period to which they relate. Suppliers eligible to enter agreements to opt out of marketplace rules An underlying supplier can enter an opt-out agreement with a marketplace operator provided they: ▪ meet the requirements set out in a determination made by the Commissioner, or ▪ provide taxable accommodation and meet the 2,000-night threshold. Criteria set out in a determination issued by the Commissioner The Commissioner has the power under section 60(2BC) to issue determinations that set out the circumstances in which a person can enter into an opt-out agreement. Before making a determination, the Commissioner is required to have regard to several factors. These factors, set out in section 60(2BD), are the compliance costs that would arise for underlying suppliers in making changes to their accounting systems and practices, and the size, scale, and nature of the services and activities undertaken by underlying suppliers. The Commissioner has not issued a determination at the time of the publication of this special report. If a determination is issued, it will be published, and any underlying supplier that meets the requirements set out in the determination would be able to enter into an opt- out agreement with a marketplace operator. The 2,000-night threshold Underlying suppliers that supply taxable accommodation through electronic marketplaces may be able to enter an opt-out agreement provided they list more than 2,000 nights of accommodation on an electronic marketplace in a 12-month period. This also includes circumstances where the underlying supplier has a reasonable expectation that they can meet this requirement in the 12-month period. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 41 of 68 Example 17: Reasonable expectation for more than 2,000 nights Harris Hotels Ltd operates a multinational hotel chain. It runs a hotel business in Auckland, Christchurch, and Wellington. Each hotel has 100 rooms. The rooms are available all-year round and are advertised on an electronic marketplace. Harris Hotels Ltd therefore has a total of 109,500 nights of accommodation available through electronic marketplaces. This is calculated based on 300 rooms available for 365 nights. It is not possible to aggregate accommodation nights across multiple electronic marketplaces for these purposes. This means that if a person has 1,000 nights available through one electronic marketplace and 1,500 nights available through another electronic marketplace, they would not be able to enter into an opt-out agreement under this test. Example 18: More than 2,000 nights across multiple marketplaces – not eligible Will and Nicole own six properties that they lease for short-term accommodation through multiple electronic marketplaces. Five properties are available for rent all-year round through an electronic marketplace, Accommodation4U. This equates to 1,825 nights of accommodation available through Accommodation4U (5 × 365 nights). The other property is available through another electronic marketplace. It is not available all-year round so Will and Nicole choose for this not to be advertised on Accommodation4U. This means Will and Nicole are unable to enter an opt-out agreement with the marketplace operator for Accommodation4U based on having more than 2,000 nights of accommodation available in a 12-month period through the electronic marketplace. Example 19: More than 2,000 nights on one electronic marketplace – eligible on other marketplaces Heyes Hotels Co lists rooms available for rent through an electronic marketplace, A Co. It has 40 rooms available across its two New Zealand locations and these rooms are GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 42 of 68 available all-year round. All rooms are listed through A Co. It therefore satisfies the criteria to enter into an opt-out agreement with A Co. The owners of Heyes Hotels Co want to list rooms on another electronic marketplace, B Co. It wants to trial providing accommodation through B Co and is not able to commit to listing more than 2,000 nights in a 12-month period through B Co until it sees whether B Co improves Hayes Hotels Co’s bookings. Heyes Hotels Co can enter an opt-out agreement with B Co because it satisfies the 2,000-night criterion on another electronic marketplace, A Co. Example 20: 2,000-night criterion not satisfied – nights available exceed 2,000 in aggregate, but not on an individual electronic marketplace Lucy and Richard have six investment properties – three in Wanaka and three in Waiheke. The properties are available for short-term rental accommodation. The Wanaka properties are available for booking through an electronic marketplace, Sam’s Stays Ltd. The Waiheke properties are available for booking through another electronic marketplace, Ben’s Baches Co. All properties are available all-year round and in aggregate, the 2,000-night threshold is satisfied. However, because the properties are listed on separate electronic marketplaces, Lucy and Richard are not eligible to enter an opt-out agreement with the operators of Sam’s Stays Ltd or Ben’s Baches Co. Marketplace operators are not required to monitor whether underlying suppliers that have entered into an opt-out agreement with them list more than 2,000 nights of accommodation available through them in each 12-month period. These agreements would apply for a 12-month period. This can be any 12-month period and does not need to coincide with a calendar year. However, if an underlying supplier does not have a reasonable expectation that they will list more than 2,000 nights of accommodation on one electronic marketplace for a later 12-month period, they may not renew their agreement to opt out of the electronic marketplace rules under this ground. If a person is a member of a group of companies, the 2,000-night threshold can be applied on a group basis. This means that, provided the group of companies satisfies the 2,000-night threshold, all members of the group can individually enter into an opt-out agreement with marketplace operators. This is provided for in section 60C(2BE). The definition of “group of GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 43 of 68 companies” that applies for these purposes refers to the definition set out in the Income Tax Act 2007 which requires common voting interests of at least 66%. 5 When determining what constitutes a “night” under this test, nights should be determined on a per listing basis. This means that each night a listing is made available to book on an electronic marketplace counts as one night under this test. Example 21: What constitutes a “night” under the 2,000 nights test Sam Sam owns a five-bedroom house in Wanaka. The way the house is configured means that two of the bedrooms have their own ensuite and kitchenette. Both bedrooms have their own self-contained accessway down each side of Sam’s home, and the bedrooms can be locked from the outside to shut them off from the main house. When Sam is living in the house, he lists these two rooms as separate accommodation on an electronic marketplace, A Co. If Sam lists both of these rooms as available to book year-round, this would total 730 nights of accommodation available per annum under the 2,000 nights test (365 × 2 = 730). Shanae Sam’s neighbour Shanae owns the five-bedroom house next door to Sam. Shanae’s house is configured in the same way as Sam’s (where two of the bedrooms have their own separate ensuite, kitchenette and self-contained accessway). For 300 days of the year, Shanae lists both rooms separately on A Co. (which totals 600 nights under the 2,000 nights test). Shanae decides to travel to Europe for the summer and is away for 65 days. During the time that Shanae is away, she decides to list the entire house on A Co as one listing. This constitutes 65 nights of accommodation being made available. It is not relevant that two of the bedrooms provide additional facilities and can be used in a self- contained manner. The decisive factor is how many nights of accommodation Shanae has made available through the electronic marketplace, which is calculated on a per listing basis. 5 See section IC 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 44 of 68 Further requirements for opt-out agreements Provided underlying suppliers meet the criteria for an opt-out agreement as set out above, and the marketplace operator agrees to an opt-out, section 60C(2BB) contains further requirements before an agreement is valid. Under these rules: ▪ the documentation provided to the recipient of the services must identify the supply as being made by the underlying supplier and not the electronic marketplace, and ▪ there must be an agreement, with that agreement being recorded in a document, that the underlying supplier is liable for the payment of tax for supplies of listed services and will continue to remain responsible for their tax obligations under the GST Act. This includes the requirement to provide the recipient with taxable supply information, if required, and providing GST returns and paying GST to Inland Revenue. If these requirements are not satisfied, the marketplace operator will be treated as the supplier of listed services and will therefore be required to account for GST on these supplies. Transitional provision for supplies of listed services Section 85D applies to enable eligible underlying suppliers to enter into an agreement with marketplace operators, or notify marketplace operators, that they are opting out of the marketplace rules. This provision allows eligible underlying suppliers to opt out of the marketplace rules before they come into effect on 1 April 2024. The Commissioner also has the power, from 1 April 2023 to issue determinations setting out criteria a person must meet if they wish to opt out of the marketplace rules but do not meet the statutory criteria. Listing intermediaries Section 60CB of the GST Act It is especially common for owners of holiday homes to use a property manager or agent 6 to list taxable accommodation in those properties on electronic marketplaces. In this situation, it is not uncommon for the host to have no relationship with the operator of the electronic 6 “Agent” is used here in a more colloquial sense, rather than in a precise legal sense. For instance, it does not necessarily refer to someone who is an agent for the purposes of section 60 of the GST Act, but rather has a broader meaning in this context referring to anyone who might list taxable accommodation on an electronic marketplace on behalf of the host. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 45 of 68 marketplace on which the accommodation is listed or advertised. Where this is the case, the GST rules for electronic marketplaces may not work appropriately on their own. This is because the marketplace operator might not have any information about the host that is necessary for administering the flat-rate credit scheme (such as the host’s name and GST registration status) and it may be difficult for the marketplace operator to obtain and hold this information, given the absence of both a contractual relationship and direct dealings with the host. This may make it impractical for the marketplace operator to administer the flat-rate credit scheme for such hosts. Where the property manager or agent has a contractual relationship with an operator of an electronic marketplace to list or advertise the services on the marketplace, the agent (referred to as a “listing intermediary”) will be responsible for all requirements related to the flat-rate credit (instead of those obligations being on the marketplace operator). As explained below, they will also be treated as making a zero-rated supply of the accommodation provided by the host to the marketplace operator, unless they are able to agree with the marketplace operator that they are liable for GST at the 15% rate on supplies of taxable accommodation. Listing intermediary definition A “listing intermediary” is defined in section 60CB(8) as a registered person who lists taxable accommodation on an electronic marketplace on behalf of a host who makes those supplies through the marketplace. The definition of “listing intermediary” requires that the person enters into an agreement with the marketplace operator to list or advertise the accommodation provided by the host. A listing intermediary may also provide other services to hosts (such as property management services), but the listing intermediary definition does not require this. An agent who lists taxable accommodation on an electronic marketplace on behalf of a host but who does not have an agreement in their own name with the marketplace operator to list or advertise the services on the marketplace does not meet the definition of a “listing intermediary”. Therefore, they are not subject to the requirements on listing intermediaries (namely, the various requirements related to the flat-rate credit, which would normally be the responsibility of the marketplace operator but which become the responsibility of a listing intermediary when they are interposed between a host providing taxable accommodation and a marketplace operator). In this circumstance, the agent will instead provide information to the marketplace operator about the host, such as the host’s GST registration status and bank account information. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 46 of 68 Example 22: Property manager meets listing intermediary definition Andraya uses the services of a property manager to manage her holiday home and advertise it on an electronic marketplace for short-stay accommodation. The property manager is registered for GST. The property manager has an agreement in its own name with the operator of the electronic marketplace to list accommodation provided in multiple properties on the electronic marketplace. Aside from the addresses of the properties listed on the marketplace, the marketplace operator does not know anything about Andraya or any of the other owners of the properties listed on the marketplace by the property manager. The property manager meets the definition of a listing intermediary. Example 23: Person is not a listing intermediary Willow has a holiday home in the Coromandel that she would like to rent out for the summer on Rent-A-Holiday-Home, a prominent electronic marketplace for short-stay accommodation. Willow is aware that her next-door neighbour, Callan, has an account on Rent-A-Holiday-Home that he sometimes uses to rent his own holiday home out for short-stay accommodation. Neither Willow nor Callan are registered for GST. Willow is not a confident user of computers and smartphones, so she asks Callan if he can create an account on Rent-A-Holiday-Home for her and list the Coromandel holiday home on Rent-A-Holiday-Home as available for short-stay accommodation guests to book over the summer. Callan creates an account on Rent-A-Holiday-Home for Willow and lists Willow’s Coromandel holiday home as available to book over the summer. Even though the email address provided to Rent-A-Holiday-Home is Callan’s secondary email address (rather than Willow’s email address), the contract entered into with the marketplace operator to list the accommodation in the Coromandel holiday home is in Willow’s name, not Callan’s. Callan is not a listing intermediary. Callan provides details of Willow’s GST registration status (unregistered) and her bank account details to Rent-A-Holiday-Home so Rent- A-Holiday-Home can pay her the flat-rate credit. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 47 of 68 Default rules for listing intermediaries – deeming of three separate supplies Section 60CB(2) applies when a listing intermediary is interposed between a host providing taxable accommodation and an operator of an electronic marketplace. The listing intermediary is “interposed” between the host and the operator of the electronic marketplace on which the accommodation is listed if the marketplace operator only deals with the listing intermediary in relation to the accommodation listed (and not directly with the host). In this circumstance, it is likely that the marketplace operator does not hold any information about the host except for the address of the property the accommodation is provided in. Under section 60CB(2), the supply of the accommodation is treated as three separate supplies: ▪ A supply from the host to the listing intermediary. This supply is zero-rated under section 11A(1)(jd) if the host is a registered person. ▪ A supply from the listing intermediary to the marketplace operator, which is also zero-rated under 11A(1)(jd). This zero-rated supply does not create a requirement for the listing intermediary to provide taxable supply information to the marketplace operator for the supply. It does however mean that the listing intermediary should include the value of this supply and all other zero-rated supplies that they make (or are deemed to make) in the ”Zero-rated supplies” box in their GST return. The value of all such supplies also counts towards the person’s total supplies for determining whether they exceed the GST registration threshold. ▪ A supply from the marketplace operator to the guest, which is subject to GST at the standard 15% rate. This means the default setting for output tax when a listing intermediary is interposed between the host and an operator of an electronic marketplace is that the liability for output tax at the 15% rate remains with the marketplace operator (just as it would if the listing intermediary was not involved in the supply). Application of flat-rate credit provisions Section 60CB(5) provides that, under the provisions related to the flat-rate credit, the listing intermediary is treated as though they are the operator of the electronic marketplace through which the supply of listed services is made, and must meet all the requirements placed on the operator for the flat-rate credit under those provisions for that supply. This means that where a listing intermediary is interposed between a host providing taxable accommodation and an operator of an electronic marketplace, all requirements related to GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 48 of 68 the flat-rate credit for that supply are imposed on the listing intermediary – including the requirement to deduct input tax for the flat-rate credit and to pass it on to the host, and to provide a statement, at least monthly, to the host showing the amount of flat-rate credit passed on. See “Flat-rate credit” from page 26 for a full explanation of these provisions. Treatment of services supplied by listing intermediary directly to guests In addition to listing or advertising taxable accommodation on an electronic marketplace on behalf of hosts, some listing intermediaries may provide property management services to these hosts. In this situation, it is not uncommon for the listing intermediary to structure its contracts so that services such as cleaning and linen hire are supplied to guests staying at the property (rather than being supplied to the host), for which the guests pay a fee. The fact that there is a separate fee for the listing intermediary’s services on top of the price of the accommodation itself may not be apparent because the marketplace may take and display just one bundled price for the package of services (being taxable accommodation and the listing intermediary’s services). Under the pre-1 April 2024 GST rules, the listing intermediary (if registered for GST) would have already been accounting for and paying GST to Inland Revenue on its services. However, if the fee charged for the listing intermediary’s services is not known to the marketplace operator and cannot be distinguished from the price of the accommodation, having the marketplace operator account for output tax on the supply of accommodation and the listing intermediary account for output tax on the supply of its services would likely result in double taxation of the listing intermediary’s services. To address this issue, section 60CB(3) provides that when section 60CB(2) applies to a supply of listed services, a supply of other services by the listing intermediary to the guest through the electronic marketplace is treated as two separate supplies as follows: ▪ a supply from the listing intermediary to the operator of the electronic marketplace that is zero-rated under section 11A(1)(jd), and ▪ a supply by the marketplace operator that is subject to GST at the standard 15% rate. The above rule only applies if section 60CB(2) applies. As discussed below, there may be situations where a listing intermediary is liable for output tax on a supply of taxable accommodation, in which case section 60CB(2) would not apply. In that situation, any services the listing intermediary supplies directly to guests through the electronic marketplace will retain their GST treatment under the normal GST rules, rather than being subject to the rule in section 60CB(3). This means, rather than being treated as making a zero-rated supply of those services to the marketplace operator (and the marketplace GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 49 of 68 operator being treated as supplying those services to the guest), the listing intermediary’s supply to the guest is a single standard rated supply as per the pre-1 April 2024 rules. If the listing intermediary is treated as making a zero-rated supply of the services to the marketplace operator, they are not required to provide taxable supply information to the marketplace operator in respect of this supply. Because the “other” services supplied by the listing intermediary to the guest (that the listing intermediary is treated as supplying to the marketplace operator) are not “listed services”, the provision of these services to the guest does not affect the calculation of the flat-rate credit that the listing intermediary is required to deduct input tax for in its GST return and then pass on to the host. In other words, the amount of flat-rate credit required to be deducted and passed on is based only on the value of the accommodation provided by the host, and does not include the value of the other services provided by the listing intermediary to the guest. Example 24: Default rules for listing intermediaries Gordon uses the services of a listing intermediary to manage his property and list it on several electronic marketplaces for short-stay accommodation. Gordon is not registered for GST. The listing intermediary is registered for GST for its property management activity. Gordon has an agreement with the listing intermediary that his property will be rented out for no less than $100 per night. Harriet uses an electronic marketplace to book accommodation in Gordon’s property. Harriet pays a total of $150 plus GST for one night’s stay in Gordon’s property. This includes $100 for the accommodation, and $50 for services supplied to Harriet by the listing intermediary. The marketplace operator accounts for GST on the supply. It provides Harriet with taxable supply information. The listing intermediary is deemed to make a supply of the accommodation provided by Gordon to the operator of the electronic marketplace. It is also treated as making a supply of its own services (that it contractually supplies to Harriet) to the marketplace operator. Both deemed supplies are zero-rated, meaning the listing intermediary has output tax of zero for the $150 of services it is treated as supplying to the operator of GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 50 of 68 the electronic marketplace. This is because the marketplace operator has accounted for output tax on these supplies at the standard GST rate of 15%. The listing intermediary is responsible for calculating the flat-rate credit for Gordon. It calculates this based on the value of the accommodation of $100. It will be responsible for providing Gordon with a statement, at least monthly, showing the flat-rate credit that Gordon received from the listing intermediary. When listing intermediary is treated as supplier of taxable accommodation Provided certain conditions are met, a listing intermediary can agree with an operator of an electronic marketplace that they are liable for output tax on accommodation supplied through the electronic marketplace. The agreement between the listing intermediary and the marketplace operator must be recorded in a document. To be entitled to seek such an agreement, the listing intermediary must: ▪ be a New Zealand tax resident ▪ list the accommodation provided by the host on not just one, but multiple electronic marketplaces, and ▪ enable or facilitate the supply of the accommodation using an electronic system that can facilitate and manage guests’ bookings automatically. For example, such an electronic system might include an application programming interface (API) that transmits data or information between the electronic marketplace and the listing intermediary’s systems, or property management software that the listing intermediary uses to manage bookings taken via multiple electronic marketplaces. The intention of the second and third requirements above is to limit the ability for a listing intermediary to obtain such an agreement with a marketplace operator to situations where the listing intermediary is in some ways similar to an operator of an electronic marketplace. The person might even be an operator of an electronic marketplace in certain scenarios, such as where they operate their own website or app through which guests can book taxable accommodation provided by a host. In this situation where a person is both a listing intermediary for some supplies of taxable accommodation and a marketplace operator for other supplies (and would therefore be liable for output tax on those other supplies), the rules allow the person the option of accounting for and paying output tax on supplies for which they are a listing intermediary, subject to the marketplace operator’s agreement with this arrangement. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 51 of 68 Section 60CB(7) provides that the effect of such an agreement is that the listing intermediary is treated as though they are the marketplace operator for several key provisions in the GST Act related to listed services. This includes section 60C(2)(ab), which is the rule that treats taxable accommodation as supplied by the operator of the electronic marketplace through which the supply of services is made, provided those services are performed, provided or received in New Zealand. In addition to being treated as the operator of the electronic marketplace for the purposes of section 60C(2)(ab) and the provisions related to the flat-rate credit, the listing intermediary is also treated by section 60CB(7) as though it is the operator of the electronic marketplace for: ▪ Section 25AAA –where a listing intermediary is interposed between a host and an operator of an electronic marketplace, the listing intermediary must apply the rules for correcting over-deductions or under-deductions of input tax for the flat-rate credit when such inaccuracies are discovered. ▪ Section 60(1C) – the host is treated as making a supply of listed services to the listing intermediary, which is zero-rated if the host is a registered person, and the listing intermediary is treated as making a standard rated supply of the same services to the guest. ▪ Section 60C(3B) and (3C) ( – the act of a listing intermediary recovering or deducting an amount from a payment due to the host and using this amount to satisfy its output tax liability for a supply it is treated as making does not give rise to any further GST implications. ▪ Sections 60C(2BB), (2BE), (2BF) and 60H – the various references to the “operator of the electronic marketplace” or “operator” throughout section 60H and in the rules for underlying supplier opt-outs should instead be read as referring to the listing intermediary. Under section 60H, this applies not just for the subsections related to the provision of information by underlying suppliers for the flat-rate credit, but also for the notification rule for unilateral opt-outs (section 60H(3)) where the underlying supplier is able to unilaterally opt out of the electronic marketplace rules because their total annual supplies are more than $500,000. ▪ Section 85E – where the listing intermediary is liable for output tax on supplies of taxable accommodation under section 60CB(7), it is eligible to apply the transitional rule for contracts for taxable accommodation entered into before 1 April 2024, provided certain conditions are met. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 52 of 68 Where section 60CB(7) applies, the marketplace operator is relieved of all liability under the GST Act for the supply, except for the provision of taxable supply information as discussed below. This means the listing intermediary is liable to account for and pay output tax to Inland Revenue on supplies of taxable accommodation made on or after 1 April 2024. Providing taxable supply information Whenever a listing intermediary is interposed between a host and an operator of an electronic marketplace in the supply of taxable accommodation to a guest, the marketplace operator is treated as the supplier of the services for the provision of taxable supply information (even if the listing intermediary is liable for output tax on the supply under section 60CB(7)). This means: the marketplace operator (not the listing intermediary) is required to issue taxable supply information to the guest under section 19NB in all circumstances, including when section 60CB(7) applies to treat the listing intermediary as making a supply of the services to the guest that is subject to the standard GST rate of 15%, and ▪ the “supplier’s” details (such as name and GST registration number) the marketplace operator is required to include in the taxable supply information are their own, and not those of the listing intermediary or the host. Example 25: Listing intermediary is responsible for output tax Sally uses the services of a listing intermediary to manage her property and list it on multiple electronic marketplaces to maximise her advertising exposure and therefore the number of nights on which the property is booked throughout the year. Sally is not registered for GST. The listing intermediary is registered for GST for its property management activity. Iona uses one of the electronic marketplaces on which Sally’s property is advertised to book the property for one night. Iona pays a total of $200 plus GST. This includes $120 for the accommodation and $80 for services supplied to Iona by the listing intermediary. The listing intermediary has a written agreement with the operator of the electronic marketplace that the listing intermediary, rather than the marketplace operator, is liable for GST on any supplies of taxable accommodation that the intermediary lists on the electronic marketplace. This means the listing intermediary (not the electronic GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 53 of 68 marketplace operator) is the supplier of the accommodation for GST purposes and has the responsibility for returning output tax on the supplies at the 15% GST rate. The listing intermediary accounts for output tax on the total value of the services supplied to Iona of $200. The listing intermediary is also responsible for calculating the flat-rate credit for Sally. It calculates this based on the value of the accommodation of $120. It is responsible for providing Sally with a statement, at least monthly, which shows the flat-rate credit that Sally received from the listing intermediary. Even though the marketplace operator is not liable for output tax on the supply of accommodation, it is still responsible for providing taxable supply information to Iona. The marketplace operator includes its own name and GST registration number in the taxable supply information provided to Iona. Opt-out rules for hosts A host who is eligible to opt out of the electronic marketplace rules (because more than 2,000 nights of accommodation they provide is listed on an electronic marketplace in a 12- month period, or because their taxable supplies in a 12-month period exceed $500,000) can still opt out or seek to opt out even if they use a listing intermediary to list the accommodation on the electronic marketplace. In this circumstance, the listing intermediary may need to notify the marketplace operator on the host’s behalf that the host is opting out of the rules. If an opt-out agreement with the marketplace operator is required, the listing intermediary may need to liaise between the host and the marketplace operator so the two parties can enter into an opt-out agreement. Even if a listing intermediary has an agreement with the marketplace operator that they are liable for output tax on the supplies of accommodation that they list on the marketplace, a host that the listing intermediary acts for who wishes to opt out of the rules to remain responsible for their own GST obligations may still be able to do so. In this situation, the host would either notify the listing intermediary they are opting out (if they are opting out because their taxable supplies in a 12-month period exceed $500,000), or enter into an opt- out agreement with the listing intermediary (if they are seeking to opt out because they meet the “listing more than 2,000 nights of accommodation” criterion). GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 54 of 68 Transitional rule for taxable accommodation Section 85E of the GST Act A transitional issue with the GST rules for listed services may arise for operators of electronic marketplaces and listing intermediaries. The problem may arise when an operator of an electronic marketplace takes an accommodation booking before 1 April 2024 for a host who is not registered for GST. If time of supply occurs on or after 1 April 2024, the default position is that the marketplace operator or listing intermediary will have a GST liability for the supply, even though the price of the accommodation might not have been set with GST in mind. To address this issue, a transitional rule in section 85E of the GST Act ensures listing intermediaries and operators of electronic marketplaces do not have to account for GST on contracts for taxable accommodation entered into before 1 April 2024, provided certain requirements are met. Supplies covered by the transitional rule The transitional rule applies when: ▪ the supply is of taxable accommodation ▪ the supply is made through an electronic marketplace ▪ the supply is made under a contract entered into before 1 April 2024 ▪ the time of supply for that supply takes place on or after 1 April 2024 ▪ an operator of an electronic marketplace or a listing intermediary would be treated by section 60C(2)(ab) as making the supply in the course or furtherance of its taxable activity in the absence of the transitional rule ▪ the person who would be treated as making the supply chooses that the transitional rule applies, and ▪ if the host is a registered person (or, as discussed below, in some cases if a listing intermediary is interposed between the host and the operator of the electronic marketplace), the person applying the transitional rule takes reasonable steps within a reasonable timeframe to notify the host or listing intermediary of their decision to apply the transitional rule, and to provide the host with sufficient information for them to correctly account for GST on the supply. If the above conditions are met, section 85E(2) allows the marketplace operator or listing intermediary to treat the services as not having been supplied by them. The transitional rule GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 55 of 68 would be applied by not including the relevant supplies in the ”Total sales and income” box of the person’s GST return, and by not deducting input tax for the flat-rate credit in respect of these supplies. The person does not need to notify Inland Revenue of their choice to apply the transitional rule, but they must keep evidence of their choice for a minimum period of seven years in accordance with the record keeping rules in the GST Act. As outlined above, the transitional rule only applies if section 60C(2)(ab) would apply in its absence. Section 60C(2)(ab) provides that listed services are treated as supplied by the operator of the electronic marketplace through which the supply of services is made if those services are performed, provided or received in New Zealand. In some instances, a listing intermediary (rather than the operator of the electronic marketplace) may be treated as making the supply of listed services. Provided certain conditions are met, section 60CB(7) provides that a listing intermediary is treated as the marketplace operator for the purposes of section 60C(2)(ab). This means the transitional rule can only ever be applied if the services would otherwise be treated as supplied in New Zealand by either an operator of an electronic marketplace or a listing intermediary. For instance, it would not be necessary to have the transitional rule apply to supplies by GST- registered hosts who have opted out of the application of the electronic marketplace rule in section 60C(2)(ab) using one of the available opt-out provisions. Who can choose to apply the transitional rule Only the person who would be treated as the supplier of the services if section 60C(2)(ab) applied to the supply may choose to apply the transitional rule. In other words, the transitional rule can only ever be applied by an operator of an electronic marketplace or a listing intermediary, and only if that person would otherwise be treated as making the supply. How the transitional rule applies When such a person chooses to apply the transitional rule, the choice they are making is that section 60C(2)(ab) does not apply to the supply. This means the rules for electronic marketplaces in section 60C (and, if applicable, the rules for listing intermediaries in section 60CB) do not apply to treat the services as supplied by the person. Instead, the host is the supplier for GST purposes. This means that: ▪ A person applying the transitional rule will not account for and pay output tax on the relevant supply to Inland Revenue. All requirements related to the flat-rate credit GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 56 of 68 (which only apply if section 60C(2)(ab) applies) also do not apply. This means the person applying the transitional rule should not deduct input tax for the flat-rate credit for the supply and pass this this on to the host. ▪ Any output tax liability on the supply remains with the host as per the pre-1 April 2024 rules. The host will only ever be liable to account for and pay output tax on the supply to Inland Revenue if they are a registered person making the supply in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity. A decision by a marketplace operator or listing intermediary to apply the transitional rule does not change when the supply is deemed to occur. A GST-registered host who is required to account for GST on the supply because of the transitional rule should therefore account for the output tax in their GST return for the taxable period in which time of supply occurred (being the earlier of when a payment was received or an invoice was issued for the supply). Notification requirements In situations where the transitional rule is applied for a supply and the host is required to account for and pay GST on the supply to Inland Revenue, the host would need to know they are liable for GST on the supply. A marketplace operator or listing intermediary who wishes to apply the transitional rule will in some situations only be entitled to do so on the condition they take reasonable steps to notify the host (or listing intermediary) of this decision. This notification must make it clear that the marketplace operator or listing intermediary is not liable for GST on the supply, and that this liability remains with the host. Where this requirement applies, the notification must be made within a reasonable timeframe. The marketplace operator or listing intermediary should also take reasonable steps within a reasonable timeframe to ensure the host has sufficient information to correctly account for GST on the supply to Inland Revenue. Meaning of “reasonable steps” There are two scenarios in which notifying the host should be relatively straightforward: ▪ The first scenario is where an operator of an electronic marketplace would, in the absence of the transitional rule, be responsible for output tax on the supply, and there is no listing intermediary involved in the supply. ▪ The second scenario is where a listing intermediary would, in the absence of the transitional rule, be responsible for output tax on the supply. In other words, the listing intermediary and the operator of the electronic marketplace through which the GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 57 of 68 supply is made have an agreement under section 60CB(6) that the listing intermediary is responsible for output tax on supplies of listed services. In the above scenarios, the person applying the transitional rule must take reasonable steps to notify the host only if the host has told them they are GST-registered. As a result, some marketplace operators and listing intermediaries might only want to use the transitional rule for supplies where they are entitled to assume the host is not a registered person. This approach is acceptable because the transitional rule is intended to be flexible enough to allow marketplace operators and listing intermediaries to apply it for all bookings taken before 1 April 2024 where time of supply occurs on or after that date, or only a subset of those bookings. The person applying the transitional rule must ensure the information they provide is sufficient for the host to correctly account for output tax on the relevant supplies. There is no requirement for any specific type of information to be provided, only that the information provided must simply be sufficient for this purpose. This is broad enough to include any information the marketplace operator or listing intermediary could share or provide that would enable the host to identify the relevant supplies, so that the host knows those supplies are the ones they need to account for in their GST return. For example, if the marketplace operator or listing intermediary will not be accounting for output tax on any of the host’s bookings taken before 1 April 2024, then they could make sure (in addition to telling the host) they provide the host with the dates those bookings were made, or some other statement or notification that a specific booking was made before 1 April 2024. There is a third possible scenario in which the host might need to be notified that the person is applying the transitional rule. This scenario arises where a booking is made before 1 April 2024 for accommodation that was listed on the electronic marketplace by a listing intermediary and, in the absence of the transitional rule: ▪ the operator of the electronic marketplace would be liable for output tax on the supply, not the listing intermediary, and ▪ the listing intermediary would be responsible for all requirements in respect of the supply that relate to the flat-rate credit, if applicable. This scenario (where the marketplace operator is responsible for output tax and the listing intermediary is responsible for all the requirements related to the flat-rate credit) is the default setting under the rules in section 60CB applying to listing intermediaries. In this default scenario, the marketplace operator (if applying the transitional rule) must take reasonable steps to notify the listing intermediary that they are applying the transitional rule and to provide the listing intermediary with information that is sufficient for GST-registered GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 58 of 68 hosts to correctly account for output tax on the supplies. The listing intermediary in this scenario should pass the relevant information on to GST-registered hosts within a reasonable timeframe. The marketplace operator in this scenario must take reasonable steps to provide the information to the listing intermediary regardless of whether the host providing the accommodation is a registered person. This is for two reasons: 1. In this situation, the marketplace operator is unlikely to know anything about the host, including whether they are a registered person. 2. Even if the host is not a registered person, the listing intermediary still needs the same information from the marketplace operator that, if the host was GST-registered, would enable the host to identify the supplies for which it should account for GST to Inland Revenue. In this case, the information will enable the listing intermediary to correctly identify for which supplies it should not deduct input tax for the flat-rate credit. Therefore, the “reasonable steps” requirement to notify the listing intermediary serves a dual purpose. Meaning of “reasonable timeframe” A marketplace operator or listing intermediary choosing to apply the transitional rule must take reasonable steps to provide the necessary information to GST-registered hosts and/or to listing intermediaries within a reasonable timeframe. This means the marketplace operator or listing intermediary should make their best endeavours to ensure the information is provided as soon as practicable to allow a GST-registered host to account for output tax on the relevant supplies in the correct GST return, before that return is due to Inland Revenue. At the very latest, Inland Revenue would expect the necessary information to be provided in advance of the due date for the April 2024 GST returns (being 28 May 2024). Example 26: Marketplace operator applies the transitional rule, host not registered person In January 2024, Ben books accommodation at a Whangarei bach for several days in December 2024/January 2025 through Marketplace Co, an operator of an electronic marketplace. Will, the host providing the accommodation, is not registered for GST because his supplies are below the registration threshold. The payment terms allow Ben the option of paying for the accommodation in instalments. Ben pays the first instalment in April 2024. No invoice has been issued, so GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 59 of 68 this first payment means time of supply occurs in April 2024 when the new GST rules applying to listed services are in force. Marketplace Co chooses to apply the transitional rule to this supply of accommodation, meaning that Marketplace Co would not account for GST on the supply. Marketplace Co applies the transitional rule by preparing and filing its GST return consistently with this position (that is, by not including the supply in the ”Total sales and income” box in its GST return, and by not deducting input tax for the flat-rate credit). Because there is no listing intermediary involved in the supply and Will has not notified Marketplace Co that he is a registered person, Marketplace Co is not required to take reasonable steps to notify Will of the decision to apply the transitional rule. Example 27: Reasonable steps requirement, no listing intermediary involved In November 2023, Martin books accommodation at an Auckland bed and breakfast for one night in September 2024 through Marketplace Co. Graeme’s Bed and Breakfast, the host providing the accommodation, is registered for GST but as of April 2024 has not opted out of the electronic marketplace rules. The payment terms allow Martin to pay in full when he checks in at the bed and breakfast, which he will end up doing. As of April 2024, no invoice has been issued for the supply. Marketplace Co intends to apply the transitional rule to all bookings made on its website before 1 April 2024 where time of supply will occur on or after 1 April 2024. This includes the booking made by Martin in November 2023. In early April 2024, Marketplace Co provides communications to Graeme’s Bed and Breakfast explaining that Marketplace Co will not be accounting for and paying GST on bookings taken before 1 April 2024 to Inland Revenue, and that GST on these bookings remains the legal responsibility of Graeme’s Bed and Breakfast. The date on which Martin’s booking was made is visible to Graeme’s Bed and Breakfast via the Marketplace Co platform, so Graeme’s Bed and Breakfast knows that it is required to include the supply in its GST return for the taxable period in which time of supply occurs (being when Martin pays upon checking in at the bed and breakfast if no invoice is issued before then). GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 60 of 68 Marketplace Co has taken reasonable steps within a reasonable timeframe to notify Graeme’s Bed and Breakfast of the decision to apply the transitional rule and to ensure they have sufficient information to correctly account for GST on the supply. Marketplace Co is therefore entitled to apply the transitional rule for the supply. Example 28: Marketplace operator takes reasonable steps to notify listing intermediary and host Jacob, a non-GST registered owner of a bach in Timaru, uses a listing intermediary to deal with the day-to-day management of his bach and to list it for short-term rental on the Marketplace Co website. In March 2024, a booking for a stay occurring at the bach for three nights in July 2024 is received through the Marketplace Co platform. Payment for the booking is not made until April 2024 and no invoice is issued before that, so time of supply is deemed to occur in April 2024. In early April 2024, Marketplace Co provides communications to the listing intermediary explaining that Marketplace Co will not be accounting for and paying GST on bookings taken before 1 April 2024 to Inland Revenue, and that GST on these bookings remains the legal responsibility of the accommodation hosts. In these communications, Marketplace Co advises the listing intermediary that this information will need to be passed on to GST-registered hosts so they can comply with their GST obligations. Marketplace Co also advises the listing intermediary that other relevant information that the GST-registered hosts will need to identify the bookings made before 1 April 2024 should be passed on to them, such as the dates the bookings were made (which is information that is accessible to the listing intermediary through the Marketplace Co platform). Marketplace Co has taken reasonable steps within a reasonable timeframe to notify the listing intermediary of the decision to apply the transitional rule and to ensure the GST-registered hosts for accommodation listed on the platform by the listing intermediary have sufficient information to correctly account for GST on the supplies. Because Jacob is not a registered person, the listing intermediary does not need to pass the information provided by Marketplace Co on to him. However, because Marketplace Co notified the listing intermediary that any GST liability for bookings taken before 1 April 2024 will remain with the hosts (instead of those supplies being subject to the new GST rules for listed services) and has provided sufficient information GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 61 of 68 to the listing intermediary to enable these bookings to be identified, the listing intermediary knows it should not deduct input tax for the flat-rate credit on the supplies. Consequential amendments Sections 5(11G), 8C, 10(7D), 15(6), 19NB, 26AA, 51, 60, 60H, 75 and 77 of the GST Act Several existing provisions affecting operators of electronic marketplaces have been amended to now refer to “listed services”. These amendments are consequential in nature and reflect that the marketplace rules now apply to a new category of services supplied through electronic marketplaces. GST registration Section 51 of the GST Act The rules for listed services require marketplace operators to register for, and return, GST on supplies of listed services that are performed, provided or received in New Zealand if the value of these supplies exceeds, or is expected to exceed, $60,000 in a 12-month period. Non-resident marketplace operators can use a fair and reasonable method of converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars to determine whether they have exceeded the GST registration threshold. This is provided for in section 51. Generally, the Commissioner is unable to allocate a tax file number (IRD number) to an offshore person, unless they have provided the Commissioner with evidence of their New Zealand bank account number. An exception to this requirement exists where the offshore person needs an IRD number solely because they are a non-resident supplier of goods or services under the GST Act. This exception applies to non-resident suppliers of listed services that would not need to provide evidence of a New Zealand bank account number if the only reason for obtaining a tax file number is so they can comply with their GST obligations. Taxable supply information Sections 8C(3)(a)(i) and 19NB of the GST Act The general rules for taxable supply information require the person making a taxable supply to another registered person to provide the recipient with taxable supply information for the supply. This enables the recipient of the supply to deduct input tax. Under the general rules, GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 62 of 68 taxable supply information may not need to be provided if the consideration for the supply is below a prescribed threshold. Despite the general rules for taxable supply information, section 19NB provides that for listed services, taxable supply information (and, if applicable, supply correction information) must be provided to the recipient of the listed services in all circumstances without the need for a request. The purpose of this is to ensure that the recipient of listed services will receive sufficient information enabling them to deduct input tax, if applicable, for listed services they receive. It is also intended to reduce compliance costs for marketplace operators by removing the need for them to have bespoke systems for responding to requests for taxable supply information. The rules for taxable supply information and supply correction information are explained on Inland Revenue’s website (search keyword: taxable supply information). Marketplace operators (and in some cases, listing intermediaries) are also treated as receiving supplies of listed services from underlying suppliers that operate through the electronic marketplace. No taxable supply information is required to be provided by underlying suppliers for these supplies under section 8C(3)(a)(i). Taxable periods Section 15(6) Section 15 specifies the taxable periods for GST-registered persons. The general rules for taxable periods are explained on Inland Revenue’s website. Section 15(6) provides that a non-resident marketplace operator that is treated as the supplier of listed services will have a quarterly taxable period based on a first quarter ending on 31 March. This means that a non-resident marketplace operator that supplies listed services will have the following taxable periods and due dates. Table 1: Taxable periods for non-resident marketplace operators Taxable period GST payment and return due date 1 January to 31 March 7 May 1 April to 30 June 28 July 1 July to 30 September 28 October GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 63 of 68 1 October to 31 December 28 January of the following year Marketplace operators that are tax resident in New Zealand will be subject to the ordinary rules for taxable periods. Bad debt deductions Section 26AA of the GST Act Marketplace operators may collect GST on a supply of listed services it is treated as making in one of two ways: ▪ The marketplace operator arranges for the payment from the recipient of the services to be split when the payment is processed, with the amount of GST and the marketplace operator’s facilitation fee or commission remitted to the operator, and the sale price (net of GST and the amount of the marketplace’s fee or commission on the sale) remitted to the underlying supplier of the services. ▪ The recipient of the services may pay the underlying supplier directly, and the marketplace operator collects the GST along with its fee or commission from the underlying supplier. In the second scenario, the marketplace operator may at times be unable to collect the GST from the underlying supplier. To prevent marketplace operators in this situation from being liable for GST that they are unable to collect, section 26AA will allow them to claim a bad debt deduction if: ▪ the underlying supplier fails to pass on the GST paid to them for the supply; and ▪ the operator of the marketplace has written off all amounts owed to it for the supply as a bad debt, including its fee or commission on the sale. This rule will apply to a marketplace operator that is treated as the supplier of listed services if the underlying supplier is not an associated person under section 2A, and the marketplace operator: ▪ charges the underlying supplier a fee for making the supply through the marketplace ▪ accounts for GST on the supply and provides a return for the taxable period in which the supply was made ▪ has an agreement with the underlying supplier under which the underlying supplier is required to pay, from the consideration the underlying supplier receives from the GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 64 of 68 recipient, an amount that includes the GST on the supply that the marketplace operator has accounted for, and ▪ the marketplace operator writes off as a bad debt the entire amount that the underlying supplier is required to pay (along with the entire amount of the marketplace’s fee, if not already included in this amount). Section 26AA(2) provides that the marketplace operator may deduct input tax equal to the amount of GST charged on the supply. If the marketplace operator recovers an amount of the bad debt that was written off in an earlier taxable period, section 26AA(3) requires the marketplace operator to account for an amount of output tax that is a fraction of the amount of the input tax deduction taken earlier. This fraction is calculated by dividing the amount recovered by the total amount written off. Record keeping Section 75(3F) of the GST Act GST-registered persons can apply to the Commissioner for authorisation to keep records at a place outside New Zealand or in a language other than English. Section 75(3F) overrides this requirement for a non-resident supplier of listed services. This enables non-resident suppliers of listed services to keep records outside of New Zealand or store them in a language other than English without the need for approval from the Commissioner. Use of foreign currency Section 77(2) and (3) of the GST Act Section 77(2) enables non-resident marketplace operators to account for GST on supplies of listed services they are treated as making in a foreign currency at the time of supply. This overrides the general rule that all amounts be expressed in New Zealand currency at the time of supply. Section 77(3) provides that, when converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for determining the amount of GST to be included in the GST return, the marketplace operator can use the foreign exchange rate applying at: ▪ the date of the supply ▪ the last day of the relevant taxable period GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 65 of 68 ▪ the earlier of: o the date the marketplace operator files its return for the relevant taxable period, or o the due date for filing its return for the relevant taxable period, or o another date agreed between the marketplace operator and the Commissioner. The marketplace operator may not change its currency conversion date for a period of 24 months unless they have agreed otherwise with the Commissioner. For example, it cannot choose to do the currency conversion using the exchange rate applying on the last day of the relevant taxable period if, in its GST return for the previous taxable period, it used the exchange rate applying on the date the return was filed. New Zealand resident agents Section 60(1A)(b) of the GST Act A non-resident supplier of listed services may enter into an agency agreement with a New Zealand resident agent. If this applies, the agent (instead of the non-resident principal) is treated by section 60(1AB) as supplying listed services in the course and furtherance of the agent’s taxable activity. Vouchers Section 5(11G)(a) of the GST Act Generally, the issue or sale of a token, stamp or voucher with a face value is treated as a supply of goods and services by the issuer or seller. This applies unless the supplier of the token, stamp or voucher treats the supply as arising on the redemption of the token, stamp or voucher for goods and services. If the supplier of the token, stamp or voucher treats the supply as arising on redemption, the person who redeems the token, stamp or voucher for goods and services is treated as making the supply at the time of redemption, rather than at the time the voucher was issued or sold. Section 5(11G)(a) has been amended to refer to “listed services” in addition to distantly taxable goods and remote services. This enables the seller of a face value voucher to treat GST as applying on the redemption of the voucher if the voucher is (or could be) redeemed for listed services. This is consistent with how the GST rules for vouchers apply to remote services and distantly taxable goods. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 66 of 68 Example 29: Seller of voucher opts to use redemption basis Charles buys a voucher with a face value of $100 from Smithy’s Siestas Ltd, a popular electronic marketplace through which short-stay accommodation can be booked, as a gift for his daughter, Lucy. The voucher can be redeemed for short-stay accommodation bought through Smithy’s Siestas Ltd. Smithy’s Siestas Ltd chooses to treat the supply for GST purposes as a rising on the redemption of the voucher (instead of the sale of the voucher). This means that GST will apply when Lucy redeems the voucher for listed services, and not on the sale or issue of the voucher itself. Lucy uses the voucher as a credit towards short-stay accommodation she buys through Smithy’s Siestas Ltd. Because Smithy’s Siestas Ltd is treated as the supplier of the accommodation for GST purposes (rather than the underlying supplier of the accommodation), it is required to return GST equal to $13.04 (3/23 × $100) on the redemption of the voucher. GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Page 67 of 68 Discounts Sections 10(7D) and 20(3N) of the GST Act Section 10(7D) contains a special valuation rule to deal with the situation where a marketplace operator provides discounts for remote services, distantly taxable goods, or listed services that it is treated as supplying under the marketplace rules. This special valuation rule provides that where a marketplace operator is deemed to make a supply to a recipient who accepts an offer of a discount funded by the operator, the supply is for the discounted price. This means that the amount of output tax that the marketplace operator is required to return on the supply is 3/23 of the total GST-inclusive amount paid by the recipient. However, the provision of the discount by the marketplace operator does not affect the calculation of the flat-rate credit for the underlying supplier, which is calculated as 8.5% of the GST-exclusive price the underlying supplier receives. Example 30: Marketplace operator provides a discount for listed services provided by an underlying supplier Kelvin is seeking accommodation for two nights for an upcoming trip in Kaikohe. He uses an electronic marketplace, Graeme’s Getaways Ltd, to find a bed and breakfast that suits his needs for the weekend trip. William owns a property in Kaikohe that is regularly booked through Graeme’s Getaways Ltd. He sets the price as $250 per night plus GST. The GST-inclusive price is therefore $287.50 per night ($250 + $37.50 in GST). Graeme’s Getaways Ltd offers a discount of $10 per night on the accommodation, provided it is booked well in advance of the guest’s arrival date. Kelvin accepts this offer, and so the final (GST-inclusive) price paid by Kelvin for the accommodation is $555. Graeme’s Getaways Ltd pays for the discount, so William still receives the GST- exclusive consideration of $500. Graeme’s Getaways Ltd is required to calculate output tax on the price paid by Kelvin ($555). It returns output tax on the supply equal to $72.39 (3/23 × $555). However, the discount must be ignored when calculating the amount of the flat-rate credit for William. Graeme’s Getaways Ltd deducts input tax for the flat-rate credit of $42.50 (8.5% × $500) and passes this amount on to William.

NEW LEGISLATION > Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Act 2024 > SPECIAL REPORT Offshore Gambling Duty Issued: April 2024 This special report provides early information on the new legislation for the offshore gambling duty ahead of an upcoming edition of the Tax Information Bulletin. Page 2 of 9 Special report: Offshore Gambling Duty | April 2024 Table of Contents Background ........................................................................................................................................... 3 Key Features .......................................................................................................................................... 3 Effective date ........................................................................................................................................ 4 Detailed analysis .................................................................................................................................. 4 About this document ............................................................................................................................... 9 Page 3 of 9 Special report: Offshore Gambling Duty | April 2024 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Act 2024 Sections 12S to 12X of the Gaming Duties Act 1971 From 1 July 2024, a 12% offshore gambling duty applies to online gambling provided by offshore operators to New Zealand residents. The Gaming Duties Act 1971 has been amended to include a new type of gaming duty, known as offshore gambling duty. It applies to GST-registered persons that are located outside New Zealand to the extent they make supplies of remote gambling services to New Zealand residents. The offshore gambling duty excludes amounts from betting on sports and racing because there is an existing requirement to pay “consumption charges” to the Department of Internal Affairs on these amounts. Background Under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) there are existing requirements for non- resident suppliers of remote services of gambling supplied to New Zealand residents to register and return GST on these supplies. The offshore gambling duty applies to these suppliers of remote gambling services if they are located outside New Zealand. Most of the offshore gambling duty rules have been designed to align with the existing rules for GST on remote services, to allow existing systems and calculations for GST to be adapted to apply the offshore gambling duty. The main difference from the GST rules is that the offshore gambling duty is calculated by excluding amounts for which the offshore operator is required to pay “consumption charges” to the Department of Internal Affairs. Consumption charges are 10% charges on betting on sports and racing by New Zealand residents conducted through offshore operators. Gambling provided by offshore gambling operators remains subject to GST. Key Features The key features of the offshore gambling duty are: ▪ It applies to GST-registered persons that are located outside New Zealand to the extent they make supplies of remote gambling services to New Zealand residents. Page 4 of 9 Special report: Offshore Gambling Duty | April 2024 ▪ The rate of offshore gambling duty is 12% of the offshore gambling profits. ▪ Offshore gambling profits are calculated as the amounts received from residents, minus the prizes paid to residents, minus any offshore betting amounts. ▪ Offshore gambling profits are calculated by subtracting any amounts of “offshore betting amounts” on which the offshore operator is required to pay “consumption charges” to the Department of Internal Affairs. Consumption charges are 10% charges on betting on sports and racing by New Zealand residents conducted through offshore operators. ▪ If the offshore operator has a negative amount of offshore gambling profits for a return period (because it has a greater amount of prize money paid or payable to New Zealand residents, than the amount of money it has received from residents) it will carry forward this negative amount to offset future offshore gambling profits in its next return periods. ▪ The return periods and due dates for the offshore gambling duty provide for the same three-monthly periods and due dates that apply to non-resident suppliers of remote services in respect of their GST returns. ▪ The rules for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) making an assessment of offshore gambling duty and for recovering any amount of unpaid gaming duty as a debt to the Crown, are identical to the existing rules that apply for casino duty. ▪ The disputes process, penalties and interest rules that are prescribed by the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) will apply to the offshore gambling duty. Effective date The offshore gambling duty applies to offshore gambling profits arising on or after 1 July 2024. Detailed analysis Key terms Section 12S(1) of the Gaming Duties Act defines offshore gambling operators along with the other key terms that are used to apply the offshore gambling duty. The offshore gambling duty applies to offshore gambling operators who are defined as registered persons located outside New Zealand who conduct any offshore gambling. Registered persons are persons who are either registered or liable to be registered under the GST Act. An offshore operator is required to register for GST if they make $60,000 or more of taxable supplies in a 12-month period, where taxable supplies include supplies of gambling to New Zealand residents (measured by the amount of money received from residents, minus prize money paid out to residents). Page 5 of 9 Special report: Offshore Gambling Duty | April 2024 Offshore gambling means any gambling or prize competition supplied through remote services that are physically performed outside New Zealand that a person who is resident in New Zealand pays an amount of money to participate in. The offshore gambling duty does not apply to existing online products offered by the Lotteries Commission (operating as Lotto NZ) and TAB NZ. This is because these operators use entities that are located within New Zealand to conduct their online gambling operations. Under the Gambling Act 2003, it is generally illegal for operators who are located within New Zealand to conduct remote interactive (ie, online) gambling, with exceptions for the Lotteries Commission and TAB NZ. The offshore gambling duty applies to offshore websites owned by New Zealand casinos because this gambling is conducted by entities that are located outside New Zealand. Remote services are defined using the same definition as how remote services are defined in the GST Act. Remote services are a service, that at the time it is performed, there is no necessary connection between the place where the service is physically performed and the location of the recipient of the service. That is, the service provider and the recipient could be in different locations. This definition includes online gambling services. Calculating offshore gambling profits The rate of the offshore gambling duty is 12% of the offshore gambling profits. Offshore gambling profits are calculated under section 12T of the Gaming Duties Act by using the following formula: amounts received from residents − prizes paid to residents − offshore betting amounts When measuring the “amounts received from residents” and “prizes paid to residents”, it is intended that the offshore gambling operator will be able to use the same values that they calculate for the GST remote services rules. This is because equivalent terms are used in the formula used to determine the amount of consideration in section 10(14B) of the GST Act. However, a difference from the GST calculation is that the offshore gambling profits are calculated by subtracting “offshore betting amounts”. Offshore betting amounts are the total amount in money on which consumption charges are payable under section 113 of the Racing Industry Act 2020. The offshore betting amounts arise from bets placed by New Zealand residents on sports and racing events where there is a requirement to pay “point of consumption charges” to the Department of Internal Affairs. The offshore gambling profits are determined for supplies of offshore gambling for which the “time of supply” under section 9 of the GST Act has occurred for the return period. The Page 6 of 9 Special report: Offshore Gambling Duty | April 2024 GST remote services rules also use the same “time of supply” rules. Under these rules, the supply occurs for each amount received (the bet) on the date on which the first drawing or determination of the corresponding gambling result (or prize competition) commences. The foreign currency rules in section 77 of the GST Act apply for determining the New Zealand dollar amounts of offshore gambling profits. This is intended to allow the offshore gambling operators to use the same foreign currency conversions as they already use for GST purposes. Section 77 of the GST Act generally requires amounts of money be expressed in New Zealand dollars at the time of supply. Alternatively, the non-resident supplier (the offshore gambling operator) can make an election to express the amounts in a foreign currency. If they elect to use a foreign currency, they must use one of the methods in section 77(3) to convert the foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollar amounts and must maintain the same conversion method for at least 24 months unless the Commissioner agrees otherwise. Example 1: Online casino games only An offshore gambling operator conducts online casino games that are supplied to New Zealand residents. In the three-month period between 1 July 2024 and 30 September 2024, it receives $151.5 million of bets from New Zealand residents and these residents have been paid or credited prizes valued at $140 million. The operator’s offshore gambling profits for the return period are $11.5 million ($151.5 million minus $140 million). The 12% offshore gambling duty applies to the offshore gambling profits. The operator files a return and pays $1.38 million of offshore gambling duty to Inland Revenue on or before 28 October 2024. For the same three-month period, the operator files a GST return and pays GST of $1.5 million (3/23rds of the $11.5 million of consideration for the remote services of gambling by New Zealand residents) to Inland Revenue on or before 28 October 2028. Page 7 of 9 Special report: Offshore Gambling Duty | April 2024 Example 2: Online gambling including sports betting An offshore gambling operator conducts online casino games, tickets to instant prize competitions and sports betting. In the three-month period between 1 July 2024 and 30 September 2024, it receives $246 million from bets/ticket sales to New Zealand residents and these residents have been paid or credited prizes valued at $200 million. These amounts include $100 million of sports bets and $70 million of prizes paid or credited on the sports bets. The operator is required to pay consumption charges to the Department of Internal Affairs on the $30 million of offshore betting amounts ($100 million minus $70 million) from these sports bets. The operator’s offshore gambling profits for the return period are: $246 million − $200 million − $30 million = $16 million The 12% offshore gambling duty applies to the offshore gambling profits. The operator files a return and pays $1.92 million of offshore gambling duty to Inland Revenue on or before 28 October 2024. For the same three-month period, the operator files a GST return and pays GST of $6 million (3/23rds of the $46 million of consideration for the remote services of gambling by New Zealand residents) to Inland Revenue on or before 28 October 2028. For the same three-month period, the operator will pay consumption charges of $3 million (10% of the $30 million of offshore betting amounts from the sports bets) to the Department of Internal Affairs. If the only gambling products that an offshore gambling operator supplies to New Zealand residents (for a return period) are sports and/or racing bets on which they are required to pay consumption charges, their offshore gambling profits will be nil. They are still required to register for the offshore gambling duty and file a return including a nil value of offshore gambling profits for the relevant return period. If the offshore gambling operator has a negative amount of offshore gambling profits for a return period (because it has a greater amount of prize money paid or payable to New Zealand residents than the amount of money it has received from residents), it will carry forward this negative amount to offset future offshore gambling profits in its next return periods. Page 8 of 9 Special report: Offshore Gambling Duty | April 2024 Return periods and due dates for return filing and payment The return periods and due dates for the offshore gambling duty are the same periods and due dates that already apply to non-resident suppliers of remote services in respect of their GST returns. The return periods are the period of three consecutive calendar months ending on the last day of either March, June, September or December. In other words, they are for quarterly periods with the first period commencing on 1 July 2024 and ending on 30 September 2024. Section 12V of the Gaming Duties Act requires that returns for offshore gambling duty must be filed on or before: ▪ 28 October for the return period and ending on 30 September ▪ 28 January for the return period ending 31 December ▪ 7 May for the return period ending 31 March, and ▪ 28 July for the return period ending 30 June. Section 12W of the Gaming Duties Act requires that the offshore gambling duty must be paid to Inland Revenue no later than the relevant due date that the offshore gambling return must be filed for the corresponding return period. Assessments, challenges, disputes process, penalties and interest The rules for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue making an assessment of offshore gambling duty and for recovering any amount of unpaid gaming duty as a debt to the Crown, are identical to the existing rules that apply for casino duty. This is provided for by section 12X of the Gaming Duties Act. Similar rules also apply for gaming machine duty, aside from existing section 12K(2) of the Gaming Duties Act, which sets out a joint and several liability rule that only applies to gaming machine duty. Section 12K(2) does not apply to casino duty and also does not apply to the offshore gambling duty. The disputes process and challenges rules that are prescribed by Parts 4A and 8 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) apply to the offshore gambling duty. The tax penalties of the TAA also apply to gaming duties, including the offshore gambling duty. Existing section 15 of the Gaming Duties Act references the fact that Part 9 (Penalties) of the TAA applies to gaming duty. Use of money interest applies to unpaid amounts of gaming duty under Part 7 (Interest) of the TAA. This is because the definition of “tax” in the TAA includes gaming duty.

Background The IWTC is the key instrument to “make work pay” within the wider context of the Working for Families package. It supports low- to middle-income working families whose members take up and stay in employment, rather than remaining on a benefit. It achieves this by providing a boost to the family’s income once members begin working. Key features  The IWTC base rate has been increased from $3,770 per year to $5,070 per year. This represents a $25 increase in weekly income.  The maximum weekly entitlement for a family of up to three children has increased from $72.50 to $97.50.  The additional child rate remains at $15 more per week.  Working for Families is an annual entitlement that is paid on a tax year basis. Sections MF 4J and MF 4K introduce a method to allow the old rate and new rate to be used for different periods in the 2024–25 tax year. The previous IWTC amount of $3,770 will be used to calculate IWTC entitlements until 30 July 2024. Effective date The amendment applies from 31 July 2024. However, part-year amendments apply from 1 April 2024. These allow the old rate and new rate to be used for different periods in the 2024–25 tax year. Page 4 of 16 Special report - Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2024 | June 2024 Minimum family tax credit Sections ME 1, MF 4J and MF 4K of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendment adjusts the minimum family tax credit (MFTC) threshold to $35,316 after tax. This will ensure that MFTC recipients benefit from the personal income tax changes and the increase to the IWTC. Background The MFTC is one of the Working for Families tax credits. Its purpose is to incentivise people at the margin with dependent children to move off the benefit and into full-time work. The MFTC achieves this by “topping up” the incomes of working families to an amount that is more than what they could potentially receive on a benefit. The IWTC and the MFTC work together to top up a person’s income to ensure that they are financially better off in work without a main benefit. The change made to the IWTC will automatically flow through to MFTC recipients by keeping the MFTC threshold at its current level. However, for every dollar a family earns over the MFTC threshold, their MFTC entitlement reduces by a dollar. As such, the MFTC threshold has been increased to ensure that a family’s entitlement is not reduced by reason of them gaining tax relief from the personal income tax rate changes. Key features  The MFTC threshold has been increased from $35,204 per year (after tax) to $35,316 per year (after tax). This represents a $2.15 increase in weekly income.  This change, in conjunction with the increase to the IWTC, will increase recipients’ income by approximately $27.15 per week.  Working for Families is an annual entitlement that is paid on a tax year basis. Sections MF 4J and MF 4K introduce a method to allow the old threshold and new threshold to be applied for the payment of instalments for different periods in the 2024–25 tax year. The previous MFTC amount of $35,204 will be used to calculate MFTC entitlements until 30 July 2024. Page 5 of 16 Special report - Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2024 | June 2024 Effective date The amendment applies from 31 July 2024. However, part-year amendments apply from 1 April 2024. These allow the old threshold and new threshold to be applied for the payment of instalments for different periods in the 2024– 25 tax year. Page 6 of 16 Special report - Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2024 | June 2024 Personal income tax Section RD 50(2) and (3), and schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; schedules 5 and 8 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Amendments enacted in the Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2024 increase three of the personal income tax thresholds with effect from 31 July 2024. These changes reduce the amount of tax a person is required to pay on their personal income. The Act also contains consequential changes to other tax types that are based on personal tax rates and thresholds These take effect from 31 July 2024 and 1 April 2025. Key features The Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2024 enacts changes to the personal income tax thresholds. The previous and new thresholds are set out below: Previous threshold New threshold Threshold rate $0 – $14,000 $0 – $15,600 10.5% $14,001 – $48,000 $15,601 – $53,500 17.5% $48,001 – $70,000 $53,501 – $78,100 30% $70,001 – $180,000 $78,101 – $180,000 33% $180,001+ $180,001+ (No change) 39% The key features of the changes are:  Composite personal income tax rates and thresholds that will take effect from 1 April 2024 to be applicable only for the 2024–25 tax year to give effect to the mid-year threshold changes.  References to previous personal income tax thresholds replaced with the new thresholds to determine certain tax codes and rates, and the correct rate for the purposes of reportable income.  A change to resident withholding tax (RWT), which is dependent on the personal income tax rates and thresholds.  A change to the formula to calculate fringe benefit tax (FBT) payable. Page 7 of 16 Special report - Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2024 | June 2024 Effective date The changes have two effective dates:  1 April 2024 for: o composite personal income tax rates and thresholds, and o the formula to calculate FBT  31 July 2024 for: o RWT o certain tax codes and rates o reporting of income information by individuals and treatment of certain amounts. Detailed analysis Changes effective from 1 April 2024 Composite rates The new tax thresholds take effect from 31 July 2024. To accommodate this mid-year change, composite tax rates will apply for tax calculations for the full year. For PAYE, the previous tax thresholds apply for the first three months and 30 days of the 2024–25 tax year, and the new thresholds apply for the remaining eight months and one day of the tax year. New Zealand’s PAYE system is very accurate at withholding the correct amount of tax through the year. However, because the thresholds have changed part-way through the year, two sets of thresholds will be applicable in a single tax year and there is a risk that people will pay too much or too little tax. To try to mitigate this, an average of the new and old rates will be applied across the entire year to determine a person’s annual tax liability. This is a composite rate. These composite rates and thresholds are used for Inland Revenue’s end-of-year “square-up” calculations, which assess a taxpayer’s income against the amount of tax paid over that income year (and may still result in a tax refund or liability). The composite rates and thresholds applicable from 1 April 2024 that will be applied for the 2024–25 tax year are: Page 8 of 16 Special report - Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2024 | June 2024 Example 1: Tax liability for the 2024–25 tax year using composite rates and thresholds Manraj earns $75,000 in the 2024–25 tax year. Manraj’s tax liability for the tax year will be calculated using the composite rates and thresholds, which would mean:  the first $14,000 will be taxed at 10.5%  every dollar earned between $14,001 and $15,600 will be taxed at 12.82%  every dollar earned between $15,601 and $48,000 will be taxed at 17.5%,  every dollar earned between $48,001 and $53,500 will be taxed at 21.64%,  every dollar earned between $53,501 and $70,000 will be taxed at 30%, and  every dollar earned after $70,001 until $75,000 will be taxed at 30.99%. Composite tax thresholds Composite tax rates 0 – $14,000 10.5% $14,001 – $15,600 12.82% $15,601 – $48,000 17.5% $48,001 – $53,500 21.64% $53,501 – $70,000 30% $70,001 – $78,100 30.99% $78,101 – $180,000 33% $180,001+ 39% Page 9 of 16 Special report - Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2024 | June 2024 Changes to FBT calculation for the attribution method The previous formula is designed to calculate the FBT payable assuming personal income tax and FBT rates are essentially the same. However, because the changes to the personal income tax and FBT thresholds become effective at different dates, the previous formula would have resulted in an amount of FBT payable that effectively claws back the tax relief the new personal income tax thresholds provide for the 2024–25 tax year. The new formula prevents this. The formula is: Tax on all-inclusive pay − FBT on net cash pay. Where:  all-inclusive pay is the sum of net cash pay and the value of taxable fringe benefits received by the employee  net cash pay is the cash left in hand of the employee after tax, ie: cash pay − tax on cash pay. Example 2: FBT liability for the 2024–25 tax year using the new formula Abby earns a salary of $14,000 and receives a fringe benefit that has a taxable value of $10,000 in the 2024–25 tax year. Abby’s employer’s FBT liability for the tax year using the new formula will be: $3,590.77 − $1,469.77 = $2,121.00 Where:  $12,530 is the net cash pay, ie, salary less the personal income tax payable on the salary $14,000 – ($14,000 x 10.5%) = $12,530  $3,590.77 is the tax on all-inclusive pay, ie, amount of FBT payable on the sum of the net cash pay ($12,530) and value of the fringe benefit ($10,000), and  $1,469.77 is the FBT payable on net cash pay ($12,530). Consequential changes effective from 31 July 2024 The rates and thresholds for consequential tax types are based on personal income tax rates and thresholds. Examples of consequential tax types include RWT, FBT, employer superannuation contribution tax, retirement scheme contribution tax and the prescribed investor rates. Page 10 of 16 Special report - Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2024 | June 2024 Rates and thresholds for consequential tax types are calculated using the personal income tax settings, which means calculating and implementing a mid-year change could create compliance challenges for employers and payroll service providers who are likely to need more time to adjust their systems. The Government has therefore decided that most changes to consequential tax types will be deferred to take effect from 1 April 2025, except for changes to RWT. The 1 April 2025 changes will be discussed in the August Tax Information Bulletin. Changes to RWT The changes to RWT apply with effect from 31 July 2024 alongside the personal income tax threshold changes. Because interest and dividends are included in a taxpayer’s personal income tax calculation at the end of the year, RWT rates will not change. However, people will be able to elect the 10.5% rate if they expect their total income to be less than the lowest personal income tax threshold of $15,600. Some customers who have elected higher RWT rates are likely to advise payers of resident withholding income that they wish to change their elected tax rates following the increases to the personal income tax thresholds. The limited changes to RWT are not expected to require payers of resident withholding income to make major changes. Page 11 of 16 Special report - Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2024 | June 2024 Independent earner tax credit Sections LC 13, LC 14 and LC 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Amendments enacted in the Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2024 change the independent earner tax credit (IETC) settings so that the credit begins abating at $66,000 and fully abates at $70,000. The amendment thus ensures that people can continue to receive IETC at higher income levels. Background Under existing rules, a taxpayer is entitled to the IETC if they earn between $24,000 and $48,000 per year, at a maximum amount of $520 per year ($10 per week). They receive the maximum IETC available when they earn between $24,000 and $44,000 per tax year, receive reduced IETC if they earn more than $44,000 per tax year, and become ineligible once they earn more than $48,000. The maximum amount receivable is $520 per year ($10 per week). The changes will increase the threshold where abatement begins and the threshold where taxpayers are no longer eligible to receive the IETC. The existing and new settings are set out below. Eligibility starts Abatement starts No longer eligible Current $24,000 13 cents per dollar earned over $44,000 $48,000 New $24,000 (no change) 13 cents per dollar earned over $66,000 $70,000 However, even if a taxpayer earns within the income thresholds, they become ineligible for any months in which they receive a main benefit, student allowance, New Zealand superannuation or veteran’s pension or are eligible to receive Working for Families tax credits. Key features The key features of the amendments are:  The personal income threshold at which the abatement begins changes from $44,000 to $66,000. Page 12 of 16 Special report - Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2024 | June 2024  The personal income threshold at which taxpayers will no longer be eligible to receive any amount of IETC increases from $48,000 to $70,000.  The method to calculate a taxpayer’s IETC entitlement for the tax year ending 31 March 2025 uses separate calculations for the period from 1 April 2024 to 30 July 2024 and for the period from 31 July 2024 to 31 March 2025. This is only applicable for the 2024–25 tax year to give effect to the mid-year setting changes. Effective date The amendments would take effect from 31 July 2024. Detailed analysis Composite calculation for the 2024–25 tax year The current IETC settings will apply for the first three months and 30 days of the 2024–25 tax year, and the new settings will apply for the remaining eight months and a day of the tax year. A composite calculation is provided to calculate a taxpayer’s full year entitlement to account for two sets of IETC settings being applicable in one year. Example 1: Annual IETC entitlement with ineligible months under the new settings Alvien earns $66,000 in the 2025–26 tax year. He becomes eligible for and receives Working for Families from March 2026. He is entitled to receive IETC from April 2025 to February 2026 because he receives no main benefit or government support and earns more than $24,000 but less than the new maximum threshold of $66,000. However, he is no longer entitled to receive IETC from March 2026 even though he earns less than the new maximum threshold because he receives Working for Families. Alvien’s IETC entitlement for the tax year will therefore be: ($520 – 0) x (11/12) = $477.66. Where:  $0 is the amount of abatement under the new settings (13 cents x $0)  11 is the number of credit period months, ie, the months Alvien is eligible to receive IETC in the 2025–26 tax year. Page 13 of 16 Special report - Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2024 | June 2024 For 1 April 2024 to 30 July 2024, the IETC entitlement is calculated using the formula: (person’s credit – full year abatement) x credit period days ÷ 365. Where:  a person’s credit is either $520 if the taxpayer’s net income for the tax year is equal to or more than $24,000, but $0 if the net income is less than $24,000 or more than $48,000  full year abatement is the total of 13 cents per dollar earned over $44,000 for the tax year  credit period days is the number of whole days in the period 1 April 2024 to 30 July 2024. For 31 July 2024 to 31 March 2025, the IETC entitlement is calculated using the formula: (person’s credit − full year abatement) x credit period days ÷ 365. Where:  a person’s credit is either $520 if the taxpayer’s net income for the tax year is equal to or more than $24,000, but $0 if the net income is less than $24,000 or more than $70,000  full year abatement is the total of 13 cents per dollar earned over $66,000 for the tax year  credit period days is the number of whole days the taxpayer in the period 31 July 2024 to 31 March 2025. Therefore, the calculation for the 2024–25 tax year is: Period 1 Period 2 ((($P – X) x 121/365) + (($P – Y) x244/365)) x EM/12. Where:  Period 1 refers to when the current settings apply (1 April 2024 to 30 July 2024), and Period 2 refers to when the proposed new settings apply (31 July 2024 to 31 March 2025)  $P = either $520 if the taxpayer earns more than $24,000 but less than the maximum threshold of the applicable setting, or $0 if the taxpayer earns less than $24,000 or more than the maximum threshold of the applicable setting  X = amount of abatement under the old settings Page 14 of 16 Special report - Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2024 | June 2024  Y = amount of abatement under the new settings  EM = number of full months the taxpayer was not ineligible for the IETC due to receiving a main benefit, student allowance, New Zealand superannuation or veteran’s pension or being eligible to receive Working for Families. Eligible months will continue to be determined on an annual basis. This means that the total combined IETC amount from periods 1 and 2 will then be multiplied by the number of eligible months divided by 12. Example 2: Annual IETC entitlement using composite calculation Elizabeth earns $45,000 in the 2024–25 tax year. Elizabeth is entitled to IETC because she receives no main benefit or government support and earns more than $24,000 but less than the maximum thresholds of both the current and new settings – $48,000 and $70,000. Elizabeth’s $45,000 annual income is $1,000 above the beginning of the abatement zone for the period up to 30 July 2024. Elizabeth’s IETC entitlement for the tax year will be calculated using the composite calculation, which would mean: ((($520 - $130) x 121/365) + (($520 – 0) x 244/365)) x 12/12 = $476.90. Where:  $130 is the amount of the abatement under the settings applicable for 1 April 2024 to 30 July 2024 (13 cents x $1,000)  121 is the number of days the settings applicable for 1 April 2024 to 30 July 2024 apply  $0 is the amount of the abatement under the settings applicable for 31 July 2024 to 31 March 2025 (13 cents x $0)  244 is the number of days the settings applicable for 31 July 2024 to 31 March 2025 apply  12 is the number of whole months Elizabeth was eligible for IETC. Page 15 of 16 Special report - Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2024 | June 2024 R&D Tax Incentive: Filing under incorrect entity name Sections 33G, 68CB, and 68CC of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The amendments enable the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to amend an approval of a person enrolled in the Research and Development Tax Incentive (RDTI) in instances where the person has applied for approval using an incorrect entity name. Background For a person to be able to claim a tax credit through the RDTI regime, they must apply for approval (either a general approval of their activities or a criteria and methodologies approval) and then submit a supplementary return containing their research and development (R&D) expenditure for the year. In a wholly-owned group situation, approval must be sought in the name of the entity undertaking the R&D. If, for example, approval was applied for and given to a parent company when its wholly-owned subsidiary company was the entity undertaking the R&D, then RDTI tax credits would not be processed for either entity if the time to vary that approval had elapsed. Key features  A person can apply to the Commissioner to amend the name of an entity in an RDTI approval if they have incorrectly named another entity within the same wholly-owned group in the approval.  If a person has an application to amend a name in an RDTI approval accepted, they have 30 days to subsequently file a supplementary return in the correct entity’s name. Effective date The amendments apply for the 2021–22 and later income years.

[All GST dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[GST (goods and services tax)])

Special supplies are different from the normal business sales or purchases.

Show all

Accommodation

The supply of accommodation in a dwelling (such as a residential tenancy) is exempt from GST.

GST-registered hotels, motels, other commercial dwellings, hospitals or short-term accommodation providers must charge GST on domestic goods and services. 

If you're a GST-registered provider, and your guest stays for 4 weeks or more, how you calculate the GST on the accommodation depends on whether it's a residential establishment or not.

Here are the full details.

[GST on short-stay and commercial accommodation](/property/commercial-property/gst-and-commercial-accommodation)

Advance payments

A supplier who receives advance or progress payments must account for GST on the payments.

For example, a payment from a marketing board to a grower is accounted for as follows:

The grower includes the payment in their total sales in the GST return period they receive it.

If, for some reason, they have to pay back all or part of the advance, it will be treated as a loan. The advance will be exempt from GST because it is a financial service.

The grower should ask us to amend the return that included the advance payment.

The marketing board may claim a GST credit for the advance payment made, if they hold sufficient records.

If the advance is later repaid, the repayment must be included in the total sales. Any interest is exempt, as it is a financial service.

A GST-registered agent who is involved in the transaction must account for GST on any commission or fee.

Agents

Special rules apply if a New Zealand agent who is registered for GST acts on behalf of a non-resident principal who is outside New Zealand, and not registered for GST.

New Zealand agent buying supplies for a non-resident principal
--------------------------------------------------------------

The agent may, in certain circumstances, claim GST incurred when importing or exporting goods to or from New Zealand or arranging transportation.

Non-resident principal contracts services agent to sell and distribute their goods
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In some cases, a non-resident, non-registered principal may wish to sell goods in New Zealand but does not want to have a place of business here. They may contract the services of an agent to sell and distribute their goods.

If the New Zealand GST-registered agent and the principal agree, the agent is responsible for returning GST on the sale of the goods instead of the non-resident. The agent can claim GST incurred when importing the goods into New Zealand.

Example: Art gallery

A non-resident art gallery decides to sell several pieces of art in New Zealand. The gallery arranges for a GST-registered agent in New Zealand to carry out the sale. The agent agrees to act as the supplier and importer of the artwork for the art gallery. The agent may claim for any GST paid to import the goods and is responsible for charging GST on the sale of the artwork in New Zealand.

Auctions and auctioneers

**Who owns the goods**

Ownership of goods under auction never passes to the auctioneer.

The auctioneers sell goods on behalf of other people, called principals. The auctioneer may not know whether the principals are registered for GST, or whether to charge GST on a particular lot.

**Charging GST on the goods**

The sale of goods on behalf of a non-registered principal is not taxable. The sale of a registered person's private assets is generally not taxable.

The auctioneer can charge and account for GST as though making the taxable supply, as long as both principal and auctioneer agree to this arrangement.

If the principal is registered, the GST-inclusive sale price, less commission, is passed on to the principal who must account for GST.

If the principal is not registered, the auctioneer will pass the GST-exclusive sale price, less commission, on to the principal.

An auctioneer who is registered for GST must account for the GST on fees or commissions.

Auctions may be conducted on either a GST-inclusive or a GST-exclusive basis. It should be stated at the beginning of the auction, so the bidders know if their bids include GST.

Coin and token-operated machines

**Supplying goods or services through a coin-operated device or machine**

If you supply goods or services through any coin-operated device or machine, such as a video game, snack machine or parking meter, you must account for the total value of the coins removed from the machine.

Include the amount in the return covering the date you removed the coins.

**Making a supply through a token-operated device or machine**

If you make a supply through a token-operated device or machine, you account for the tokens in the same way as other tokens, stamps or vouchers. The supplier should treat the token as a supply for GST purposes at the time the customer buys them.

**Receiving business goods or services through a coin or token-operated machine**

If you receive business goods or services through a coin or token-operated machine, you may claim a GST credit in the period you paid the money.

Door to door sales

If you're a door-to-door salesperson
------------------------------------

The time of supply is the first day after the period the purchaser may cancel the sale in. Your buyers have either 7 days or 1 month to cancel the sale, depending on the cancellation period.

You account for the supply in the taxable period covering the day after the final date for cancellation.

For example, a door-to-door salesperson, sells an item on 31 May, the last day of the taxable period. The 8th day after the sale is 8 June. They include the full price for the supply in the taxable period covering 8 June.

Purchasing from a door-to-door salesperson
------------------------------------------

You can claim a credit in the return covering the first day after the cancellation period, provided you hold sufficient records.

This applies even if you get an invoice or make payment before that date.

Finance leases

Time of supply for GST
----------------------

The time of supply rule you need to use depends on the type of [finance lease](/api/glossary/item?id={613DDE7C-ABCD-4D45-B0C8-D7DC1E0C668C})
.

*   For an agreement to hire, treat each supply as taking place at the earlier of when a payment is due or when you receive it. An agreement to hire is a financial arrangement where each payment or instalment is treated as a separate supply for GST purposes and the goods are treated as supplied with each payment or instalment during the life of the arrangement.
*   For a hire purchase agreement, the time of supply is the time you entered into the agreement.
*   For any other finance lease, the ordinary rule applies. The time of supply is the earlier of the time the supplier issues the invoice or receives a payment for that supply. 

Calculating the GST
-------------------

The GST part of the payment is calculated based on the cash price of the goods under the arrangement. Multiply the amount of payment by 3, divide by 23 to work out the GST. 

The difference between the cash price and the total amount you pay under the finance lease is the finance charge. These are exempt from GST.

Foreign currency payments

If payment for goods or services is made in a foreign currency, convert it to New Zealand dollars using the exchange rate applying at the time the goods or services were supplied.

To claim a GST credit, you must hold sufficient records to support the New Zealand currency amount.

Full price not known at time of supply

Sometimes a final price is not settled until after the goods are physically supplied.

### Selling goods

If you are selling goods where the full price is not known and you use the invoice or hybrid basis, include the GST for the known price in the earliest taxable period:

*   an invoice is issued for any part of the supply
*   when a payment is due
*   when a payment is received.

### Purchasing goods

If you purchase goods where the full price is not known, and you use the invoice basis, claim the GST for the known price in the earliest taxable period:

*   you receive an invoice for any part of the supply
*   you make a payment
*   a payment is due.

Include the total amount invoiced, due or paid.

For purchases under the payments or hybrid basis, you claim a credit when you make a payment.

Gaming machines

Gaming machines are constructed, designed or adapted for use in gambling.

Gaming machine duty and GST
---------------------------

If you operate gaming machines, you should be registered for and pay gaming machine duty for each calendar month for all machines.

You must also pay GST on the value of the gaming machine revenue, based on:

*   the increase in metered [turnover](/api/glossary/item?id={B7A7B2F3-9E68-4DDF-ACED-28BE96F1F811})
    
*   less the increase in metered total wins during a return period.

If the jackpot figure is not included in the metered total wins, then the amount of any jackpots won during the return period is also deducted from total turnover.

Calculating gaming machine revenue
----------------------------------

Calculate the gaming machine revenue for GST purposes from the information provided in the record keeping requirements for the Department of Internal Affairs.

If your monthly machine analysis reports or cashless gaming machine analysis reports are prepared to coincide with the last day of your taxable periods, the report(s) can be used to calculate the gaming machine revenue.

Paying problem gambling levy
----------------------------

A problem gambling levy is also payable on gaming machine profits. The problem gambling levy is calculated at 1.08% of all gaming machine profits plus GST. You may claim back the GST on problem gambling levy.

Goods imported through NZ Customs

People on the invoice basis claim GST in full in the period any payment is made or invoice received.

People on the payments basis claim GST in the return when a payment is made.

Grants and subsidies

Grants and subsidies from the Crown or public authorities are considered to include GST if the recipient is registered for GST. Include the full grant or subsidy in the 'Total sales and income' section of your return. 

Exceptions
----------

An exception is grants intended for overseas use for international development. You will have to return GST only on the portion of the grant allocated for administration and capacity building in New Zealand.

Taxable supply information
--------------------------

If you get a grant or subsidy from a government department, you do not normally need to provide taxable supply information. However, if you get a grant or subsidy, such as a research grant from another registered person, you will probably be asked to provide taxable supply information.

If you pay a grant or subsidy in exchange for [taxable supplies](/api/glossary/item?id={07FA406A-D39C-4573-B445-274D0F443A3F})
, you may ask for taxable supply information and claim a GST credit as usual.

Example: George's wage subsidy

George employs 10 staff. He receives a wage subsidy of $200 per week for 8 weeks. The GST content would be $208.69.

$200 x 8 (weeks) = $1,600

$1,600 x 3/23 = $208.69

George includes $1,600 with sales in his return.

Hire purchase agreements

Hire purchase sales
-------------------

You must account for all hire purchase sales in the taxable period covering the date you enter into the agreement. This rule applies to whichever [accounting basis](/api/glossary/item?id={5832934C-6FA4-4D0B-B892-7AB87138EE23})
 you use.

Buying goods on hire purchase
-----------------------------

If you buy goods on hire purchase, you may claim a deduction in the taxable period covering the date you enter into the agreement. This rule applies to whichever accounting basis you use.

Calculating the GST component
-----------------------------

The GST component of the payment is calculated based on the cash price of the goods under the arrangement. Multiply the amount of payment by 3, and divide by 23 to work out the GST. 

The difference between the cash price and the amount of instalments you must pay, are finance charges. These are exempt from GST.

Example: Rebecca's carpet

Rebecca sells a carpet on hire purchase to Emily on 7 June. The cash price is $550 including GST.

The agreement is for 36 monthly payments of $23, totalling $828. Rebecca accounts for the sale on the cash price of the goods ($550) in the period covering 7 June.

Emily also claims for her purchase on the cash price of the goods ($550) in the period covering 7 June. The difference of $278 is the finance charge, which is an exempt supply.

Imported services

GST applies to certain supplies of services imported to New Zealand. For example:

*   management
*   legal and accounting services
*   products downloaded online.

Reverse charge
--------------

If you are receiving imported services from an overseas supplier you may need to account for GST on the cost of the services, whether you are currently registered for GST or not. This is called ‘reverse charge’.

The reverse charge requires you to pay GST of 15% based on the price of the services.

The reverse charge applies if the intended percentage of use or the actual taxable use of the imported services is less than 95% of the total use. There are special provisions if you are receiving the imported services from a non-resident member of the same GST group.

A person required to pay GST under the reverse charge is treated as the supplier of the services for registration purposes, payment of output tax and record keeping.

[Records for imported services](https://www.ird.govt.nz/gst/charging-gst/special-supplies/records-for-imported-services)

Accounting for and paying the GST      
---------------------------------------

You include the GST amount in your return and pay it to us if all the following apply.

*   Services are supplied by a non-resident supplier to a New Zealand-resident consumer.
*   Services are acquired by a person who estimates at the time of acquisition that the percentage of intended taxable use is less than 95%, or determines at the end of the adjustment period that the percentage of actual taxable use is less than 95%.
*   The supply of services would be a taxable supply if it were made in New Zealand by a registered person in the course of their [taxable activity](/api/glossary/item?id={F966147A-3408-4CDD-A965-AF294365FA2D})
    .

You may need to register for GST
--------------------------------

If you are not registered for GST and the value of imported services takes your [turnover](/api/glossary/item?id={B7A7B2F3-9E68-4DDF-ACED-28BE96F1F811})
 above the $60,000 threshold, you will have to register for GST.

[Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 28, No 6, July 2016](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/tib/volume-28---2016/tib-vol28-no6)

Insurance

If you receive an insurance payment relating to your [taxable activity](/api/glossary/item?id={F966147A-3408-4CDD-A965-AF294365FA2D})
, you must include the GST content as an adjustment in the return covering the time you received the payment.

What you don't need to account for
----------------------------------

Some accident compensation receipts do not need to be returned. However, the insurer will still charge GST on the premiums for this type of cover.

You do not have to account for payments received under a life insurance contract, as the insurer cannot charge GST on the premiums.

What insurers can claim for
---------------------------

Some types of insurance premiums are liable for GST, such as fire and general insurance. A registered insurer may claim deductions for payments to policy holders when they are made.

The insurer needs to keep records to deduct any other payments for claims on policies, such as a payment to a panelbeater for repairs to an insured vehicle.

An insurer cannot claim for payments made under life insurance policies. 

Example: Graham's fire

Graham's distilling equipment was damaged by fire on 20 January. On March 18 his insurance company pays $4,600 for the damage.

Graham includes an adjustment for $600 ($4,600 x 3 divided by 23) in his return covering 18 March.

Layby sales

Time of supply
--------------

For GST purposes, the time of supply is the date the title of the asset passes to the purchaser. If the sale is cancelled and the seller keeps part of the money, the time of supply is the date of cancellation.

Accounting for the payments
---------------------------

Include the full cost of a layby sale in the return period the purchaser takes ownership of the goods. This is the time of the final payment.

Even if you use the payments basis, do not account for the lay-by payments as you receive each one, but wait until you receive the final payment.

For example, Marilyn buys an electronic keyboard on layby from Music Ltd in January. The full price is $560. Marilyn pays $160 deposit, and instalments of $200 in February and March. The keyboard is delivered in April. Marilyn accounts for GST in her return covering March, when the final payment was made and ownership changed.

When a lay-by sale is cancelled
-------------------------------

If a layby sale is cancelled and the retailer keeps some of the payments already made, or receives payments later, this amount is accounted for in the return for the period the sale was cancelled in. GST is calculated on the full amount kept, or received later, and must be included in the return. 

For example, Marilyn (see above example) cancels the agreement in February and is refunded $300. She loses $60. Music Ltd accounts for it in the GST return covering February.

Claiming deductions
-------------------

If you buy goods on layby, you may claim a deduction when you have paid for them in full. You need sufficient records to support the deduction.

If you cancel a layby sale, you may claim 3/23 of any cancellation charge the supplier makes, in the return period you cancel it, as long as you hold sufficient records to support the cancellation charge.

Legislative charges

Charges you are required by law to pay, including fees and levies, are subject to GST unless they are a fine, penalty, interest or general tax.

Local authority rates

Local authorities are the only registered persons who charge rates.

Using the invoice or hybrid basis
---------------------------------

A local authority using the invoice or hybrid basis accounts for rates charged in full.

The time of supply for rates is the earliest of the:

*   date of an instalment notice for a single payment
*   due date for payment
*   date when payment is received.

Using the payments basis
------------------------

Using the payments basis, the authority accounts for all payments of rates at the time they receive them whether they are paid in 1 instalment or several.

Registered persons claiming GST
-------------------------------

Registered persons may claim GST for payments of rates for premises used in a [taxable activity](/api/glossary/item?id={F966147A-3408-4CDD-A965-AF294365FA2D})
.

If you use the invoice basis and you pay rates in 1 lump sum, you may claim a GST credit when you make the payment or receive an invoice, whichever is earlier. If you pay rates in instalments, you may claim the GST when each instalment is due or paid, whichever comes first.

For the payments and hybrid basis, you claim the GST for rates when you make payment, provided you hold sufficient records.

Lotteries and other games of chance

If you run raffles, lotteries, or other games of chance, you must account for the proceeds of the lottery, such as total sales of tickets or cards, less the total amount of cash prizes.

For example, if the total proceeds were $1,070 and total cash prizes were $800, the difference of $270 must be included in your total sales and income of the return covering the date the raffle was drawn.

If a raffle has several draws, account for the GST in the return covering the date of the first draw.

You may claim GST on the purchase of non-cash prizes in the normal way, as long as you hold sufficient records.

Payments of deposits

When a supplier receives a deposit under a contract, the general time of supply will be triggered. This applies equally to conditional or unconditional contracts.

Where there is no binding contract or agreement, the supplier must show that the payment is for the supply of goods or services, whether it occurs now or in the future.

Deposits paid to stakeholders
-----------------------------

When a deposit is paid to a person as stakeholder, time of supply is not triggered as there is no receipt by the supplier.

A supplier may be a stakeholder. A stakeholder holds the deposit on behalf of both parties and owes a contractual obligation to both parties.

A stakeholder relationship requires agreement by all parties. A person cannot declare themselves a stakeholder unilaterally.

[Interpretation Statement IS10/03 - GST: Time of supply - payments of deposits, including to a stakeholder](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/interpretation-statements/is1003-gst-time-of-supply-payments-of-deposits-including-to-a-stakeholder)

Price changes

Sometimes the price of goods or services will change after an invoice has been provided or a payment made.

Reduction of the agreed price
-----------------------------

If you supply goods and services and reduce the price of the supply after providing taxable supply information or receiving payment, you must include the amount of the reduction in the return period it was made in. This is usually the return when the supply correction information was issued.

If you have already provided taxable supply information, you must also provide supply correction information.

If you’re the buyer, you must include the reduction shown on the supply correction information in the return period covering the time of reduction. This is usually the period the supply correction information was received. 

Increase of the agreed price
----------------------------

If you supply goods or services and increase the price of the supply after providing taxable supply information or receiving payment, you must include the amount of the increase in the return period it was made in. This is usually the return for the period you provided the supply correction information.

If you have already provided taxable supply information, you must also provide supply correction information for any increase in price.

The buyer, must include the supply correction information in the return covering the time the increase was made. This is usually the return for the period the supply correction information was received.

Example: Kevin's cleaning goods

In July, Kevin sells cleaning goods to Maria for $1,000. Maria pays Kevin $900 as some goods were damaged.

In his next GST return period, Kevin issues supply correction information for the difference of $100. Both Maria and Kevin use the invoice basis.

Kevin includes $1,000 in his total sales in the return he sold the goods. Kevin then claims $100 in his purchases and expenses in his return covering when the reduction was made.

Maria claims $1,000 in purchases in the return she received the goods and later includes $100 in the total sales in the return covering the time when the reduction for damage was made.

If the taxable supply information and supply correction information were issued in the same return period, Kevin could have shown the net amount of $900 in his total sales instead. Maria could claim the net purchase of $900.

This example of how adjustments are made also applies to an increase in price.

Private dwellings

If you are a registered person and you purchase a [taxable activity](/api/glossary/item?id={F966147A-3408-4CDD-A965-AF294365FA2D})
 that includes a dwelling, the dwelling may be treated as a separate supply.

To be able to claim a GST credit in this case, you must show the extent the dwelling is used in the taxable activity.

You may be able to claim some GST on the purchase and you may need to make ongoing adjustments.

Any claims for the purchase of the property itself or any capital improvements made to the dwelling may make a future sale of the property subject to GST on the full sale amount. An election can be made to treat principally private assets as non-taxable.

[GST adjustments for business, private and exempt use](/gst/gst-adjustments)

Progress payments and successive supplies

Progress payments, like periodic payments made under hire agreements, are treated as a series of separate supplies for each period of the agreement.

When is the time of supply?
---------------------------

The time of supply is the earlier of when a progress payment was made or when an invoice was provided.

The goods or services must be supplied in one of the following ways:

*   progressively or periodically, and paid for in the same way
*   directly in constructing, manufacturing or extending a building, or civil engineering work, with payments made periodically as the work progresses.

Progress payments
-----------------

If you receive progress payments and you use the invoice or hybrid basis, account for the GST in the return for the period a payment is due or received or an invoice is issued, whichever is earlier.

For the payments basis, account for GST when you receive any payments. 

Claiming a GST credit
---------------------

If you are making progress payments under the invoice basis, you may claim a GST credit in any of the following situations.

In the earliest return period a payment is due. When you make a payment.

When you receive an invoice for the instalment.

For the payments and hybrid basis you claim a credit in the GST return period you make a payment in.

Repossessions

In hire purchase arrangements, goods may be repossessed and resold if a buyer does not keep up the payments. If there is a forced sale, the original buyer (not the repossessor) is considered to supply the goods to the new purchaser.

**Accounting for GST**

If the goods sold are used in a [taxable activity](/api/glossary/item?id={F966147A-3408-4CDD-A965-AF294365FA2D})
, GST must be accounted for when they are sold after repossession.

To account for the GST, the repossessor will need to file a special Goods and services tax return for goods sold in satisfaction of debt - IR373.

Example: Gordon's sale

Gordon sells a $1,380 fridge on hire purchase to Bridget for her restaurant. Gordon accounts for GST of $180 ($1,380 x 3 divided by 23) in the return covering the period the agreement was made in.

Bridget does not keep up the payments.

Gordon repossesses the fridge and sells it again. The sale is not included in Gordon’s GST return. Gordon must file a special return for goods sold in satisfaction of debt, which will include the sale of the fridge on Bridget’s behalf. If Gordon used an agent, Tim, to repossess the fridge, Bridget would still be making the sale and responsible for accounting for GST on it.

The agreement between Gordon (original vendor) and Tim (the agent) would determine who files the special return for the resale of the fridge.

Road user charges

Time of supply for road user charges is when any payment is made to the New Zealand Transport Agency or one of their agents.

You can only claim GST in the period when the payment is made.

Sale of interest in an unincorporated body

The organisation is the registered person and not the individual members, if people are members of an unincorporated body, such as partnership, joint venture or trust.

If a member sells an interest in the organisation, there may be no GST implications if it is a private transaction between 2 persons and not a taxable supply.

Secondhand goods

Generally, the same rules for GST and record keeping apply to secondhand goods as for all other goods liable for GST.

What secondhand goods are
-------------------------

Secondhand goods are goods previously used by someone else. This includes land.

What secondhand goods are not
-----------------------------

Secondhand goods are not:

*   new goods
*   primary produce (unless previously used)
*   goods supplied under a lease or rental agreement
*   livestock
*   goods consisting of any fine metal of any degree of purity.

Buying goods from a non-registered seller
-----------------------------------------

If you are GST-registered you may be able to claim a credit for GST purposes when you buy secondhand goods. If the seller is not registered for GST or the goods are private (exempt), there is no GST charged. 

Regardless of the [accounting basis](/api/glossary/item?id={5832934C-6FA4-4D0B-B892-7AB87138EE23})
 you use, you must make a payment before you can claim the credit for the purchase.

You must record:

*   the name and address of the supplier
*   the date of the purchase
*   a description of the goods
*   the quantity of the goods
*   the price paid.

You'll also need to keep details of the transaction if you are going to make a claim for income tax purposes.

Exported secondhand goods
-------------------------

If you sell and export secondhand goods after you've claimed GST on the purchase, you can only zero-rate the sale if:

*   the goods are entered for export
*   the goods leave New Zealand within 28 days of the time of supply
*   the recipient provides a declaration that the goods will not be reimported to New Zealand. This declaration may be included in the sale and purchase agreement for the goods.

Supplies exceeding $225,000

If you make a supply of goods and services for more than $225,000 it must be accounted for using the invoice basis regardless of your [accounting basis](/api/glossary/item?id={5832934C-6FA4-4D0B-B892-7AB87138EE23})
. 

The general time of supply rule applies.

However, you can continue using your normal basis if the transaction is a 'short term agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services'. This means that settlement must take place, or services must be performed, within 365 days of the date the agreement is entered into.

Supplies to associated persons

Special rules apply if you make certain supplies to people closely associated with you such as relatives, or closely connected associated companies or trusts.

**Supply to registered associated persons**

If you supply goods or services to an associated person who can claim a GST credit for the purchase, you account for GST on the amount received. 

**Supply to unregistered associated persons**

If you supply goods or services to an associated person who cannot claim a deduction, you must work out the open (current) market value of the supply and account for the greater of the market value, or the amount you charged, in your return. 

**Taxable period the supply falls in**

Include transactions with associated persons in the return for the taxable period you made the supply in. However, if you receive payment or issue an invoice before the last date for filing that return, the date of payment or invoice determines which taxable period the supply falls in, depending on your [accounting basis](/api/glossary/item?id={5832934C-6FA4-4D0B-B892-7AB87138EE23})
. 

**Claiming GST on associated supplies**

For the invoice basis, claim a deduction in the return for the taxable period the supply is made available, removed or performed in. However, if you make payment or receive an invoice before the last date for filing that return, the date of payment or invoice determines the return period.

If you use the payments or hybrid basis, claim the GST as you make payments as usual.

Example: Jones and Jones' piano

Jones and Jones, a GST-registered partnership sells a piano to Dawn, a sister of one of the partners. Dawn is registered for GST and can claim a GST credit on the purchase.

The open (current) market value of the piano is $2,000 but the sale is for $1,500. The partnership accounts for GST of $195.65 ($1,500 x 3 divided by 23).

Example: Dawn's unregistered purchase

If Dawn was not registered for GST, the partnership would account for GST of $260.87.

This is the $2,000 market value multiplied by 3 then divided by 23.

Example: Partnerships

A partnership has a 2-month return period. The return for the period ended 30 April is due on the last working day of May.

The partnership supplies goods with an open (current) market value of $115 to a non-registered brother of one of the partners on 24 April and receives payment of $100 on 16 June. The partnership will account for $15 GST (on the market value of $115) in the return for the taxable period ended 30 April, as this is the period in which the supply was made.

If the partnership had issued an invoice or received payment during May (before the April return was due to be filed), the $15 GST would be included in the return period to 30 June. This is because the invoice or payment falls in the June return period.

Telecommunications - mobile roaming services

**Outbound mobile roaming services**

Outbound mobile roaming services means mobile roaming services used outside New Zealand by a person with a New Zealand registered mobile device, whose usual mobile network is in New Zealand. These services are subject to GST of 15%.

**Inbound mobile roaming services**

Inbound mobile roaming services means mobile roaming services used by a [non-resident](/api/glossary/item?id={629D26DB-A2DC-4E9F-88E8-397C0AA00D67})
 who is in New Zealand and whose usual mobile network is outside New Zealand. These services are zero-rated for GST if supplied by a resident or treated as being made outside New Zealand (and so are not subject to GST) if supplied by a non-resident.

Tenders

A registered person may invite tenders for a future supply of goods or services. The advertisement should state whether the tenders should include GST, so both parties know whether to allow for GST in the tender amount.

Occasionally the person making a tender will have to pay a deposit. There is no GST on the deposit unless all or part of it is kept for some reason.

Tokens, stamps and vouchers

**Tokens, stamp and vouchers with no fixed value**

The supplier should treat tokens, stamps and vouchers that have no fixed value as a supply for GST purposes at the time a customer buys them. This also applies to postage stamps and vouchers sold to a non-resident for services performed in New Zealand. The supplier must account for GST on these items when the customer buys them. 

**Tokens, stamps and vouchers with a fixed value**

For tokens, stamps and vouchers with a fixed value, the supplier has a choice of when to account for GST. As it may be impractical to return the GST at the time when the customer buys a voucher, the supplier can return the GST when the customer exchanges the voucher for the monetary value of the goods or services purchased.

The supplier of the voucher and supplier of the goods or services need to agree to do this. 

**Claiming GST on tokens, stamps and vouchers**

Buying tokens, stamps and vouchers can be claimed as an expense when they are acquired, according to your [accounting basis](/api/glossary/item?id={5832934C-6FA4-4D0B-B892-7AB87138EE23})
.

Example: Petrol vouchers

A petrol station owner sells an oil company's $20 petrol voucher to a customer. The petrol station owner collects the $20 for the oil company, and forwards the money to the oil company.

The customer gives the voucher to a friend who buys petrol at another petrol station. Here, there is an agreement between the petrol stations to return the GST on redemption of the voucher. The second petrol station tells the oil company they have sold petrol (goods) in exchange for a $20 petrol voucher.

The oil company reimburses the second petrol station owner for the sale, who then accounts for the GST on the $20 by including the total amount of the sale in their GST return.

Late Filing Penalty (WITHDRAWN)
===============================

Withdrawn statement SPS 05/01 set out the CIR's practice for imposing late filing penalties. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

1.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out the Commissioner's practice for imposing late filing penalties under section 139A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA).

Application
-----------

2.  This SPS applies from 4 February 2005 and replaces Standard Practice Statement RDC 5, _Late filing penalty_ originally published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Volume 11, No 6 (July 1999).

Background
----------

3.  The New Zealand tax system is based on voluntary compliance.  It relies on taxpayers voluntarily meeting their obligations under the tax laws, for example, filing tax returns by the due date.  Section 139A of the TAA imposes a penalty on a taxpayer for failure to furnish certain returns by the due date.  For example, an annual tax return, employer monthly schedule or annual imputation return required to be furnished by an Australian imputation credit account company that is not required to furnish a return of income for an income year.  The purpose of the penalty is to promote voluntary compliance and ensure penalties for breaches are imposed impartially and consistently.

Legislation
-----------

> **Tax Administration Act 1994**
> 
> **139A Late filing penalties**

> 1.  This section applies to tax returns required to be furnished under sections 33, 41 to 44, and 79 (in this Part, "annual tax returns"), the annual imputation return required to be furnished under section 69(1) and (1B)(a) by an Australian imputation credit account company that is not required to furnish a return of income for an income year, the reconciliation statement required to be provided under regulation 3 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance (Earnings Definitions) Regulations 1992 or regulation 15 of the Accident Insurance (Premium Payment Procedures) Regulations 1999 or any successor to that regulation made under the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001, and the employer monthly schedule required to be provided under section NC 15(1)(a) or (b) or (c) or (d) of the Income Tax Act 1994.

>

>     2.  Between $100,000 and $1,000,000 (both figures inclusive), is $250; 
>     3.  Above $1,000,000, is $500.  
> 4.  The late filing penalty for an annual imputation return or reconciliation statement or employer monthly schedule is $250.
> 5.  Except in the case of a late filing penalty resulting from an employer monthly schedule, the Commissioner must, not less than 30 days before imposing a late filing penalty- 
>     1.  Send written notice to a taxpayer that a late filing penalty may be imposed if a return specified in the notice is not filed; or  
>         
>     2.  Publicly notify that a late filing penalty may be imposed on taxpayers who omit to file the required return.  
>         
> 
> In this Standard Practice Statement all legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated.

Discussion
----------

4.  Under section 139A, a late filing penalty applies to:  
      
    *   Annual tax returns;
    *   ACC reconciliation statements;
    *   Employer Monthly Schedules; 
    *   Annual imputation returns required to be furnished under section 69(1) and (1B)(a) by an Australian imputation credit account company that is not required to furnish a return of income – from 1 April 2003.   
          
         
5.  Although section 139A provides for late filing penalties to be imposed in respect of outstanding ACC reconciliation statements, Inland Revenue no longer collects these statements on behalf of the Accident Compensation Corporation.  Therefore, Inland Revenue will not impose late filing penalties in respect of these statements.    
      
    
6.  The Commissioner must give at least 30 days notice to the taxpayer of the intention to impose a late filing penalty for an annual tax return or annual imputation return required to be filed by an Australian imputation credit account company.  The Commissioner must provide such a notice either in writing or by public notification to a taxpayer or group of taxpayers.  If the outstanding return is filed within the 30-day period, or an extension of time is granted to file the outstanding return, the penalty will not be imposed.  
      
    
7.  For employer monthly schedules, the Commissioner must notify the taxpayer that the late filing penalty is payable but no prior notification of intention to impose a penalty is required.    
      
    
8.  The amount of the late filing penalty for annual tax returns is based on the amount of net income as follows:  
      
    *   Less than $100,000                     $50
    *   From $100,000 to $1,000,000   $250
    *   Greater than $1,000,000             $500  
          
        
9.  The amount of the late filing penalty for an employer monthly schedule and an annual imputation return required to be filed by an Australian imputation credit account company is $250.  
    

Standard Practice
-----------------

**Imposing the late filing penalty** 

10.  The Commissioner's practice is that a late filing penalty is imposed on the following:  
      
    *   Income tax returns for individuals (IR 3)
    *   Income tax returns for companies (IR 4) 
    *   Employer monthly schedules (IR 348 and IR 349)
    *   Annual imputation returns required to be furnished under section 69(1) and 69(1B)(a) by an Australian imputation credit account company that is not required to furnish a return of income for an income year that corresponds to an imputation year (IR 4J).  
          
        
11.  A late filing penalty will be imposed in the following circumstances.
    
    _Income Tax returns_ 
    
12.  A late filing penalty will be imposed in respect of an outstanding income tax return in the following situations:   
      
    1.  the return is not filed by the due date, and is not subject to an extension of time arrangement; or
    2.  the return is subject to an extension of time arrangement, and is not filed by the date agreed to in the arrangement; or
    3.  an extension of time arrangement is withdrawn from a client/all clients of a tax agent, and the return(s) are not filed by the date specified when the extension of time was withdrawn; or
    4.  the return is for a client of a tax agent with an extension of time arrangement and is not filed by the 31st of March in the year immediately following the income year to which the return applies.  
          
        
13.  The Commissioner will provide written notification of at least 30 days prior to the intention to impose the late filing penalty, either by public notification or directly to the taxpayer.  
      
     
14.  The amount of the penalty for outstanding income tax returns is determined from the taxpayer's previous year's net income based on the return filed.  Once the return is received the amount of the penalty is checked and amended if necessary, for example, where the net income is in a different income bracket to the previous year's return.    
      
    
15.  If Inland Revenue has no information on which to base the late filing penalty, or the previous year's return has not been filed, the minimum penalty of $50 is imposed.  When the return is received the amount of penalty is checked and increased where appropriate.  If the amount of the late filing penalty is increased, time will be given to pay any additional penalty.  The minimum penalty remains payable if the return is subsequently filed and shows a loss.    
      
    
16.  The due date for payment of a late filing penalty is the later of a date specified by the Commissioner, not being less than 30 days after the date of the notice informing of the imposition of the penalty, or the terminal tax due date for the income year to which the return relates. 
    
    _Employer Monthly Schedule_ 
    
17.  Although the Commissioner is only required to notify the employer that the penalty is payable and is not required to provide prior notification of the intention to impose the penalty, Inland Revenue will take a liberal approach in regard to imposing a late filing penalty in respect of an employer monthly schedule.  
      
    
18.  The first time an employer fails to file an employer monthly schedule by the due date, the Commissioner will issue a warning notice to the employer advising a late filing penalty will not be imposed providing the schedule is filed immediately.  
      
    
19.  If, within 12 months of the warning notice being issued, a further default in filing a schedule occurs (second default), a late filing penalty will be imposed in respect of that schedule (second default) and a notice will be issued to the employer advising the penalty is payable.  
      
    
20.  If the taxpayer defaults again after 12 months of a warning notice being issued, a further warning notice will be issued.  If a further default occurs within 12 months of the second warning notice being issued, a late filing penalty will be imposed in respect of that schedule.  
      
    
21.  The due date for payment of a late filing penalty is the 5th or 20th of the month following the month in which the schedule was due to be filed depending on whether the employer remits PAYE deductions monthly or twice monthly. 
    
    _Annual Imputation return_
    
22.  A late filing penalty will be imposed when the return has not been filed by the due date and at least 30 days written notification of the intention to impose the penalty has been given, either directly to the taxpayer or by public notification.  
      
    
23.  The due date for payment of a late filing penalty is the later of a date specified by the Commissioner, not being less than 30 days after the date of the notice informing of the imposition of the penalty, or the date by which the company is required to furnish the annual imputation return.  
    

**Reversal or remission of late filing penalty** 

24.  The Commissioner's practice is that the late filing penalty may be reversed if:   
      
    *   the return was filed before the date the late filing penalty was imposed, but had not been 'lodged' by Inland Revenue; or 
    *   the return or employer monthly schedule was not required to be filed; or
    *   in respect of an employer monthly schedule, the taxpayer did not pay any salary or wages even though a registered employer.  
          
        
25.  The Commissioner's practice is that the late filing penalty may be remitted if the legislative criteria contained in sections 183A and 183D of the TAA are met.  Remission of penalties is discussed in a separate Standard Practice Statement.  
      
    
26.  The Commissioner's practice is that the late filing penalty will not be remitted if:   
      
    *   the taxpayer has an extension of time arrangement as a client of a tax agent, but the agent had not notified the Commissioner that the taxpayer was their client before the late filing penalty was imposed. 
    *   the taxpayer was granted an extension of time arrangement (either as a client of a tax agent or individually), after the late filing penalty was imposed.  
        

This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 4 February 2005.

Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer (Apr 05) (WITHDRAWN)
========================================================================

Withdrawn statement SPS 05/04 - Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

###   Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement outlines the taxpayer's rights and responsibilities in respect of an assessment of tax liability or a disputable decision when a taxpayer commences the disputes resolution process.  
      
    
2.  Where the Commissioner commences the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner's practice is stated in SPS 05/03 - _Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue.  
    _  
    
3.  This Standard Practice Statement consolidates all previous Standard Practice Statements and practices and has been updated for recent changes to the law in the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004. The Commissioner regards this Standard Practice Statement as a reference guide for taxpayers and officers of Inland Revenue. The practices outlined will be followed by officers of Inland Revenue.

###  Application

4.  This Standard Practice Statement applies to disputes commenced on or after 1 April 2005 or in the case of GST disputes, applies to GST return periods starting on or after 1 April 2005. It replaces the following Standard Practice Statements (these, as revised from time to time, will continue to apply to disputes commenced prior to 1 April 2005 or in the case of GST disputes, apply to GST return periods starting prior to 1 April 2005):  
      
    
    *   INV-150 Content standards for Notice of Proposed Adjustment and Notice of Response published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999); and  
          
        
    *   INV-170 Timeliness in resolving tax disputes published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 2 (February 2002).
    
      
      
    
5.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this Standard Practice Statement are to the Tax Administration Act 1994.

###  Background

6.  The aim of the disputes resolution process is to resolve disputes over tax liability in a fair, effective and timely manner. The disputes resolution process is designed to encourage an "all cards on the table" approach and the resolution of issues without the need for litigation. It ensures that all the relevant evidence, facts, and legal arguments are canvassed before a case goes to court.  
      
    
7.  The disputes resolution process was introduced in 1996. A review of the procedures was carried out in July 2003. Amendments have recently been made to the process to improve the framework within which tax disputes are resolved.  
    
8.  The early resolution of a dispute is intended to be achieved through a series of steps prescribed in legislation, the main elements of which are:  
      
    
    *   A notice of proposed adjustment: this is a notice by either the Commissioner or a taxpayer to the other that an adjustment is sought in relation to the taxpayer's self-assessment, the Commissioner's assessment or a disputable decision.  
          
        
    *   A notice of response: this is issued by the party receiving the notice of proposed adjustment with which they disagree.  
          
        
    *   A disclosure notice and statement of position: a disclosure notice triggers the issue of a statement of position. A statement of position contains an outline of facts and propositions of law with sufficient details to support the position taken. A statement is issued by each party. It is an important document because it limits facts and propositions of law which can be relied on (by either party) if the case goes to court.
    
      
      
    
9.  There are also two administrative phases in the process-the conference and adjudication phases. The conference can be formal or informal discussion between Inland Revenue and the taxpayer, to clarify and, if possible, resolve the issues. Adjudication involves the independent consideration of the dispute by Inland Revenue and is the final phase in the process before the taxpayer's assessment is amended (if it is to be amended), and follows the exchange of statements of position. If the dispute has not been already resolved, the Commissioner's practice will be to hold conferences, and refer the dispute to the Adjudication Unit, except in rare circumstances.

###  Taxpayer assessment

10.  Section 92(1) states:  
    
    > A taxpayer who is required to furnish a return of income for an income year must make an assessment of the taxpayer's taxable income and income tax liability and, if applicable for the income year, the net loss, terminal tax or refund due.
    
11.  The above legislative provision applies to the 2002-03 and subsequent income years. Where a taxpayer is required to file a tax return, they must make an assessment of their taxable income and income tax liability, and if applicable, the net loss, terminal tax or refund due.  
      
    
12.  Similar requirements apply to taxpayers who are required to file GST returns under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("the GST Act"). For GST return periods beginning on or after 1 April 2005, these taxpayers are required to make an assessment of the amount of GST payable. Section 92B(1) states:  
      
    
    > A taxpayer who is required under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to provide a GST tax return for a GST return period must make an assessment of the amount of GST payable by the taxpayer for the return period.
    
13.  For both income tax and GST assessments made by taxpayers, the date of assessment is that on which Inland Revenue receives the return from a taxpayer.  
      
    
14.  Inland Revenue's practice is that when the taxpayer's assessment is received, the return is stamped with the date of receipt either electronically or manually. This date is then entered into Inland Revenue's computerised database. Once this date is entered into the computerised database, a return acknowledgment form is generated and sent to the taxpayer. This practice ensures that the taxpayer will have a clear record of the date of their assessment.

###  Assessment made by the Commissioner

15.  Despite section 92(1) and subject to the statutory time bar in sections 108 and 108A, the Commissioner can sometimes issue a notice of assessment to a taxpayer.  
      
    
16.  The Commissioner will not make an assessment without first issuing a notice of proposed adjustment ("NOPA") to a taxpayer, unless an exception to the requirement for issuing a NOPA under section 89C applies. (Nevertheless, even if the Commissioner, in a very unlikely event, made an assessment in breach of section 89C, the assessment would be regarded as valid under section 114.)  
      
    
17.  Where the Commissioner issues an assessment without first issuing a NOPA, the taxpayer may issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of that assessment. The exceptions under section 89C are explained in the Commissioner's practice as stated in SPS 05/03 - _Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue._

###  A taxpayer may issue a NOPA to the Commissioner

18.  A taxpayer may issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in the following five situations:

 **Situation 1: NOPA in respect of the Commissioner's assessment**

19.  Section 89D(1) states:  
      
    If the Commissioner-  
      
    
    1.  Issues a notice of assessment to a taxpayer; and
    2.  Has not previously issued a notice of proposed adjustment to the taxpayer in respect of the assessment, whether or not in breach of section 89C,-  
        
    
    the taxpayer may, subject to subsection (2); issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of the assessment.  
      
    
20.  Where the Commissioner issues a notice of assessment without first issuing a NOPA to a taxpayer, and the notice of assessment does not relate to a "default assessment", the taxpayer may issue to the Commissioner for receipt a NOPA in respect of the assessment. Taxpayers' responses to default assessments are discussed in **Situation 2: NOPA in respect of the Commissioner's default assessment.  
    **  
    
21.  The taxpayer's NOPA must be issued within the applicable "response period" as defined in section 3(1), i.e. within the four-month period starting on the date of the Commissioner's notice of assessment. For instance, if the Commissioner's notice of assessment is made on 8 April 2005, the taxpayer may issue a NOPA in respect of the assessment to the Commissioner for receipt on or before 7 August 2005.  
      
    
22.  The taxpayer's right to issue a NOPA under section 89D(1) would not be affected, even if the Commissioner, in a very unlikely event, made the assessment in breach of section 89C. The assessment will be regarded as valid under  
    section 114.

 **Situation 2: NOPA in respect of the Commissioner's default assessment**

_Default assessment other than GST_

23.  Section 89D(2) states:  
    
    > A taxpayer who has not furnished a return of income for an assessment period may dispute the assessment made by the Commissioner only by furnishing a return of income for the assessment period.
    
24.  Where a taxpayer has not filed a tax return, the Commissioner may make an assessment (commonly known as a "default assessment") without first issuing a NOPA to a taxpayer.  
      
    
25.  Where a taxpayer wants to dispute a default assessment through the disputes resolution process, the taxpayer must, within the applicable response period (i.e. 4 months from the date of issue of the default assessment):  
      
    *   File a tax return in the prescribed form for the period to which the default assessment relates (refer to section 89D(2)); and  
          
        
    *   Issue a NOPA to the Commissioner for receipt in respect of the default assessment.  
        
26.  In the case of a default assessment, the requirement to furnish a tax return is an additional requirement of the disputes resolution process. This ensures that all taxpayers have provided the information required by tax law before they are entitled to dispute an assessment. (Note that a taxpayer cannot dispute a "default assessment" unless the requirements as set out in paragraph 25 of this Standard Practice Statement are met.)  
      
    
27.  On receipt of the taxpayer's tax return for the default assessment period, the Commissioner may decide not to amend the default assessment on the basis of that tax return, if the Commissioner considers that the taxpayer's tax position is, for example, incorrect or a result of a vexatious or frivolous act or does not meet a reasonable standard. However, where an amended assessment has been issued on the basis of the taxpayer's tax return, the Commissioner is not prohibited from conducting further investigation on that assessment, and if necessary, issuing a NOPA to the taxpayer.

_GST default assessment_

28.  Similar rules apply to a taxpayer's NOPA in respect of a GST default assessment.  
      
    
29.  Section 89D(2C) states:  
    
    > A taxpayer who has not provided a GST tax return for a GST return period may not dispute the assessment made by the Commissioner other than by providing a GST return for the GST return period.
    
30.  Where a taxpayer has not filed a GST return, the Commissioner may make a GST assessment (commonly known as a "GST default assessment") without first issuing a NOPA to a taxpayer.  
      
    
31.  Where a taxpayer wants to dispute a GST default assessment through the disputes resolution process, the taxpayer must, within the applicable response period (i.e. four months from the date of the issue of the GST default assessment):  
    
    *   File a GST return for the period to which the GST default assessment relates (refer to section 89D(2C)); and  
          
        
    *   Issue a NOPA to the Commissioner for receipt in respect of the GST default assessment.  
        
    
      
    
32.  Section 89D(2C) applies for GST return periods that begin on or after 1 April 2005.

 **Situation 3: NOPA in respect of deemed assessment under section 80H**

33.  Section 89D(2B) states:  
    
    > A taxpayer to whom section 80F applies who has not furnished an amended income statement for an assessment period may dispute a deemed assessment under section 80H only by furnishing an amended income statement for the assessment period.
    
34.  The above section applies to a taxpayer who derives income only from salary and wages, interest and dividends and where the taxpayer will receive an income statement from the Commissioner under section 80D(1).  
      
    
35.  In general, where the taxpayer considers that the income statement is incorrect, the taxpayer must inform the Commissioner of the reasons and provide the relevant information to correct the income statement under section 80F(1). This has to be done within the statutory time limit, being the later of the taxpayer's terminal tax date for the income year to which the income statement relates and two months after the date the income statement is issued.  
      
    
36.  If the relevant information is not provided within the statutory time limit, the taxpayer will be treated as having filed a tax return under section 80G(2) and having made an assessment under section 80H in respect of that income statement. In this case, the date of deemed assessment under section 80H will be the date on which the statutory time limit under section 80F expires.  
      
    
37.  Pursuant to section 89D(2B), the taxpayer may not issue to the Commissioner a NOPA in respect of the deemed assessment under section 80H without first satisfying their statutory obligation to file an amended income statement for the assessment period.  
      
    
38.  Where a taxpayer wants to dispute a deemed assessment under section 80H, the taxpayer must, within the applicable response period (i.e. within four months from the date of the issue of the deemed assessment):  
      
    *   File an amended income statement for the assessment period; and  
          
        
    *   Issue a NOPA to the Commissioner for receipt in respect of the assessment.

 **Situation 4: NOPA in respect of disputable decision**

39.  Section 89D(3) states: If the Commissioner-  
      
    1.  Issues a notice of disputable decision that is not a notice of assessment; and  
          
        
    2.  The notice of disputable decision affects the taxpayer, -

> the taxpayer, or any other person who has the standing under a tax law to do so on behalf of the taxpayer, may issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of the disputable decision.

40.  The term "disputable decision" is defined in section 3(1) to mean an assessment and a decision of the Commissioner under a tax law. The definition also includes exceptions to what is a disputable decision. Section 3(1) on the definition of "disputable decision" defines the term as:  
      
    
    1.  An assessment:  
        
    2.  A decision of the Commissioner under a tax law, except for a decision -  
        1.  To decline to issue a binding ruling under Part VA; or  
            
        2.  That cannot be the subject of an objection under Part VIII; or  
            
        3.  That cannot be challenged under Part VIIIA; or  
            
        4.  That is left to the Commissioner's discretion under sections 89K, 89L, 89M(8) and (10) and 89N(3)  
            
    
      
    
41.  A "decision of the Commissioner under a tax law" generally refers to a tax law which specifically gives the Commissioner a discretion or power. Subparagraph (iv) excludes from the definition of "disputable decision" decisions left to the Commissioner's discretion that occur specifically under the disputes legislation contained in Part IVA of the TAA. For example:  
      
    
    *   A taxpayer issues a late NOPA to the Commissioner and the Commissioner refuses to exercise the discretion to accept it as a NOPA issued within the response period under section 89K. The refusal to exercise the Commissioner's discretion is not a disputable decision.  
          
        
    *   After receiving the taxpayer's statement of position, the Commissioner provides the taxpayer with additional information under section 89M(8). The decision to provide this additional information is not a disputable decision.  
          
        
    *   The Commissioner refuses to exercise the discretion under section 113 to amend a taxpayer's income tax assessment. This decision cannot be challenged under section 138E(1)(e)(iv) and is therefore, not a disputable decision.  
        
    
      
    
42.  The above exceptions ensure that only substantive issues are disputed as disputable decisions and that procedural sections of the disputes resolution process do not in themselves give rise to disputes.  
      
    
43.  Pursuant to section 89D(3), a taxpayer may issue to the Commissioner a NOPA in respect of a disputable decision, other than an assessment. For example:  
      
    
    *   A taxpayer who is a natural person may dispute the Commissioner's decision under section OE 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 that they are resident in New Zealand for taxation purposes.  
          
        
    *   Under section NC 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004, the Commissioner can determine whether, and to what extent, a payment is subject to PAYE. It is not possible to dispute such a determination. However, where an employer or an employee receives an assessment of tax deductions, they may dispute the assessment on the ground that a section NC 1(2) determination on which it is founded is wrong in fact or in law.  
        
    
      
    
44.  The NOPA must be issued for the Commissioner's receipt within the applicable response period, i.e. within the two-month period starting on the date of issue of the notice of disputable decision (not being an assessment).

 **Situation 5: NOPA in respect of an assessment made by a taxpayer**

45.  Section 89DA(1) states:  
    
    > A taxpayer may issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of an assessment made by the taxpayer for an income year or a GST return period if the Commissioner has not previously issued a notice of proposed adjustment to the taxpayer in respect of the assessment.
    
46.  The above legislative provision applies to taxpayers' income tax assessments for the 2002-03 and subsequent income years. A taxpayer who is required to file a tax return must make an assessment of their taxable income and income tax liability under section 92(1).  
      
    
47.  Section 89DA(1) also applies to taxpayer's GST assessments for the GST return periods beginning on or after 1 April 2005. A taxpayer who is required to file a GST return must make an assessment of the amount of GST payable for the return period under section 92B(1).  
      
    
48.  Section 89DA(1) allows a taxpayer to issue to the Commissioner a NOPA in respect of their own assessment of tax. The NOPA must be issued for the Commissioner's receipt within the applicable response period, i.e. within the four-month period starting on the date on which Inland Revenue receives the taxpayer's notice of assessment.

_Proposed adjustments - input tax credits_

49.  Where a taxpayer receives a taxable supply and omits to claim a deduction from output tax under section 20(3) of the GST Act, the taxpayer may have two options.  
      
    
50.  First, the taxpayer may propose an adjustment by issuing a NOPA to the Commissioner within the applicable response period.  
      
    
51.  Alternatively, the taxpayer may claim a deduction from output tax in a later GST return period under section 20(3) of the GST Act. There is an unqualified two-year period to claim an input tax credit in a current period return. Pursuant to paragraph (a) of the proviso to section 20(3) of the GST Act (which can be found after paragraph (i) of the section), the two-year period is calculated from the earlier of:  
      
    
    *   The date of payment for the taxable supply to which the input tax credit relates; and  
          
        
    *   The date of issue of a tax invoice in relation to that taxable supply  
        
    
      
    
52.  However, pursuant to the proviso to section 20(3) of the GST Act, the taxpayer may have an unlimited time to claim the input tax credit if the taxpayer's failure to make the deduction under that section arises from one of the following reasons:  
      
    
    *   An inability of the registered person to obtain a tax invoice;  
          
        
    *   A dispute over the proper amount of the payment for the taxable supply to which the deduction relates;  
          
        
    *   A mistaken understanding on the part of registered person that the supply to which the deduction relates was not a taxable supply;  
          
        
    *   A clear mistake or simple oversight of the registered person.  
        
    
      
    
53.  For example, a taxpayer is registered for GST. They pay GST on an invoice basis and file monthly GST returns. In May 2005, they receive a tax invoice in respect of a taxable supply. However, the taxpayer omits to claim the input tax credits in respect of that taxable supply in the May 2005 GST return period. The reason for the omission is that the taxpayer has misplaced the tax invoice in one of their business files. The taxpayer has found the tax invoice in December 2007.  
      
    
54.  The taxpayer has two options. First, they may propose an adjustment to an input tax credit in the May 2005 GST period by issuing a NOPA to the Commissioner. However, the NOPA will be issued outside the four-month response period. Unless one of the "exceptional circumstances" in section 89K applies, the Commissioner will not accept the taxpayer's NOPA outside the response period. The Commissioner will consider the taxpayer's case under section 113. The Commissioner's practice in relation to section 113 is stated in a separate Standard Practice Statement.  
      
    
55.  The second option is that the taxpayer may claim a deduction from output tax in the current GST return period under section 20(3) of the GST Act. In this example, the taxpayer's omission is due to a simple oversight of the taxpayer. Therefore, the two-year restriction on claiming the deduction does not apply.  
      
    
56.  The term "clear mistake or simple oversight" is interpreted in a similar manner to that in section 89C(b).  
      
    
57.  There is no dollar limit to what is "a simple or obvious mistake or oversight" and this may be ascertained on a case by case basis.  
      
    
58.  However, "a simple or obvious mistake or oversight" will not include a taxpayer's GST position taken as a result of:  
      
    *   A new, beneficial interpretation or favourable new case law; or  
          
        
    *   A change of mind (e.g. a taxpayer has taken the tax position that the sale of business is a supply of a going concern and therefore, zero-rated for GST purposes, but later changes their mind and wants to treat the supply as a standard-rated supply.)

###  Contents of a taxpayer's NOPA

59.  **A NOPA is the document that commences the disputes resolution process. It is intended to explain in a legal/technical manner what the position of the issuer is in relation to the proposed adjustments. The contents of a NOPA issued by a taxpayer are prescribed in sections 89F(1) and (3).  
    **  
    
60.  Section 89F states:  
    
    1.  A notice of proposed adjustment must-  
        1.  contain sufficient detail of the matters described in subsections (2) and (3) to identify the issues arising between the Commissioner and the disputant; and  
            
        2.  be in the prescribed form.  
            
    
    ...  
    
    3.  A notice of proposed adjustment issued by a disputant must-  
          
        1.  identify the adjustment or adjustments proposed to be made to the assessment; and
        2.  provide a statement of the facts and the law in sufficient detail to inform the Commissioner of the grounds for the disputant's proposed adjustment or adjustments; and
        3.  state how the law applies to the facts; and
        4.  include copies of the documents of which the disputant is aware at the time that the notice is issued that are significantly relevant to the issues arising between the Commissioner and the disputant.  
            
    
      
    
61.  A NOPA must be in the prescribed form. The taxpayer is required to use a _Notice of proposed adjustment (IR 770)_. This can be found on Inland Revenue's website www.ird.govt.nz In order to support the proposed adjustment in the NOPA, the taxpayer is required to provide a statement of the facts and the law in sufficient detail, state how the law applies to the facts and include copies of the documents that are significantly relevant to the dispute and that the taxpayer is aware when issuing their NOPA.  
      
    
62.  The law requires a statement of the facts and the law in sufficient detail. The term "sufficient detail" is intended to convey a document that contains an adequate amount of analysis of the law and facts relevant to the dispute. This means enough discussion of the law to enable the Commissioner to clearly understand the proposed adjustment.  
      
    
63.  The Commissioner believes that the purpose of requiring the taxpayer to "provide a statement of the facts and the law in sufficient detail" is to ensure that the taxpayer has fully considered an issue before raising it in a NOPA.  
      
    
64.  If the taxpayer provides sufficient information to support the proposed adjustment in their NOPA, this will facilitate a speedy resolution to the dispute, thus also reduce administrative and compliance costs.

###  _Identify the proposed adjustment - Section 89F(3)(a)_

65.  The taxpayer must identify the proposed adjustment or adjustments in their NOPA. This includes for each proposed adjustment:  
      
    
    *   the amount or impact of the adjustment, and  
          
        
    *   income year or tax period to which the proposed adjustment relates.  
        
    
      
    
66.  The proposed adjustment should be set out as specifically as possible. For example: "increase the 2003 repairs and maintenance expenditure by $3,000"; "increase the deduction from GST output tax by $4,000", etc.

###  _Provide a statement of the facts and the law in sufficient detail - Section 89F(3)(b)_

_Facts_

67.  This includes for each proposed adjustment the facts relevant to proving all arguments raised in support of the adjustment, including any facts which are inconsistent with any argument previously raised by the Commissioner.  
      
    
68.  It is important for the taxpayer to state all the relevant material facts clearly and with an adequate amount of details. In a taxpayer's dispute, the taxpayer usually has good understanding of the background and the facts. Disclosure of the background and facts at the NOPA phase helps to resolve the dispute at an earlier stage. However, the taxpayer should not overstate the facts with irrelevant detail or repetition.  
      
    
69.  In a complex case, the Commissioner expects the taxpayer to go through the relevant facts step by step. The taxpayer should also assist the Commissioner in understanding the background and the facts to the dispute, so as to facilitate a speedy resolution of the case. It is unhelpful and can cause delay if the Commissioner has to second guess the factual basis of the taxpayer's case.  
      
    
70.  For example, in a dispute that involves a complex financial arrangement, the taxpayer should explain each element of the financial arrangement. This includes providing the background to the financial arrangement, identifying the parties involved, highlighting the relevant clauses in an agreement, etc.

_Law_

71.  This includes for each proposed adjustment the section or sections relied on including where a section has multiple independent parts, the applicable subsection(s).  
      
    
72.  It is important for the taxpayer to include in their NOPA an adequate amount of analysis of applicable legal principles or tests. Where possible these should be supported by case authority with full citations. For example, in a dispute that involves the tax treatment of a trade-tie payment, the taxpayer must apply the legal principles in a leading case such as _Birkdale Service Station v CIR_ \[2001\] 1 NZLR 293. A mere reference to "tax cases on trade-tie payment" in the taxpayer's NOPA will not satisfy section 89F(3)(b). On the other hand, it is not necessary to laboriously describe large numbers of precedent cases.

### _How the law applies to the facts - Section 89F(3)(c)_

73.  The legal arguments must be applied to the facts to ensure that the proposed adjustments are not statements which appear out of context in relation to the rest of the documents. The application of the law to the facts must logically support the proposed adjustment and must be stated clearly and in detail.  
      
    
74.  The taxpayer must present materials and arguments on which it is intended to rely or on which reliance may be placed. In other words, if more than one argument supports the same or similar outcome, all arguments will be made and supported by evidence. For each proposition of law, it is recommended that the NOPA makes a clear link to an outline of supporting facts.

### _Include copies of the documents in support of the adjustment - Section 89F(3)(d)_

75.  The taxpayer is required to provide full copies of the documents that are significantly relevant to the dispute and that are known to the taxpayer when the NOPA is issued. This ensures that the Commissioner has all the relevant information necessary to respond to the NOPA.  
      
    
76.  For example:  
      
    
    *   A taxpayer proposes an adjustment on GST input tax credits in their NOPA. The taxpayer must provide copies of the relevant tax invoices as documentary evidence in their NOPA.  
          
        
    *   A taxpayer's dispute involves a sale of land transaction. The taxpayer must provide copies of the sale and purchase agreement and other relevant correspondence between the vendor and the purchaser as documentary evidence in their NOPA.  
        
    
      
    
77.  However, the taxpayer's NOPA will not be invalid by reason of not providing all the documentary evidence in their NOPA. In some cases, new documentary evidence may emerge, as the dispute progresses. For example:  
      
    
    *   A dispute involves overseas parties who hold relevant documents outside of New Zealand.  
          
        
    *   The documentation is quite old and may have been misplaced.  
        
    
      
    
78.  The taxpayer may not be aware of these documents when the NOPA was issued. The Commissioner and the taxpayer can then exchange this new evidence when it becomes known or available.  
      
    
79.  Where the taxpayer is aware of a particular document which is significantly relevant to the dispute, but has difficulty in obtaining a copy of it, the taxpayer should include the following matters in their NOPA:  
      
    
    *   The nature of the document and its relevance to the disputes;  
          
        
    *   The reasonable steps taken by the taxpayer to obtain a copy of the document; and  
          
        
    *   The expected date of making the document available to the Commissioner.  
        
    
      
    
80.  However, the practice allowed in the immediate preceding paragraph should not be considered as dispensing with the requirements under section 89F(3)(d). The Commissioner expects the taxpayer to send a copy of the relevant documents mentioned in the taxpayer's NOPA. The Commissioner may reject the proposed adjustments if the taxpayer fails to do so.

###  Election of small claims jurisdiction of taxation review authority

81.  A taxpayer can issue a NOPA to the Commissioner and elect in the NOPA that any unresolved dispute will be heard by the Taxation Review Authority acting in the small claims jurisdiction under section 89E(1)(a), if the following requirements are met:  
      
    *   The taxpayer's NOPA is issued under section 89D, i.e. in respect of the Commissioner's assessment, a deemed assessment under section 80H or a "disputable decision" (not being an assessment); and  
          
        
    *   The amount in dispute is $30,000 or less.

###  Receipt of taxpayer's NOPA

82.  When a taxpayer's NOPA is received, the NOPA will usually be assigned to an actioning officer within five working days of receipt by Inland Revenue. Following receipt, the actioning officer will ascertain and record the following:  
      
    
    *   The date of issue of the NOPA, whether the NOPA has been issued within the applicable response period and the date by which a response is required to be issued; and  
          
        
    *   The salient features of the NOPA including any deficiencies as to content.  
        
    
      
    
83.  Where this is practicable, the taxpayer or their tax agent will be informed within 10 working days that the NOPA has been received by Inland Revenue either by phone call or in writing.  
      
    
84.  However, where the Commissioner is aware of any deficiencies as to the content of the NOPA, the taxpayer or their tax agent will usually be notified of these deficiencies as soon as practicable. They will also be notified of the expiry date of the response period, by which those deficiencies must be rectified in order for the NOPA to be valid. (Note: taxpayers are encouraged to issue their NOPA as soon as they have completed it. This is because if an invalid or deficient NOPA has been issued close to the expiry date of the response period, the taxpayer may not have sufficient time to rectify the invalidity or deficiency before the end of the response period.)

### Deficiencies in the contents of a NOPA

85.  Where a NOPA has been received and where Inland Revenue considers there are deficiencies (i.e. the requirements under section 89F(3) are not met), the actioning officer will take reasonable steps to obtain the information in the NOPA corrected before the expiry of the response period. The taxpayer will be notified of the need for the additional information and the impending crucial deadlines.  
      
    
86.  If a NOPA is not accepted by the Commissioner because there are deficiencies and the information is not corrected before the response period expires, the taxpayer will be treated as if the dispute has never been initiated (unless a late NOPA is issued and subsequently accepted by the Commissioner under one of the exceptional circumstances under section 89K). The reasons for not accepting the NOPA will be documented and the actioning officer will notify the taxpayer of these reasons in writing within 15 working days from the expiry of the response period for issuing a taxpayer's NOPA.

###  NOPA issued by a taxpayer outside the applicable response period

87.  Unless an "exceptional circumstance" in section 89K arises, the Commissioner will not accept a NOPA issued by a taxpayer under section 89D or section 89DA outside the applicable response period.

_Exceptional circumstances under section 89K_

88.  The legislation defines exceptional circumstances very narrowly. Cases on "exceptional circumstances", such as _Treasury Technology Holdings Ltd v CIR_ (1998) 18 NZTC 13,752, _Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR_ (1998) 18 NZTC 14,005 and _Fuji Xerox NZ Ltd v CIR_ (2001) 20 NZTC 17,470 (CA), are also relevant. For example, a taxpayer's misunderstanding or erroneous calculation of the applicable response period will usually not be regarded as an event or a circumstance beyond the taxpayer's control under paragraph (a) of section 89K(3).  
      
    
89.  Late NOPAs will be accepted only on rare occasions. Some examples of situations that may be considered "exceptional circumstances" beyond the control of a taxpayer are explained in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 8, No 3 (August 1996).  
      
    
90.  Section 89K(3) states:  
      
    
    1.  an exceptional circumstance arises if-  
        
        1.  an event or circumstance beyond the control of a disputant provides the disputant with a reasonable justification for not rejecting a proposed adjustment, or for not issuing a notice of proposed adjustment or statement of position, within the response period for the notice:  
            
        2.  a disputant is late in issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, notice of response or statement of position but the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, or results from 1 or more statutory holidays falling in the response period:  
            
        
          
        
    2.  an act or omission of an agent of a disputant is not an exceptional circumstance unless-  
        1.  it was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent that could not have been anticipated, and its effect could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct; or  
            
        2.  the agent is late in issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, notice of response or statement of position but the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, or results from 1 or more statutory holidays falling in the response period.  
            
    
      
    
91.  The exception for lateness as a result of a statutory holiday is self explanatory. The Commissioner can also accept a late NOPA if the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, i.e. the document was only one or two days late. Besides the degree of lateness, the Commissioner will consider the following factors when exercising the discretion under section 89K:  
      
    
    *   the date on which the NOPA was issued; and  
          
        
    *   the response period within which the NOPA should be issued; and  
          
        
    *   the reasons why the taxpayer failed to issue the NOPA within the response period; and  
          
        
    *   the compliance history of the taxpayer in relation to the tax type under consideration (e.g. has the taxpayer paid tax late or filed late tax returns, late NOPAs in the past?)  
        
    
      
    
92.  For example, a taxpayer issued a NOPA to the Commissioner two days later than the applicable "response period". The taxpayer failed to provide a legitimate reason for the lateness. It was also found that the taxpayer had a history of filing late NOPAs within the minimal lateness allowable (i.e. no more than two days outside the applicable "response period") and had been advised on the calculation of the "response period" on more than one occasion. Although the lateness was minimal on each occasion, the taxpayer's NOPA would not be accepted in this case. This ensures that the exception under section 89K(3)(b)(ii) is not considered to be an extension of the "response period" in all situations.  
      
    
93.  Where an application for consideration of exceptional circumstances is made under section 89K, the reasons for accepting or rejecting it will be documented and the actioning officer will notify the taxpayer of the decision in writing within 15 working days of receipt of the taxpayer's application by Inland Revenue.  
      
    
94.  If the taxpayer's application under section 89K is rejected, the validity of the taxpayer's tax position must nevertheless be considered in terms of the Commissioner's practice on applying section 113. The Commissioner's practice on the application of section 113 is set out in a separate Standard Practice Statement. Also note that the Commissioner's decision under section 89K is not a "disputable decision".

###  Timeframes to complete the disputes resolution process

95.  Once the disputes resolution process has commenced (i.e. where a NOPA has been issued by the taxpayer to the Commissioner and the dispute has not been resolved by agreement between the taxpayer and the Commissioner), where practicable, a time line should be negotiated between the taxpayer and Inland Revenue officers involved to ensure timely and efficient progression of the dispute.  
      
    
96.  Negotiating time lines for the timely resolution of disputes is an administrative practice encouraged by the Commissioner. Inland Revenue officers and taxpayers should endeavour to meet the agreed time lines. Where the negotiated time line cannot be achieved, this will be discussed with the taxpayer with a view to agreeing a new time line. However, failure to negotiate an agreed time line or adhere to the agreed time line will not prevent a case from progressing through the disputes resolution process.  
      
    
97.  In addition to the above administrative practice, the Commissioner is bound by section 89N. The law requires that where the Commissioner and the taxpayer cannot agree on the proposed adjustments, the Commissioner cannot amend an assessment without completing the disputes resolution process, unless one of the exceptions in section 89N applies. These exceptions are explained in the Commissioner's practice as stated in SPS 05/03 - _Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue.  
    _  
    
98.  Although the adjudication process is not legislated as part of the disputes resolution process, it is the Commissioner's administrative practice to go through the adjudication process for the purpose of resolving a dispute after the statements of position phase, where practicable. However, where the adjudication process cannot be completed (e.g. because the statutory time bar is imminent), the Commissioner can amend an assessment, provided that the taxpayer's statement of position has been considered. This means that Inland Revenue officers should act in good faith and genuinely consider the facts and legal arguments in the taxpayer's statement of position before deciding whether to amend an assessment.

###  The Commissioner's response to a taxpayer's NOPA: Notice of response

99.  If the Commissioner disagrees with the taxpayer's proposed adjustment, then under section 89G, the Commissioner must notify the taxpayer that any or all of the proposed adjustments are rejected by issuing a notice of response ("NOR") within the two-month response period, i.e. within two months starting on the date of issue of the taxpayer's NOPA. The Commissioner interprets this as requiring receipt of the NOR by the taxpayer. For instance, if a taxpayer issues a NOPA on 8 April 2005, the Commissioner must notify the taxpayer of the rejection by issuing a NOR to the taxpayer for receipt on or before 7 June 2005.  
      
    
100.  Where it is practicable (e.g. the issue in dispute is straight-forward), the Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent within two weeks prior to the expiry of the response period for the taxpayer's NOPA and advise whether the Commissioner intends to respond to the NOPA by issuing a NOR. Contact may be made by way of a phone call or a letter.  
      
    
101.  The contents of a NOR are prescribed under section 89G(2). The Commissioner must state concisely in the NOR:  
      
    1.  the facts or legal arguments in the taxpayer's NOPA that the Commissioner considers are wrong; and  
          
        
    2.  why the Commissioner considers those facts and arguments to be wrong; and  
          
        
    3.  any facts and legal arguments relied upon by the Commissioner; and  
          
        
    4.  how the legal arguments apply to the facts; and  
          
        
    5.  the quantitative adjustments to any figure referred to in the taxpayer's NOPA that result from the facts and legal arguments relied upon by the Commissioner.  
        
102.  The requirement of quantitative adjustment under section 89G(2)(e) establishes, in the Commissioner's opinion, by how much the taxpayer's adjustment in the NOPA is incorrect. There is no requirement that the amount referred to be exact, however every attempt should be made to ensure that it is as accurate as possible. As the dispute progresses, the amount in dispute may be altered. For example a new figure may be worked out at a conference between the parties.  
      
    
103.  Nevertheless, the Commissioner believes that Inland Revenue has a statutory obligation to inform the taxpayers adequately. In keeping with that obligation, where the Commissioner issues a NOR to reject the proposed adjustments in the taxpayer's NOPA, the NOR will be relatively brief but at the same time detailed enough to cover all the relevant facts, quantitative adjustments, issues and law.

###  Deemed acceptance

104.  If the Commissioner does not issue a NOR within the two-month response period, the Commissioner is deemed to have accepted the proposed adjustments in the taxpayer's NOPA. Section 89H(2) states:  
      
    
105.  If the Commissioner does not, within the response period for a notice of proposed adjustment issued by a disputant, reject an adjustment contained in the notice, the Commissioner is deemed to accept the proposed adjustment and section 89J applies.

###  Exception to deemed acceptance

105.  Notwithstanding section 89H(2), the Commissioner may apply to the High Court for an order allowing him to issue a NOR outside the two-month response period. Section 89L applies only if an exceptional circumstance applies or has prevented the Commissioner from issuing the NOR to the taxpayer within the response period.  
      
    
106.  Under section 89L(3), an "exceptional circumstance":  
      
    
    1.  Is an event or circumstance beyond the control of the Commissioner or an officer of the Department that provides the Commissioner with a reasonable justification for not rejecting an adjustment proposed by a disputant within the response period; and  
        
    2.  Without limiting paragraph (a), includes a change to a tax law, or a new tax law, or a decision of a court in respect of a tax law, that is enacted or made within the response period.  
        
    
      
    
107.  For example:  
      
    *   During the applicable response period to a taxpayer's NOPA, a flood occurred and damaged one of the Inland Revenue offices. The taxpayer's NOPA was also lost in the flood. Inland Revenue officers could not obtain another copy of the NOPA within the applicable response period. The absence of information has prevented the Commissioner from forming a view on the subject matter in dispute. The Commissioner may apply for a High Court order under section 89L for further time to issue a NOR.  
          
        
    *   In a NOPA issued to the Commissioner, a taxpayer proposes to claim additional tax depreciation on computer software. During the two-month response period, a High Court decision was made in respect of another taxpayer. The High Court held that such depreciation claim amounted to tax avoidance and should be disallowed. The Commissioner may apply to the High Court for further time to issue a NOR to the taxpayer, so as to consider the full effect of the High Court decision.

###  Implication of section 89J

108.  Where the Commissioner accepts or is deemed to accept the proposed adjustments in the taxpayer's NOPA, the Commissioner must include or take account of the adjustments in a notice of assessment issued to the taxpayer. The dispute is brought to an end.

###  Rejection of the Commissioner's NOR

109.  Where the Commissioner has issued a NOR under section 89G to reject the proposed adjustments in the taxpayer's NOPA, the taxpayer must reject the Commissioner's NOR within the applicable response period, i.e. within two months starting on the date of the Commissioner's NOR. Otherwise, the taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the Commissioner's NOR under section 89H(3) and the dispute comes to an end.  
      
    
110.  The Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent two weeks prior to the expiry of the response period for the Commissioner's NOR to ascertain whether the taxpayer will reject the Commissioner's NOR in writing. Contact may be made by way of a phone call or in writing.  
      
    
111.  The taxpayer must reject the Commissioner's NOR in writing. Where it is practicable, the taxpayer's rejection will be forwarded to the actioning officer within five working days of receipt by Inland Revenue and will be acknowledged as received within 10 working days.  
      
    
112.  In the case of deemed acceptance (i.e. where the taxpayer has not rejected the Commissioner's NOR in writing), the Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to advise the taxpayer of this within two weeks after the expiry of the response period to the Commissioner's NOR.)

### Conference

###  Conduct of a conference

113.  Where a dispute remains unresolved following the taxpayer's rejection of the Commissioner's NOR, the conference phase follows. The Commissioner will usually initiate the conference phase within one month of receipt of the notice of rejection of the Commissioner's NOR. The time suggested for the conference phase is an average of three months. However, the time will vary depending on the facts and the complexity of the specific case.  
      
    
114.  There is no legislative requirement for a conference. The conference phase is an administrative process which aims to clarify and if possible, resolve the issues in the dispute.  
      
    
115.  The conduct of the conference should be as flexible as possible, consistent with the taxpayer's wishes and other factors such as the scope of the audit. Conferences may range from a phone call to several meetings. Discussions in conferences must be recorded or otherwise documented and agreed upon if possible. These may include any agreement on facts, common grounds for the dispute to proceed, timeframes for completing the disputes resolution process and agreed adjustments.

###  Legal and other advisers attending a conference

116.  If a dispute is not settled earlier, the Commissioner and the taxpayer may want to obtain expert legal or other advice. These advisers may attend any meetings in relation to the dispute. The Commissioner accepts that it is appropriate in these circumstances for a certain amount of "back tracking" to take place, i.e. some items already discussed (but which are not agreed in writing or otherwise accepted) between the parties may be revisited by the newly introduced advisers.

###  Conference not held or abridged

117.  The Commissioner considers the conference phase to be an important part of the disputes resolution process.  
      
    
118.  In some circumstances the Commissioner will not hold further discussions or a conference, even though agreement has not been reached post the taxpayer's rejection of the Commissioner's NOR. This does not mean that the disputes resolution process will come to an end, as the disclosure notice and statement of position phase will still be undertaken. Where the dispute is not resolved in the statement of position phase, the Commissioner and the taxpayer will endeavour to have the dispute resolved via the adjudication process.  
      
    
119.  Conferences may not be held or may be abridged in one or more of the following situations:  
      
    
    *   There may be revenue losses incurred as a result of delaying tactics used by a taxpayer to frustrate the collection of tax.  
          
        
    *   The Commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer or the taxpayer's agent is acting in a frivolous or vexatious manner. For example where, the taxpayer or their agent is setting unreasonable demands as to the time and place, or terms of such meeting(s), or refuses to conduct themselves reasonably at any meeting.  
          
        
    *   The taxpayer contests the Commissioner's policy and it is agreed to disagree, or where it is otherwise agreed that a conference would be of no benefit.  
          
        
    *   The taxpayer advises the Commissioner that they do not want a conference to be held.  
        
    
      
    
120.  Where it is practicable, the decision whether or not the conference phase will be dispensed with or abridged will be communicated in writing to the taxpayer or their tax agent within seven days of that decision being made. The reasons for the decision not to hold, or abridge, any conference must be documented.

###  Disclosure notices

121.  The Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice under section 89M(1), unless the Commissioner is not required to complete the disputes resolution process under section 89N (as discussed in SPS 05/03 _\- Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_). Another restriction on issue of a disclosure notice by the Commissioner is set out in section 89M(2). The Commissioner may not issue a disclosure notice in respect of a taxpayer's NOPA if the Commissioner has already issued a notice of disputable decision that includes or takes account of the adjustment proposed in that NOPA. Sections 89M(1) and (2) state:  
      
    
    1.  Unless subsection (2) applies, and subject to section 89N, the Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice in respect of a notice of proposed adjustment to a disputant at the time or after the Commissioner or the taxpayer, as the case may be, issues the notice of proposed adjustment.  
          
        
    2.  The Commissioner may not issue a disclosure notice in respect of a notice of proposed adjustment if the Commissioner has already issued a notice of disputable decision that includes, or takes account of, the adjustment proposed in the notice of proposed adjustment.  
        
    
      
    
122.  A disputable decision is:  
    
    *   an assessment; or  
          
        
    *   a decision of the Commissioner under a tax law, except for a decision -  
          
        
        1.  to decline to issue a binding ruling; or  
              
            
        2.  that cannot be the subject of an objection or challenge; or  
              
            
        3.  that is left to the Commissioner's discretion under sections 89K, 89L, 89M(8) and (10) and 89N(3).
        
          
        (Refer to paragraphs 40 to 42 in this Standard Practice Statement.)
    
      
      
    
123.  Where the Commissioner decides to issue a disclosure notice, the taxpayer will usually be advised of this within 2 weeks from the date of the issue of the Commissioner's disclosure notice.

 _Evidence exclusion rule_

124.  A disclosure notice is the document that triggers the application of the evidence exclusion rule. The rule restricts what the Commissioner and the disputant may raise as evidence in a court challenge to matters raised in their respective statements of position. (Note that the Commissioner and the taxpayer may refer to evidence that has been raised by either party.) As this is one of the guiding principles of the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner must explain the effect of the evidence exclusion rule and refer to section 138G in the Commissioner's disclosure notice.  
      
    
125.  In a dispute commenced by a taxpayer, section 89M(6B) states that "evidence" in the context of the evidence exclusion rule refers to the available documentary evidence and does not include a list of potential witnesses or types of witnesses. Therefore the identities of both the taxpayer's and the Commissioner's witnesses in sensitive cases will continue to be protected, without undermining the effect of the evidence exclusion rule.

 _Issue of a disclosure notice_

126.  It is possible for the Commissioner to issue a disclosure notice at any time on or after the issue of a NOPA by either the taxpayer or the Commissioner.  
      
    
127.  Generally such a notice will be issued after receipt of a NOR and its rejection, following the conference phase and in accordance with the agreed time line between the Commissioner and the taxpayer. Where a disclosure notice is issued earlier (e.g. the facts are clear, the taxpayer agrees, or a conference is not required) the reasons must be documented.

###  Statement of position

128.  Pursuant to section 89M(5), where a taxpayer commences a dispute and the Commissioner issues a disclosure notice, the taxpayer must issue the Commissioner with a statement of position ("SOP") in the prescribed form _Statement of Position (IR 773)_ within the response period, i.e. within two months starting on the date of issue of the disclosure notice.  
      
    
129.  Unless an "exceptional circumstance" in section 89K applies, where the taxpayer issues the Commissioner with a SOP outside the response period, the dispute will be treated as if it has not been commenced by the taxpayer. The Commissioner is not required to issue an assessment to include or take account of the taxpayer's proposed adjustments. Section 89M(7)(b) states:  
      
    7.  A disputant who does not issue a statement of position in the prescribed form within the response period for the statement of position, is treated as follows:  
          
        ...  
          
        2.  if the disputant has proposed the adjustment to the assessment, the disputant is treated as not having issued a notice of proposed adjustment.

###  Contents of taxpayer's statement of position

130.  The contents of a SOP are binding. Under the principle of the "evidence exclusion rule" if the matter proceeds to court, the parties are limited to the facts, evidence (excluding oral evidence), issues and propositions of law which are relied on (by either party). The SOP must be in the prescribed form and must contain sufficient detail to fairly inform the Commissioner of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law that the taxpayer wishes to rely on.  
      
    
131.  Section 89M(6) states:  
      
    A disputant's statement of position in the prescribed form must, with sufficient detail to fairly inform the Commissioner,-  
      
    
    1.  Give an outline of the facts on which the disputant intends to rely; and  
        
    2.  Give an outline of the evidence on which the disputant intends to rely; and  
        
    3.  Give an outline of the issues that the disputant considers will arise; and  
        
    4.  Specify the propositions of law on which the disputant intends to rely.  
        
    
      
    
132.  The minimum contents requirements of a SOP are an outline of the relevant facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law. However, to enable the Adjudication Unit to successfully reach a decision, it is important that the SOP contains full, complete and detailed submissions. An outline of frank and complete discussion of the issues, the law, arguments and evidence supporting the arguments is implicit in the spirit and intent of the disputes resolution process.  
      
    
133.  Under the principles of the evidence exclusion rule, arguments and evidence that are not present in the SOP will be excluded from consideration by a court.  
      
    
134.  The list of evidence that is required to be submitted with the SOP does not include a list of potential witnesses. Section 89M(6B) states:
    
    > In subsection 4(b) and 6(b), evidence refers to the available documentary evidence on which the person intends to rely, but does not include a list of potential witnesses, whether or not identified by name.
    
135.  Therefore, only documentary evidence needs to be listed in the SOP. Witnesses' identities will continue to be protected without undermining the effect of the evidence exclusion rule.

###  Receipt of taxpayer's statement of position

136.  The Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent two weeks prior to the expiry of the response period to ascertain whether the taxpayer will issue a SOP in response to the Commissioner's disclosure notice. Contact can be made by phone or in writing. Where the taxpayer has issued a SOP, it will be forwarded to the actioning officer within five working days of receipt by Inland Revenue. Following receipt, the actioning officer will ascertain and record the following:  
      
    
    *   the date of issue of the SOP;  
          
        
    *   whether the SOP has been issued within two months starting on the date of issue of the disclosure notice; and  
          
        
    *   the salient features of the SOP including any deficiencies as to content.  
        
    
      
    
137.  Where it is practicable, a taxpayer's SOP will be acknowledged as received within 10 working days of receipt by Inland Revenue. However, where the Commissioner is aware of any deficiencies as to the content of the SOP, the taxpayer or their tax agent will usually be notified of these deficiencies as soon as practicable. They will also be notified again of the expiry date of the response period, by which those deficiencies must be rectified in order for the SOP to be valid and whether the Commissioner intends to issue a SOP in reply to the taxpayer's SOP.  
      
    
138.  Where a SOP has been issued outside the applicable response period, the taxpayer may apply for consideration of exceptional circumstances under section 89K. The reasons for accepting or rejecting the application will be documented and the actioning officer will make reasonable efforts to notify the taxpayer of the decision in writing within 15 working days of receipt of the taxpayer's application by Inland Revenue.  
      
    
139.  As mentioned above, the dispute will be treated as if it has not been commenced by the taxpayer, if they fail to issue a SOP within two months starting on the date of the issue of the disclosure notice and none of the exceptional circumstances under section 89K apply. Where practicable, the Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to notify the taxpayer of this within two weeks after expiry of the response period for the disclosure notice.

###  Commissioner's statement of position

140.  Where the dispute remains unresolved, the Commissioner will usually issue the taxpayer with a SOP in reply to the taxpayer's SOP within the response period, i.e. within two months starting on the date of issue of the taxpayer's SOP.  
      
    
141.  However, the Commissioner may apply to the High Court for further time to reply to the taxpayer's SOP under section 89M(10), provided the application is made before expiry of the response period, and the Commissioner considers it unreasonable to reply within the response period because of the number or complexity or novelty of matters raised in the taxpayer's SOP.  
      
    
142.  Such applications are expected to be rare but may arise where a taxpayer is less than co-operative with supplying information, and/or has failed to maintain proper and adequate records.  
      
    
143.  The Commissioner's SOP must be in the prescribed form and must contain sufficient detail to fairly inform the taxpayer of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law that the Commissioner wishes to rely on.  
      
    
144.  Section 89M(4) states:  
      
    The Commissioner's statement of position in the prescribed form must, with sufficient detail to fairly inform the disputant,-  
    
    1.  Give an outline of the facts on which the Commissioner intends to rely; and  
        
    2.  Give an outline of the evidence on which the Commissioner intends to rely; and  
        
    3.  Give an outline of the issues that the Commissioner considers will arise; and  
        
    4.  Specify the propositions of law on which the Commissioner intends to rely.  
        
    
      
    
145.  In addition to the Commissioner's SOP, it is possible for the Commissioner to provide the taxpayer with additional information in response to matters raised in the taxpayer's SOP under section 89M(8) within two months starting on the date of issue of the taxpayer's SOP. This is intended to cover the situation where the Commissioner has already issued a SOP within the applicable response period and then new evidence becomes available before the expiry of the response period. Any additional information must be provided as far as possible in the same format as the SOP of which it becomes a part.  
      
    
146.  However, in a dispute commenced by a taxpayer, the Commissioner will endeavour to include all the relevant details (including any additional information) in the Commissioner's SOP.  
      
    
147.  It must be noted that the taxpayer does not have a right of reply to the additional information provided by the Commissioner or the Commissioner's SOP, unless there is an agreement between the Commissioner and the taxpayer that additional information will be accepted. (Refer to "Agreement to include additional information" below.)

###  Agreement to include additional information

148.  There is scope to agree to add any additional information to the SOPs. Despite the absence of any statutory time limit, the Commissioner's practice is to allow one month (from the date of the issue of the Commissioner's SOP or the date of the provision of additional information by the Commissioner under section 89M(8)) for such agreement to be reached and information provided. However, this will be applied after taking into account the taxpayer's prior conduct, in particular, whether the taxpayer could have provided the information earlier through the application of due diligence.  
      
    
149.  The Commissioner will also consider the materiality and relevance of the additional information, and its capacity to help resolve the dispute.  
      
    
150.  The primary concern of the disputes resolution process is that both parties apply proper cooperation and due diligence in resolving the matters at issue. Additional information will therefore not be accepted unless proper cooperation and due diligence have been demonstrated.  
      
    
151.  Where a taxpayer requests to have additional information added and the request is declined, the reasons will usually be communicated to the taxpayer or their tax agent. The reasons will also be documented with detailed reference to the taxpayer's conduct, level of cooperation prior to the request and the reason for the information not being provided earlier.  
      
    
152.  Where the additional information is agreed to be added to the SOPs, the agreement will be made subject to the taxpayer agreeing that the Commissioner may include a response to the additional information to the SOP, if required.

###  Preparation for adjudication

153.  Within the disputes resolution process, the role of the Adjudication Unit in Inland Revenue's National Office is to take a fresh look at tax disputes in an impartial and independent manner, and to provide technically accurate decisions. The Commissioner's practice is to refer all disputes to the Adjudication Unit, where practicable. (Please refer to paragraph 154 of this Standard Practice Statement.)  
      
    
154.  Where the dispute commenced by the taxpayer is not resolved after both the taxpayer and the Commissioner have issued a SOP, the taxpayer may challenge the assessment by commencing proceedings in a court or Taxation Review Authority under section 138B(3). In this situation, the dispute will be heard by a court or Taxation Review Authority, rather than going through the adjudication process first.  
      
    
155.  A challenge under section 138B(3) can be made if the Commissioner has, within the applicable response period, rejected the taxpayer's proposed adjustments and does not subsequently issue an amended assessment. Pursuant to section 138B(3)(c), the decision to not issue an amended assessment is a disputable decision which can be challenged. A challenge under section 138C can be made if the Commissioner has, within the applicable response period, rejected the taxpayer's proposed adjustments in respect of the disputable decision.  
      
    
156.  However, where the dispute is referred to the Adjudication Unit in Inland Revenue's National Office, the actioning officer will prepare a cover sheet that will note all documents that need to be sent to the Adjudication Unit.  
      
    
157.  The cover sheet together with copies of the documents (NOPA, NOR, notes of conferences, the taxpayer's SOP, the Commissioner's SOP, additional information, material evidence, including expert opinions or specialist advice obtained, together with a schedule of all evidence held) will be sent to the Adjudication Unit.  
      
    
158.  A letter together with a copy of the cover sheet will be issued by the actioning officer to the taxpayer prior to the submissions and evidence being sent to the Adjudication Unit. The cover sheet and the letter are usually completed within one month from the date of issue of the Commissioner's SOP or the Commissioner's additional information provided under section 89M(8).  
      
    
159.  The purpose of this letter would be to seek concurrence on the material to be sent to the adjudicator-primarily in regard to documentary evidence that has been disclosed at the SOP phase. This letter will allow no more than 10 working days for response.  
      
    
160.  All materials to be forwarded to the Adjudication Unit will usually be forwarded within 12 working days of the issue of the letter to the taxpayer, advising the taxpayer that the materials are being forwarded to the Adjudication Unit.  
    
161.  Where an investigation has covered a number of issues, the cover sheet will outline which issues have been agreed upon between the Commissioner and the taxpayer and which issues are still in dispute. The adjudicator is then able to direct their attention to those issues in dispute. The adjudicator will not reconsider those issues that have been agreed upon.  
      
    
162.  The adjudicator usually only considers the material submitted by the Commissioner and the taxpayer. They do not usually seek out further information, although they may consider additional material which is relevant. However, if the additional material was not contained in the Commissioner or the taxpayer's SOP, and the matter proceeds to litigation, that material cannot be put forward as evidence in court (refer to discussion on the evidence exclusion rule above). The only exception is where the parties to the dispute agree to include it as additional information under section 89M.

###  Adjudication decision

163.  Once the Adjudication Unit has reached a conclusion the taxpayer and the actioning officer will be notified of the decision. The actioning officer will carry out any of the recommendations of the Adjudication Unit and follow up procedures where required. Where applicable, this includes issuing a notice of assessment to the taxpayer.  
      
    
164.  Where a decision is made by the Adjudication Unit against the Commissioner, the Commissioner must follow the Adjudication Unit's decision. The Commissioner is bound by the decision and cannot challenge that decision. The dispute will be at an end.  
      
    
165.  Where a decision is made by the Adjudication Unit against the taxpayer, the taxpayer may challenge the assessment (whether made by the Commissioner or the taxpayer).  
      
    
166.  In a dispute resolution process commenced by a taxpayer, the taxpayer if disagreeing with the Adjudicator's decision, may file proceedings in the Taxation Review Authority (either acting in its general or small claims jurisdiction) or the High Court if one of the following conditions is met:  
      
    
    *   the assessment was the subject of an adjustment proposed by the taxpayer which the Commissioner has rejected (section 138B(3)); or  
          
        
    *   a disputable decision other than an assessment was the subject of an adjustment proposed by the taxpayer that the Commissioner has rejected (section 138C).  
        
    
      
    
167.  The taxpayer must file proceedings with the Taxation Review Authority or High Court within the response period, i.e. two months starting on the date of issue of the assessment.

This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 23 March 2005.

Retrospective adjustments to salaries paid to shareholder-employees (May 05) (WITHDRAWN)
========================================================================================

Withdrawn statement SPS 05/05 Retrospective adjustments to salaries paid to shareholder-employees (May 05). Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

1.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out the criteria for considering whether the circumstances are appropriate for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to recognise retrospective reductions to salaries paid to shareholder-employees, where a genuine error has been made in the preparation of the company's accounts.

Application
-----------

2.  This SPS addresses the question of when a retrospective reduction in a shareholder-employee's salary may be made.  It does not apply to requests for retrospective amendments to PAYE deducted from shareholder-employee's salaries.  Furthermore, it does not apply to situations where a company proposes to increase a shareholder-employee's salary due to an increase in the company's income.
  
  
  
 6.  It also does not apply to situations where other mistakes have been made in a company's accounts and the company is seeking to rectify these mistakes without involving any retrospective reduction in salaries paid to shareholder-employees.
  
  
  
 10.  This SPS will apply from the 2005-2006 and subsequent income years.  For periods prior to the 2005-2006 income year, please refer to SPS _GNL 410 - Retrospective adjustments to salaries paid to shareholder-employees_.

Background
----------

5.  In the _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 9, No 4 (April 1997) at page 9, Inland Revenue published an item entitled _Retrospective adjustment to salaries paid to shareholder-employees._  Its effect was that where an error had been made in the preparation of the accounts of a company, Inland Revenue would amend the company's assessment to take account of the additional expenses that should have been included in the original return.  However, where the company and the shareholder-employee proposed to reduce the salary amount that was originally agreed to be paid by an amount equal to the additional expenses allowed, Inland Revenue would not agree to these consequential adjustments.  In that case, neither the company's nor the individual's assessments would be amended to reflect the fact that a reduced salary would be paid.
  
  
  
 9.  Subsequent to the publication of the item, the Taxation Review Authority considered the same issue in _Case U27_ (1999) 19 NZTC 9,261.  Willy DJ arrived at a different conclusion to the item.  His Honour held that decisions as to the amounts of a shareholder-employee's salary for two income years that were made mistakenly could be reversed or amended.  In that case, the accountant was not fully informed of the company's financial affairs (there was, unknown to him, a tax dispute with Inland Revenue).  This led him to prepare end of year accounts that did not accurately reflect the company's true position.
  
  
  
 13.  The company had over several years fallen behind in accounting for PAYE, GST, ACC premiums and FBT to the Commissioner.  The accumulated taxes and penalties resulted in a substantial overstatement of the resulting profit.  This was important because salaries in this company were only ever paid out of profits.  Therefore, the level of salaries was based on incorrect profit figures.  Although the resolutions authorising the salaries were prepared, these were never signed.  When the accountant discovered his mistake, new resolutions were prepared to authorise the distribution of reduced salaries.
  
  
  
 17.  The Taxation Review Authority held that section 75 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (section EB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, and sections BD 3 and EI 8 of the Income Tax Act 2004), which deemed a person to have derived income when it has been dealt with in the person's interest or on their behalf in various ways (including being "credited in account"), applied, i.e. it operated on the circumstances brought about by the company resolutions correcting the error.  His Honour decided that the company was entitled to and did rectify the error when it came to its notice and the shareholder-employee was obliged to pay tax only on the reduced amounts of income for the relevant income years.
  
  
  
 21.  In the light of _Case U27_and other relevant factors, such as company law, the published item in 1997 was withdrawn and replaced by SPS _GNL-410 - Retrospective adjustments to salaries paid to shareholder-employees_, which was published in the _Tax Information Bulletin_, Vol 15, No 6 (June 2003). This SPS updates and replaces SPS _GNL-410_.

Legislation
-----------

**Income Tax Act 2004**

**BD 3 Allocation of income to particular income years**

_Application_

1.  Every amount of income must be allocated to an income year under this section.

_General rule_

2.  An amount of income is allocated to the income year in which the amount is derived, unless a provision in any of Parts C or E to I provides for allocation on another basis.

_Interpretation of derive_

3.  When the time of derivation of an amount of income is being determined, regard must be had  to case law, which-
    1.  requires some people to recognise income on an accrual basis; and
    2.  requires other people to recognise income on a cash basis; and
    3.  more generally, defines the concept of derivation.

_Income credited in account_

4.  Despite subsection (3), income that has not previously been derived by a person is treated as being derived when it is credited in their account or, in some other way, dealt with in their interest or on their behalf.

_Role of Part E_

5.  Part E (Timing and quantifying rules) contains a number of provisions that-
    1.  specifically modify the allocation of income or have the effect of modifying the allocation of income; or
    2.  allocate income as part of the process of quantifying it.

_Single allocation_

6.  An amount of income may be allocated only once.

**EI 8 Matching rule for employment income of shareholder-employee**

_Matching if company allowed deduction_

1.  If a company is allowed a deduction for expenditure on employment income that is paid or is payable to a shareholder-employee under section CE 1 (Amounts derived in connection with employment), the income is allocated in the way set out in subsections (2) and (3).

_Allocation to deduction year unless unexpired_

2.  The income is allocated to the income year to which the deduction allowed to the company is allocated, except for an amount equal to any unexpired portion for the income year of the company's expenditure under section EA 4 (Deferred payment of employment income).

_Allocation otherwise when ceases being unexpired_

3.  The remaining income is allocated to the income year or years in which the corresponding amount of the company's expenditure on the income is no longer treated as an unexpired portion.

Standard Practice
-----------------

10.  Where  
     
    
    *   a genuine error has been made in the accounts as a result of which a deduction has not been claimed for legitimate expenditure incurred, or a receipt has been incorrectly categorised, and
    *   the company as a result decides to reduce the amount of salary previously allocated, and
    *   the company has passed a resolution reflecting the reduction in light of the relationship between the company and the shareholder-employee, and
    *   a request for correction has been filed with Inland Revenue with a copy of the resolution,
    
      
    Inland Revenue will consider the request to amend assessments in accordance with the principles set out in a separate SPS (currently this is SPS _INV-510 Requests to amend assessments_), provided full disclosure is made and the relevant financial statements have been amended and lodged.

11.  It is expected that requests of this nature will be made in a timely fashion.  What is timely involves an exercise of judgment.  There are two aspects to consider:  
     
    *   Once a mistake has been discovered then the parties should set about attending to it promptly.
    *   As to how long a mistake may go undetected, the answer is less certain. Timeliness requires that a mistake is discovered when in the course of events and in the circumstances of the taxpayer company, one would have expected it to have been discovered.  It could be that many months may go by before the error is detected.  For example, in _Case U27_, there was a lack of communication between the accountant and principal shareholder and director. The latter kept certain information about the arrears of taxes to himself.

12.  Inland Revenue considers the presence of a "genuine error" in the sense of oversight to be a crucial requirement for accepting the taxpayer's application.  It is considered that the shareholder-employee salaries are generally irrevocable, unless a genuine error has been made.
  
  
  
 16.  Whether something is a genuine error is determined by the Commissioner.  If, after considering all relevant information, the Commissioner is not satisfied that a genuine error was made, the Commissioner will not amend an assessment.

_**Examples**_ 

14.  The following examples provide some guidance on what will not be regarded as "a genuine error" for the purpose of this SPS:  
     
    1.  _Fraud committed by a shareholder-employee_  
          
        Where a shareholder-employee has committed fraud in relation to their salaries or other shareholder-employees' salaries in the company, no genuine error has been made.  Inland Revenue will not amend the company's and shareholder-employees' assessments.
      
      
      
     5.  _Retrospective reduction of a shareholder-employee's salary with the intention to reduce the shareholder-employee's child support liabilities or to increase their entitlement to family assistance_  
          
        Inland Revenue will not amend the company's and shareholder-employee's assessments in the above case.  This is because no genuine error exists, merely a changed decision motivated by additional benefit to the employee.
      
      
      
     9.  _Retrospective reduction of a shareholder-employee's salary with the intention to assist with the company's cash flow_  
          
        Inland Revenue will not amend the company's and shareholder-employee's assessments in the above case.  This is because no genuine error exists.
  
  
  
 18.  Where Inland Revenue agrees to a retrospective adjustment on the shareholder-employees' salaries, sections BD 3 and EI 8 of the Income Tax Act 2004 will deem the shareholder-employee's salary to be the amount as determined by the amending resolution and under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, Inland Revenue will adjust the company's and employee's assessments accordingly. 

**_Examples_**

16.  The following examples may give some guidance as to when Inland Revenue will permit adjustments to be made.  
     
    1.  _Incorrect treatment of receipt_  
          
        Where there is an error in the categorisation of a capital receipt (e.g. a loan repayment) as revenue and this results in an overstatement of income, an adjustment may be made. 
      
      
      
     5.  _Omission of expenditure_  
          
        Where an error arises from the omission of deductible expenditure incurred in the current year, an adjustment may be made. 
      
      
      
     9.  _Company still in profit despite the error made_  
          
        Although an error has been made in the accounts, that error is not sufficient to produce an overall loss and the company still has sufficient profit after the accounts have been corrected to cover the salary originally agreed to be paid.  In this situation, Inland Revenue is less likely to exercise the discretion, but will consider each application for an adjustment on its merits.  For example, the Commissioner will need to consider the nature of the contract between the parties and past practice.  While in this circumstance, there would not be the same pressing need to amend or rescind the salary declaration, nevertheless the company could find the situation inconvenient and desire that the amount credited to the shareholder-employee at least be reduced to some extent.  Past company practices of retaining profits may be taken into account.  If the genuine error causes non-compliance with these practices (e.g. the excessive shareholder-employee's salary reduces the percentage of company profits normally retained), the Commissioner may allow the adjustment.
      
      
      
     13.  _Accrual expenditure_  
          
        A company has committed itself to certain expenditure in one year although it has not had to discharge or bear that expense until the following year.  If such an item has been overlooked and the accounts need revision, it would be less likely for the shareholder-employee's salary to be revised.  There may still be funds available to pay them.  This is a matter where circumstances will vary.  Where there is accrual expenditure, the answer will depend on the amount of the unexpired portion of that expenditure relating to future income years.  The Commissioner will consider each application for an adjustment on its merits.
      
      
      
     17.  _Change of shareholding in the company_  
          
        Genuine errors were made by the company before the original shareholder-employees sold their shares to the current shareholders of the company.  The current shareholders passed a resolution to retrospectively reduce the original shareholder-employees' salaries in prior income years.   
          
        Provided that the original shareholder-employees were fully informed and agreed to such reductions, the Commissioner may agree to adjust the company's and the original shareholder-employees' assessments.  
          
        However, if the original shareholder-employees disagree with the resolution to reduce their salaries in prior income years, the Commissioner will usually not adjust the company's and the original shareholder-employees' assessments in these cases until the dispute between the original shareholder-employees and the current shareholders is resolved.

Non-standard balance dates for managed funds and "as agent" returns (May 05) (WITHDRAWN)
========================================================================================

Withdrawn statement SPS 05/06 - Non-standard balance dates for managed funds and 'as agent' returns. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

1.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) extends operational practice relating to consent for the use of non-standard balance dates to recognise special taxpayer/administrator situations.  
      
    
2.  The SPS provides indicative examples of situations where Inland Revenue may consent to applications by taxpayers to adopt non-standard balance dates for managed funds (unit trusts, group investment funds and superannuation funds) and agents for non-resident insurers (in respect of "as agent" returns).

Application
-----------

3.  This SPS applies from the 2005-2006 and subsequent income years. Refer to SPS _GNL-120 Non-standard balance dates for managed funds and "as agent" returns_ (SPS _GNL-120_) for periods prior to the 2005-2006 income year only. This SPS applies only to applications by:  
      
    *   managed funds to adopt a non-standard balance date in common with the manager or trustee if Inland Revenue recognises a parent-subsidiary like relationship between parties; and  
          
        
    *   entities deemed to be agents of non-resident insurers to file "as agent" returns in terms of section FC 16 of the Income Tax Act 2004.

Summary
-------

4.  Inland Revenue's practice in relation to providing consent for the use of non-standard balance dates is currently as set out in _Tax Information Bulletins_ Vol 3, No 9 (June 1992) and Vol 5, No 11 (April 1994).  
      
    
5.  SPS _GNL-120_ extends the parent-subsidiary criteria to include analogous situations that exist between managed funds and the entities that are responsible for their administration.  
      
    
6.  Consent may be given for managed funds and agents for non-resident insurers to adopt a balance date other than 31 March if any of the following applies:  
      
    
    *   Inland Revenue recognises that a parent-subsidiary like relationship exists between the parties e.g. the relationship between the managed fund and its trustee or manager. This is demonstrated by the manager/trustee preparing accounts, promoting the entity, making strategic investment decisions and providing other administration services to the trust; or  
          
        
    *   an employer superannuation fund is established for the benefit of the employees and there is a close relationship between the employer and the superannuation fund; or  
          
        
    *   the agent of a non-resident insurer is required to file "as agent" returns on behalf of the non-resident.
    
      
    
7.  In recognition of the equivalent of a parent-subsidiary relationship, Inland Revenue will consent to applications to adopt the following non-standard balance dates -

  
 

| Entity | **Approved non-standard balance date** |
| --- | --- |
| Unit trust | Balance date of unit trust manager |
| Group Investment Fund | Balance date of group investment fund manager |
| Employer Superannuation Fund | Balance date of employer |
| Other Superannuation Fund | Balance date of trustee |
| "As agent" return | Balance date of entity preparing "as agent" return |

Background
----------

8.  Prior to the publication of SPS _GNL-120_, taxpayers might adopt a balance date other than 31 March (a "non-standard balance date") only if:  
      
    
    *   the nature of their business made a 31 March balance date inappropriate; or  
          
        
    *   a subsidiary wished to align its balance date with its parent company; or  
          
        
    *   an estate wished to adopt the deceased's date of death; or  
          
        
    *   a shareholder-employee wanted the same balance date as the company.
    
      
    
9.  Managed funds and agents for non-resident insurers would not qualify for a non-standard balance date under the practice currently as set out in _Tax Information Bulletins_ Vol 3, No 9 (June 1992) and Vol 5, No 11 (April 1994). SPS _GNL-120_ and this SPS therefore extend the previous practices, in respect of affected taxpayers, to reduce compliance costs.

Legislation
-----------

10.  Section 38 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 reads:
    
    > 38\. RETURNS TO ANNUAL BALANCE DATE  
    >   
    > 
    > 1.  Instead of furnishing a tax year return under section 33 on the basis of a corresponding income year that ends on 31 March, a taxpayer (other than a taxpayer to whom section 33A(1) or (5) applies) may, with the consent of the Commissioner, elect to furnish a return based on a corresponding income year that ends with the date of the annual balance of the taxpayer's accounts.
    > 2.  (Repealed)
    > 3.  Any election made by a taxpayer for the purposes of this section shall continue in force unless and until it is altered by the taxpayer with the prior approval in writing of the Commissioner.
    
11.  Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 defines group investment fund, superannuation fund, superannuation scheme and unit trust as follows:  
      
    **group investment fund** means a group investment fund established under the-  
      
    
    1.  Public Trust Act 2001; or
    2.  Trustee Companies Act 1967; or
    3.  Public Trust Office Act 1957
    
      
      
    **superannuation fund**\-  
      
    
    1.  means a superannuation scheme registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989; and
    2.  when referring to a superannuation fund that is a trust, means the trustees of the fund
    
      
      
    **unit trust**\-  
      
    1.  means a scheme or arrangement, whether made before or after the commencement of this Act, that is made for the purpose or has the effect of providing facilities for subscribers, purchasers, or contributors to participate, as beneficiaries under a trust, in income and gains (whether in the nature of capital or income) arising from the money, investments, and other property that are for the time being subject to the trust; and
    2.  does not include-
        1.  a trust for the benefit of debenture holders:
        2.  the Common Fund of Public Trust:
        3.  a Group Investment Fund established by Public Trust:
        4.  the Common Fund of the Maori Trustee:
        5.  a Group Investment Fund established under the Trustee Companies Act 1967:
        6.  a friendly society registered under the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act 1982:
        7.  a superannuation fund:
        8.  an employee share purchase scheme:
        9.  a fund that satisfies section CW 38 (Funeral trusts):
        10.  any other trust of any specified kind that is declared by the Governor-General, by Order in Council, not to be a unit trust for the purposes of section HE 1 (Unit trusts)

Definition of terms
-------------------

12.  "**As agent**" refers to obligations of a person as an agent of a non-resident insurer in accordance with section FC 16 of the Income Tax Act 2004.  
      
    
13.  "**Non-standard balance date**" means a balance date other than 31 March.

Standard Practice
-----------------

14.  Inland Revenue will consider consent to applications for non-standard balance dates from the following entities.  
      
    *   The trustee of a unit trust that wishes to align its balance date with that of its manager.  
          
        
    *   The trustee of a group investment fund that wishes to align its balance date with that of its manager.  
          
        
    *   The trustee of a superannuation fund that wishes to align its balance date with that of its trustee or, where the fund is administered by an employer for the benefit of its employees, the balance date of the employer.  
          
        
    *   A taxpayer (who is a resident for taxation purposes) required to file an "as agent" return that wishes to align the balance date of that return with the taxpayer's own non-standard balance date.

_Indicative examples of recognised relationships_

15.  A taxpayer may change to non-standard balance dates if one of the following examples applies:  
      
    *   **A unit trust wishes to align its balance date with that of its manager**  
          
        A unit trust may align its balance date to that of its manager. The manager is the entity with responsibility for the management of the unit trust and is appointed under the trust deed. Adoption of the manager's balance date is appropriate only if the manager has retained the responsibility for day-to-day administration of the unit trust.  
          
        
    *   **A group investment fund wishes to align its balance date with that of its manager**  
          
        A group investment fund is administered and overseen by a manager. The fund may have a separate trustee, although there is no requirement that the trustee and manager be separate entities. Consent will only be granted to align the fund's balance date with that of the manager.  
          
        As with unit trusts, the concession applies when the manager has retained the responsibility for day-to-day administration of the trust and for preparing the trust's accounts. When these functions have been contracted out to a third party, it is not appropriate to adopt the manager's balance date.  
          
        
    *   **A managed fund wishes to align its tax balance** **date for financial reporting purposes**  
          
        A managed fund (including unit trusts, group investment funds and superannuation funds) may align its balance date with that for financial reporting purposes if it can be demonstrated that the alignment of balance dates helps reduce the managed fund's tax risks. The purpose of this concession is to promote voluntary compliance and good tax practices. Inland Revenue expects the managed fund to set out the reasons for changing their balance dates. These reasons will be examined on a case-by-case basis.  
          
        However, this concession does not apply if:  
          
        
        *   the reason for changing the balance date is to improve the managed fund's administration of human resources (e.g. smoothing the workflows of their managers).  
              
            
        *   the managed fund cannot provide evidence of what the tax risks are and how the change of balance date helps to mitigate these risks.  
              
            
        *   the managed fund can identify some of its tax risks but the change of balance date is irrelevant to the mitigation of these risks.
        
          
          
        
    *   **Superannuation funds**  
          
        
        *   **An employer superannuation fund wishes to align its balance date with that of the employer**  
              
            A scheme established for the benefit of employees of an employer may apply to adopt the balance date of that employer.  
              
            
        *   **Any other superannuation fund (e.g. a wholesale or retail fund) wishes to align its balance date with that of its trustee**  
              
            The trust deed under which a superannuation fund is established will appoint a trustee to supervise the fund. Consent will be given for a fund to align its balance date with that of the trustee, provided that the trustee's role has not been contracted out to a third party.
        
          
          
        
    *   **A taxpayer who is an agent of a non-resident insurer wishes to align the balance date of its "as agent" return to its own non-standard balance date**  
          
        A taxpayer who insures with a non-resident insurer is required to return part of the premiums paid as income in a return known as an "as agent" return (section FC 16 of the Income Tax Act 2004). This income is returned by the taxpayer "as agent" for the non-resident insurer.  
          
        Taxpayers with an approved non-standard balance date for their own returns will be granted consent to align the balance dates of their "as agent" returns to this date.

_Applications_

16.  Applications for consent to non-standard balance dates are to be in writing and should provide the following information:  
      
    
    *   full name of the entity seeking the non-standard balance date  
          
        
    *   name of tax agent  
          
        
    *   full details of the reason why consent should be given to the use of a non-standard balance date  
          
        
    *   details of the nature of the relationship between the entity applying for a change in balance date and the entity to which the balance date is being aligned  
          
        
    *   any other reasons to demonstrate why a proposed non-standard balance date is considered appropriate.
    
      
      
    
17.  All requests for consent to non-standard balance date elections for unit trusts, group investment funds, superannuation funds and taxpayers required to file "as agent" returns should be sent to:  
      
    Managed Funds Industry Desk  
    Financial Sector  
    Corporates Group, Inland Revenue  
    P O Box 2198  
    WELLINGTON

_Indicative examples where consent will not be given for a non-standard balance date_

18.  Inland Revenue will not normally consent to a taxpayer's application for a non-standard balance date in the following situations.  
      
    *   The anniversary date of the commencement of the business is not a valid reason for a non-standard balance date. Inland Revenue will not consent to the use of a non-standard balance date if it is for the reasons of tax deferral or tax avoidance, or to take undue advantage of a tax incentive or concession.  
          
        
    *   Consent will not be given where the election is made to spread the balance dates of a number of funds in order to smooth the workflow of the manager or the trustee of those funds.  
          
        
    *   In cases where administrative functions have been contracted out to a third party (for example, a specialist administration manager) Inland Revenue will not provide consent to adopt the manager's balance date.  
          
        
19.  The adoption of a non-standard balance date will continue until the date is changed by a further election. The process for change of non-standard balance dates is the same as above.

This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 6 May 2005.

Section 17 Notices (July 2005) (WITHDRAWN)
==========================================

Withdrawn SPS 05/08 - Section 17 Notices (Jul 2005). Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement (the "Statement") outlines the procedures Inland Revenue will follow when issuing notices, including third party requests, under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section 17, which relates to requisitions for information, is one of Inland Revenue's information-gathering powers. Other powers (such as section 16) which relate to the gathering of information can be, and are, used by the Commissioner in conjunction with section 17 but they are not discussed in this Standard Practice Statement.  
      
    
2.  This Statement has been updated to incorporate changes to the procedures followed by Inland Revenue when issuing section 17 notices as a result of the introduction of the taxpayer's statutory right to claim non-disclosure of certain tax advice documents. The statutory provisions are contained in sections 20B to 20G of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Application

3.  This Statement applies from 22 June 2005 and replaces GNL - 440 _Section 17 Notices_ published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 16, No 7 (August 2004).  
      
    
4.  The references to the right to claim non-disclosure for tax advice documents applies to section 17 notices issued after 21 June 2005 which require disclosure of documents that may be eligible to be tax advice documents. For further information on the right to claim non-disclosure refer to the SPS 05/07 _Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents_ published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 17, No 6 (August 2005) and available on Inland Revenue's website: www.ird.govt.nz  
      
    
5.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this Statement refer to the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Background

6.  Before Inland Revenue can verify or make an assessment of a person's taxation liability, information is needed. The Tax Administration Act 1994 gives the necessary powers to collect information including section 17, which empowers the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to require any person to furnish in writing any information and produce books and documents for inspection where it is considered "necessary or relevant" for the Commissioner to exercise his statutory functions.  
      
    
7.  Inland Revenue will usually request information, books or documents without expressly relying on section 17. This practice fosters a spirit of reasonableness and mutual cooperation.  
      
    
8.  If information is not provided voluntarily or in a timely manner Inland Revenue will use the statutory authority in section 17 to demand the information. In this case Inland Revenue issues a section 17 notice. Non-compliance with the section 17 notice will result in Inland Revenue invoking the statutory remedies. Inland Revenue reserves the right in some cases to commence the information gathering process with a section 17 notice, for example in cases where it knows of prior instances of non-cooperation from the taxpayer and/or their advisers.  
      
    
9.  Any request for information with express reference to section 17 should contain a reference to the taxpayers' right to claim non-disclosure to ensure the recipient of the notice is aware of this statutory right belonging to the taxpayer unless the nature of the request does not warrant a reference to the right to claim non-disclosure (ie the request for information relates purely to information which is not contained in tax advice documents). Refer to the SPS 05/07 _Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents_ for further information on what constitutes a tax advice document. If a reference to the non-disclosure right in the request for information is required, the level of detail contained in that reference will depend on the nature of the request, the type of information being requested and the recipient of the request.  
      
    
10.  The process for making a claim of non-disclosure is set out in the SPS 05/07 _Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents_. The claim must be made in the specified time period after the Commissioner has issued a section 17 notice requiring disclosure of these documents which may be eligible to be tax advice documents.

### **Standard Practice**

**Section 17 Notice**

11.  Section 17 gives the Commissioner the power to require persons to produce for inspection books and documents which the Commissioner considers necessary or relevant for any purpose relating to the administration or enforcement of the Inland Revenue Acts. Included within the expression "book and document" are all books, accounts, rolls, records, registers, papers, and all photographic plates, microfilms, photostatic negatives, prints, tapes, discs, computer reels and perforated rolls. It is considered that "discs" would include any kind of recordable disc, ie compact and floppy discs, and DVDs, etc.  
      
    
12.  Where information is to be demanded under section 17 a notice will be issued (refer to Notice "A" in the attached Appendix). Prior to issuing a section 17 notice, Inland Revenue will consider the following points.  
      
    12.1 _The reason for requiring the information_
    
    1.  Inland Revenue will only require disclosure of information considered necessary or relevant and that is reasonably required in the circumstances of the case.
    
      
      
    12.2 _The impact of the demand on the suppliers of information_
    
    1.  Inland Revenue will be reasonable in relation to the quantity of information sought and the timeframe for providing that information. Inland Revenue will reconsider parts of the demand where there is genuine difficulty in obtaining and/or providing that information.
    
      
      
    12.3 _Previous requests for information or attempts to resolve disputes_
    
    1.  Generally, apart from where the taxpayer or their authorized tax advisor wishes to claim the right of non-disclosure, a section 17 notice will only be issued following a failure to provide information previously requested, or where specific issues have been identified and an attempt to resolve those issues has failed. There will be occasions where a section 17 notice may be issued without a prior request, e.g. where there have been prior instances of non-cooperation from the taxpayer and/or their advisers, or where the Commissioner otherwise considers that delay, or a less formal approach, may unreasonably increase the risk of non-compliance. (Depending on the circumstances, a refusal or failure to comply with an informal request for information would be non-cooperation and a refusal or failure to comply with a more formal request for information, ie one mentioning section 17, would be non-compliance.) Where the taxpayer's adviser has in the past been uncooperative (including in respect of matters unrelated to the taxpayer) this may be a factor to be taken into account in considering whether a section 17 notice may be issued without a prior request.  
          
        
    2.  An example of a case where a notice might be issued without a prior request is where an audit has been in progress for some time without a request under section 17 having been made. It would then be appropriate, because the matter may proceed to adjudication, that a notice be issued to ensure that all relevant information has been gathered.
    
      
      
    12.4 _Whether the information is available publicly_
    
    1.  Inland Revenue will generally not use section 17 where information is available publicly and will meet the usual charges, for example where the information is held by the Land Information New Zealand, the Companies Office and Quotable Value New Zealand. Public availability of information does not, however, prevent Inland Revenue from requiring information to be provided under section 17.
    
      
      
    12.5 _Whether the Commissioner requires disclosure of the tax contextual information_
    
    1.  Where the section 17 notice contains a reference to the non-disclosure right, the section 17 notice should also refer to when the tax contextual information (ie the factual and non tax advice content of the documents) would be required to be disclosed if the Commissioner requires such a disclosure. The section 17 notice should generally advise that disclosure of the tax contextual information (if required by the Commissioner) will be required in a subsequent notice or in rare cases, the section 17 notice will contain a requirement to disclose the tax contextual information as part of the disclosure requirements for the section 17 notice. For further information on the operation of the right to claim non-disclosure and the definition of key terms refer to the SPS 05/07 _Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents_.  
          
        
    2.  Notice "A" in the attached Appendix includes a standard paragraph referring to the disclosure of the tax contextual information. In rare cases, where the Commissioner requires disclosure of the tax contextual information as part of the disclosure requirements in the section 17 notice, an alternative paragraph (as set out in Notice "A" in the attached Appendix) should replace the standard paragraph included in the section 17 notice.
    
      
      
    12.6 _The effect upon the disputes resolution process_
    
    1.  The disputes resolution process relies on full and prompt disclosure by both the Commissioner and the disputant. Where previous requests have not been met with full and prompt disclosure Inland Revenue will use section 17 notices to obtain information. The use of section 17 prior to the commencement of the disputes resolution process may mean that the number of matters entering that process will be reduced.  
          
        
    2.  Section 17 may also be used during the disputes process to ensure that all relevant information is gathered and available to Inland Revenue. The disputes process may be truncated and an amended assessment issued where a taxpayer has failed to comply with a section 17 notice during the disputes process.
    
      
      
    12.7 _Inland Revenue's intention to ensure compliance with the notice_
    
    1.  Generally, Inland Revenue will use a section 17 notice only where it is prepared to invoke the statutory remedies in the event of non-compliance.
    
      
      
    12.8 _The use of section 16 powers_
    
    1.  In some cases Inland Revenue will not request information but will access the books and documents under section 16 which gives the Commissioner the power to enter all places for the purpose of inspecting any books and documents.
    
      
      
    
13.  Nothing in section 17 precludes Inland Revenue from seeking information from multiple sources and from sources other than the affected taxpayer.
14.  Separate section 17 notices may be issued for different information and books or documents. If the Commissioner requires the information to be delivered to Inland Revenue, the notice will state that the information be furnished, or the books and documents be produced, to a particular office of the Department.  
      
    _Requests for significant amounts of documentation_  
      
    
15.  If a significant amount of documentation is requested, the person providing the information will be permitted to send the documents to the nearest Inland Revenue office, which will arrange for them to be forwarded to the office conducting the investigation. Where the delivery costs would be reduced by $20 or more by sending to the nearest Inland Revenue office then it is considered that the amount of documentation is significant. In this circumstance we would generally accept the request to send the information to the nearest office. [\[1\]](#1)
      
      
    
16.  The decision whether or not to issue a section 17 notice will generally be the responsibility of a team leader and approval to issue the notice should be given by an officer at or above that level with the exception of section 17 notices requiring disclosure of the tax contextual information.  
      
    _Legal professional privilege_  
      
    
17.  A taxpayer is entitled, and should have sufficient time, to seek legal advice in respect of whether particular books or documents are subject to legal professional privilege. Section 20 covers the topic of solicitor-client privilege, ie privilege of confidential communications between legal practitioners and their clients. Briefly, it provides that information is privileged from disclosure if it is a confidential communication between a legal practitioner and another legal practitioner (acting in their professional capacities) or a legal practitioner in the practitioner's professional capacity and the practitioner's client and it is made or brought into existence for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice or assistance. However financial information and investment records kept in connection with solicitors' trust accounts are not privileged. The other kind of privilege, litigation privilege which relates to pending or contemplated litigation, is not covered by section 20.  
      
    _Right to claim non-disclosure for tax advice documents_  
      
    
18.  The statutory right to claim non-disclosure relates to tax advice documents required to be disclosed under the Commissioner's information gathering powers including the issuing of section 17 notices. A claim for non-disclosure involves certain disclosures by the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor. The right to claim non-disclosure belongs to the taxpayer. The statutory provisions contain specific time periods in which the taxpayer (or their authorised tax advisor) is required to make the necessary disclosures. These time periods reflect the need for taxpayers (and their authorised tax advisors) to have sufficient time to ascertain whether particular books or documents otherwise required to be disclosed under a section 17 notice are eligible to be tax advice documents. The taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor will be given at least 28 days to claim the non-disclosure right for those books or documents eligible to be tax advice documents and required to be disclosed under the section 17 notice. This time period will be specified in the section 17 notice. The taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor can make the claim for non-disclosure by completing the form _Tax advice document claim_ (_IR 519)_.  
      
    
19.  Typically, the Commissioner will then decide after having reviewed the documents and information received pursuant to the section 17 notice, including the information provided on the form IR 519 whether disclosure of the tax contextual information from the documents eligible to be tax advice documents is required. If the tax contextual information is required, a subsequent section 17 notice (refer to Notice "E" in the attached Appendix) will be issued for the tax contextual information and will allow at least another 28 days to provide the tax contextual information.  
      
    
20.  The tax contextual information must be provided on the prescribed form which is the _Tax contextual information disclosure (IR 520)_. The form IR 520 contains a statutory declaration which needs to be completed by a tax advisor. For further information on tax contextual information and the necessary disclosure requirements, refer to the SPS 05/07 _Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents_ or consult your tax advisor. A copy of the SPS can be found on Inland Revenue's website [www.ird.govt.nz](http://www.ird.govt.nz/)
      
      
    
21.  In rare cases, if warranted, the Commissioner may require both the claim for the non-disclosure right and the disclosure of the tax contextual information from those documents potentially eligible to be tax advice documents in the one section 17 notice. In such a case, a taxpayer (and their authorised tax advisor) will be given at least 28 days to comply with all the disclosure requirements of the section 17 notice.  
      
    
22.  The discretion to require disclosure of the tax contextual information from documents eligible to be tax advice documents will be exercised sparingly in order to minimise compliance costs, and so as not to undermine the spirit of the non-disclosure right rules. Accordingly, an exercise of this discretion will be limited to officers of Inland Revenue at an appropriately high level of delegated authority.  
      
    _Advice and other work papers prepared by accountants_  
      
    
23.  The Commissioner's policy statement referred to as _Commissioner's Policy on Access to Advice and other Workpapers Prepared by Accountants_, issued on 6 September 1993 applies to section 17 notices issued on or before 21 June 2005.  
      
    
24.  Any section 17 notice issued after 21 June 2005 may be subject to the statutory right of non-disclosure and taxpayers and officers of Inland Revenue should follow the practices outlined in the SPS 05/07 _Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents_.  
      
    
25.  The Commissioner's policy statement on Access to Audit Work Papers, issued on 15 August 1991 applies in so far as the section 17 notice requires disclosure of auditors' workpapers. The Commissioner is currently considering updating this policy statement to reflect changes in legislation and within Inland Revenue since the publishing of that statement.  
      
    _Correction of information_  
      
    
26.  Where a taxpayer has complied with an information requisition then, in accordance with section 6 of the Privacy Act 1993 (Information Privacy Principle No. 3), the taxpayer will be allowed to seek access to and correction of that information where Inland Revenue has incorrectly recorded the information.

**Changes to Section 17 Notice**

27.  In following the above process every attempt will be made to maintain contact with the taxpayer so as to provide an opportunity for concerns to be raised. Inland Revenue expects holders of information to contact Inland Revenue where there is genuine difficulty in complying with the demand.
28.  Any change to the date for compliance must be agreed before the expiration of the original date. Beyond this, the offence for non-compliance has already occurred and an extension of time will not be given.  
      
    
29.  Where modification of the notice is agreed it will be recorded in writing (refer to specimen Notice "B" in the attached Appendix).  
      
    
30.  Any change to the date for compliance as set out in the section 17 notice should consider the impact of the change of date on the time periods allowed for claiming the right of non-disclosure.

**Requests to persons other than the taxpayer**

31.  Some holders of information, such as banks, are willing to provide information but require Inland Revenue to state its legal authority before they will release the information. Generally, where information is required from persons other than the taxpayer and cooperation is likely, Inland Revenue will initially seek the information by a letter (refer to specimen Letter "C1" and the slightly more formal Notice "C2" in the Appendix). The letter may follow a discussion. Letter "C1" is provided by way of example and may be varied according to the circumstances, and it may or may not contain a reference to section 17_**.**_  
      
    
32.  The letter is not a formal section 17 demand. However, generally where the letter is not complied with, a section 17 notice based on specimen Notice "A" will be issued so the third party recipient is informed of the consequences of their non-compliance before further action is initiated.  
      
    
33.  Any section 17 notice issued to a third party such as a bank should refer to the non-disclosure right subject to paragraph 9 of this Statement. The recipient of the section 17 notice may then choose (if appropriate) to contact the taxpayer to confirm whether the taxpayer (or their authorised tax advisor) is wanting to claim the non-disclosure right over the books or documents required to be disclosed under the section 17 notice issued to the third party.  
      
    _Controlled non-residents_  
      
    
34.  Under section 17(1), Inland Revenue may require a New Zealand resident to provide information in circumstances where the resident's non-resident employees or agents hold the information for the resident. Section 17(1B) now gives Inland Revenue the further power to require a New Zealand resident to provide information held by a non-resident entity controlled, directly or indirectly, by that New Zealand resident [\[2\]](#2)
    . For example, a husband and wife have 51% of the shares in a foreign company. Inland Revenue can issue a section 17 notice to them requiring that they furnish information held by the foreign company. Subsection (1C) sets out further rules for determining whether a non-resident is controlled, in particular it provides that foreign secrecy laws are to be ignored.  
      
    
35.  If obtaining the information would be a costly or difficult exercise then generally it would not be required where the tax at stake is immaterial, or when Inland Revenue has access to this information through other sources.  
      
    _Medical information_  
      
    
36.  In rare instances Inland Revenue may seek access to an individual's medical records. For example, it may be necessary to inquire into the genuineness of a medical certificate. Such requests need careful consideration.

**Non-compliance with a section 17 notice**

37.  It is an offence not to comply with a section 17 notice. Sections 143 and 143A state that an offence has occurred where a person does not provide, or knowingly does not provide, information to the Commissioner when required to do so by a tax law. Furthermore, section 143B provides that it is an offence for a person knowingly not to provide information to the Commissioner or any other person when required to do so under section 17, where that person or any other person does so intending to evade the assessment or payment of tax. However, sections 143 and 143A of the Act state that no person may be convicted of an offence for not providing information, or knowingly not providing information (other than tax returns and tax forms) to the Commissioner if that person proves they did not, as and when required to provide the information, have that information in their knowledge, possession or control. Control here is used in its wider sense and includes material held by others on one's behalf.  
      
    
38.  If the non-compliance with a section 17 notice relates to a requirement to disclose the tax contextual information from tax advice documents, a number of offences may have occurred, including:
    
    1.  Offences under sections 143 to 143B; or
    2.  An offence under section 143H (obstruction); or
    3.  An offence under section 11 of the Crimes Act 1961 (false statements or declarations).  
        
    
      
      
    
39.  Refer to the SPS 05/07 _Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents_ for further information on breaches of tax advisor's responsibilities in relation to the non-disclosure right.  
      
    
40.  Where non-compliance occurs, Inland Revenue will not reissue a section 17 notice in a different format. An offence is committed if a section 17 notice is not complied with. However, those receiving section 17 notices have the ability to request a new due date for compliance with the notice before expiration of the original due date as mentioned above.  
      
    
41.  Where non-compliance occurs, a follow-up notice will generally be issued before further action is taken. The follow up notice will state that the section 17 notice has not been complied with, court orders are being sought and/or prosecution action is being considered (refer Notice "D" attached). A follow-up notice or letter will not be issued in all cases, eg one situation would be where there have been delays in supplying information previously. A follow-up notice does not entitle the taxpayer (or their authorised tax advisor) to claim (for the first time or to make a subsequent claim) the non-disclosure right for tax advice documents that were required to be disclosed under the original section 17 notice.  
      
    
42.  Where Inland Revenue has issued a follow-up notice, an application for a court order for compliance with the section 17 notice may be made and/or prosecution action may be taken. There are different time limits for laying information to begin prosecution action:

*   for the offence of knowingly not providing information when required to do so the time limit is 6 months,
*   for the absolute liability offence of not providing information when required to do so the time limit is 10 years, and
*   for the offence of knowingly not providing information when required and the offender does so, for example, intending to evade the assessment or payment of tax, there is no time limit.

43.  Once the offence is committed prosecution action should be commenced within a reasonable time of the date of non-compliance unless there are special circumstances, eg the offence not being discovered until a later time. In general where a person complies with the requirement to provide information after the stipulated time but prior to the issue of a summons by the Court commencing the prosecution action foreshadowed in Notice "D", the prosecution would not be commenced.

\[_Brief history explaining why the Notice has been issued._\]

Therefore I, \[_name_\]_,_ \[_designation_\]_,_ \[_office_\]_,_ being duly authorised by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the Act), require you under section 17 of the Act (copy attached) to furnish in writing the information sought below, and produce for inspection the following books and documents which I consider necessary or relevant to establish \[_possible phrase:_  your correct taxation liability\].

The information to be furnished, and the books and documents to be produced for inspection, are as follows:

**1 .        ......** \[_List all information required._\]

**2 .        ......**

In addition, please provide a list of all documents required that are not in your possession or under your control and where known, identify the person who possesses or has control of such documents.  \[_As required_\]   

I also require that the written information or particulars furnished be verified by statutory declaration.  \[_Include where appropriate._\] 

**Taxpayers' non-disclosure rights**

Any document covered by legal professional privilege as provided for in section 20 of the Act is outside the scope of this notice.  You should consult your legal advisers if assistance is required in determining whether a specific document is covered by legal professional privilege.  Please provide a list of all documents for which legal professional privilege is claimed.  \[_This paragraph is inapplicable where the information requested consists of financial documents only._\]

Taxpayers have a statutory right of non-disclosure which applies to certain documents containing tax advice.  The statutory provisions are contained in sections 20B to 20G of the Act.  If any document required to be disclosed under this notice is eligible for non-disclosure under these provisions, the form _Tax advice document claim_ (IR 519)  should be completed to make the claim of non-disclosure.  A copy of this form can be found on Inland Revenue's website www.ird.govt.nz  The claim is required to be made within \[28 days _insert date after this if applicable\]_ of the date of this notice.  The claim should be provided to Inland Revenue as per the delivery instructions below.  For further information on the right to claim non-disclosure refer to the SPS 05/07 _Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents_ or consult your tax advisor_._  A copy of this SPS can be found on Inland Revenue's website www.ird.govt.nz

\[_If it is known that the taxpayer intends to make a claim for the right of non-disclosure, a copy of the form IR 519 Tax advice document claim should be included with this notice.\]_

If there is a claim to exercise the right of non-disclosure, the Commissioner may subsequently require disclosure of the tax contextual information from the documents which are subject to a claim of non-disclosure.  The Commissioner will notify you in writing if a disclosure of the tax contextual information is required.  Refer to the SPS 05/07 _Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents_ for further information on the meaning of tax contextual information and the disclosure requirements.

_Or_

_\[Insert this paragraph and delete the above paragraph if the tax contextual information is required as part of the disclosure requirements for section 17 notice. This should only occur in special circumstances when the appropriate delegated authority has authorised this action.\]_

If there is a claim to exercise the right of non-disclosure, the Commissioner requires disclosure of the tax contextual information from the documents which are subject to a claim of non-disclosure by _\[insert date which needs to be at least 28 days from the date of this notice\]_.  The tax contextual information must be provided on the form _Tax contextual information disclosure_ _(IR 520)_  which contains a statutory declaration.  Refer to the SPS 05/07 _Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents_ for further information on the meaning of tax contextual information and the disclosure requirements.

\[_Name_\] will call at \[_place and time_\] on \[_date -_ \] to collect the information.  _Or_  Please deliver the information to \[_postal address, or street address where courier or hand delivery is required, of a particular office or nearest office, where the taxpayer has permission to send to the nearest office, of Inland Revenue_\] marked for my attention _or_ for the attention of \[_name_\] by \[_date_\] _or_ within 28 days from the date of this notice.  _Or_ Please fax the information to \[_facsimile address_\] marked for my attention by \[_date_ _\-_\].  If you wish to make other arrangements as to collection will you please telephone \[_name_\] on \[_telephone number_\]_._

If gathering this information is going to be time consuming or would otherwise cause you difficulty, please contact \[_name_\] on \[_telephone number_\] as they are willing to assist.  If you wish to discuss the content or detail of this notice, please contact \[_name_\] well before the time mentioned in the preceding paragraph as modifications will be agreed to in cases of genuine difficulty.

If you consider that the amount of information required is significant, you may be permitted to send the \[_information, books or documents_\] to the nearest Inland Revenue office.  (Where the delivery costs would be reduced by $20 or more by sending to the nearest Inland Revenue office then it is considered that the amount of documentation is significant.)  \[_Include this paragraph where appropriate._\]   

**Non-compliance**

I would point out that it is an offence not to comply with this notice.  Failure to comply may lead to a court order being requested to enforce compliance and/or prosecution action.  I draw your attention to sections 143 and 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994.  These sections state an offence has occurred where a person does not provide, or knowingly does not provide, information to the Commissioner when required to do so by a tax law.  Furthermore section 143B provides that it is an offence for a person knowingly not to provide information to the Commissioner or any other person when required to do so under section 17, where that person or any other person do so intending to evade the assessment or payment of tax.

However, sections 143 and 143A of the Act state that no person may be convicted of an offence for not providing information, or knowingly not providing information (other than tax returns and tax forms) to the Commissioner if that person proves they did not, as and when required to provide the information, have that information in their knowledge, possession or control.  Control here is used in its wider sense and includes material held by others on your behalf. 

I would also point out that once you have complied with this Notice you have the right to inspect the information that you have provided and to correct any such information.

Income equalisation deposits and refunds (October 2005) (WITHDRAWN)
===================================================================

SPS 05/09 considers the CIR's powers to accept income equalisation deposits and refund applications for a tax year outside the specified period.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

This statement also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 17, No 8.

**Introduction**

1.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out the Commissioner's practice in regard to the statutory powers to:
    *   accept income equalisation deposits for a tax year outside the specified period, and
    *   accept refund applications for a tax year outside the specified period.

**Application**

2.  This SPS applies from the 2005-2006 and subsequent income years. Refer to _GNL-400_ _Income equalisation deposits and refunds_ for periods prior to the 2005-2006 income year.
  
  
  
 6.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS are to the Income Tax Act 2004.
  
  
  
 10.  Subject to the exceptions in paragraph 5 , this SPS applies to income equalisation deposits and refunds made under:
    *   the main income equalisation scheme (under sections EH 3 to EH 37), and
    *   the thinning operations income equalisation scheme (under sections EH 65 to EH 81).

5.  This SPS does not apply to:
    *   the adverse event income equalisation scheme (under sections EH 38 to EH 64)
    *   refunds from the main income equalisation account to:
        *   persons who retire, die or are adjudicated bankrupt (under sections EH 17 to EH 24), or
        *   companies which are put into liquidation (under sections EH 25 and EH 26)
    *   refunds from the thinning operations income equalisation account to companies which carry on a forestry business on land in New Zealand and are put into liquidation (under sections EH 77 and EH 78).

### **Summary**

6.  The main income equalisation scheme applies to taxpayers who are farmers, fishers or foresters.
  
  
  
 10.  The thinning operations income equalisation scheme applies to taxpayers who are companies that carry on a forestry business on land in New Zealand and derive income from carrying out thinning operations on the land.

### **Deposits**

8.  In some cases, an eligible taxpayer (as described in paragraphs 6 and 7 ) may make a deposit into the applicable income equalisation scheme after the end of the specified period for a tax year. The specified period is set in sections EH 37 and EH 81. Where the eligible taxpayer seeks to make a deposit after the specified period, the deposit has to be made by the date that the Commissioner sets by exercising the discretion in sections EH 4(4)(c)(i) and EH 66(4)(c)(i). (for the purpose of this SPS, this is to be referred to as "the required deposit date"). Furthermore, the taxpayer must, at the time of making the deposit, give the Commissioner notice that the deposit is for that tax year.
  
  
  
 12.  Subject to paragraphs 11 and 12, where the Commissioner exercises the discretion, the required deposit date is the earlier of:
    *   one month from the date of filing the tax return for that tax year, and
    *   one month from the date that the relevant tax return is due to be filed.
  
  
  
 16.  The due date for filing a tax return will include any extension of time arrangements agreed to by Inland Revenue.
  
  
  
 20.  However, the Commissioner will generally not exercise the discretion to allow the taxpayer to make deposits into the applicable income equalisation scheme after the end of the specified period if the specified period ends on a date later than the date determined by paragraph 9. In these cases, the required deposit date is the date on which the specified period ends.
  
  
  
 24.  The Commissioner will consider a taxpayer's request to make a late deposit on a case-by-case basis. The merits of the taxpayer's particular situation will be considered. A decision will be made on whether to accept the deposit for the requested tax year after taking full account of the taxpayer's particular circumstances.
  
  
  
 28.  Deposits made after the required deposit date and not accepted by the Commissioner as applying to the requested tax year may still be accepted by the Commissioner and applied to the tax year in which the deposits are made. The Commissioner will first contact the taxpayer to give them the option of continuing with the deposit or having it refunded back to them.
  
  
  
 32.  Where a taxpayer makes a deposit into the applicable income equalisation scheme and the deposit is physically received by Inland Revenue:
    *   by the required deposit date, or
    *   after the required deposit date and is accepted by the Commissioner,the taxpayer is allowed a deduction of the deposit made for the tax year, as set out in the taxpayer's notice when making the deposit.

### **Refunds**

15.  In some cases, an eligible taxpayer may apply for a refund from the applicable income equalisation scheme after the end of the specified period for a tax year. The specified period is set in sections EH 37 and EH 81. Where the eligible taxpayer seeks to make an application for a refund after the specified period, the application has to be made by the date that the Commissioner sets by exercising the discretion in sections EH 14(2)(a) and EH 74(2)(a) (for the purpose of this SPS, this is to be referred to as "the required application date"). Furthermore, t he taxpayer must elect in the application that the refund is deemed to be income in respect of that tax year.
  
  
  
 19.  Subject to paragraphs 17 and 18, where the Commissioner exercises the discretion, the required application date is the earlier of:
    *   one month from the date of filing the tax return for that tax year; and
    *   one month from the date that the relevant tax return is due to be filed.
  
  
  
 23.  However, the Commissioner will generally not exercise the discretion to allow the taxpayer to apply for a refund from the applicable income equalisation scheme after the end of the specified period if the specified period ends on a date later than the date determined by paragraph 16. In these cases, the required application date is the date on which the specified period ends.
  
  
  
 27.  The Commissioner will consider a taxpayer's late application for a refund on a case-by-case basis. The merits of the taxpayer's particular situation will be considered. A decision will be made on whether to accept the application for the refund after taking full account of the taxpayer's particular circumstances.
  
  
  
 31.  Where a taxpayer makes an application for a refund from the applicable income equalisation scheme and the application is physically received by Inland Revenue:
    *   by the required application date, or
    *   after the required application date and is accepted by the Commissioner,the refund is income derived by the taxpayer in the elected tax year.

20.  Applications for refunds made after the required application date and not accepted by the Commissioner as applying to the elected tax year, may still be accepted by the Commissioner and applied to the tax year in which the applications are made. The Commissioner will first contact the taxpayer to give them the option of continuing with or withdrawing the application for a refund.
  
  
  
 24.  If the taxpayer continues with the application, the refund is income to the taxpayer in the tax year in which the Commissioner receives the application for the refund.

### **Background**

22.  The income equalisation scheme was introduced in 1965. At the time of introduction of the scheme it was stated that it would:
    *   enable farmers to iron out rates of tax due to rises and falls in income;
    *   encourage farmers to put aside part of their income in good years and to use this money for farm development in years when farm income falls;
    *   help to remove a cause of inflation and therefore help to maintain a steadier rate of economic growth.
23.  The scheme enables an eligible taxpayer to make income equalisation deposits with the Commissioner and claim a deduction against their income in the tax year in which the deposit is made or in the tax year requested by the taxpayer in their notice to the Commissioner when making a deposit.
  
  
  
 27.  When a refund is made from the scheme, the amount is included as part of the taxpayer's income in the tax year in which the application for refund is received or in the tax year elected by the taxpayer and this election is accepted by the Commissioner.
  
  
  
 31.  Since the implementation of the scheme, use-of-money interest (UOMI) has been introduced. Farmers are usually not in a position to know their final financial position until after liability for UOMI applies. Also, many farmers do not receive the bulk of their income until near the end of their tax year, meaning that they have not had the use of that money throughout the year. The income equalisation scheme provides an avenue for farmers to limit their exposure to UOMI.

### **Legislation**

26.  The relevant legislative provisions are:
    *   Sub-part EH,
    *   Sections BC 24, CX 43, DQ 1, DQ 3 and OB 1 (definitions of "specified period" and "tax year"), and
    *   Sections 37 and 38 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("the TAA" ).

### **Discussion**

**Main income equalisation scheme**

27.  The following is a discussion of the issues surrounding deposits and refunds in relation to the main income equalisation scheme.
28.  Section EH 1(1) allows an eligible taxpayer to reduce their income for any tax year by making an income equalisation deposit.
29.  Pursuant to section EH 3(1), eligible taxpayers are:
    1.  farmers who carry on a farming or agricultural business on land in New Zealand,
    2.  fishers who carry on business of fishing, and
    3.  foresters who derive income from forestry and who are not a company, or a public authority, or a Maori authority, or an unincorporated body.

**Deposit**

30.  An eligible taxpayer may make a payment to the income equalisation scheme at any time during the tax year. (Refer to section EH 4(4)(a).)
  
  
  
 34.  Sections EH 4(4)(b) and (c) also allow an eligible taxpayer to make a deposit during the specified period (set in section EH 37) for the tax year, or within such later time as the Commissioner may allow after the end of the specified period. In either case, the taxpayer must, at the time of making the deposit, give the Commissioner notice that the deposit is for that tax year. Sections DQ 1 and EH 7 allow the taxpayer a deduction of the amount of the deposit in that tax year.
  
  
  
 38.  On a case-by-case basis, a taxpayer can request the Commissioner to accept a deposit of income equalisation after the specified period for a tax year and after the further time allowed by the Commissioner under section EH 4(4)(c).
  
  
  
 42.  Where such a request has not been accepted by the Commissioner, the deposit may, subject to consultation with the taxpayer, be applied to the tax year in which the deposit is made. Pursuant to sections DQ 1 and EH 7, the taxpayer is allowed a deduction of the amount of the deposit in that tax year.

**Refund**

34.  Section EH 12 allows a taxpayer at any time, subject to certain restrictions, to make an application in writing for a refund from sums deposited in the scheme. Section EH 14 states that the refund is income derived by the taxpayer in the tax year in which the Commissioner receives their application for the refund.
  
  
  
 38.  Where an application for a refund is received:
    *   in the specified period (set in section EH 37) for a tax year, or
    *   within such later time as the Commissioner allows after the end of the specified period,section EH 14(2) and (3) state that any refund made, if the taxpayer so elects, is income derived by the taxpayer in the elected tax year.

36.  A taxpayer can make an application for a refund on a case-by-case basis after the specified period for a tax year and after the further time allowed by the Commissioner under section EH 14(2)(a).
  
  
  
 40.  Where such an application has not been accepted by the Commissioner, the refund may, subject to consultation with the taxpayer, be applied to the tax year in which the application for the refund is made. Pursuant to sections CB 24 and EH 14, the refund is income derived by the taxpayer in that tax year.

**Thinning operations income equalisation scheme**

38.  The following is a discussion of the issues surrounding deposits and refunds in relation to the thinning operations income equalisation scheme. The rules on the thinning operations income equalisation scheme are similar to those that apply for deposits and refunds to the main equalisation scheme as discussed above.
  
  
  
 42.  Pursuant to section EH 65(1), eligible taxpayers to this scheme are companies that carry on a forestry business on land in New Zealand and derive income from carrying out thinning operations on the land.
  
  
  
 46.  The thinning operations income equalisation scheme does not apply to taxpayers who are natural persons.

**Deposit**

41.  An eligible taxpayer may make a payment to the Commissioner for entry in their thinning operations income equalisation account during the tax year. (Refer to section EH 66.)
  
  
  
 45.  Sections EH 66(4)(b) and (c) also allow an eligible taxpayer to make a deposit during the specified period (set in section EH 81) for the tax year, or within such later time as the Commissioner may allow after the end of the specified period. In either case, the taxpayer must, at the time of making the deposit, give the Commissioner notice that the deposit is for that tax year. Sections DQ 3 and EH 69 allow the taxpayer a deduction of the amount of the deposit in that tax year.
  
  
  
 49.  On a case-by-case basis, a taxpayer can still request the Commissioner to accept a deposit of income equalisation after the specified period for a tax year and after the further time allowed by the Commissioner under section EH 66(4)(c).
  
  
  
 53.  Where such a request has not been accepted by the Commissioner, the deposit may, subject to consultation with the taxpayer, be applied to the tax year in which the deposit is made. Pursuant to sections DQ 3 and EH 69, the taxpayer is allowed a deduction of the amount of the deposit in that tax year.

**Refund**

45.  Section EH 72 allows a taxpayer at any time, subject to certain restrictions, to make an application in writing for a refund from sums deposited in the scheme. Section EH 74 states that the refund is income derived by the taxpayer in the tax year in which the Commissioner receives the application for the refund.
  
  
  
 49.  Section EH 74(2) states where an application for a refund is received in the specified period (set in section EH 81) for a tax year, or within such later time as the Commissioner allows after the end of the specified period, any refund made, if the taxpayer so elects, is income derived by the taxpayer in the elected tax year.
  
  
  
 53.  On a case-by-case basis, a taxpayer can make an application for a refund after the specified period for a tax year and after the further time allowed by the Commissioner under section EH 74(2)(a).
  
  
  
 57.  Where such an application has not been accepted by the Commissioner, the refund may, subject to consultation with the taxpayer, be applied to the tax year in which the application for the refund is made. Pursuant to sections CB 24 and EH 74, the refund is income derived by the taxpayer in that tax year.

**Specified period**

49.  "Specified period" is defined in section OB 1, which refers to other legislative provisions for the purposes of different income equalisation schemes. For example, the definition of "specified period" for the purposes of the thinning operations income equalisation scheme is found in section EH 81.
  
  
  
 53.  The definition of "specified period" for the purposes of the main income equalisation scheme and the thinning operations income equalisation scheme are similar. The relevant "specified period" for an eligible taxpayer is the shorter of:
    *   the period of six months after the end of the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year, and
    *   the period from the end of the accounting year (which corresponds to the tax year) to the date one month after the due date of filing the taxpayer's return of income (including any extension of time arrangements agreed to by Inland Revenue).
  
  
  
 57.  This is demonstrated by the following examples:  
      
    **Example 1**  
      
    30 June 2006 balance date (with an extension of time arrangement for filing the return of income to 31 March 2007). The specified period is the shorter of:
    
    *   the period of six months after the end of the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year - 1 July to 31 December 2006, and
    *   the period from the end of the accounting year to one month after the tax return is due - 1 July 2006 to 30 April 2007.
    
      
      
    **Example 2**  
      
    30 June 2006 balance date (without extension of time arrangement). The specified period is the shorter of:
    *   the period of six months after the end of the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year - 1 July to 31 December 2006, and
    *   the period from the end of the accounting year to one month after the tax return is due - 1 July to 7 November 2006 (being one month after return filing due date of 7 October 2006 (see section 37(1) of the TAA)).
  
  
  
 61.  In the first example the specified period ends on 31 December 2006, whereas in the second example the specified period ends on 7 November 2006.

**Commissioner's discretion**

53.  The Commissioner may accept a deposit or an application for refund for a particular tax year outside the specified period. For example, section EH 4(4)(c)(i) allows an eligible taxpayer to make a deposit in the main income equalisation scheme "within a time that is after the end of the specified period but that is allowed by the Commissioner in a case or class of cases".
  
  
  
 57.  What needs to be considered is how the Commissioner should exercise that discretion.
  
  
  
 61.  Case law has determined that a statutory power conferred to a public authority (eg discretion) cannot be unfettered or arbitrary. Also, discretion must be used reasonably. In _Roberts v Hopwood_ \[1925\] AC 578, Lord Wrenbury stated:
    
    > "A person in whom is vested a discretion must exercise his discretion upon reasonable grounds. A discretion does not empower a man to do what he likes merely because he is minded to do so - he must in the exercise of his discretion do not what he likes but what he ought. In other words, he must, by the use of his reason, ascertain and follow the course which reason directs. He must act reasonably."
    
62.  When an authority (such as Inland Revenue) considers whether it will exercise the discretion, it needs to consider each case on its own merits. Blindly dismissing cases as being not within policy is an abuse of power. An authority may make policies but the policies cannot be over-rigid. This is highlighted in _Gisborne Mills Ltd v CIR_ (1989) 11 NZTC 6,194. Robertson J found that the Commissioner had failed to exercise a discretion which Parliament had given him. By failing to discharge a statutory responsibility, an abuse has arisen and the Commissioner's decision was subject to review by the Court.
  
  
  
 66.  In _Lawton v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2003\] 2 NZLR 48, the Court of Appeal held that the Commissioner had not properly exercised the discretion in section 30(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976, which deals with acceptance of a late objection.
  
  
  
 70.  Glazebrook J, delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court, reiterated the dicta in _CIR v Wilson_ (1996) 17 NZTC 12,512 _,_ which stated that:
    
    > "the merits of a proposed \[late\] objection must be considered unless the explanation for the lateness of the objection is so inadequate that this is unnecessary."
    
71.  In _Lawton_ , it was held that the taxpayer had given a full and credible explanation for the lateness of the objection. The Court held:
    
    > "… In such a case, unless \[the\] explanation was palpably untrue or quite unjustified, it would be rare for the explanation to be deemed so inadequate that the merits need not be examined."
    
72.  The _Lawton_ case contains some recent judicial comments on the manner in which the Commissioner should exercise discretions in the Inland Revenue Acts.
  
  
  
 76.  In considering whether to accept a taxpayer's request for a deposit after the required deposit date or a taxpayer's application for a refund after the required application date, the Commissioner is obliged to consider the merits of the taxpayer's explanation for the lateness of the request or the application. The request or the application cannot simply be dismissed. The Commissioner, after considering the merits of the explanation, may or may not accept the deposit or refund for the elected tax year.

**What is reasonable?**

62.  For the purpose of the main income equalisation scheme, section EH 3 allows an eligible taxpayer to make payments, during any tax year, to the scheme in respect of that tax year. Section EH 4 allows the taxpayer to make a deposit of income equalisation within the tax year or during the specified period. Section EH 4(4)(c)(i) grants the Commissioner discretion to extend the time for eligible taxpayers to make deposits after the end of the specified period.
  
  
  
 66.  Similarly, in section EH 66(4)(c)(i), for the purpose of the thinning operations income equalisation scheme, the Commissioner has discretion to extend the time for eligible taxpayers to make deposits after the end of the specified period.
  
  
  
 70.  Commonly, it will not be until the taxpayer's set of accounts and tax return are completed before the taxpayer's financial situation for an accounting year will be known. From this, the decision on whether to make a deposit to the applicable income equalisation scheme, and of how much, would be made.
  
  
  
 74.  Taking this into consideration, it would be reasonable to expect an eligible taxpayer to make a deposit to the scheme (for that particular tax year) at the time of filing their tax return, provided the tax return is filed by the filing due date. This date could potentially be 31 March of the following year if the taxpayer has an extension of time arrangement.
  
  
  
 78.  However it may not be possible or practicable for the deposit to be sent in with the tax return. An example is e-filed tax returns and it may also take a tax agent sometime to arrange the sending in of the deposit. Therefore a reasonable period of time after the tax return filing date should be allowed, so that the eligible taxpayer can forward the deposit to Inland Revenue.
  
  
  
 82.  Where the specified period is shorter than the period of six months from the end of the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year, the legislation allows one month after the due date for filing a return in the definition of a specified period. (Refer to sections EH 37 and EH 81.) No deduction will be allowed until the deposit is physically received by Inland Revenue. The return will be reassessed to allow the deduction when the deposit is received.
  
  
  
 86.  Subject to paragraph 74 , it seems reasonable to allow eligible taxpayers to make income equalisation deposits after the end of the specified period and by the earlier of:
    *   one month from the date of filing the tax return for that tax year, and
    *   one month from the date that the relevant tax return is due to be filed.
  
  
  
 90.  The following example illustrates the effect of this practice:  
      
    **Example 3**  
      
    A taxpayer has a tax agent. The taxpayer has a balance date of 31 March. For the 2006 income year, the tax agent has an extension of time arrangement to file the taxpayer's tax return until 31 March 2007. The tax return for the taxpayer is filed on 31 October 2006.  
      
    The specified period for making deposits into the income equalisation scheme is the shorter of:
    
    *   the period of six months after the end of the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year - 1 April to 30 September 2006, and
    *   the period from the end of the accounting year to one month after the tax return is due - 1 April 2006 to 30 April 2007 (being one month after return filing due date of 31 March 2007 (see section 37(1) of the TAA)).
    
      
      
    For an income equalisation deposit to be accepted for the 2006 income year, the Commissioner exercises the discretion under section EH 4(4)(c) to allow the taxpayer to make the deposit by 30 November 2006, which is the earlier of:
    
    *   one month from the date of filing the tax return (i.e. 30 November 2006), and
    *   one month from the due date of filing the tax return (ie 30 April 2007).
    
      
      
    In the same scenario but were instead the return is filed on 1 May 2007, a deposit would need to be paid by 30 April 2007, which is the earlier of:
    
    *   one month from the date of filing the tax return (i.e. 1 June 2007), and
    *   one month from the due date of filing the tax return (ie 30 April 2007).
    
      
      
    In both of the above scenarios, if the taxpayer cannot make the deposit within the time allowed by the Commissioner and there are valid reasons for it, the Commissioner will consider the merits of the taxpayer's situations and may accept the late deposits on a case-by-case basis.
  
  
  
 94.  For taxpayers without extension of time arrangements, deposits in respect of a tax year will be accepted up to the end of the specified period, which is the shorter of six months immediately following the end of the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year and one month after the return is required to be filed. These taxpayers may also make deposits after the end of the specified period. (Refer to paragraph 68 .)
  
  
  
 98.  However, in some cases, the taxpayer is required to make the deposit into the income equalisation scheme by the end of the specified period. The Commissioner will generally not exercise the discretion under section EH 4(4)(c) because the specified period ends on a date later than the date that would be determined by exercising the Commissioner's discretion. This is illustrated by the following example:  
      
    **Example 4**  
      
    A taxpayer with a 30 June 2006 balance date will be required to file their tax return by 7 October 2006 (see section 37(1) of the TAA). The taxpayer files their tax return on 30 September 2006. Pursuant to section EH 4(4)(b), the taxpayer may make a deposit to the main income equalisation scheme during the specified period, which is the shorter of:
    
    *   the period from the end of the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year to one month after the tax return is due - 1 July 2006 to 7 November 2006, and
    *   six months from the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year - 1 July to 31 December 2006.
    
      
      
    The taxpayer should generally make the deposit by the end of the specified period, ie 7 November 2006. This is a later date than the date that would be determined by exercising the discretion under section EH 4(4)(c), ie 31 October 2006, which is the earlier of:
    
    *   one month from the date of filing the tax return (ie 31 October 2006), and
    *   one month from the due date of filing the tax return (ie 7 November 2006).
    
      
      
    However, if the taxpayer cannot make the deposit by 7 November 2006 and there are valid reasons for it, the Commissioner will consider the merits of the taxpayer's situations and may accept the late deposits on a case-by-case basis.
  
  
  
 102.  The Commissioner will exercise the discretion under section EH 4(4)(c) if the specified period ends on a date earlier than the date determined by exercising that discretion. The following example illustrates this:  
      
    **Example 5**  
      
    A taxpayer with a 30 November 2005 balance date will be required to file their tax return by 7 July 2006 (see section 37(1) of the TAA). The taxpayer files their tax return by 30 June 2006. Pursuant to section EH 4(4)(b), the Commissioner exercises the discretion to allow the taxpayer to make a deposit to the main income equalisation scheme during the specified period, which is the shorter of:
    
    *   the period from the end of the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year to one month after the tax return is due - 1 December 2005 to 7 August 2006, and
    *   six months from the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year - 1 December 2005 to 31 May 2006.
    
      
      
    However, the taxpayer may make a deposit after the end of the specified period, ie 31 May 2006. Pursuant to section EH 4(4)(c), the taxpayer may make an income equalisation deposit by 31 July 2006, which is the earlier of:
    
    *   one month from the date of filing the tax return (ie 31 July 2006), and
    *   one month from the due date of filing the tax return (ie 7 August 2006).
    
      
      
    If the taxpayer cannot make the deposit by 31 July 2006 and there are valid reasons for it, the Commissioner will consider the merits of the taxpayer's situations and may accept the late deposits on a case by case basis.
  
  
  
 106.  For taxpayers who do not have a tax agent and require an extension of time to file their income tax return, please refer to the separate SPS on extension of time applications from taxpayers without tax agents.
  
  
  
 110.  Where an eligible taxpayer makes a deposit after the required deposit date, the Commissioner will take into account the merits of the taxpayer's situation and the reasons why the deposit was not made before the required deposit date. The Commissioner will consider these on a case-by-case basis.
  
  
  
 114.  Reasons could include, but are not limited to, incorrect advice from the taxpayer's tax agent or a sudden or unexpected change in circumstances. However, these examples are not indicative of situations when a request for a late deposit will automatically be accepted. All factors must be considered before the Commissioner accepts the deposit as being made in the requested tax year.
  
  
  
 118.  The Commissioner will apply similar principles (as stated in paragraphs 62 to 75 of this SPS) to an eligible taxpayer's application for a refund after the required application date.

### **Standard Practice**

The following standard practice has been developed from the above principles.

77.  The main income equalisation scheme applies to taxpayers who are farmers, fishers or foresters.
  
  
  
 81.  The thinning operations income equalisation scheme applies to taxpayers, who are companies that carry on a forestry business on land in New Zealand and derive income from carrying out thinning operations on the land.

**Deposits**

79.  Eligible taxpayers may make a deposit to the applicable income equalisation scheme for any tax year at any time during that tax year.
  
  
  
 83.  A deposit made during the specified period in relation to any tax year will be treated as having been made in respect of that tax year. The specified period is set in sections EH 37 and EH 81.
  
  
  
 87.  In some cases, an eligible taxpayer may make a deposit into the applicable income equalisation scheme by the required deposit date after the end of the specified period for a tax year. Furthermore, the taxpayer must, at the time of making the deposit, give the Commissioner notice that the deposit is for that tax year.
  
  
  
 91.  The required deposit date, which is determined by exercising the Commissioner's discretion in sections EH 4(4)(c)(i) and EH 66(4)(c)(i), is the earlier of:
    *   one month from the date of filing the tax return for that tax year, and
    *   one month from the date that the relevant tax return is due to be filed.
  
  
  
 95.  However, the Commissioner will generally not exercise the discretion to allow the taxpayer to make deposits into the applicable income equalisation scheme after the end of the specified period if the specified period ends on a date later than the date determined by paragraph 82 . In these cases, the required deposit date is the date on which the specified period ends.
  
  
  
 99.  Generally, the Commissioner will not accept a deposit for a tax year after the required deposit date. The Commissioner will consider, at a taxpayer's request, to make a late deposit on a case-by-case basis. The merits of the taxpayer's particular situation will be considered. A decision will be made on whether to accept the deposit for the requested tax year after taking full account of the taxpayer's particular circumstances.
  
  
  
 103.  Deposits made after the required deposit date and not accepted by the Commissioner as applying to the requested tax year, may still be accepted by the Commissioner and applied to the tax year in which the deposits are made. The Commissioner will first contact the taxpayer to give them the option of continuing with the deposit or having it refunded back to them.
  
  
  
 107.  Where a taxpayer makes a deposit into the applicable income equalisation scheme and the deposit is physically received by Inland Revenue:
    *   by the required deposit date, or
    *   after the required deposit date and is accepted by the Commissioner,the taxpayer is allowed a deduction of the deposit made for the tax year, as set out in the taxpayer's notice when making the deposit.

**Refunds**

87.  Eligible taxpayers may make an application for a refund from the applicable income equalisation scheme for any tax year at any time during that tax year although the Commissioner can only refund amounts which have been deposited for at least 12 months. The Commissioner may need to wait for the expiry of this period in order to make the refund, after receiving an application.
  
  
  
 91.  Generally, a refund is treated as having been made in the tax year in which the Commissioner receives the application for the refund. An application for a refund made during the specified period in relation to any tax year will be treated as having been made in respect of that tax year. The specified period is set in sections EH 37 and EH 81.
  
  
  
 95.  In some cases, an eligible taxpayer may apply for a refund from the applicable income equalisation scheme by the required application date after the end of the specified period for a tax year. Furthermore, t he taxpayer must elect in the application that the refund is deemed to be income in respect of that tax year.
  
  
  
 99.  The required application date, which is determined by exercising the Commissioner's discretion in sections EH 14(2)(a) and EH 74(2)(a), is the earlier of:
    *   one month from the date of filing the tax return for the tax year, and
    *   one month from the date that the relevant tax return is due to be filed.
  
  
  
 103.  However, the Commissioner will generally not exercise the discretion to allow the taxpayer to apply for a refund from the applicable income equalisation scheme after the end of the specified period if the specified period ends on a date later than the date determined by paragraph 90 . In these cases, the required application date is the date on which the specified period ends.
  
  
  
 107.  Generally, the Commissioner will not accept an application for a refund for an elected tax year after the required application date. However, the Commissioner will consider a taxpayer's late application for a refund on a case-by-case basis. The merits of the taxpayer's particular situation will be considered. A decision will be made on whether to accept the application for the refund after taking full account of the taxpayer's particular circumstances.
  
  
  
 111.  Where a taxpayer makes an application for a refund from the applicable income equalisation scheme and the application is physically received by Inland Revenue:
    *   by the required application date, or
    *   after the required application date and is accepted by the Commissioner,the refund is income derived by the taxpayer in the elected tax year.
  
  
  
 115.  Applications for refunds made after the required application date and not accepted by the Commissioner as applying to the elected tax year, may still be accepted by the Commissioner and applied to the tax year in which the applications are made. The Commissioner will first contact the taxpayer to give them the option of continuing with or withdrawing the application for a refund.
  
  
  
 119.  If the taxpayer continues with the application, the refund is income to the taxpayer in the tax year in which the Commissioner receives the application for the refund.

Remission of penalties and interest (October 2005) (WITHDRAWN)
==============================================================

Withdrawn SPS 05/10 - Remission of penalties and interest (October 2005). Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

This statement also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 17, No 9 (November 2005), and is referenced in [_SPS 15/02 - Remission of penalties and use-of-money interest_](/standard-practice-statements/returns-and-debt-collection/sps-1502-remission-of-penalties-and-use-of-money-interest)
.

### **Introduction**

1.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out the Commissioner's practice in respect to granting remission of penalties and interest under sections 183A, 183ABA and 183D of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Application

2.  This SPS applies to remission requests received on or after 17 October 2005. It replaces SPS _RDC 600 Remission of penalties and interest_ , which was originally published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 14, No 12 (December 2002).  
     
3.  This SPS does not apply to:  
     
    *   shortfall penalties (except those imposed by section 141AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994), and  
         
    *   penalties and interest charged on payments by non-custodial or custodial parents under the Child Support Act 1991, and  
         
    *   student loan repayments.
4.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### **Summary**

5.  Applications for remission under sections 183A and 183D should be made in writing and should be accompanied by supporting information.  
     
6.  The Commissioner will remit under section 183A where he is satisfied that the non-compliance has been caused by an event or circumstance that provides reasonable justification or excuse for the omission, and the omission was rectified as soon as practicable.  
     
7.  The Commissioner will remit under section 183ABA where:  
     
    
    *   a taxpayer is significantly affected by a "qualifying event", and
    *   the taxpayer has applied for remission of the penalties and/or interest as soon as practicable, and
    *   the Commissioner is satisfied that the effect on the taxpayer of the occurrence of the qualifying event makes the remission equitable.
    
      
     
8.  The Commissioner will remit under section 183D if the Commissioner is satisfied that remission is consistent with the duty to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law. Generally, the Commissioner will grant remission of penalties where there was a genuine oversight, a "one-off" situation, or incorrect advice was given by an Inland Revenue officer that led to the taxpayer not filing their return or paying the tax on time.  
     
9.  The Commissioner will remit interest in limited circumstances such as where an Inland Revenue officer has given incorrect advice to the taxpayer, and that advice has directly resulted in the non-compliance. However, this is not the only situation in which interest may be remitted. The Commissioner will consider each case on its own merits.  
     
10.  Remission applications under sections 183A and 183D will only be considered when the returns relevant to the remission requests have been filed and the tax has been paid.  
     
11.  Sections 183A and 183D do not permit remission to be granted for financial reasons. Requests for financial relief are dealt with under sections 176 and 177.

**Background**

12.  Taxpayers are obliged to pay their taxes by the due date. Penalties provide an incentive to all taxpayers to comply with the law. Use-of-money interest provides compensation for the time value of money and compensates the taxpayer or Inland Revenue for the use of money over time.  
     
13.  Remission provisions are needed to allow Inland Revenue to accommodate circumstances in which charging a penalty or interest is inappropriate. The procedures Inland Revenue use should ensure taxpayers have been justly treated regardless of the outcome. Inland Revenue will weigh the particular circumstances that exist in each taxpayer's case against the standard practice.  
     
14.  Legislation governing remission of penalties and interest is contained in sections 183A, 183ABA and 183D. These sections do not apply to penalties and interest charged on payments by custodial or non-custodial parents, student loan repayments or to shortfall penalties except shortfall penalties imposed by section 141AA.  
     
15.  The legislation governing imposition and non-imposition of penalties is contained in Part IX of the Tax Administration Act 1994. For further details regarding non-imposition of penalties please refer to a separate SPS on instalment arrangements for payment of tax debt.  
     
16.  Remission will occur when the tax, penalty or interest is correctly charged at the time but it is decided to relieve the taxpayer of the liability to pay. Cancellation will occur when the tax, penalty or interest was correctly charged at the time but a provision of the legislation relieves the taxpayer from the obligation to pay, such as the successful completion of an instalment arrangement. Reversal will occur when the tax, penalty or interest should not have been charged in the first place. For further details regarding imposition of penalties please refer to a separate SPS on instalment arrangements for payment of tax debt.

### Legislation

17.  The relevant legislative provisions are:  
     
    *   sections 140CB, 141AA, 183A, 183ABA and 183D, and
    *   section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 (definition of "qualifying event").

### Discussion

_**Remission for reasonable cause**_ 

18.  Section 183A applies to:  
     
    
    *   a late filing penalty
    *   a non-electronic filing penalty
    *   initial and incremental late payment penalties
    *   imputation penalty tax
    *   dividend withholding payment penalty tax
    *   Maori authority distribution penalty tax
    *   a shortfall penalty imposed by section 141AA.
    
      
     
19.  The Commissioner may impose Maori authority distribution penalty tax under section 140CB, where a Maori authority fails to pay further income tax as a result of a debit balance in the Maori authority credit account at the end of the year. The amount of the penalty tax is 10% of the amount of further income tax.  
     
20.  Pursuant to section 141AA, a person is liable for a shortfall penalty of $250 for each return period if:  
     
    
    1.  the person fails to deduct non-resident contractors withholding tax from a contract payment made to a non-resident contractor, and  
         
    2.  the non-resident contractor is not liable to pay income tax on the contract payment due to a double tax agreement or other reasons.
    
      
      
    The shortfall penalty imposed under section 141AA is limited to a maximum of $1,000 for each return period.  
     
21.  Section 183A does not apply to interest or shortfall penalties (except those imposed by section 141AA).  
     
22.  The Commissioner may remit penalties mentioned in paragraph 18 if satisfied that the penalties arose as a result of an event or a circumstance beyond the taxpayer's control and the taxpayer is able to provide in writing reasonable justification for the late filing, non-electronic filing, late payment or failure to deduct non-resident contractors withholding tax. Furthermore, the taxpayer must have filed the return and paid the tax as soon as practicable after the event or circumstance.  
     
23.  The term "reasonable" must be applied to the event or circumstance. This is an objective test.  
     
24.  Case law has determined that whether an event or circumstance provides a taxpayer with reasonable justification for failing to meet their obligations, the event or circumstance relied on by the taxpayer must firstly be identified. It must then be determined whether the event or circumstance was beyond the control of the taxpayer, and whether the event or circumstance provides the taxpayer with reasonable justification. See _CIR v Fuji Xerox New Zealand Limited_ (2001) 20 NZTC 17,470.  
     
25.  Section 183A expressly excludes a taxpayer's financial position from the definition of event or circumstance. Requests for financial relief are dealt with under sections 176 and 177.  
     
26.  In deciding whether remission is appropriate the Commissioner will consider the following:  
     
    1.  Has the penalty been correctly charged?  
         
    2.  Has the taxpayer paid the tax (and filed the return) in question?  
         
    3.  Why did the taxpayer pay or file late, or not file (electronically or otherwise)?  
         
    4.  Was the non-compliance caused by an event or a circumstance that was beyond the control of the taxpayer? An event or circumstance may include:  
         
        *   an accident or a disaster
        *   illness or emotional or mental distress.  
             
27.  When considering the above-mentioned events or circumstances, Inland Revenue will use the following definitions:  
     
    
    *   accident - an event that is without apparent cause or is unexpected
    *   disaster - sudden or great misfortune or a calamity
    *   illness - state of being ill
    *   emotional distress - disturbance of the mind, mental sensation or state
    *   mental distress - of the mind, done by the mind, affected with mental disorder.
    
      
     
28.  Other factors to consider include:  
     
    
    1.  Has this event or circumstance occurred before? Where appropriate, have measures been put in place by the taxpayer to ensure that this situation does not recur in the future? If a similar event occurred in the past, this factor will be taken into account when considering the taxpayer's current request for remission of penalties and interest.  
         
    2.  Was the tax paid or return filed as soon as practicable (as soon as is feasible and realistic) or was there no reasonable basis for delay? This will depend on the circumstances of each case. Specifically, was the default corrected as soon as possible after the event or circumstance passed?  
         
    3.  Was the non-compliance the result of an act or omission of the taxpayer's agent? Did an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent cause the non-compliance? Could the default have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct?  
         
    4.  Any other information that Inland Revenue considers relevant in assessing the application.
    
      
      
    **Examples:**  
      
    **Emotional or mental distress (late filing penalty)**  
    A taxpayer's return was due on 7 July. The return was near completion and the taxpayer's previous compliance history was exemplary. However, prior to the due date his daughter became seriously ill and was hospitalised. Her condition steadily deteriorated and the family spent a great deal of time at the hospital where she was in intensive care until the first week in September. The taxpayer was unable to contact Inland Revenue during this time.  
      
    During this time a reminder notice was issued advising the taxpayer that a late filing penalty would be charged if his current year's income tax return was not filed within 30 days. He filed the overdue return in mid-October, along with a letter from his daughter's doctor verifying her illness and hospitalisation, after the penalty was charged.  
      
    In these circumstances, the taxpayer filed the return three months after the due date, but given the "events and circumstances" this would be considered a  
      
    **Circumstances beyond the taxpayer's control (non-electronic filing penalty)**  
    An employer is set up for, and has been sending, employer monthly schedules for the last six months. A fire destroys the work premises on the date before it was planned to transmit the current month's schedule. As a back-up to the computer system, the employer has a printed copy of the file stored off-site. The employer decides to copy these details onto a paper-based schedule so that the schedule and payment would reach Inland Revenue on time. The taxpayer provided a report from the New Zealand Fire Service confirming the date and location of the fire and that the fire destroyed the computer system. Any non-electronic filing penalty would be remitted as the event was "beyond the control" of the taxpayer.  
      
    **Circumstance beyond agent's control (late payment penalty)**  
      
    An agent was entrusted to pay a client's income tax by the due date of 7 April, as the taxpayer would be overseas at the due date. The cheque was made out for the correct amount, signed and post-dated. The cheque was given to the agent and placed in the office safe. The night before 7 April the office was burgled and the safe and its contents were destroyed. The client's agent provided a New Zealand Police report verifying the date and location of the burglary and that the safe and its contents were destroyed. This is considered to be an event beyond the agent's control.

**_Remission in circumstances of a "qualifying event"_** 

29.  Section 183ABA applies to:
    
    *   late filing penalty
    *   non-electronic filing penalty
    *   initial and incremental late payment penalties
    *   interest (also commonly known as "use-of-money interest").
    
      
     
30.  Section 183ABA does not apply to shortfall penalties.  
     
31.  Section 183ABA allows the Commissioner to remit the type of penalties and interest as mentioned in paragraph 29, where:  
     
    1.  a taxpayer is significantly affected by a "qualifying event" (see paragraphs 33 to 39 ), and  
         
    2.  the taxpayer has applied for remission of the penalties and/or interest as soon as practicable, and  
         
    3.  the Commissioner is satisfied that the effect on the taxpayer of the occurrence of the qualifying event makes the remission equitable.  
         
32.  Taxpayers may be unable to comply with their tax obligations when a "qualifying event" significantly affects them in the following ways:  
     
    
    *   The taxpayers' records have been destroyed and thus, the taxpayers are unable to file tax returns.
    *   The taxpayers are unable to access their records, as in the case of evacuation or destruction of a home or business.
    *   The taxpayers were unable to make payments or file returns because of higher priorities created by the "qualifying event", such as assisting other victims.
    
      
     
33.  Section 183ABA applies only when there is a "qualifying event" as defined under section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. The extreme climatic conditions that occurred during February 2004 and the storm event that occurred during the month of July 2004 in the Bay of Plenty area were defined as "qualifying events".  
     
34.  Section 183ABA may also apply to future qualifying events. These are naturally-occurring events in respect of which a state of emergency is declared and the Governor-General by an Order in Council declares the naturally-occurring event to be a qualifying event.  
     
35.  However, section 183ABA only applies to naturally-occurring events, such as floods or storms. It does not apply to incidents of rioting or civil unrest.  
     
36.  Once a qualifying event is declared all significantly affected taxpayers qualify. Whether a taxpayer is significantly affected by a qualifying event requires consideration of the relativity of the taxpayer's situation to the qualifying event, and whether the taxpayer was highly or substantially affected as a result of the event.  
     
37.  Relief may be granted if the effect on the taxpayer of the qualifying event occurring makes it equitable that the penalty or interest be remitted. In _Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Limited_ (1973) AC 360, Lord Wilberforce defined equitable as involving considerations of a personal character arising between one individual and another, which made it unjust or inequitable to insist on legal rights, or to exercise them in a particular way. Therefore, Inland Revenue will consider remission of penalties and interest where the taxpayer's personal situation makes it unjust or unfair not to remit penalties or interest.  
     
38.  While the legislation does not fix any time limit for a taxpayer to seek remission the taxpayer should apply for the remission in writing as soon as practicable. Case law defines the term "as soon as practicable" to mean " as soon as is feasible or realistic". This will depend on the circumstances of each case.
39.  However, the Commissioner generally considers that taxpayers should apply for the remission of penalties and/or interest within six months from the occurrence of the "qualifying event".  
      
    **Examples:**  
      
    **Whether a taxpayer is significantly affected by a qualifying event (late filing penalty)**  
    The Governor-General has declared a flood in the Bay of Plenty area as a qualifying event. A taxpayer resides in Auckland and owns business premises in the Bay of Plenty . All the taxpayer's business records were stored in the business premises. The flood destroyed the business records and the taxpayer could not file the tax return by the due date. A late filing penalty is imposed on the taxpayer. The taxpayer provides supporting evidence (for example, a report on the damaged business premises from the insurance company with whom the taxpayer was insured and photos of the taxpayer's business premise after the flood) verifying that his business records were destroyed by the flood. The taxpayer's request for penalty remission will be accepted because Inland Revenue considers the taxpayer is significantly affected by the qualifying event and that it is equitable for the penalties to be remitted.  
      
    Applying the same facts as above but where the taxpayer's business records were stored in Auckland and the taxpayer's business premises were unaffected by the flood. In this case, the taxpayer's request for penalty remission will not be accepted because Inland Revenue considers the taxpayer is not significantly affected by the qualifying event.  
      
    **Whether the taxpayer applied for the remission as soon as practicable (late filing penalty)**  
    The Governor-General has declared a storm in the Auckland area as a qualifying event. A taxpayer's business premises were severely damaged by the storm. The taxpayer was unable to access his records and file a tax return until two months later. Due to the taxpayer's oversight, another seven months elapsed before the taxpayer applies for remission of the late filing penalty. In this case, the Commissioner will not exercise the discretion to remit the penalty because the taxpayer did not apply for the remission as soon as practicable.

**_Remission consistent with collection of highest net revenue over time_** 

40.  Section 183D applies to:  
     
    
    *   a late filing penalty
    *   a non-electronic filing penalty
    *   initial and incremental late payment penalties
    *   a shortfall penalty imposed by section 141AA
    *   interest.
    
      
     
41.  Section 183D does not apply to shortfall penalties except those imposed by section 141AA (see paragraph 20 ). There is no requirement to remit all of the penalties and interest. Each case will be considered on its own merits.  
     
42.  The Commissioner is required by law to collect the highest net revenue over time, having regard to the resources available, the importance of promoting voluntary compliance and compliance costs incurred by taxpayers. The Commissioner recognises that pursuing the collection of penalties in some circumstances will not meet his legal duty. Those circumstances are where one of the above-mentioned penalties is imposed because of:  
     
    
    *   a genuine error, or
    *   a "one-off" situation, or
    *   incorrect advice given by Inland Revenue which has directly resulted in the non-compliance.
    
      
     
43.  Section 183D is the primary provision under which interest can be remitted. Section 183E also provides for remission of interest but only where the underlying tax is remitted.  
     
44.  Under section 183D, the Commissioner may exercise his discretion to remit the total interest payable or part of the interest payable. Section 183D expressly prevents a taxpayer's financial circumstances from being taken into account.  
     
45.  Interest will be remitted in limited circumstances such as where an Inland Revenue officer has given incorrect advice to the taxpayer, and that advice has directly resulted in the non-compliance. However, this is not the only situation in which remission of interest may be granted.

**_Remission due to unintended legislative changes and other reasons_** 

46.  The Commissioner must consider each case on its own merits. For details regarding remission of interest arising from an unintended legislative change, please refer to the separate SPS on penalties and interest arising from unintended legislative changes.  
     
47.  When considering remission under this section, the taxpayer's financial situation cannot be taken into account. It was not intended that this section be used to remit penalties and interest remaining from longstanding arrears when the taxpayer has financial difficulties and eventually can only pay the core tax or the core tax plus minimal penalties. These cases are dealt with under sections 176 and 177. Refer to the separate SPSs on instalment arrangements for payment of tax debt and writing off tax debt.  
     
48.  The taxpayer must have filed the relevant tax return and paid the tax prior to the remission request.  
     
49.  In deciding whether remission is appropriate Inland Revenue will consider the answers to the following:  
     
    
    1.  Has the penalty or interest been correctly charged?  
         
    2.  Has the taxpayer paid the tax (or filed the return) in question?  
         
    3.  Why did the taxpayer pay (or file) late, or not file electronically?  
         
    4.  Whether the non-compliant action was the result of a genuine oversight or a one-off situation:  
         
        *   Remitting a penalty for a taxpayer who has not complied due to a genuine oversight or "one-off" situation recognises that penalising a taxpayer for a small failure to comply is counter-productive and may actually reduce voluntary compliance.  
             
        *   Requests for remission because of a genuine oversight or a one-off situation apply to penalties only. Inland Revenue will not remit interest in these cases as interest is compensation to the Revenue for the use of the money over time.  
             
        *   Interest charged because of a third party default will generally not be considered for remission. In these situations the Commissioner considers the taxpayer should look to that third party for compensation.  
             
    5.  Has Inland Revenue given incorrect advice to the taxpayer, or was there an error in an Inland Revenue publication, which has resulted in the non-compliance?  
          
        If an Inland Revenue officer has given incorrect advice to a taxpayer (for example, the taxpayer has directly been given an incorrect date or amount for tax payment) or the taxpayer relies on incorrect information contained in an Inland Revenue publication, the imposition of the penalty may adversely affect future compliance by the taxpayer or other taxpayers. However, this does not apply to misinterpretations of what is written in an Inland Revenue publication.  
         
    6.  Has Inland Revenue contributed to the quantum of interest as a result of excessive delay (such as computer processing problems)?  
        If there have been computer delays in the issuing of a statement of account and the taxpayer has made a payment including interest based on their own calculations the additional interest accrued may be remitted in full or in part.  
         
    7.  Any other information that Inland Revenue considers relevant in assessing the application. In particular, Inland Revenue will wish to understand how the remission would contribute to collection of the highest net revenue over time and otherwise promote voluntary compliance.
    
      
      
    **Examples:**  
      
    **One-off situation (late filing penalty and late payment penalty)**  
    An employer has a computer payroll package set up to prepare the employer monthly schedule for ir-FILE. A computer virus was detected on 4 August when the schedule was due for transmission on 5 August. The software developer was called but the problem was not fixed until 7 August when the schedule was prepared and transmitted. On the same day, the remittance slip and payment were sent together with the software developer's report confirming when the virus was detected; the actual location of the virus in the computer system; the effect of the virus on transmission of the employer monthly schedule; and when the problem was finally resolved. The late filing and late payment penalties would be remitted, as this would be a situation beyond the taxpayer's control.  
      
    **Genuine oversight (late payment penalty)**  
    A new office person had been hired by an employer as a wages clerk. The new person's duties included preparing the wages, maintaining the wage records and preparing the employer monthly schedules and remittances.  
      
    The new person arrived in early March and found the wage records in a terrible mess. The person completed and balanced the employer monthly schedule and forwarded it to Inland Revenue by 20 April, and had intended to enclose the monthly remittance for March in the same envelope. Unfortunately, the remittance and the cheque were caught up in some papers and were not discovered until 24 April. The remittance and cheque were promptly delivered to the nearest Inland Revenue office with supporting documentation explaining the background circumstances leading to the oversight and an accompanying letter requesting remission. Remission of the late payment penalty would be granted under section 183D as a genuine oversight.  
      
    **Incorrect advice (late payment penalty)**  
    A small business taxpayer registered for GST and was a six-monthly payer. However, as business improved the taxpayer elected to file GST returns two-monthly. The taxpayer sought the advice from the nearest Inland Revenue office but, unfortunately, confusion arose over the date the next return was due to be filed, resulting in the imposition of a late payment penalty. The taxpayer sought penalty remission and provided supporting documentation confirming the name of the Inland Revenue officer who gave the advice, the date of obtaining that advice and the contents of that advice. Remission of the late payment penalty would be granted under section 183D due to incorrect information being given by Inland Revenue.  
      
    **Incorrect advice (interest)**  
    A taxpayer is advised of an incorrect date for PAYE and incurs a late payment penalty and interest. As the late payment penalty and interest were caused by Inland Revenue's error, both the late payment penalty and interest would be remitted. However, the taxpayer would be expected to provide evidence to support that incorrect information was given by Inland Revenue. Relevant evidence may include the name of the Inland Revenue officer who gave the advice, the date of obtaining that advice and the contents of that advice.  
      
    **Incorrect advice (partial remission of interest)**  
    A taxpayer rang Inland Revenue to find out what interest was accruing on their 2005 income tax account, as they had just received a statement of account showing some interest payable. The due date for the actual income tax was shown as 7 February 2006 . They were advised that interest was not accruing so the taxpayer did not make payment immediately. Subsequently, the taxpayer was charged further interest.  
      
    Remission was applied for on the grounds that they would have paid immediately had they known of the ongoing liability. Remission of interest was granted in part – the interest that had accrued until the time the taxpayer telephoned Inland Revenue was still payable. However, the taxpayer would be expected to provide evidence to support that incorrect information was given by Inland Revenue. Relevant evidence may include the name of the Inland Revenue officer who gave the advice, the date of obtaining that advice and the contents of that advice.  
      
    **One-off situation (late filing penalty and late payment penalty)**  
    A taxpayer had tax arrears comprising core tax of $3,000 when the taxpayer left New Zealand in April 1998. However, the taxpayer was unaware of the tax arrears, as the statement of account was sent to the taxpayer's New Zealand residence after he had left the country. When the taxpayer returned to New Zealand in 2005, the taxpayer discovered the imposition of late filing penalty, late payment penalties and interest to a total of $40,000. The taxpayer's financial circumstances would not meet the requirements for relief for serious hardship. Inland Revenue may consider remitting the late filing penalty and late payment penalties as a one-off situation once the taxpayer has provided supporting documentation confirming the taxpayer's New Zealand address and his date of departure and re-entry into New Zealand.

### **Standard Practice**

The following standard practice applies.

50.  When considering the remission provisions of penalties and interest, Inland Revenue considers it important to treat both the taxpayer requesting the remission and all other taxpayers fairly. A lenient remission practice penalises complying taxpayers and may ultimately affect voluntary compliance. However, allowing an inappropriate penalty to stand will also impact on voluntary compliance. Inland Revenue recognises that penalising a taxpayer for a small non-compliant action is counterproductive and may actually reduce voluntary compliance.  
     
51.  Applications for remission under sections 183A and 183D should be made in writing and should be accompanied by supporting information.  
     
52.  The Commissioner will remit under section 183A:  
     
    
    *   a late filing penalty
    *   a non-electronic filing penalty
    *   initial and incremental late payment penalties
    *   imputation penalty tax
    *   dividend withholding payment penalty tax
    *   Maori authority distribution penalty tax (see paragraph 19)
    *   a shortfall penalty imposed by section 141AA (see paragraph 20).
    
      
      
    where he is satisfied that the non-compliance has been caused by an event or circumstance that provides reasonable justification or excuse for the omission, and the omission was rectified as soon as practicable.  
     
53.  The Commissioner will remit under section 183ABA:  
     
    
    *   late filing penalty
    *   non-electronic filing penalty
    *   initial and incremental late payment penalties
    *   interest (also commonly known as "use-of-money interest")
    
      
      
    where:  
     
    
    1.  a taxpayer is significantly affected by a "qualifying event" (see paragraphs 33 to 39 ), and  
         
    2.  the taxpayer has applied for remission of the penalties and/or interest as soon as practicable, and  
         
    3.  the Commissioner is satisfied that the effect on the taxpayer of the occurrence of the qualifying event makes the remission equitable.
    
      
     
54.  The Commissioner will remit under section 183D:  
     
    
    *   a late filing penalty
    *   a non-electronic filing penalty
    *   initial and incremental late payment penalties
    *   a shortfall penalty imposed by section 141AA
    *   interest,
    
      
      
    if to do so is consistent with collection of the highest net revenue over time.  
     
55.  Interest will be remitted in extremely limited circumstances such as where an Inland Revenue officer has given incorrect advice to the taxpayer, and that advice has directly resulted in the non-compliance. However, this is not the only situation in which interest may be remitted. The Commissioner must consider each case on its own merits.  
     
56.  Remission applications under sections 183A and 183D will only be considered when the returns relevant to the remission requests have been filed and the tax has been paid.  
     
57.  Sections 183A and 183D do not permit remission to be granted for financial reasons. Requests for financial relief are dealt with under sections 176 and 177. For further details refer to the relevant SPSs on instalment arrangements for payment of tax debt and writing off tax debt.

Instalment arrangements for payment of tax debt (Nov 05) (WITHDRAWN)
====================================================================

Withdrawn SPS 05/11 Instalment arrangements for payment of tax debt (Nov 05). Statement provided for historical purposes only.

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out Inland Revenue's practice on providing relief by way of an instalment arrangement when taxpayers are in debt.  
      
    
2.  Please refer to the relevant SPS on writing off tax debt for further details on Inland Revenue's practice on providing relief under section 177C of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Application

3.  This SPS applies to applications for relief by way of instalment arrangement made on or after 15 November 2005. It replaces SPS _RDC 610 - Instalment arrangements for payment of tax debt originally published in Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002).  
      
    
4.  This SPS also applies to instalment arrangements for student loan repayment debt and late payment penalties incurred on that debt. Interest is not charged on instalment arrangements for student loan repayment debt although it will be charged on student loan balances.  
      
    
5.  This SPS does not apply to instalment arrangements for payment of child support arrears by non-custodial or custodial parents.  
      
    
6.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Summary

7.  Pursuant to section 176, the Commissioner must not recover tax debt from a taxpayer, being a natural person if recovery would place that person in serious hardship.  
      
    
8.  Section 177 allows a taxpayer to apply for financial relief by requesting to enter into an instalment arrangement.  
      
    
9.  The Commissioner will negotiate with the taxpayer to determine what method of payment best suits the taxpayer's financial situation and will maximise recovery of the tax debt from the taxpayer.  
      
    
10.  Applications for relief by way of an instalment arrangement may be made by telephone or in writing.  
      
    
11.  The Commissioner may require relevant information to be provided in support of the application. This may include financial information and the filing of outstanding returns. This information must be provided within 20 working days or a longer period allowed by the Commissioner.  
      
    
12.  Upon receipt of a taxpayer's application for an instalment arrangement the Commissioner may accept the request, seek further information from the taxpayer, make a counter offer or decline the request.  
      
    
13.  The Commissioner's authority to enter into instalment arrangements for the payment of tax debt under the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("the TAA") is further qualified by the requirement:  
      
    
    *   to maximise the recovery of tax debt from a taxpayer, but not if:
        
        *   recovery would represent an inefficient use of the Commissioner's resources, or
        *   a taxpayer, being a natural person, would be placed in serious hardship by enforcement of the debt.
        
          
          
        
    *   that, if the Commissioner can recover more through an instalment arrangement than from bankruptcy or liquidation action, the Commissioner is required to enter into an instalment arrangement.
    
      
    In _Raynel v CIR_ (2004) 21 NZTC 18,583 Randerson J noted that the obligation to maximise recovery of outstanding debt from a taxpayer is not an absolute obligation. Rather the Commissioner's duty is to be approached on "a pragmatic basis with proper regard to the likely benefits and the costs of achieving them." Randerson J also considered that this obligation does not relieve Inland Revenue officers from their duty under section 6(1) to use their best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system. Further, Randerson J noted that the Commissioner is required under section 6A(3)(b) to have regard to the importance of promoting voluntary compliance by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts. Thus taxpayers are entitled to expect that appropriate and firm action is taken against non-complying taxpayers and that this may override any proposed instalment arrangement.  
      
    
14.  Use-of-money interest will continue to accrue during the term of an instalment arrangement.  
      
    
15.  Under section 139B, the initial late payment penalty is divided into two steps with a staggered application.  
      
    
16.  In addition, monthly incremental penalties will not be charged while a debt is under an instalment arrangement, provided that the taxpayer complies with the instalment arrangement. This applies from the date on which the taxpayer contacts Inland Revenue seeking financial relief.  
      
    
17.  When the Commissioner accepts an instalment arrangement, he will issue to the taxpayer a letter of confirmation setting out both the taxpayer's and the Commissioner's obligations.  
      
    
18.  The taxpayer may renegotiate an instalment arrangement at any time. However, the Commissioner may only do so after two years have elapsed from the date the instalment arrangement was entered into.  
      
    
19.  The Commissioner may cancel an instalment arrangement because the taxpayer has provided misleading information or is not meeting their obligations under the arrangement. In these circumstances monthly incremental penalties will be imposed retrospectively as if the instalment arrangement had not been entered into.

### Legislation

20.  The relevant legislative provisions are sections 14B, 139B, 139BA, 176, 177, 177A, 177B and 177CA.

### Discussion

21.  Pursuant to section 176, the Commissioner must not recover tax debt from a taxpayer, being a natural person if recovery would place that person in serious hardship.  
      
    
22.  The taxpayer may apply for financial relief under the TAA. The relief may be in the form of an instalment arrangement and/or a write-off of all or part of the tax debt. (Refer to the relevant SPS for details on Inland Revenue's practice on writing off tax debt.)  
      
    
23.  Taxpayers may apply for an instalment arrangement by telephone or in writing. In some cases, however, Inland Revenue may require a taxpayer to apply in writing.  
      
    
24.  Pursuant to section 14B, where a taxpayer is required to apply for financial relief by giving notice in writing to the Commissioner, the taxpayer may do so by:  
      
    
    *   delivering the notice in person to an Inland Revenue office, or
    *   issuing the notice by fax to an Inland Revenue office, or
    *   sending an email on Inland Revenue's Online Correspondence Service, or
    *   sending the notice to an Inland Revenue office by post.
    
      
    
25.  In all cases the taxpayers must provide supporting financial information. This information can be supplied either orally or in writing. Despite this, Inland Revenue officers may obtain written financial information from the taxpayers to verify or further support their applications for financial relief. However, in some cases, Inland Revenue may already hold adequate financial information about the taxpayers and thus further financial information may not be required.  
      
    
26.  Upon receipt of an application for an instalment arrangement, Inland Revenue may:  
      
    1.  Accept the taxpayer's request  
          
        Once the request is accepted written confirmation will be sent to the taxpayer. This will include:  
          
        
        *   the commencement date of the instalment arrangement, and
        *   any terms and conditions in addition to the agreed repayments under the instalment arrangement negotiated between Inland Revenue and the taxpayer.
        
          
        If the taxpayer disagrees with any of the terms and conditions they should contact the Inland Revenue officer who issued the confirmation immediately.
    2.  Seek further information from the taxpayer  
          
        If the Commissioner requires additional information it must be received by a date agreed to between the Commissioner and the taxpayer.  
          
        
    3.  Make a counter offer  
          
        The Commissioner may make a counter offer to the taxpayer where:  
          
        
        *   the Commissioner considers that the taxpayer's financial circumstances disclose that the taxpayer can make instalments at a higher amount than was proposed by the taxpayer in the application, or
        *   the Commissioner considers that to accept instalments based on the amount the taxpayer offers to pay would place the taxpayer in serious hardship. In this case the Commissioner may make a counter offer to accept instalments of a lesser amount.
        
          
        
    4.  Decline the request  
          
        The Commissioner must not enter into an instalment arrangement:
        
        *   if recovery would represent an inefficient use of the Commissioner's resources, or
        *   to the extent that it would place a taxpayer, being a natural person, in serious hardship. However an exception arises where the taxpayer is liable to pay, in relation to a tax debt, a shortfall penalty for either an abusive tax position under section 140D(2) or evasion under section 141E(1) or a similar act. In these circumstances recovery action to collect both the shortfall penalty and the underlying tax will continue even if recovery would place a taxpayer in serious hardship.
        
          
        If the Commissioner declines a request for an instalment arrangement the taxpayer will be notified of the reasons for the decision. The taxpayer may request the Commissioner to explain the decision in writing.  
          
        In addition, the Commissioner may decline to enter into an instalment arrangement:  
          
        *   if it is considered that the taxpayer is able to pay the debt in full. For example, a taxpayer has term deposits or other investments or the ability to borrow sufficient funds to pay the tax debt, or
        *   if the Commissioner considers that more can be recovered by commencing bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings.

**Timeframe for responding**

27.  If the Commissioner is unable to make a decision on granting relief immediately and requires further information, or makes a counter offer, the taxpayer will be advised in writing.  
      
    
28.  The letter will contain the following details:  
      
    
    *   the date the application was received
    *   the name and contact number of the Inland Revenue officer handling the request
    *   the additional information the taxpayer is required to supply (if applicable)
    *   the timeframe for the supply of that information
    *   the consequences of failing to provide that information by the required date
    
      
    
29.  Generally, the taxpayer must provide the information requested or respond to Inland Revenue's counter offer within 20 working days. However, the Commissioner may allow a longer period to respond if the taxpayer is having difficulties in obtaining the required information or responding to the counter offer within the time frame. In this situation, the taxpayer may contact Inland Revenue to request an extension of the response period. Inland Revenue will consider such a request on its own merits, taking into account the reason for the taxpayer's difficulty in providing the information or responding to the counter offer and whether it is reasonable for the request to be granted.  
      
    
30.  Incremental late payment penalties and in some cases, part of the initial late payment penalties will not be imposed during the response period. However, use-of-money interest will continue to accrue on a daily basis.  
      
    
31.  If the information or response to the Commissioner's counter offer is not provided within the negotiated timeframe, late payment penalties will be imposed as though no application had been made.  
      
    
32.  If the information is forwarded at a later date, the Commissioner will treat this as a new request for financial relief unless there is good reason why the taxpayer was unable to provide the information or respond to the Commissioner's counter offer within the timeframe. Possible reasons could include illness, or involvement in an accident which prevented the taxpayer from contacting Inland Revenue to request an extension.  
      
    
33.  If the Commissioner, upon receipt of the information requested, declines to enter into an instalment arrangement, any late payment penalties not imposed during the response period will be imposed as though no application for financial relief had been made.  
      
    
34.  The Commissioner will not commence recovery action during a negotiation period. However, if recovery action has already commenced, the Commissioner will discuss with the taxpayer whether this recovery action will continue during the negotiation period.  
      
    
35.  For example, a taxpayer may already be paying an outstanding amount by way of an instalment arrangement and may contact the Commissioner to discuss a reduction in the instalment amounts. In this instance, the Commissioner will discuss with the taxpayer whether the current instalment arrangement is to continue until such time as a new instalment arrangement is successfully negotiated.  
      
    
36.  If the taxpayer incurs further debt during the response period, this amount may be added to the total amount under negotiation.

**Considering the request**

37.  When considering a request for an instalment arrangement, declining such a request, deciding whether to seek further information, or making a counter offer, Inland Revenue will take into account the following factors:
    1.  Whether the proposal will place the taxpayer, being a natural person, in serious hardship.  
          
        1.  This requires the Commissioner to take into account the circumstances of the taxpayer, specifically:  
              
            
            *   whether the taxpayer will be unable to meet minimum living expenses according to normal community standards, or
            *   the cost of medical treatment for an illness or injury of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's dependant(s), or
            *   a serious illness suffered by the taxpayer or the taxpayer's dependant(s) which directly caused financial difficulty in complying with their statutory obligations to file returns and make tax payments (including penalties and/or interest), or
            *   the cost of education for the taxpayer's dependant(s). /li>
            
              
            
        2.  The Commissioner may take into account whether the recovery of tax debt would place a shareholder who owns, or two shareholders who jointly own, 50% or more of the shares in a company or a shareholder-employee of a close company in serious hardship.  
              
            
        3.  A "close company" for these purposes means a company which has five or fewer natural persons whose voting interests or market value interests in the company exceed 50% and are not a special corporate entity.  
              
            
        4.  Serious hardship does not include financial difficulties that arise because:  
              
            
            *   the taxpayer is obligated to pay tax, or
            *   the taxpayer may become bankrupt, or
            *   the taxpayer's, or the taxpayer's dependant's social activities and entertainment may be limited, or
            *   the taxpayer is unable to afford goods or services that are expensive or of a high quality or standard according to normal community standards.
            
              
            
        5.  Whether a person is a taxpayer's "dependant" will be determined on a case by case basis. In determining dependency issues, the Commissioner will consider:  
              
            
            *   whether the person is dependent on the taxpayer for financial support, and
            *   what degree of financial support is provided by the taxpayer, and
            *   to what extent providing financial support impacts on the taxpayer's ability to meet minimum living expenses according to normal community standards.
            
              
            For further discussion on consideration of serious hardship, refer to the separate SPS on _Writing off tax debt_.
    2.  Whether the instalment arrangement would maximise the recovery of tax debt from the taxpayer.
        1.  Inland Revenue has a duty to maximise the recovery of tax debt from a taxpayer. The Commissioner is therefore obliged to compare the value of the likely recovery from entering into an instalment arrangement with any other viable options for recovery. In some cases, it is clear which option will maximise recovery. In other cases there may be options that could yield similar returns. Accordingly it is necessary to determine which option will maximise recovery.  
              
            
        2.  Whilst not necessary in most circumstances, one method of distinguishing between alternative repayment options is to apply a net present value calculation.  
              
            A net present value calculation recognises the time value of money, as well as the probability of payment (risk). The proposed payments are discounted for the time value of money and for the likelihood of receiving the money. Inland Revenue needs to determine the amount, date, and probability of each payment and apply an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate is calculated from published Government stock rates. Inland Revenue uses a calculation that multiplies the amount of payment by the probability of payment (for risk), divided by the discount factor appropriate to the term (for interest).  
              
            The methodologies for determining the discount rate, probability of payment and net present value are outlined in the appendix to _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 6, No. 14 (June 1995).  
              
            
        3.  The legislation imposes no time limit in which an instalment arrangement must be completed. However, Inland Revenue considers it desirable, in order to maximise the recovery of tax debt, that instalment arrangements are over a shorter period of time, rather than a longer period of time. This is because the longer the period, the greater the risk of non-payment and the greater the loss of the time value of money.  
              
            The Commissioner will also consider whether the proposed instalment arrangement would lead to a monetary return to Inland Revenue greater than any amount likely to be received if legal proceedings were initiated.
    3.  Whether the taxpayer is in a position to pay all of the tax debt immediately.  
          
        An opinion will be formed based on the financial information provided by the taxpayer and the result of any further enquiries the Commissioner considers necessary.  
          
        
    4.  Whether the taxpayer has met their obligations under a previous instalment arrangement.  
          
        Where a taxpayer has previously entered into an instalment arrangement with Inland Revenue and has not met their obligations under that instalment arrangement, the Commissioner may decline to enter into a further instalment arrangement.  
          
        In reaching this decision, Inland Revenue will also take into account:  
          
        *   the length of time since the previous instalment arrangement
        *   whether the previous instalment arrangement was realistic
        *   any changes in the taxpayer's position over that time
        *   whether there are any other factors likely to indicate that the taxpayer will meet their obligations if an instalment arrangement is agreed to this time.
    5.  Whether the taxpayer is being frivolous or vexatious.  
          
        This includes situations where:  
          
        
        *   Inland Revenue considers the taxpayer is not seriously contemplating entering into, and/or complying with an instalment arrangement, or
        *   previous requests for instalment arrangements have been declined and the taxpayer provides the same information when requesting a further instalment arrangement.
        
          
          
        In these circumstances Inland Revenue may decline to enter into an instalment arrangement.  
          
        
    6.  Whether the taxpayer's proposal is realistic.  
          
        
        1.  An opinion will be made based upon the financial information provided by the taxpayer and any further information the Commissioner considers necessary. The Commissioner will consider whether the taxpayer can reasonably afford to repay the outstanding amount at the rate detailed in the taxpayer's application.  
              
            
        2.  The Commissioner must, under section 6(1), have regard to protecting the integrity of the tax system and will be conscious of taxpayers re-ordering their tax affairs by reducing personal assets or deliberately concealing assets overseas, or by some other method to prevent recovery of tax debt and to achieve a settlement with the Commissioner.
        
          
        
    7.  Whether future compliance by the taxpayer is likely.  
          
        Inland Revenue will consider whether entering into an instalment arrangement would be likely to allow the taxpayer to meet future tax obligations by their due dates. For example, if a taxpayer is continuing in business, whether the instalment arrangement would allow the taxpayer to meet their ongoing provisional, residual income tax and GST obligations as they arise.  
          
        
    8.  Whether the taxpayer has filed all required returns.  
          
        Inland Revenue may, in certain circumstances, request outstanding returns to be filed in order to ascertain the taxpayer's full debt situation. This may occur if the outstanding amount relates to assessments made by the Commissioner in the absence of returns having been filed.  
          
        
    9.  Other relevant factors:  
          
        In _Clarke & Money v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,165 Priestley J considered the following factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion under section 177:  
          
        1.  the circumstances which led to the taxpayer's taxation debts
        2.  the nature and extent of the taxpayer's co-operation and negotiating stance
        3.  the speed with which the taxpayer has provided requested information, and the extent of that information
        4.  the taxpayer's degree of compliance in providing information.  
              
            In _Raynel v CIR_ (2004) 21 NZTC 18,583, Randerson J noted that where there has been a flagrant and on-going failure to comply with the taxpayer's obligations and where recovery is dubious or is likely to result only in a relatively minor proportion of the overall debt being recovered, the Commissioner may be justified in initiating or continuing enforcement proceedings to secure the wider interests identified by the legislation.  
              
            In _Rogerson v CIR_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,260, Potter J also considered the taxpayer's compliance history was a factor relevant to the Commissioner's exercise of the discretion to grant financial relief

**Cancellation of an instalment arrangement**

38.  Under section 177B(6), the Commissioner may cancel an instalment arrangement in the following circumstances:  
      
    
    *   if the instalment arrangement was entered into on the basis of false or misleading information provided by the taxpayer.  
          
        For example, where a taxpayer has overstated outgoings or understated income, it may not have been appropriate for the Commissioner to have entered into an instalment arrangement; or where a taxpayer has a vested right to income or assets of a trust, and this was not disclosed to the Commissioner.  
          
        
    *   if the repayment obligations under the instalment arrangement are not being met.
    
      
    
39.  If an instalment arrangement is cancelled because misleading information was provided, any late payment penalties not imposed under the instalment arrangement from the date the taxpayer contacted Inland Revenue seeking financial relief will be reinstated in full.  
      
    
40.  When an instalment arrangement is cancelled due to the repayment obligations not being met, incremental late payment penalties will be imposed on a monthly basis from the date the taxpayer stops meeting the repayment obligations. Any late payment penalties not charged under the instalment arrangement from the date the taxpayer contacted Inland Revenue seeking financial relief to the date Inland Revenue cancels the instalment arrangement are not reinstated.

**Payments**

41.  Inland Revenue will negotiate with the taxpayer to achieve the frequency and method of payment that matches the taxpayer's financial circumstances and which maximises recovery of the tax debt from the taxpayer.  
      
    
42.  Inland Revenue will only apply credits that arise in a taxpayer's account to the outstanding arrears that are under an instalment arrangement when requested by the taxpayer.  
      
    
43.  A taxpayer may start making voluntary payments at any time, without contacting the Commissioner to request an instalment arrangement. However, in these situations the taxpayer will not be eligible for any late payment penalty reduction or non-imposition. If the taxpayer does subsequently contact Inland Revenue to request an instalment arrangement, after commencing the voluntary payments, and that request is granted, the non-imposition of penalties will apply from the date the taxpayer contacted Inland Revenue requesting financial relief.

**Reviewing instalment arrangements**

44.  A taxpayer may renegotiate an instalment arrangement at any time.  
      
    
45.  The Commissioner may only initiate renegotiation of an instalment arrangement after the end of two years from the date on which the instalment arrangement was entered into. Such a review will consider whether the instalment arrangement is still appropriate to the taxpayer's financial circumstances and may therefore require updated financial information from the taxpayer.  
      
    
46.  The date the instalment arrangement is entered into is the date the instalment arrangement is accepted by the Commissioner. The taxpayer will be notified of the Commissioner's acceptance of the instalment arrangement in writing.

**Imposition of late payment penalty**

47.  Late payment penalties imposed under section 139B comprise an initial late payment penalty and incremental late payment penalties.  
      
    
48.  The initial late payment penalty is a two-step penalty being:  
      
    
    *   an initial late payment penalty of 1% imposed on the day after due date, and
    *   a second initial late payment penalty of 4% imposed at the end of the 6 th day after the date on which the 1% initial late payment penalty is imposed if the tax owing remains outstanding. In practice, if the tax owing remains outstanding, this means the 4% second initial late payment penalty is imposed at the end of the 7 th day after the due date.
    
      
    
49.  An incremental late payment penalty of 1% is imposed on the balance of tax debt outstanding at the end of every month after the date the initial 1% late payment penalty was imposed.  
      
    
50.  The Commissioner will review monthly all instalment arrangements entered into to determine whether the expected instalment amount has been received for the previous month. Where the instalment has been received, the incremental late payment penalty will not be imposed for that month.  
      
    
51.  The agreed instalment arrangement amount is the minimum amount that is due each month. Extra payments in one month are not used as credits towards future monthly obligations. Instead they are applied to reduce the term of the instalment arrangement and the amount of interest payable.

**Instalment arrangements entered into before the due date - commonly known as "Pre-emptive instalment arrangements"**

52.  Where the taxpayer contacts the Commissioner seeking financial relief by way of an instalment arrangement before the due date, the 1% initial late payment penalty under section 139B(2A)(a) will be imposed. However, the 4% initial late payment penalty under section 139B(2A)(b) will not be imposed. This type of arrangement is commonly known as a "pre-emptive" instalment arrangement.  
      
    
53.  In addition, where monthly repayment obligations under the instalment arrangement have been met, the monthly incremental late payment penalty of 1% will not be imposed for that month. Failing to meet any monthly repayment obligations will result in the incremental late payment penalty being imposed for that month based on the balance outstanding under that instalment arrangement.  
      
    
54.  If financial relief is not granted, the late payment penalties mentioned earlier will be imposed as if the taxpayer had not requested financial relief.  
      
    
55.  When a taxpayer seeks to enter into a pre-emptive instalment arrangement for provisional tax payments they must provide cashflow forecasts and budgets to substantiate the proposed instalment arrangement when required. The Commissioner may consider the taxpayer's trend of making tax payments, taxable income and the industry in which they are working. The Commissioner may also refer to other taxpayers in the same industry to establish whether the taxpayer will have residual income tax to pay.  
      
    
56.  When a taxpayer seeks to enter into a pre-emptive instalment arrangement for the payment of provisional tax instalments based on the standard method but there is evidence, such as a cashflow forecast or budget, to establish that the taxpayer will have no tax to pay in the tax year, the Commissioner may decline to enter into an instalment arrangement with the taxpayer.

**Instalment arrangements entered into on or after due date**

57.  Where the taxpayer contacts the Commissioner seeking financial relief on or after the due date, both the 1% and 4% initial late payment penalties will be imposed. In addition, any incremental late payment penalties imposed up to the date the taxpayer requests financial relief are also payable.  
      
    
58.  The monthly incremental late payment penalty of 1% will not be charged in those months where the monthly repayment obligations are met. Failing to meet monthly repayment obligations will result in an incremental penalty being imposed for that month based on the balance outstanding under that instalment arrangement.  
      
    
59.  If all obligations under the instalment arrangement are fulfilled, these instalment arrangements will, in effect, be charged only the 1% and 4% initial late payment penalties plus any monthly incremental penalties imposed prior to the taxpayer requesting financial relief.

### Standard Practice

60.  Upon receipt of a taxpayer's application for an instalment arrangement, Inland Revenue has four options:  
      
    
    1.  accept the taxpayer's request, or
    2.  seek further information from the taxpayer, or
    3.  make a counter offer, or
    4.  decline the request.
    
      
    
61.  Inland Revenue will take into account the following factors when considering a taxpayer's application for an instalment arrangement:  
      
    
    1.  Whether the proposal will place the taxpayer, being a natural person, in serious hardship.
    2.  Whether the instalment arrangement would maximise the recovery of outstanding tax from the taxpayer.
    3.  Whether the taxpayer is in a position to pay all of the tax debt immediately.
    4.  Whether the taxpayer has met their obligations under a previous instalment arrangement.
    5.  Whether the taxpayer is being frivolous or vexatious.
    6.  Whether the taxpayer's proposal is realistic.
    7.  Whether future compliance by the taxpayer is likely.
    8.  Whether the taxpayer has filed all required returns.
    9.  Whether other relevant factors exist.
    
      
    
62.  When considering a taxpayer's application, the Commissioner may require the taxpayer to provide additional information within 20 working days or a longer period allowed by the Commissioner.  
      
    
63.  The taxpayer must provide the required information within the timeframe. Failure to do so will be treated as if the application for an instalment arrangement had not been made. This means that the initial late payment penalty, the monthly incremental late payment penalty and use-of-money interest will be imposed on the unpaid tax.  
      
    
64.  When the Commissioner accepts an instalment arrangement, a letter of confirmation setting out both the taxpayer's and the Commissioner's obligations will be issued to the taxpayer.  
      
    
65.  Where the taxpayer applies for an instalment arrangement before the due date and the Commissioner accepts the application, the initial late payment penalty of 1% on the unpaid tax will be imposed. Use-of-money interest will also be accrued daily on the unpaid tax.  
      
    
66.  Where the taxpayer applies for an instalment arrangement after the due date and the Commissioner accepts the application, the initial late payment penalty of 1% and 4% on the unpaid tax will be imposed. In addition, any incremental late payment penalties imposed up to the date the taxpayer requests financial relief are also payable. Use-of-money interest will also be accrued daily on the unpaid tax.  
      
    
67.  The taxpayer may renegotiate an instalment arrangement at any time. The Commissioner may do so only after the end of two years from the date on which the instalment arrangement was entered into. During the renegotiation process, the Commissioner may require the taxpayer to provide further information (including financial information).  
      
    
68.  The Commissioner may cancel an instalment arrangement because the taxpayer has provided misleading information. In this case, the monthly incremental penalty of 1% will be imposed on the unpaid tax from the date on which the taxpayer contacted Inland Revenue seeking financial relief.  
      
    
69.  However, when an instalment arrangement is cancelled because the taxpayer does not meet their repayment obligations, a monthly incremental penalty of 1% will be imposed on the unpaid tax from the date on which the taxpayer fails to meet their repayment obligations under the instalment arrangement.

Discretion to cancel or not assess shortfall penalties for taking an unacceptable tax position (April 2006) (WITHDRAWN)
=======================================================================================================================

Withdrawn SPS 06/01 Discretion to cancel or not assess shortfall penalties for taking an unacceptable tax position. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

This statement also appears in Tax Information Bulletin, Vol. 18, No. 5 (June 2006).

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out Inland Revenue's practice for exercising the Commissioner's discretion to:
    *   cancel a previously assessed shortfall penalty for taking an unacceptable tax position, and/or
    *   not assess a shortfall penalty that would otherwise be assessed for taking an unacceptable tax positionin circumstances when the Commissioner is satisfied that certain criteria are met.

2.  For the purpose of this SPS, the term "UTP penalty" refers to a shortfall penalty assessed for taking an unacceptable tax position under section 141B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA).

3.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the TAA.

### Application

4.  This SPS applies to taxpayers:
    *   who have been assessed a UTP penalty before 1 April 2006, and/or
    *   who may (but for exercise of the discretion) be assessed a UTP penalty on or after 1 April 2006for tax positions taken after 1 April 2003.

### Standard Practice

5.  From 1 April 2006, pursuant to section 141KB, the Commissioner can determine:
    *   whether or not to cancel a UTP penalty that has been assessed before 1 April 2006, and
    *   whether or not to assess a UTP penalty that would otherwise be assessed on or after 1 April 2006.

6.  In order for the Commissioner to consider cancelling a UTP penalty that has been assessed prior to 1 April 2006, the taxpayer must make a request in writing. The request must be received by Inland Revenue before 1 October 2006.

7.  The Commissioner will cancel or decide not to assess a UTP penalty if satisfied that the following three criteria of section 141KB(2)(a) are met:
    *   that "a clear mistake or simple oversight" caused the taxpayer to take the unacceptable tax position to which the UTP penalty related, or would relate if the UTP penalty were to be assessed, and
    *   either:
        *   the tax shortfall is voluntarily disclosed to the Commissioner prior to the notification of a pending tax audit or investigation (in terms of section 141G(1)(a)), or
        *   the tax shortfall is a temporary tax shortfall (in terms of section 141I(3)), and
    *   it is appropriate that the taxpayer not be liable to pay a UTP penalty.

8.  When the Commissioner cancels or decides not to assess a UTP penalty under section 141KB(1), the Commissioner may consider that the taxpayer is instead liable to pay a shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care under section 141A. The date of imposing a shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care, if applicable, is the same as the date of the Commissioner's decision under section 141KB(1).

### Background

9.  The UTP penalty legislation (section 141B) was enacted (as an amendment to the former "unacceptable interpretation" penalty) in 2003, because under the former penalty (for taking an unacceptable interpretation) taxpayers could choose not to interpret the legislation on a complex tax issue as a means of avoiding possible shortfall penalties. However, experience with the UTP penalty has shown that it gives rise to some unintended penalty outcomes. In some cases, the penalty discourages voluntary compliance by taxpayers who discover a clear mistake or simple oversight.

10.  The government has recognised the problems caused by the UTP penalty and introduced section 141KB to give the Commissioner discretion in the assessment of a UTP penalty when the tax shortfall has arisen from a clear mistake or simple oversight. In exercising this discretion in practice, the Commissioner's intention is to ensure the discretion is applied consistently with the background to its enactment and to encourage voluntary disclosure of mistakes and oversights, and their efficient correction, and thus promote voluntary compliance.

11.  Section 141KB applies from 1 April 2006, but to overcome previous unintended outcomes, the section has retrospective effect to 1 April 2003.

12.  Taxpayers are still obliged to ensure that, when viewed objectively, their tax positions meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. However, section 141KB means that, generally, taxpayers who make a pre-notification voluntary disclosure in relation to tax shortfalls that have arisen from clear mistakes or simple oversights will not be liable for UTP penalties.

### Legislation

13.  The relevant legislative provisions are:
    *   the definitions of "tax position", "disputable decision" and "response period" in section 3(1),
    *   sections 14, 89D, 141A, 141B, 141FB, 141G, 141H, 141I, 141KB, and
    *   sections CC 8 and EF 4 of the Income Tax Act 2004.

### Discussion

#### Operation of the UTP penalty

14.  Section 141B provides that a shortfall penalty will be imposed if a taxpayer takes an unacceptable tax position.

15.  An unacceptable tax position is one taken by a taxpayer that, when "viewed objectively, fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct". This standard has been recognised as applying to a wide range of tax positions including tax positions that are simply incorrect as a result of inadvertence.

16.  For a UTP penalty to be assessed, the tax shortfall must be more than both:
    *   $20,000, and
    *   the lesser of $250,000 and 1% of the taxpayer's total tax figure for the relevant return period.

17.  The shortfall penalty payable is 20% of the resulting tax shortfall. However, the penalty may be reduced because of:
    *   a voluntary disclosure under section 141G, and/or
    *   a temporary tax shortfall under section 141I, and/or
    *   the taxpayer's previous behaviour under section 141FB, and/or
    *   disclosure of an unacceptable tax position under section 141H.

18.  Please refer to Interpretation Statement _IS0055_ titled _Shortfall penalty - unacceptable interpretation and unacceptable tax position_ (which was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 17, No. 9 (November 2005) and is available on Inland Revenue's website at www.ird.govt.nz) for further details on Inland Revenue's practice in assessing UTP penalties.

#### The Commissioner's discretion under section 141KB

19.  The Commissioner may exercise the new discretion under section 141KB(1) to cancel a previously assessed UTP penalty (i.e. assessed before 1 April 2006) or not assess a UTP penalty that would otherwise be assessed from 1 April 2006 in respect of a tax position taken after 1 April 2003.

20.  Section 141KB reads:  
      
    
    |     |     |     |     |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | (1) | The Commissioner may decide in the circumstances given by subsection (2) that a taxpayer is not liable to pay a shortfall penalty that would otherwise be imposed by section 141B in relation to a tax position. |     |     |
    | (2) | The Commissioner may exercise the discretion given by subsection (1) if- |     |     |
    |     | (a) | the Commissioner is satisfied that- |     |
    |     |     | (i) | the tax position is taken as a result of a clear mistake or simple oversight; and |
    |     |     | (ii) | the tax shortfall arising from the tax position is or would be subject to a reduced penalty under section 141G(1)(a) as a result of a voluntary disclosure or is a temporary tax shortfall under section 141I(3); and |
    |     |     | (iii) | it is appropriate that the taxpayer not be liable to pay a shortfall penalty under section 141B in relation to the tax position; and |
    |     | (b) | the Commissioner- |     |
    |     |     | (i) | does not assess the shortfall penalty before exercising the discretion: |
    |     |     | (ii) | assesses the shortfall penalty before 1 April 2006 and receives before 1 October 2006 a written request from the taxpayer for a decision under subsection (1). |
    | (3) | If the Commissioner decides under subsection (1) that a taxpayer is not liable to pay a shortfall penalty that the Commissioner has assessed, the assessment of the shortfall penalty is treated as not having been made. |     |     |
    | (4) | If the Commissioner decides under subsection (1) that a taxpayer is not liable to pay a shortfall penalty that would otherwise be imposed by section 141B in relation to a tax position, the taxpayer is not excluded from liability to pay a shortfall penalty under section 141A in relation to the tax position. |     |     |
    

#### Taxpayers' requests for cancellation of UTP penalties assessed before 1 April 2006

21.  A taxpayer may request cancellation of a UTP penalty assessed before 1 April 2006. Their request must be:
    *   made in writing, and
    *   received by Inland Revenue before 1 October 2006.The taxpayer's request should be sent to their nearest Inland Revenue office. The addresses of Inland Revenue offices can be obtained from Inland Revenue's website at www.ird.govt.nz.

22.  To enable the Commissioner to consider all relevant information in exercising the discretion under section 141KB, the written request should include:
    *   a description of the circumstances leading to the tax shortfall, including the relevant background facts that led to the assessment of the UTP penalty under section 141B,
    *   references to any relevant correspondence with the Commissioner, and
    *   any other information that the taxpayer considers relevant to the Commissioner's decision under section 141KB.

23.  The request for a cancellation of a UTP penalty should include a discussion on how the three criteria of section 141KB(2)(a) in paragraphs 28 to 66 relate to the facts and circumstances of the case at hand. The commentary below will assist.

24.  When the taxpayer makes a written request for the Commissioner to exercise the discretion under section 141KB, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer in writing of his decision. The matter will be subject to a degree of priority, depending upon the volumes and the need to maintain consistency.

#### The criteria for cancelling UTP penalties

25.  The Commissioner must be satisfied that the following three criteria are met in order to exercise the discretion and cancel a UTP penalty that has been assessed. The three criteria are:
    *   that a "clear mistake or simple oversight" caused the taxpayer to take the tax position to which the UTP penalty relates (please see paragraphs 28 to 42 for details on what the Commissioner considers constitutes a "clear mistake or simple oversight" in the context of section 141KB), and
    *   that the tax shortfall is voluntarily disclosed prior to the notification of a pending tax audit or investigation under section 141G(1)(a) or is a temporary tax shortfall under section 141I(3) (please see paragraphs 43 to 55 for details), and
    *   that it is appropriate that the taxpayer not be liable to pay the UTP penalty (the meaning of "appropriate" in the context of section 141KB is explained further in paragraphs 56 to 66).

#### Assessment of UTP penalties from 1 April 2006

26.  From 1 April 2006, the Commissioner has discretion in determining whether or not to assess a UTP penalty if certain criteria are met. As stated in paragraph 10 of this SPS, the Commissioner will exercise the discretion in the spirit in which section 141KB was enacted, to make sure that tax shortfalls which meet the criteria can be properly identified and corrected without incurring a UTP penalty. In considering whether or not to assess a UTP penalty, the Commissioner will always consider the objectives of section 141KB and whether he is satisfied that the three criteria set out in section 141KB(2)(a) are met (please see paragraph 25 for details).

27.  However, if taxpayers do not believe that the discretion has been properly considered, and a UTP penalty is to be assessed, they should draw the matter to the attention of Inland Revenue as soon as possible following receipt of the Commissioner's notification of a UTP.

#### The three criteria in section 141KB(2)(a)

##### Criterion 1: the tax shortfall is caused by "a clear mistake or simple oversight"

28.  The term "a clear mistake or simple oversight" is not defined in the TAA. To the extent that the term relates to the assessment of a UTP penalty under section 141B, or the non-assessment/cancellation of a UTP penalty under section 141KB, the term should be read in the context of that provision's objective, and the Commissioner will adopt a broad approach to the words.

29.  However, not all mistakes or oversights will qualify for the application of section 141KB. The Commissioner considers that the sort of mistake or oversight contemplated must be an inadvertent one. That is, had the taxpayer known of the mistake or oversight, they would not have taken the tax position that they took. A tax shortfall which is the result of a deliberate interpretation will not qualify. Furthermore, the existence of the mistake or oversight should be plain and obvious on review.

30.  The term "clear mistake or simple oversight" can also apply to situations when a particular outcome is intended, but that outcome later turns out not to be achieved, as a result of a miscalculation, misunderstanding or unintentional omission.

31.  The Commissioner considers that the words "clear" and "simple" apply to the mistake or oversight, and not to the underlying transaction to which the mistake or oversight relates. That is, it is possible for section 141KB to apply in respect of a complex transaction, when an incorrect tax position is taken as a result of a clear mistake or simple oversight. For example, in a company shareholder restructure, a breach of shareholder continuity was not identified as a result of a mistake in determining the change in shareholding percentages with the result that tax losses were incorrectly carried forward. The restructure was complex, but a clear mistake resulted in an incorrect tax position.

32.  Whether the Commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer's tax position is caused by a "clear" mistake or "simple" oversight will be determined on a case-by-case basis. As the nature of the enquiry is in determining whether there is a mistake or oversight, the Commissioner expects that, once discovered, the reason for the mistake must be clearly identifiable and understood. Similarly if a matter is an oversight, it should be an uncomplicated process to explain that and how the mistake led to the tax shortfall.

33.  For example, a taxpayer purchased some land and was informed by the vendor's solicitor that the vendor was registered for GST and a tax invoice was to be issued. The taxpayer's accountant relied on this advice and filed a GST return claiming the full amount of input tax. It was later established that while the vendor was GST registered, the land did not form part of the vendor's taxable activity, but was held in the vendor's personal capacity. In this example, the taxpayer's tax position in claiming the input tax was deliberately taken, but the taxpayer had acted on a misunderstanding that resulted in an incorrect tax position. The Commissioner is satisfied that the incorrect tax position taken was as a result of a clear mistake.

34.  A "clear mistake" in the context of sections 141B and 141KB could include (but is not limited to) "a mistake in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return." Such mistakes, however, should be considered in terms of section 141B(1B), and do not result in a UTP penalty in the first place. If section 141B(1B) applies, there should be no need to consider section 141KB in these types of cases.

35.  For further details on mistakes "in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return", please refer to an article entitled "Tax compliance, standards and penalties" in the _Tax Information Bulletin_, Vol. 15, No. 5 (May 2003) and Interpretation Statement _IS0055_ titled _Shortfall penalty - unacceptable interpretation and unacceptable tax position_. Both the article and the Interpretation Statement are also available on Inland Revenue's website at www.ird.govt.nz.

_A mistake of law or mistake of fact may be "a clear mistake or simple oversight"_

36.  Section 141KB(2)(a)(i) does not distinguish between a "mistake of fact" and a "mistake of law". The Commissioner does not intend to draw a distinction between these concepts (which can often be merged), so that overlooking or completely misunderstanding a statutory requirement could qualify as a clear mistake.

37.  For example, a taxpayer changed their GST accounting treatment from the payments to invoice basis, and incorrectly assumed the change took effect from the commencement of the GST return period in which the election was made, rather than the GST return period immediately following approval by the Commissioner.

38.  As stated in paragraph 29, a tax position that was inadvertent or that was taken in circumstances when, had the taxpayer known of the mistake or oversight, they would not have taken the tax position they took, will often suggest that there was a mistake.

39.  The Commissioner also considers that, generally, no "clear mistake or simple oversight" will be present in the following circumstances:
    *   _Not knowing the law:_ there is no clear mistake or simple oversight simply because a taxpayer does not know the law. Taxpayers have a duty to be aware of their obligations. Furthermore, knowingly choosing not to refer to the relevant tax law when taking a tax position, i.e. knowingly turning a blind eye to the law, is also something not contemplated by the discretion. However, knowingly choosing not to interpret the law would not apply to circumstances when the taxpayer can show they have taken steps to find out what the law requires but have genuinely overlooked a relevant law.
    *   _Knowing the law but choosing to ignore it:_ in the same vein, a taxpayer cannot be said to have made a clear mistake or simple oversight if they were aware of their responsibilities but chose to ignore them. For example, a taxpayer was aware that they were not permitted to value closing trading stock at market value unless the value was less than the cost, and did not adjust the closing trading stock value back to cost when completing their income tax return.

_"Timing" differences may be "a clear mistake or simple oversight"_

40.  By way of a further example, the Commissioner considers that a "clear mistake or simple oversight" may include mistakes or oversights resulting in "timing" differences for taxation purposes. The inclusion of "timing" differences in what might constitute a "clear mistake or simple oversight" is in any event implied by the reference to "a temporary tax shortfall" in section 141KB(2)(a)(ii).

_The discretion may apply to mistakes or oversights that relate to multiple tax types, tax periods or other taxpayers in some cases_

41.  To avoid doubt on the issue, a taxpayer's mistake or oversight can relate to one or more revenue types, or one or more tax periods, or taxpayers. For example, as mentioned in paragraph 31 above, the breach of shareholder continuity may have meant that tax losses have been incorrectly carried forward for several income years. They may have also been incorrectly applied against the taxable income of other companies in the same group of companies. Despite this, so long as the Commissioner considers the criteria of section 141KB are met, the Commissioner will exercise the discretion and either cancel or not assess the UTP penalties.

42.  To continue the example in paragraph 31, the losses had been offset against foreign dividend withholding payments. The same mistake caused the taxpayer to take incorrect tax positions in more than one revenue type. Despite this, so long as the Commissioner considers that the criteria of section 141KB are met, the Commissioner will exercise the discretion and either cancel or not assess the UTP penalties.

##### Criterion 2: the taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure or the shortfall is a temporary tax shortfall

43.  In order to satisfy the Commissioner that the criterion of section 141KB(2)(a)(ii) is met, a taxpayer must be able to show that the tax position to which the UTP penalty relates:
    *   is subject to a voluntary disclosure prior to the notification of a pending tax audit or investigation ("pre-notification disclosure") under section 141G(1)(a), or
    *   is a temporary tax shortfall under section 141I(3).

**Voluntary disclosure**

44.  For a UTP penalty assessed before 1 April 2006 or a UTP penalty that would otherwise be assessed on or after 1 April 2006, section 141KB(2)(a)(ii) is met if the tax position to which the UTP penalty relates has been or would be reduced by 75% for a pre-notification disclosure under section 141G(1)(a).

45.  Section 141G(1)(a) reads:  
      
    
    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | A shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer under any of sections 141A to 141EB may be reduced if, in the Commissioner's opinion, the taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure to the Commissioner of all the details of the tax shortfall, either- |     |
    | (a) | Before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation (referred to in this section as "pre-notification disclosure") … |
    

46.  The following SPSs set out the Commissioner's practice on reducing shortfall penalties for voluntary disclosure and pre-notification disclosures:
    
    *   _INV 251 Voluntary Disclosures_, and
    *   _INV 260 Notification of a Pending Audit or Investigation_
    
    These SPSs were published in _Tax Information Bulletins_ Vol. 14, No. 4 (April 2002) and Vol. 12, No. 2 (February 2000) respectively and are available on Inland Revenue's website at www.ird.govt.nz. Note that SPS _INV 260_ has expired, but still generally indicates current practice.

47.  As noted in SPS _INV 251_, the tax system is based on voluntary compliance, and relies on taxpayers meeting their obligations under the tax laws. The voluntary disclosure system provides an incentive to taxpayers to determine their correct tax liability. It is also recognised that the tax system also benefits from voluntary admissions of irregularities and other co-operation by taxpayers.

48.  Inland Revenue now also allows taxpayers to make full voluntary disclosure of tax shortfalls by email on Inland Revenue's Online Correspondence Service. In the context of this SPS, it has been decided that disclosures by email or ordinary correspondence will be accepted, provided that they are clear in their terms. That is, form IR281 need not be used.

**Notification of audit or investigation**

49.  It is the Commissioner's intention to give sufficient opportunities for taxpayers to disclose mistakes in the period before a decision is taken to commence an investigation (and before it commences). Clear wording is to be used in any communication to taxpayers when a decision to investigate has been made. Requests for information to enable the Commissioner to decide whether to investigate are not themselves part of an investigation.

50.  The Commissioner's practice of undertaking an audit activity after a return has been filed, such as some GST refund checks, may limit the opportunity for a taxpayer to make a pre-notification disclosure under section 141G(1)(a). Taxpayers and agents filing returns will therefore have to be aware that section 141KB may not give relief in all cases. However, if taxpayers and/or their agents can show that they have taken steps to permanently reverse or correct the tax shortfall (prior to the notification of the audit or investigation), the tax shortfall may be a temporary tax shortfall pursuant to the Commissioner's current practices. Provided that all other criteria in section 141KB(2)(a) are met, the Commissioner will exercise the discretion to cancel or not assess the UTP penalty. (Please see the discussion on temporary tax shortfalls in paragraphs 52 to 55.)

51.  The Commissioner may give notice of a pending tax audit or investigation by post. In such cases the taxpayer will be regarded as having been notified of the audit or investigation if the notice meets the requirements of section 14(8) and section 14(9).

**Temporary tax shortfall**

52.  For a UTP penalty assessed before 1 April 2006 or a UTP penalty that would otherwise be assessed on or after 1 April 2006, section 141KB(2)(a)(ii) is met if the tax position to which the UTP penalty relates has been or would be reduced by 75% for a temporary tax shortfall under section 141I(3).

53.  The term "temporary tax shortfall" is defined by section 141I(3) as follows:  
      
    
    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | A tax shortfall is a temporary tax shortfall for a return period if the Commissioner is satisfied that- |     |
    | (a) | The tax shortfall has been permanently reversed or corrected in an earlier or later return period, so that (disregarding penalties or interest) the taxpayer pays the correct amount of tax or calculates and returns the correct tax liability in respect of the item or matter that gave rise to the tax shortfall; and |
    | (b) | No tax shortfall will arise in a later return period in respect of a similar item or matter; and |
    | (c) | No arrangement exists in any return period which has the purpose or effect of creating a further related tax deferral or advantage; and |
    | (d) | The tax shortfall was permanently reversed or corrected before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation. |
    
      
    SPS _INV 231_ _Temporary Shortfall - Permanent Reversal_ sets out Inland Revenue's practice on what constitutes a temporary tax shortfall. This SPS was published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol. 11, No. 8 (September 1999) and is available on Inland Revenue's website at www.ird.govt.nz.

54.  The Commissioner considers that a tax shortfall has been permanently reversed or corrected if:
    *   it appears from the taxpayer's actions that the steps taken by the taxpayer have or will remedy the tax shortfall, or
    *   through operation of law or circumstances, the matter will reverse itself.

55.  The Commissioner's practice has been to accept that the tax shortfall is temporary if on inquiry (not being an audit or investigation) he is satisfied that steps are being taken to correct the shortfall in the next relevant return. For example, an incorrect input tax credit claimed in respect of a transaction that was zero-rated. If the tax shortfall is corrected and the tax is paid in the next GST return period, or earlier, the initial tax shortfall will be regarded as being temporary.

##### Criterion 3: the Commissioner is satisfied that it is "appropriate" to cancel or not to impose a UTP penalty

56.  The discretion under section 141KB(1) will be exercised if the Commissioner is satisfied that all three criteria in section 141KB(2)(a) are met. Pursuant to section 141KB(2)(a)(iii), the Commissioner may decline to exercise the discretion if the Commissioner is satisfied that it would not be appropriate to do so, although the circumstances in which this will arise will be rare.

57.  The legislation does not define what is meant by "appropriate". In considering whether it is appropriate to exercise the discretion under section 141KB, the Commissioner will have regard to the facts of each case, in light of the purpose of section 141KB, which is a concessionary discretion.

58.  The Commissioner will also consider the overriding obligations in section 6 to protect the integrity of the tax system and in section 6A(3) to collect the highest net revenue over time, and in particular the importance of promoting voluntary compliance by all taxpayers.

59.  The Commissioner considers that it is very important to create the right conditions for encouraging voluntary disclosure in particular and compliance in general. The following factors (not being an exhaustive list) could be relevant on a case-by-case basis in deciding whether or not to apply the discretion under section 141KB:
    *   the steps taken to rectify the incorrect tax position to which the UTP penalty relates. For example, requesting a reassessment to reflect the correct tax position and/or meeting any payments due, and
    *   whether and the extent to which the taxpayer has been assessed for similar shortfall penalties, and the nature of those penalties. If the taxpayer is consistently incurring shortfall penalties, this may illustrate the taxpayer's general approach to tax compliance, which is not consistent with the exercise of the discretion in the taxpayer's favour.

#### Taxpayers' efforts to rectify the incorrect tax position to which the UTP penalty relates

60.  It is envisaged that the taxpayer will make a voluntary disclosure of the tax shortfall as soon as practicable, and take reasonable steps to rectify the position (for example, by paying the correct amount of tax.) There are instances of this occurring before the original due date for filing. In such cases, where the other criteria of section 141KB(2)(a) are met, it can be assumed that it is appropriate to cancel or not to impose the UTP penalty.

#### Taxpayer repeatedly makes similar clear mistakes or simple oversights

61.  Section 141KB is intended to promote voluntary compliance by taxpayers. In cases when the taxpayer repeatedly makes similar clear mistakes or simple oversights, there is unlikely to be any reason to positively exercise the discretion.

62.  That is, there may be circumstances that may indicate that voluntary compliance by taxpayers in general, as well as the particular taxpayer, may not be promoted by exercise of the discretion, in particular when the mistake or oversight has occurred before, and has been drawn to the taxpayer's attention, yet the mistake or oversight has been repeated. (Generally this might also bring the matter into the realm of the shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care.)

63.  For example, a taxpayer imports a piece of machinery and pays GST to NZ Customs. In preparing the GST return, the taxpayer includes that GST paid to NZ Customs as an input tax adjustment in their return, but also includes the amount paid to their overseas supplier in their total purchases for the period - thereby claiming a GST input tax credit twice. The mistake is voluntarily disclosed and corrected. The discretion under section 141KB is applied and no UTP penalty is assessed. However, a few months later, when another piece of machinery is imported, the same mistake is made. In this second case, it cannot be presumed that because the mistake is disclosed and corrected that the Commissioner will consider it "appropriate" to apply the discretion.

64.  This is not to suggest, however, that the provisions of section 141KB should be applied only once in respect of a particular type of mistake or oversight.

65.  In some cases, it may still be appropriate for the Commissioner to cancel or not to assess a UTP penalty when the taxpayer concerned has a reasonable compliance history but has the occasional lapse - for example due to a change in staff. Sometimes there are special or unique circumstances giving rise to the tax shortfall, and the Commissioner will take this into account.

66.  Whether a taxpayer makes similar mistakes is not determined by the wider tax compliance history of the taxpayer. For example a previously non-compliant taxpayer (for example, a taxpayer convicted of knowledge and evasion offences under sections 143A and 143B) now usually meets all their tax obligations, except on this occasion, when the taxpayer makes a clear mistake that results in a UTP penalty. Provided that the other criteria of section 141KB(2)(a) are met, it is appropriate for the Commissioner to decide not to impose the UTP penalty on the taxpayer.

#### Retrospective effect of cancellation of UTP penalties assessed before 1 April 2006

67.  Pursuant to section 141KB(3), when the Commissioner cancels a UTP penalty that was assessed before 1 April 2006, the cancellation is retrospective. In other words, the cancellation has the same effective date as the date on which the UTP penalty was assessed. Thus, if the taxpayer has already paid the UTP penalty, the cancellation of the UTP penalty will result in an overpayment of tax as at that date and Inland Revenue will pay use of money interest ("UOMI").

68.  Any credit UOMI arising from the cancellation of the UTP penalty forms part of the taxpayer's income under section CC 8 of the Income Tax Act 2004. It is allocated to the income year in which the Commissioner pays the UOMI under section EF 4 of the Income Tax Act 2004.

69.  Inland Revenue will discuss with the taxpayer how the overpayment (including any late payment penalties if any) and the credit UOMI should be applied. This may include refunding the overpaid amount to the taxpayer or offsetting that amount against other outstanding tax (if any) or both.

70.  If the taxpayer has not paid the UTP penalty, the Commissioner's cancellation of the penalty under section 141KB(1) means that any late payment penalties and debit UOMI accrued on the UTP penalty will be reversed.

#### Shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care may still apply

71.  Section 141KB(4) provides that when the Commissioner decides to cancel or not to assess a UTP penalty that would otherwise be assessed but for section 141KB(1), the Commissioner is not precluded from assessing a shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care ("LORC" penalty) under section 141A.

72.  Despite section 141KB(4) there is no ability to apply a LORC penalty retrospectively. Section 141A(5) states that when a LORC penalty applies, the liability for the shortfall penalty is treated as arising on the date of the Commissioner's decision to cancel or not to assess the UTP penalty under section 141KB(1).

73.  Please refer to Interpretation Statement _IS0053 titled Shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care_ (which was published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol. 17, No. 9 (November 2005) and is available on Inland Revenue's website at www.ird.govt.nz) for further details on Inland Revenue's practice in assessing LORC penalties.

#### Taxpayer's right to dispute the Commissioner's decision under section 141KB(1)

74.  The exercise of the Commissioner's discretion under section 141KB(1) is a "disputable decision" as defined in section 3(1). Thus, if a taxpayer disagrees with the Commissioner's decision not to cancel or wishes to dispute a decision to assess a UTP penalty, the taxpayer may issue a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) to the Commissioner under section 89D(3). The NOPA must be issued within the applicable response period. (Please refer to _SPS 05/04 Disputes resolution process commenced by taxpayers_. This SPS was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 17, No. 3 (April 2005) and is available on Inland Revenue's website at www.ird.govt.nz).

#### Examples

75.  The following examples are included for illustrative purposes only. They illustrate circumstances when the Commissioner will exercise his discretion positively under section 141KB.

##### Example 1 Unrelated third party mistake

76.  Mr X is a property developer registered for GST on a two-monthly invoice basis. Mr X purchases commercial property on 1 March 2004 and settlement occurs on 31 March 2004. The vendor's solicitor prepares the tax invoice for the transaction and makes a mistake in calculating the GST amount on the tax invoice. The tax invoice is forwarded to Mr X's accountant who prepares the GST return including the incorrect GST amount. The accountant has no direct involvement in Mr X's property development business apart from preparing his GST returns. The accountant forwards the GST return to Mr X to sign and file. Mr X is required to pay GST for the period ending 31 March 2004 as a result of two commercial properties he has sold during the period. The mistake in the tax invoice is not detected and Mr X sends the GST return to Inland Revenue. Mr X discovers the mistake the following week when he is reconciling his bank statements for the period. Mr X immediately makes a voluntary disclosure to Inland Revenue. The Commissioner assesses a UTP penalty on Mr X.

77.  Mr X makes a written request to the Commissioner to exercise his discretion under section 141KB of the TAA.

**Application of section 141KB**

78.  Mr X has made a voluntary disclosure prior to any notification of a pending audit or investigation.

79.  In the Commissioner's opinion, the unacceptable tax position taken by Mr X was made as a result of a clear mistake in his GST return. This mistake resulted from a mistake made by an unrelated third party in calculating the GST amount on the tax invoice for the sale of the commercial property.

80.  The Commissioner would be satisfied that it is appropriate in this case for Mr X to not be liable to pay a UTP penalty.

81.  Based on the above circumstances, the Commissioner would cancel the UTP penalty because he is satisfied that the three criteria in section 141KB are met. The cancellation would be effective on the same date as the UTP penalty assessment was made.

##### Example 2 Clear mistake by omission

82.  The ABC Trust (ABC) sold some farm machinery through an auctioneer in September 2004. GST was charged on the sale. ABC accounts for GST on the payments basis and settlement occurred in September 2004 when the money was deposited in ABC's bank by the auctioneer, but a statement from the auctioneer was not received until 22 October 2004. ABC had filed its two-monthly GST return to 30 September 2004 on 20 October 2004 but omitted the sale of the farm machinery.

83.  ABC made a voluntary disclosure as to the omission on 29 October 2004 and at the same time (on the due date) made the correct payment of GST.

84.  Inland Revenue assessed a UTP penalty. The taxpayer has written to the Commissioner requesting the penalty be cancelled under section 141KB.

**Application of section 141KB**

85.  ABC has made a voluntary disclosure of the tax shortfall and also made payment of the GST by the due date.

86.  In the Commissioner's opinion, the omission of the sale of the farm machinery was the result of a clear mistake or simple oversight due to the delay in receiving the auctioneer's statement.

87.  The Commissioner is satisfied that it is appropriate for the taxpayer to not be liable to pay a UTP penalty and would exercise the discretion under section 141KB.

88.  Based on the above circumstances, the Commissioner would cancel the UTP penalty because he is satisfied that the three criteria in section 141KB are met. The cancellation would be effective on the same date as the UTP penalty assessment was made.

Writing off outstanding tax (May 2006) (WITHDRAWN)
==================================================

Withdrawn statement SPS 06/02 - Writing off outstanding tax. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

In the item titled SPS 06/02 Writing off outstanding tax published under the section "Standard practice statements" in the Tax Information Bulletin, Volume 18, No 5 (June 2006), pp 55-64, please note that paragraph 63 is incorrect.

Paragraph 63 of the standard practice statement should read:

63.  If Inland Revenue considers that recovery of part, or all of the outstanding tax would not represent an efficient use of administrative resources, then pursuant to section 176(2)(a), the outstanding tax would be written off.

Paragraph 63 in the attached SPS has now been corrected.

### Application

3.  This SPS applies to all write-offs of outstanding tax from 10 May 2006. It replaces _SPS RDC 620 Writing off tax debt_ originally published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002) and other past Inland Revenue practices.  
      
    
4.  This SPS does not apply to financial support as defined in section 2(1) of the Child Support Act 1991 (ie child support payable and/or domestic maintenance payable under that Act) or to student loan repayment obligations. However, this SPS applies to an amount payable by a payer, as defined in section 153 of the Child Support Act 1991, under Part X of that Act.  
      
    
5.  Please refer to _SPS 05/11 Instalment arrangements for payment of tax debt_ for further details on Inland Revenue's practice on providing relief under sections 177, 177A and 177B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). The SPS was published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 17, No 10 (December 2005) and is available on Inland Revenue's website at www.ird.govt.nz.  
      
    
6.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the TAA.

#### Summary

7.  Taxpayers who cannot afford to pay their tax may apply to Inland Revenue for financial relief under section 177(1).  
      
    
8.  Inland Revenue will negotiate with taxpayers to determine as soon as possible whether or not the taxpayers are eligible for financial relief and to what extent. Where Inland Revenue is unable to make an immediate decision on granting relief, the taxpayers may be required to provide additional relevant information (such as financial information) and will be required to file outstanding returns in support of the application.  
      
    
9.  Inland Revenue may write off amounts that cannot be recovered. Furthermore, Inland Revenue must write off outstanding tax due to:  
      
    *   bankruptcy, or  
          
        
    *   liquidation, or  
          
        
    *   when a taxpayer's estate has been distributed.  
          
        
10.  An amount written off may be reinstated if:  
      
    *   Inland Revenue receives, by operation of law, additional funds in respect of a taxpayer after the taxpayer becomes bankrupt, is liquidated or if additional funds due to the taxpayer's estate are discovered after the taxpayer's estate has been distributed (section 177C(4)), or  
          
        
    *   the outstanding tax was written off on the grounds of serious hardship and the taxpayer for whom the outstanding tax was written off is adjudged bankrupt or placed in liquidation within a year of the amount being written off (section 177C(7)(a) and (b)), or  
          
        
    *   the outstanding tax was written off on the basis of false or misleading information provided by the taxpayer (section 177C(7)(c)).  
          
        
11.  Inland Revenue cannot write off outstanding tax if the taxpayer was liable to pay a shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position under section 141D(2) or evasion under section 141E(1) or a similar act in relation to the outstanding tax.  
      
    
12.  Subject to Inland Revenue's power to reverse a write-off under section 177C, Inland Revenue now writes off outstanding tax permanently. Inland Revenue will not provisionally write off outstanding tax.

#### Background

13.  Since the publication of SPS _RDC 620 Writing off tax debt_, sections 14, 177(1), 177A(3) and 177C(6) have been amended. Sections 14B, 177C(5B) and 177C(5C) have also been inserted into the TAA.  
      
    
14.  Furthermore, the High Court decisions in _Raynel v CIR_ (2004) 21 NZTC 18,583, _Clarke & Money v CIR_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,165, _McLean v CIR_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,231, _W v CIR_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,602 and _Rogerson v CIR_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,260 have clarified how Inland Revenue may exercise the discretion under sections 177(1) and 177C and explained their relationship with sections 6 and 6A.  
      
    
15.  This SPS sets out Inland Revenue's standard practice in light of these legislative changes and the recent case law.

#### Legislation

16.  The relevant legislative provisions are:  
      
    *   section LB 2 of the Income Tax Act 2004, and  
          
        
    *   sections 14B, 138E, 139B, 139BA, 141D, 141E, 174AA, 176, 177, 177A to 177C.  
        

#### Discussion

#### Maximising recovery of outstanding tax

17.  Inland Revenue has a duty to maximise the recovery of outstanding tax from a taxpayer pursuant to section 176(1). Inland Revenue is therefore obliged to compare the value of the likely recovery from accepting taxpayers' proposals with any other viable options for recovery. In some cases, it is clear which option will maximise recovery. In other cases, there may be options that could yield similar returns. Accordingly, it is necessary to determine which option will maximise recovery.

#### The relationship between sections 6(1), 6A and 176(1)

18.  While Inland Revenue must maximise recovery of outstanding tax from taxpayers, this duty is subject to the overriding obligations in section 6 to protect the integrity of the tax system and section 6A to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law.  
      
    
19.  In _Raynel v CIR_, Randerson J referred to the following general principles in respect of sections 6 and 6A:  
      
    *   Section 6A(3) is to prevail over other provisions in the Inland Revenue Acts including section 176.  
          
        
    *   The obligation to collect the highest net revenue is not absolute. Inland Revenue is only required to take steps to recover that are practicable and lawful.  
          
        
    *   Inland Revenue is required to have regard to the resources available, the importance of promoting compliance (especially voluntary compliance) by all taxpayers, and the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers.  
          
        
    *   Sections 6 and 6A(3)(b) emphasise that there is a broader public interest in the integrity of the tax system and in ensuring that taxpayers meet their obligations.  
          
        
20.  Section 176(1) is to be read subject to section 6 and section 6A(3). Section 176(1) does not relieve Inland Revenue officers of their duties under section 6(1) to use their best endeavours to protect "the integrity of the tax system" and under section 6A to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law. Although Inland Revenue will consider each application for financial relief on its own merits, the duty to protect the integrity of the tax system will in certain cases require Inland Revenue to take action that (in the short term) might not be considered to maximise recovery of the revenue.

21.  When a negotiated agreement for payment of all or part of the outstanding tax would yield more than bankruptcy or liquidation action, Inland Revenue will usually enter into the negotiated agreement. Any amount not recoverable under the agreement will be written off at the time the agreement is entered into. However, as Randerson J noted in _Raynel v CIR_ Inland Revenue may take enforcement actions against the taxpayer and may not enter into a negotiated agreement. This would be done, for example to preserve the integrity of the tax system and promote voluntary compliance by other taxpayers. This may be where there is a "flagrant and on-going failure to comply with the taxpayer's obligations and where recovery is dubious or is likely to result only in a relatively minor proportion of the overall debt being recovered."  
      
    
22.  For example, a taxpayer has outstanding tax of $100,000 and makes an offer of $75,000 to settle the arrears over a period of three years. Inland Revenue considers that bankruptcy would only yield $50,000 and that there are no other viable avenues for recovery. In this instance, Inland Revenue would consider writing off $25,000 and entering into an instalment arrangement over three years for $75,000.  
      
    

#### The financial relief application

23.  Taxpayers may apply for financial relief pursuant to section 177(1). The financial relief may be in the form of:  
      
    
    *   an instalment arrangement for all of the outstanding tax, or  
          
        
    *   an instalment arrangement for part of the outstanding tax and a write-off of the remaining balance (a partial write-off), or  
          
        
    *   a write-off of all of the outstanding tax.  
        
    
    (Please also refer to _SPS 05/11 Instalment arrangements for the payment of tax debt._)  
     
    
24.  Taxpayers can apply by telephone or in writing (including by facsimile and secure email on Inland Revenue's Online Correspondence Service) for a write-off of outstanding tax on the grounds of serious hardship.  
      
    
25.  In some cases, Inland Revenue will require taxpayers to apply for financial relief by notice in writing under section 177(2). For example, where the taxpayer's serious hardship is caused by a number of factors which require evidence in writing or where the taxpayer has related parties, such as a partnership or company, that have outstanding tax to pay. Pursuant to section 14B, where taxpayers are required to apply for financial relief by giving notice in writing to Inland Revenue, the taxpayers may do so by:  
      
    *   delivering the notice in person to an Inland Revenue office, or  
          
        
    *   issuing the notice by facsimile to an Inland Revenue office, or  
          
        
    *   sending an email on Inland Revenue's Online Correspondence Service, or  
          
        
    *   sending the notice to an Inland Revenue office by post.  
          
        

#### Considering the taxpayer's application

26.  Upon receipt of an application for writing off outstanding tax, Inland Revenue may:  
      
    1.  Accept the taxpayer's request.  
          
        Once the request is accepted and outstanding tax is written off, the taxpayer will receive written notification. This will include:  
          
        
        *   the tax type(s), the relevant period(s) and the amount(s) of outstanding tax written off, and  
              
            
        *   the remaining net losses and/or excess imputation credits carried forward, after these have been extinguished, and/or  
              
            
        *   the outstanding tax under an instalment arrangement plus interest, when a taxpayer is granted a partial write-off of outstanding tax and the balance remaining is placed under an instalment arrangement.  
              
            
        
        However, the written notification will not include the exact amount of interest payable by the taxpayer under the instalment arrangement. This is because the total amount of interest payable may vary with the interest rate and/or increased instalment payments during the course of the arrangement.  
          
        When a taxpayer proposes to make a lump sum payment in full settlement of outstanding tax on a specific future date, Inland Revenue will notify the taxpayer in writing of the total amount of outstanding tax and interest that the taxpayer must pay on that date.  
          
        
    2.  Seek further information from the taxpayer.  
          
        When considering an application for serious hardship, Inland Revenue must assess the taxpayer's financial circumstances based on the information provided. Inland Revenue may ask taxpayers to provide additional information and will also require them to file any outstanding returns.  
          
        Inland Revenue must, under section 6(1), have regard to protecting the integrity of the tax system to ensure fairness to all taxpayers.  
          
        If additional information is required, Inland Revenue will allow the taxpayer reasonable further time to comply with the request. However, if the taxpayer provides the required information outside the time allowed, the receipt of the information will be treated as a new request for financial relief.  
          
        For example, a taxpayer has outstanding income tax for the 2004 tax year. The taxpayer applies for outstanding tax to be written off on the grounds of serious hardship. The taxpayer's income tax return for the 2004 tax year shows a net loss carried forward. However, the 2003 income tax return is yet to be filed. Inland Revenue may require the taxpayer to provide additional information such as the calculation of the net loss and to file the income tax return in the 2003 tax year before accepting the taxpayer's request for financial relief.  
          
        
    3.  Make a counter offer.  
          
        When a taxpayer requests a write-off of outstanding tax, Inland Revenue may make a counter offer to the taxpayer. This will occur when Inland Revenue considers the taxpayer can afford to make a lump sum payment or enter into an instalment arrangement for part of the outstanding tax and therefore a partial write-off is more appropriate.  
          
        
    4.  Decline the taxpayer's request.  
          
        Inland Revenue may decline to accept a taxpayer's request for a write-off if it is considered that the taxpayer is able to pay the outstanding tax in full. For example, a taxpayer has term deposits or other investments or the ability to borrow sufficient funds to pay the outstanding tax.  
          
        Inland Revenue may also decline to accept a taxpayer's request for a write-off if the taxpayer has not provided sufficient information to support their request.  
          
        Where Inland Revenue declines the taxpayer's request for financial relief, both initial and incremental late payment penalties will be imposed and interest will accrue as if the taxpayer had not made the request.

#### Instances where Inland Revenue must write off outstanding tax

27.  Inland Revenue must write off amounts that cannot be recovered from a natural person due to bankruptcy.  
      
    
28.  When a person is bankrupt, Inland Revenue will write off outstanding tax that cannot be recovered upon receipt of:  
      
    
    *   a final dividend, or  
          
        
    *   advice from the Official Assignee that there will be no dividend to Inland Revenue,  
          
        
    
    provided that Inland Revenue does not challenge the Official Assignee's advice. Furthermore, pursuant to section 177C(2)(b), Inland Revenue must write off a company's outstanding tax that cannot be recovered if the company is in liquidation. Please refer to paragraph 54 for more details.  
      
    
29.  When an estate has been distributed, Inland Revenue must write off the outstanding tax upon receipt of confirmation from the administrator that the estate has been distributed.

#### Writing off outstanding tax of taxpayers (being natural persons) due to serious hardship

30.  Taxpayers (being natural persons) applying for financial relief on the grounds of serious hardship pursuant to section 177(1) should explain why recovery would place them in serious hardship. The application should include supporting financial information.  
      
    
31.  Written applications will not be required when it is evident from information already available that recovery would place the taxpayers in serious hardship. This may happen where taxpayers request relief by way of an instalment arrangement but an examination of the information obtained reveals that repayment, even by way of an instalment arrangement, would place the taxpayers in serious hardship.  
      
    
32.  Inland Revenue will consider each application made pursuant to section 177(1) on its own merits, subject to the overriding obligations in section 6 to protect the integrity of the tax system and section 6A to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law.  
      
    
33.  Section 177A defines "serious hardship". In order for Inland Revenue to determine if an individual would be placed in serious hardship, Inland Revenue will request relevant details of the person's financial position. These may include and are not limited to:  
      
    *   details of income and expenditure,  
          
        
    *   assets and liabilities,  
          
        
    *   a 12-month cash flow projection,  
          
        
    *   asset valuations,  
          
        
    *   a statement of financial performance,  
          
        
    *   a statement of financial position,  
          
        
    *   a list of debtors and creditors.  
          
        
34.  Pursuant to section 177A(1)(a) in considering whether taxpayers, being natural persons, will be placed in serious hardship, Inland Revenue will have regard to the following:  
      
    *   whether the taxpayers will be unable to meet minimum living expenses according to normal community standards, or  
          
        
    *   the cost of medical treatment for an illness or injury of the taxpayers or the taxpayers' dependants, or  
          
        
    *   a serious illness suffered by the taxpayers or the taxpayers' dependants, or  
          
        
    *   the cost of education for the taxpayers' dependants.  
          
        
35.  Whether a person is a taxpayer's "dependant" for the purposes of paragraph 34 will be determined on a case-by-case basis. In determining dependency issues, Inland Revenue will consider:  
      
    *   whether the person is dependent on the taxpayer for financial support, and  
          
        
    *   what degree of financial support is provided by the taxpayer, and  
          
        
    *   to what extent providing financial support affects the taxpayer's ability to meet minimum living expenses according to normal community standards.  
          
        
36.  Pursuant to section 176(2)(b), Inland Revenue may not recover outstanding tax to the extent that the recovery would place taxpayers, being natural persons, in serious hardship. However, where taxpayers apply for financial relief and their financial difficulties are a result of their obligation to pay outstanding tax, the taxpayers will not meet the grounds for serious hardship under section 177A(1)(a). This is because serious hardship does not include financial difficulties that arise from the taxpayer's obligation to pay tax under section 177A(1)(b). The serious hardship rules should not be regarded as a means of avoiding the obligation to pay tax. To allow otherwise would compromise the integrity of the tax system.  
      
    
37.  Pursuant to section 177A(1)(b), serious hardship does not include financial difficulties that arise because:  
      
    *   the taxpayers are obligated to pay tax, or  
          
        
    *   the taxpayers may become bankrupt, or  
          
        
    *   the taxpayers' or the taxpayers' dependants' social activities and entertainment may be limited, or  
          
        
    *   the taxpayers are unable to afford goods or services that are expensive or of a high quality or standard according to normal community standards.  
          
        
38.  Regarding the last bullet point in paragraph 37, while normal community standards must be considered in the context of the wider community of all New Zealand, the actual expenditure of taxpayers in different parts of the country may vary due to, for example higher or lower housing costs, commodity or travel expenses. When calculating taxpayers' minimum living expenses, Inland Revenue will consider the costs of food, heating and accommodation in accordance with normal community standards based on information provided on a geographical basis by Statistics New Zealand.  
      
    
39.  In some situations, a decision on financial relief can be made immediately. In others, further information may be required. Pursuant to section 177(4), taxpayers must provide the information within 20 working days (although a longer period may be allowed by Inland Revenue). Incremental late payment penalties will not be imposed under section 139B(2B) during this period, provided financial relief is granted. If taxpayers request the write-off before the payment due date, the 4% initial late payment penalty under section 139B(2A)(b) will also not be imposed. However, interest will continue to accrue on a daily basis. (Please refer to _SPS 05/10 Remission of penalties and interest_, which was published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 17, No 9 (November 2005) and is available on Inland Revenue's website at www.ird.govt.nz.)  
      
    
40.  In some instances, taxpayers may be able to pay part of the outstanding tax, but recovery of the full amount would place the taxpayer in serious hardship. In these cases, Inland Revenue will negotiate a lump sum payment or an instalment arrangement with the taxpayers and write off the irrecoverable amount. The irrecoverable amount will be written off at the time the instalment arrangement is entered into.  
      
    
41.  For example, a taxpayer has outstanding tax of $8,000 and has been putting funds aside to clear this amount by the due date. However, at the due date they have only managed to save $2,000 towards this amount. Due to the taxpayer's financial circumstances, any payment over and above the $2,000 they have saved would cause difficulty in meeting their day-to-day living expenses. Inland Revenue accepts the lump sum payment of $2,000 and writes off the balance on the grounds of serious hardship as it is not feasible for Inland Revenue to enter into an instalment arrangement for payment of the outstanding $6,000.

#### Factors relevant to the consideration of financial relief

42.  Inland Revenue may have regard to a number of factors when considering applications for financial relief. In _Clarke & Money v CIR_, Priestley J referred to the following factors as relevant to the exercise of the discretion under section 177:  
      
    1.  the circumstances which led to the taxpayers' outstanding tax,  
          
        
    2.  the nature and extent of the taxpayers' co-operation and negotiating stance,  
          
        
    3.  the speed with which the taxpayers have provided requested information, and the extent of that information, and  
          
        
    4.  Inland Revenue's duties under sections 6 and 6A.

43.  In _Raynel v CIR_, Randerson J noted that where there has been a flagrant and on-going failure to comply with the taxpayers' obligations and where recovery is dubious or is likely to result only in a relatively minor proportion of the overall outstanding tax being recovered, Inland Revenue may be justified in initiating or continuing enforcement proceedings to secure the wider interests identified by the legislation.  
      
    
44.  In _Rogerson v CIR_, Potter J held that Inland Revenue is entitled to consider the whole history of compliance and non-compliance by the taxpayer in the context of the obligation to preserve the integrity of the tax system.  
      
    
45.  Pursuant to section 138E(1)(e)(iv), there is no statutory right to challenge or object to any decision of Inland Revenue to grant or cancel relief. However, if taxpayers do not agree with Inland Revenue's decision not to grant relief, the taxpayers may request that the decision be reviewed by the officer involved or their superior officer. The decision may also be reviewed by the Ombudsman or by way of judicial review.

#### Net present value calculation

46.  Whilst unnecessary in most circumstances, one method of distinguishing between alternative repayment options is to apply a net present value calculation.  
      
    
47.  A net present value calculation recognises the time value of money, as well as the probability of payment (risk). The proposed payments are discounted for the time value of money and for the likelihood of receiving the money. Inland Revenue needs to determine the amount, date, and probability of each payment and apply an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate is calculated from published government stock rates.  
      
    
48.  Inland Revenue uses a calculation that multiplies the amount of payment by the probability of payment (for risk), divided by the discount factor appropriate to the term (for interest).  
      
    
49.  Please refer to the appendix to _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 6, No 14 (June 1995) for:  
      
    *   the methodologies for determining the discount rate, probabilities of payment and net present value, and  
          
        
    *   examples of assessments of the probabilities of payment being made in particular circumstances.  
          
        

#### Writing off a company's outstanding tax

50.  Serious hardship generally applies to natural persons only. A company cannot apply for outstanding tax to be written off on the grounds of serious hardship. However, Inland Revenue may take into account whether the recovery of outstanding tax would place a shareholder who owns, or two shareholders who jointly own, 50% or more of the shares in a company or a shareholder-employee of a close company in serious hardship.  
      
    
51.  A "close company" for these purposes means a company which has five or fewer natural persons whose voting interest(s) or market value interest(s) in the company exceed 50% and is not a special corporate entity.  
      
    
52.  Pursuant to section 177C(1), Inland Revenue may also write off a company's outstanding tax if it is consistent with the duty to maximise recovery under section 176(1), subject to the overriding obligations in section 6 to protect the integrity of the tax system and section 6A to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law. In some cases, Inland Revenue may enter into an instalment arrangement for part of the company's outstanding tax and then write off the remaining balance.  
      
    
53.  For example, a close company owes outstanding tax of $300,000 and its only asset is a debit balance in the principal shareholder's current account of $300,000. If the company were placed into liquidation, the $300,000 in the current account would be called up. The shareholder's personal assets are a house valued at $290,000 and a car valued at $7,000. Inland Revenue recognises that any action taken to liquidate this company could place the shareholder in serious hardship. The company agrees to pay to Inland Revenue the sum of $220,000, borrowed against the principal shareholder's home. The balance of the outstanding tax will be written off, as collection of the amount would cause the shareholder serious hardship.  
      
    
54.  When a company is in liquidation, Inland Revenue will write off outstanding tax that cannot be recovered upon receipt of:  
      
    *   a final distribution, or  
          
        
    *   advice from the liquidator that there will be no distribution to Inland Revenue,  
          
        provided that Inland Revenue does not challenge the liquidator's advice.

#### Struck-off companies

55.  Inland Revenue officers may discuss with a person who was, immediately before a company was removed from the New Zealand register at the Companies Office (commonly known as "struck-off"), a director or authorised officer of the company, matters relating to outstanding returns and tax arising prior to the company being struck off.  
      
    
56.  Inland Revenue will consider an application for writing off outstanding tax by a shareholder, director or authorised officer of a struck-off company after they have restored the company's New Zealand register at the Companies Office.  
      
    
57.  Inland Revenue cannot consider an application for financial relief of a struck-off company prior to the restoration of the company's New Zealand register. This is because the struck-off company ceases to be a person and therefore is not a taxpayer when it has been removed from the New Zealand register. In some cases, Inland Revenue may restore the company to the New Zealand register for purposes such as recovering outstanding tax or prosecuting company directors for failing to account for PAYE.  
      
    
58.  In other cases, Inland Revenue may not restore the company to the New Zealand register. Inland Revenue may apply to the High Court for an appointment of a liquidator to liquidate the struck-off company under section 327 of the Companies Act 1993. For example, Inland Revenue may do so even if there is no prospect of recovering the outstanding tax from the struck-off company. (Please refer to paragraph 54 regarding writing off the outstanding tax of a liquidated company).  
      
    
59.  However, Inland Revenue may also consider a write-off of a struck-off company's outstanding tax that cannot be recovered pursuant to section 177C subject to the overriding obligations in section 6 to protect the integrity of the tax system and section 6A to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law.

#### Writing off a trust's outstanding tax

60.  A trust cannot apply for outstanding tax to be written off on the grounds of serious hardship pursuant to section 177(1)(a) either itself and/or by its trustees. Serious hardship generally applies to natural persons only and the Commissioner generally considers that a trustee of a trust is not acting as a natural person in that capacity.  
      
    
61.  However, Inland Revenue may consider writing off a trust's outstanding tax pursuant to section 177C(1) if that tax cannot be recovered. In determining whether a trust's outstanding tax is irrecoverable, Inland Revenue will also consider whether the trustees can satisfy the outstanding tax in their capacity as trustees or personally. If Inland Revenue cannot recover the outstanding tax from the trust or its trustees, the outstanding tax will be considered as irrecoverable for the purposes of section 177C(1).  
      
    
62.  Inland Revenue will exercise its discretion to write off under section 177C(1) on a case-by-case basis and subject to the obligations in section 6 to protect the integrity of the tax system and section 6A to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law.

#### Inefficient use of Inland Revenue's resources

63.  If Inland Revenue considers that recovery of part, or all of the outstanding tax would not represent an efficient use of administrative resources, then pursuant to section 176(2)(a), the outstanding tax would be written off.  
      
    
64.  This is consistent with Inland Revenue's duty pursuant to section 6A(3) to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law having regard to the resources available to Inland Revenue.  
      
    
65.  However, taxpayers cannot require that outstanding tax be written off simply because they consider that collection would result in an inefficient use of Inland Revenue's resources. The provision of relief under section 176(2)(a) is discretionary and acknowledges that Inland Revenue has limited resources to collect outstanding tax and, in some instances, the cost of collection may be higher than the outstanding tax. A decision to write off on the basis that recovery would represent an inefficient use of Inland Revenue's resources will be made on a case-by-case basis. Again, pursuant to section 6A(3)(b), Inland Revenue will consider the effect of the proposed write-off on overall compliance, from an efficiency perspective.  
      
    

#### Writing off small amounts of outstanding tax

66.  Inland Revenue may permanently write off outstanding tax under section 174AA(a) where the balance of the tax payable is not more than $20. In exercising its discretion Inland Revenue may consider the factors referred to in this SPS.  
      
    
67.  Inland Revenue can only reverse a write-off or reinstate outstanding tax under section 177C. Inland Revenue will not reinstate outstanding tax written off under section 174AA(a).

#### Net losses and excess imputation credits

68.  From the 2005-06 income year onwards, pursuant to section LB 2(3B) and (3C) of the Income Tax Act 2004, a taxpayer, who is not:  
      
    
    1.  a company,  
          
        
    2.  a trustee (other than the Maori trustee),  
          
        
    3.  a Maori authority, or  
          
        
    4.  a taxpayer whose imputation credits giving rise to the credit of tax is category A income of the trustee of a group investment fund,  
          
        
    
    must carry any excess imputation credits forward. In determining such a taxpayer's application for writing off outstanding tax, Inland Revenue will consider whether the taxpayer has net losses and/or excess imputation credits carried forward from a previous year.  
      
    
69.  Pursuant to section 177C(5), if Inland Revenue writes off outstanding tax for a taxpayer with net losses, Inland Revenue must extinguish all or part of the taxpayer's net losses, by dividing the amount written off by 33% and reducing the net losses by that amount.  
      
    
70.  If the taxpayers have excess imputation credits carried forward from a previous year, then pursuant to section 177C(5B) all or part of these tax credits will be extinguished on a dollar-for-dollar basis when outstanding tax is written off.  
      
    
71.  When the taxpayers (except those listed in paragraph 72) have both net losses and excess imputation credits carried forward from a previous year, the net losses will be extinguished first. It should be noted that the taxpayers' net losses and/or excess imputation credits can be extinguished even if the outstanding tax written off is of a type other than income tax.  
      
    
72.  For a taxpayer who is:  
      
    
    1.  a company,  
          
        
    2.  a trustee (other than the Maori trustee),  
          
        
    3.  a Maori authority, or  
          
        
    4.  a taxpayer whose imputation credits giving rise to the credit of tax is category A income of the trustee of a group investment fund,  
          
        
    
    only net losses will be extinguished if the taxpayer applies for writing off outstanding tax and Inland Revenue accepts the application.  
      
    
73.  Taxpayers must file all earlier outstanding tax returns (ie outstanding returns relating to tax years prior to the tax year in which the outstanding tax arises) before their application for a write-off of outstanding tax will be considered. Any net losses and/or excess imputation credits will not be extinguished under section 177C(5) and (5B) until all outstanding tax returns are filed. Inland Revenue may then calculate the net losses using the taxpayers' most recently filed income tax return.  
      
    
74.  For example, in July 2005, a taxpayer applies for writing off their outstanding income tax for the 2005 tax year. The taxpayer's 2002 income tax return shows net losses carried forward to the 2003 tax year. However, the 2003 and 2004 income tax returns remain outstanding. The outstanding tax will not be written off and the net losses will not be extinguished until the 2003 and 2004 income tax returns are filed.

#### Instances where the Inland Revenue cannot write off outstanding tax

75.  Pursuant to section 177C(3), Inland Revenue cannot write off outstanding tax if the taxpayer was liable to pay, in relation to that outstanding tax, a shortfall penalty for, either taking an abusive tax position under section 141D(2) or evasion under section 141E(1) or a similar act. This means that recovery action to collect both the shortfall penalty and the underlying tax will continue even if recovery would place a taxpayer in serious hardship.  
      
    
76.  Inland Revenue will distinguish between outstanding tax arising from such assessments and other arrears so that part of the taxpayer's total outstanding tax may be written off if the required criteria are met, leaving the tax to which the shortfall penalty applies and the penalty itself outstanding. The outstanding tax that cannot be written off due to section 177C(3) also includes late filing and payment penalties imposed, and use-of-money interest accruing, on the underlying tax that was subject to the shortfall penalty for evasion or taking an abusive tax position.  
      
    
77.  Inland Revenue must protect the integrity of the tax system while also trying to maximise recovery of outstanding tax. (Please refer to paragraphs 18 to 22 for the discussion on the relationship between sections 6(1), 6A and 176(1).) Where section 177C(3) applies, Inland Revenue will consider other options for recovering the underlying tax and shortfall penalty, such as an instalment arrangement if negotiated by the taxpayer. Please refer to _SPS 05/11 Instalment arrangements for the payment of tax debt._  
      
    
78.  For example, a taxpayer has outstanding GST for the 31 March 2004 return period and also has outstanding income tax for the 2004 tax year including a shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position. In this instance, where the criteria for serious hardship are met, the outstanding GST can be written off. However, the outstanding income tax will not be written off, regardless of whether recovery will cause serious hardship.  
      
    
79.  The application of section 177C(3) is suspended when taxpayers challenge the imposition of a shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position or evasion in a hearing authority. This is because the taxpayers are not liable to pay the shortfall penalty during the challenge. However, Inland Revenue will not consider writing off the taxpayers' outstanding tax until after the hearing authority has ruled on the issue of the imposition of the shortfall penalty.

#### Reinstatement of outstanding tax

80.  Pursuant to section 177C(4) Inland Revenue may only reinstate all or part of outstanding tax that has been written off if Inland Revenue receives, by operation of law, additional funds in respect of the taxpayer:  
      
    *   after the taxpayer has become bankrupt or has been liquidated, or  
          
        
    *   if additional funds due to the taxpayer's estate are discovered after the taxpayer's estate has been distributed.  
          
        
81.  For example, Inland Revenue writes off a bankrupt taxpayer's outstanding tax under section 177C(2) after the Official Assignee declares that no dividend will be payable and closes the file. The Official Assignee subsequently discovers a previously unknown bank account with a credit balance. The Official Assignee makes a dividend payment to the creditors. In this instance Inland Revenue will reinstate the outstanding tax under section 177C(4) and credit the dividend received to the taxpayer's account.

#### Reversal of write-off

82.  In addition to section 177C(4), section 177C(7) allows Inland Revenue to reverse a write-off in the following circumstances:  
      
    *   the taxpayer, being a natural person, declares bankruptcy within a year of the outstanding tax being written off on the grounds of serious hardship.  
          
        
    *   the taxpayer, being a natural person, is subject to bankruptcy proceedings brought by a creditor within a year of the outstanding tax being written off on the grounds of serious hardship.  
          
        
    *   the taxpayer, being a company, is liquidated within a year of the outstanding tax being written off on the grounds of serious hardship.  
          
        
    *   the taxpayer, being a company, is in the course of being liquidated within a year of the outstanding tax being written off on the grounds of serious hardship.  
          
        
    *   the outstanding tax was written off on the basis of false or misleading information provided by the taxpayer, for example, where a taxpayer has unreasonably overstated outgoings or understated income or where a taxpayer has a vested right to income or assets of a trust, and this was not disclosed to Inland Revenue.

#### Standard Practice

83.  Upon receipt of taxpayers' applications for writing off outstanding tax, Inland Revenue has four options:  
      
    1.  accept the taxpayers' request, or  
          
        
    2.  seek further information from the taxpayers, or  
          
        
    3.  make a counter offer, or  
          
        
    4.  decline the request.  
          
        
84.  Inland Revenue will take into account the following factors when considering taxpayers' applications for a write-off of outstanding tax:  
      
    1.  Whether the proposal will place the taxpayers, being natural persons, in serious hardship.  
          
        
    2.  Whether the value of the taxpayers' proposals when compared to other options would maximise the recovery of outstanding tax from the taxpayers.  
          
        
    3.  Whether the taxpayers are in a position to pay all or part of the outstanding tax immediately.  
          
        
    4.  Whether the taxpayers have filed all required returns.  
          
        
    5.  Whether other relevant factors exist (such as those identified in paragraphs 42 to 45).  
          
        
85.  When considering taxpayers' applications, Inland Revenue may require the taxpayers to provide additional information within 20 working days (or such longer period that may be allowed by Inland Revenue). This may include financial information and will include the filing of any outstanding returns.  
      
    
86.  Taxpayers must provide the required information within the allowed timeframe. Information received outside the allowed timeframe will be treated as a new request for financial relief. If Inland Revenue subsequently declines to grant financial relief to the taxpayers, both initial and incremental late payment penalties will be imposed and interest will accrue as if the request for financial relief had not been made.  
      
    
87.  Inland Revenue may permanently write off outstanding tax under section 174AA(a) where the balance of the tax payable is not more than $20.00. In exercising the discretion Inland Revenue may consider the factors referred to in this SPS.  
      
    
88.  Inland Revenue cannot write off outstanding tax if the taxpayers were liable to pay a shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position under section 141D(2) or evasion under section 141E(1) or a similar act in relation to the outstanding tax.  
      
    
89.  A trust cannot apply for outstanding tax to be written off on the grounds of serious hardship pursuant to section 177(1)(a) either itself and/or by its trustees. Serious hardship applies to natural persons only and the Commissioner generally considers that a trustee of a trust is not acting as a natural person in that capacity.  
      
    
90.  However, Inland Revenue may consider writing off a trust's outstanding tax pursuant to section 177C(1) if that tax cannot be recovered. In determining whether a trust's outstanding tax is irrecoverable, Inland Revenue will also consider whether the trustees can satisfy the outstanding tax in their capacity as trustees or personally. If Inland Revenue cannot recover the outstanding tax from the trust or its trustees, the outstanding tax will be considered as irrecoverable for the purposes of section 177C(1).  
      
    
91.  When writing off outstanding tax, Inland Revenue must extinguish all or part of any net losses carried forward from the taxpayers' most recent income tax return and/or any excess imputation credits.  
      
    
92.  Where the taxpayers (except those listed in paragraph 72 of the SPS) have both net losses and excess imputation credits carried forward from a previous year, the net losses will be extinguished first.  
      
    
93.  Taxpayers must file all earlier outstanding tax returns before their applications for a write-off of outstanding tax will be considered. Any available net losses and/or excess imputation credits will not be extinguished under section 177C(5) and (5B) until all outstanding tax returns are filed. Inland Revenue may then calculate the net losses using the taxpayers' most recently filed income tax returns.  
      
    
94.  When Inland Revenue writes off outstanding tax, the taxpayers will be notified in writing of the financial relief granted and of the remaining value of any net losses or excess imputation credits carried forward.  
      
    
95.  Pursuant to section 138E(1)(e)(iv), there is no statutory right to challenge or object to any decision of Inland Revenue to grant or cancel relief. However, if taxpayers do not agree with Inland Revenue's decision not to grant relief, the taxpayers may request that the decision be reviewed by the officer involved or their superior officer. The decision may also be reviewed by the Ombudsman or by way of judicial review.

===================================================================

SPS 06/03 sets out IR's practice for reducing shortfall penalties for previous behaviour.

This statement also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 18, No 6 (July 2006).

### Introduction

2.  In particular, this SPS discusses the reduction for previous behaviour of:  
      
    1.  shortfall penalties imposed for evasion under section 141E(1), and  
          
        
    2.  other shortfall penalties imposed under any of sections 141A to 141D.

### Application

4.  This SPS sets out Inland Revenue's position on the application of the law in this area.  
      
    
5.  The SPS applies to shortfall penalties imposed on or after 21 December 2004.  
      
    
6.  This SPS replaces SPS INV 295 Reduction of Shortfall Penalties for Previous Behaviour originally published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 3 (April 2004). SPS INV 295 applies to shortfall penalties imposed before 21 December 2004.  
      
    
7.  Please refer to the following SPSs:  
      
    *   _INV 251 Voluntary Disclosures_,  
          
        
    *   _INV 260 Notification of a Pending Audit or Investigation_,  
          
        and the following Interpretation Statements:  
          
        
    *   _IS0053 Shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care_,  
          
        
    *   _IS0055 Shortfall penalty - unacceptable interpretation and unacceptable tax position_,  
          
        
    *   _IS0060 Shortfall penalty for gross carelessness_, and  
          
        
    *   _IS0061 Shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position_,  
          
        for further details on Inland Revenue's practice on imposing and reducing shortfall penalties. These statements were published in Tax Information Bulletins and are available on Inland Revenue's website, www.ird.govt.nz. SPS _INV 260_ has expired, but still generally indicates current practice.

8.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA).  
      
    
9.  For the purpose of this SPS, the term "current penalty" refers to the shortfall penalty for which a previous behaviour reduction under section 141FB is being considered.  
      
    
10.  The term "satisfactory behaviour period", as used in this SPS, is not defined in the TAA but refers to the specified period under section 141FB(4) for the purpose of the definitions of "disqualifying offence" (ie an offence under sections 143 and 144) and "disqualifying penalty" (ie where the current penalty is not imposed for evasion under section 141E(1)). The term "satisfactory behaviour period" and the legislative terms "disqualifying offence" and "disqualifying penalty" will be discussed later in the SPS.  
      
    
11.  All taxpayers start with a "clean slate" for the purpose of section 141FB. If a taxpayer has had a shortfall penalty imposed or a conviction entered before 26 March 2003 (when section 141FB was originally enacted), that penalty or conviction is not taken into account in determining whether a current penalty will be reduced for previous behaviour.

### Summary

12.  Inland Revenue reduces a current penalty under section 141FB(1) or (2) for previous behaviour depending on the type of shortfall penalty.  
      
    
13.  Pursuant to section 141FB(1) and (2), the current penalty will be reduced by 50% if the taxpayer is not:  
      
    1.  convicted of a "disqualifying offence", and/or  
          
        
    2.  liable for a "disqualifying penalty".  
          
        
14.  Generally, section 141FB applies separately to each tax type, such as PAYE, income tax and fringe benefit tax (FBT).  
      
    
15.  However, if the taxpayer is convicted of a "disqualifying offence" pursuant to paragraph (a) of that term's definition in section 141FB(3), then a later shortfall penalty for any tax type cannot be reduced by 50%. The "satisfactory behaviour period" does not apply (see paragraphs 38 to 40 of this SPS for details).  
      
    
16.  Where a taxpayer is liable to pay a current penalty for evasion imposed under section 141E(1) and the penalty is not reduced for voluntary disclosure, any later shortfall penalty for evasion for the same tax type cannot be reduced by 50% under section 141FB(1). The "satisfactory behaviour period" does not apply in these cases (see paragraphs 44 to 45 of this SPS for details).  
      
    
17.  Nevertheless, a shortfall penalty that is reduced for voluntary disclosure is not a "disqualifying penalty". It will not affect the taxpayer's eligibility to the 50% reduction of any later shortfall penalty imposed.  
      
    
18.  For the purpose of section 141FB(2), when separate current penalties are imposed under any of sections 141A to 141D for different tax shortfalls identified in the same investigation or voluntary disclosure, each penalty will be treated as if the taxpayer was not liable for the other penalty provided the taxpayer:  
      
    1.  takes both tax positions on the same date, and/or  
          
        
    2.  is not liable for a shortfall penalty during the "satisfactory behaviour period" (as defined in paragraph 38 of this SPS) that ends on the earliest date on which the taxpayer takes the tax position relating to the tax shortfall.  
        

### Background

19.  The August 2001 discussion document titled _Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review_ (the discussion document) identified the following benefits from applying the previous behaviour reduction provision to all current penalties:  
      
    1.  Taxpayers perceive those taxpayers who repeatedly offend to be more harshly penalised, reflecting their failure to begin complying voluntarily.  
          
        
    2.  A concern that the shortfall penalty rates are excessive is addressed. (Especially in relation to voluntary disclosures where the rules are seen as penalising taxpayers who are attempting to comply.)  
          
        
    3.  The shortfall penalty rate for first time evasion is aligned with the evasion rate in Australia and Canada.  
          
        
20.  Section 141FB was originally enacted to implement the recommendations outlined in the discussion document including that a taxpayer's past compliance should be taken into account when imposing shortfall penalties.  
      
    
21.  Since the publication of SPS _INV 295 Reduction of Shortfall Penalties for Previous Behaviour_, section 141FB has been amended in respect of shortfall penalties imposed on or after 21 December 2004.  
      
    
22.  The new section 141FB contains a policy change in that offences under sections 143 to 145 are now considered when determining whether a taxpayer has a satisfactory record of previous compliance.  
      
    
23.  The term "disqualifying offence" has been inserted into the new section 141FB. A taxpayer may not be eligible for a reduction of a current penalty if convicted of a "disqualifying offence". The term "disqualifying penalty" is retained in the new section 141FB.  
      
    
24.  The term "satisfactory behaviour period" (see paragraph 38 of this SPS for details) is designed to be sufficiently long to demonstrate that the taxpayer's behaviour has changed, yet brief enough to not excessively burden the taxpayer.

### Legislation

25.  The relevant legislative provisions are:  
      
    *   the definition of "tax position" in section 3, and  
          
        
    *   sections 141A to 141E, 141FB, 143, 143A, 143B, 143F to 143H, 144 and 145.

### Discussion

### General

26.  Section 141FB was replaced pursuant to the Taxation (Annual Rates, Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004. The new provision permits two types of previous behaviour reduction for shortfall penalties. Section 141FB(1) establishes the grounds for a 50% reduction of a shortfall penalty imposed for evasion under section 141E(1). Section 141FB(2) establishes the grounds for a 50% reduction of any other type of shortfall penalty imposed under sections 141A to 141D.  
      
    
27.  Both subsections (1) and (2) of section 141FB refer to a "disqualifying offence" and a "disqualifying penalty" as the relevant criteria for determining eligibility to the 50% reduction.  
      
    
28.  The term "disqualifying offence" is defined in section 141FB(3) to mean:  
      
    1.  An offence under section 143A, 143B, 143F, 143G, 143H or 145 for which a conviction is entered-  
          
        1.  On or after 26 March 2003; and  
              
            
        2.  Before the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty relates:  
              
            
    2.  An offence under section 143 or 144 that relates to the type of tax to which the current penalty relates and for which a conviction is entered-  
          
        1.  On or after 26 March 2003; and  
              
            
        2.  After the date that precedes, by the period specified in subsection (4), the date on which the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty relates; and  
              
            
        3.  Before the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty relates:  
              
            
29.  The term "disqualifying penalty" is defined in section 141FB(3) to mean:  
      
    
    1.  For the purpose of subsection (1), a shortfall penalty that-
    
      
    
    1.  Relates to the type of tax to which the current penalty relates; and  
          
        
    2.  Is for evasion or a similar act; and  
          
        
    3.  Is not reduced for voluntary disclosure by the taxpayer; and  
          
        
    4.  Relates to a tax position that is taken on or after 26 March 2003 and before the date on which the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty relates:  
          
        
    
    3.  For the purpose of subsection (2), a shortfall penalty that-  
          
        1.  Relates to the type of tax to which the current penalty relates; and  
              
            
        2.  If the current penalty is-  
              
            1.  For gross carelessness or taking an abusive tax position, is a shortfall penalty for evasion or a similar act or for gross carelessness or taking an abusive tax position:  
                  
                
            2.  For not taking reasonable care or taking an unacceptable tax position, is a shortfall penalty of any sort; and  
                  
                
        3.  Is not reduced for voluntary disclosure by the taxpayer; and  
              
            
        4.  Relates to a tax position that is taken-  
              
            1.  On or after 26 March 2003; and  
                  
                
            2.  After the date that precedes, by the period specified in subsection (4), the date on which the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty relates; and  
                  
                
            3.  Before the date on which the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty relates.  
                

### Reduction for shortfall penalties for evasion imposed under section 141E(1)

30.  Pursuant to section 141FB(1), a current penalty for evasion imposed under section 141E(1) will be reduced by 50% if the taxpayer is not:  
      
    *   convicted of a "disqualifying offence", and/or  
          
        
    *   liable for a "disqualifying penalty".  
        

### Disqualifying offence

31.  A current penalty, ie a shortfall penalty for evasion imposed under section 141E(1), will not be reduced for previous behaviour when a taxpayer is convicted:  
      
    1.  on or after 26 March 2003, and  
          
        
    2.  before the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty for evasion relates,  
          
        for:
        1.  a knowledge offence under section 143A, or  
              
            
        2.  an offence for evasion or a similar act under section 143B, or  
              
            
        3.  an offence in relation to inquiries made by Inland Revenue under section 143F, or  
              
            
        4.  an offence in relation to court orders under section 143G, or  
              
            
        5.  obstruction under section 143H, or  
              
            
        6.  other offences with no specified penalty under section 145.  
              
            
32.  Furthermore, when the taxpayer is convicted:  
      
    1.  on or after 26 March 2003, and  
          
        
    2.  within the relevant "satisfactory behaviour period" (see paragraph 38 of this SPS), and  
          
        
    3.  before the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty for evasion relates,  
          
        for:  
          
        
        1.  an absolute liability offence under section 143, or  
              
            
        2.  certain offences under section 144 in relation to the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971,
        
          
          
        a current penalty relating to the same tax type as the offence for which the conviction is entered will not be reduced for previous behaviour. However, any later shortfall penalty for the same tax type will be reduced for previous behaviour if the conviction does not fall within the relevant "satisfactory behaviour period" for that shortfall penalty.

### Meaning of when a conviction is entered

33.  Generally, a conviction is entered after the final determination of the case, when the defendant is sentenced. Note that a guilty plea, per se, will not be a conviction. In particular, a judge may permit a guilty plea to be withdrawn before sentencing.  
      
    
34.  If a taxpayer enters a guilty plea that is later ratified by the judge, the conviction is entered at the date of ratification. However ratification will not occur until sentencing.  
      
    
35.  If a taxpayer is convicted but discharged, the taxpayer will still be treated as convicted. However, if the taxpayer is discharged without conviction, then a conviction has not been entered and there is no "disqualifying offence" for the purpose of section 141FB.
    

### Tax types

36.  Generally, section 141FB applies separately to each tax type, such as PAYE, income tax and FBT. Therefore, a penalty imposed in relation to one tax type does not preclude a previous behaviour reduction for a later shortfall penalty relating to a different tax type.  
      
    
37.  However, if the taxpayer is convicted of a "disqualifying offence" pursuant to paragraph (a) of that term's definition in section 141FB(3), then a later shortfall penalty for any tax type cannot be reduced by 50%.

### Satisfactory behaviour period

38.  For the purpose of the definitions of "disqualifying offence" (ie an offence under sections 143 and 144) and "disqualifying penalty" (ie where the current penalty is not imposed for evasion under section 141E(1)), pursuant to section 141FB(4), the "satisfactory behaviour period" means:  
      
    *   two years preceding the date on which the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty relates for the following tax types:  
          
        1.  the taxpayer's application of the PAYE rules,  
              
            
        2.  FBT,  
              
            
        3.  goods and services tax (GST), and  
              
            
        4.  resident withholding tax, or  
              
            
    *   four years preceding the date on which the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty relates for all other tax types (including income tax).  
          
        
39.  The commencement date of the "satisfactory behaviour period" is calculated by retrospectively applying the relevant period defined in paragraph 38 from the date that the taxpayer takes the tax position relating to the current penalty.  
      
    
40.  However, if the taxpayer is convicted of a "disqualifying offence" pursuant to paragraph (a) of the term's definition in section 141FB(3) (see paragraph 31 of this SPS), then a later shortfall penalty for any tax type cannot be reduced under these rules, regardless of the period elapsed. That is, there is no relevant "satisfactory behaviour period".  
      
    

### Disqualifying penalty

41.  If a taxpayer has not been convicted of a "disqualifying offence" and is not liable for a "disqualifying penalty", a current penalty for evasion under section 141E(1) will be reduced by 50%.  
      
    
42.  However, a current penalty for evasion will not be reduced by 50% pursuant to section 141FB(1) if the taxpayer is liable to pay an earlier shortfall penalty for evasion that:  
      
    1.  relates to the same tax type, and  
          
        
    2.  is not reduced for voluntary disclosure, and  
          
        
    3.  relates to a tax position taken on or after 26 March 2003 and before the date of the tax position to which the current penalty relates.

### Impacts of voluntary disclosure in the context of a current penalty for evasion

43.  An earlier shortfall penalty for evasion that is reduced for voluntary disclosure is not a "disqualifying penalty". Therefore, it will not affect the taxpayer's eligibility to the 50% reduction of the current penalty for evasion.

### Effects of imposing a shortfall penalty for evasion under section 141E(1)

44.  The imposition of a shortfall penalty for evasion will affect the taxpayer's eligibility to the 50% reduction of later shortfall penalties in some cases. That is, if the shortfall penalty for evasion is not reduced for voluntary disclosure, any later shortfall penalty for evasion for the same tax type will not be reduced by 50% under section 141FB(1). There is no "satisfactory behaviour period" in respect of a shortfall penalty for evasion in these cases.  
      
    
45.  However, the "satisfactory behaviour period" will apply in cases where the later shortfall penalty is imposed under any of sections 141A to 141D (also see paragraphs 46 to 52 of this SPS). For example, a later penalty imposed for lack of reasonable care under section 141A for an income tax shortfall will be reduced by 50% under section 141FB(2) if the previous shortfall penalty for evasion, that is not reduced for voluntary disclosure, relates to an income tax position taken outside the four-year "satisfactory behaviour period".

### Reduction for current penalties imposed under any of sections 141A to 141D

46.  Pursuant to section 141FB(2), a current penalty imposed under any of sections 141A to 141D will be reduced by 50% if the taxpayer is not:  
      
    *   convicted of a "disqualifying offence", and/or  
          
        
    *   liable for a "disqualifying penalty" within the "satisfactory behaviour period."  
        

### Disqualifying offence

47.  Section 141FB(2) applies to a current penalty that may be imposed for:  
      
    
    1.  not taking reasonable care under section 141A, or  
          
        
    2.  taking an unacceptable tax position under section 141B, or  
          
        
    3.  gross carelessness under section 141C, or  
          
        
    4.  taking an abusive tax position under section 141D.
    
      
      
    
48.  Pursuant to section 141FB(2), a current penalty, ie imposed under any of sections 141A to 141D, will not be reduced by 50% for previous behaviour when:  
      
    
    *   a taxpayer is convicted of a "disqualifying offence" listed under paragraph (a) of that term's definition in section 141FB(3) (see paragraph 31 of this SPS),  
          
        *   on or after 26 March 2003, and  
              
            
        *   before the date of taking the tax position to which the current penalty relates.  
              
            
    
    A later shortfall penalty for any tax type will not be reduced for previous behaviour because of the "disqualifying offence".  
      
    
49.  Furthermore, a current penalty (ie imposed under any of sections 141A to 141D) will not be reduced by 50% for previous behaviour when:  
      
    *   a taxpayer is convicted of a "disqualifying offence" listed under paragraph (b) of that term's definition in section 141FB(3) (see paragraph 32 of this SPS),  
          
        *   on or after 26 March 2003, and  
              
            
        *   before the date of taking the tax position to which the current penalty relates, and  
              
            
        *   within the relevant "satisfactory behaviour period".  
              
            (See paragraphs 33 to 35 of this SPS regarding the meaning of when a conviction is entered.)

### Disqualifying penalty

50.  A current penalty, ie a shortfall penalty imposed under any of sections 141A to 141D, will not be reduced for previous behaviour if the taxpayer is liable to pay a "disqualifying penalty".  
      
    
51.  Where a current penalty is imposed for gross carelessness under section 141C or for taking an abusive tax position under section 141D, a "disqualifying penalty" is a shortfall penalty that:  
      
    1.  relates to the same tax type as the current penalty, and  
          
        
    2.  is imposed for gross carelessness, taking an abusive tax position or evasion or a similar act, and  
          
        
    3.  is not reduced for voluntary disclosure, and  
          
        
    4.  relates to a tax position taken on or after 26 March 2003 that is within the "satisfactory behaviour period" (see paragraph 38 of this SPS) and before the date of the taxpayer's tax position to which the current penalty relates.  
          
        
52.  Where a current penalty is imposed for not taking reasonable care under section 141A or for taking an unacceptable tax position under section 141B, a "disqualifying penalty" is a shortfall penalty of any sort that:  
      
    1.  relates to the same tax type as the current penalty, and  
          
        
    2.  is not reduced for voluntary disclosure, and  
          
        
    3.  relates to a tax position taken after 26 March 2003 which is within the "satisfactory behaviour period" and before the date of the taxpayer's tax position to which the current penalty relates.

### Tax shortfalls arising from a single investigation or voluntary disclosure - section 141FB(5)

53.  For the purpose of this SPS, an "investigation" means any examination of a taxpayer's financial affairs verifying that the taxpayer has paid the correct amount of tax and is complying with the tax laws.  
      
    
54.  Clear wording will be used in any communication to taxpayers when a decision to investigate has been made. Requests for information to enable the Commissioner to decide whether to investigate are not themselves part of an investigation. Examples of investigation activities include:  
      
    *   income tax, GST and payroll checks (for example, capital/revenue discrepancies and GST on real property transactions),  
          
        
    *   payroll, GST and FBT registration checks, and  
          
        
    *   any other types of review by Inland Revenue.  
          
        
55.  For the purpose of section 141FB(2), when separate current penalties are imposed under any of sections 141A to 141D for different tax shortfalls identified in the same investigation or voluntary disclosure, each penalty will be treated as if the taxpayer was not liable for the other penalty provided the taxpayer:  
      
    1.  takes both tax positions on the same date, and/or  
          
        
    2.  is not liable for a shortfall penalty during the "satisfactory behaviour period" (as defined in paragraph 38 of this SPS) that ends on the earliest date on which the taxpayer takes the tax position relating to the tax shortfall.

### Standard Practice

56.  This SPS discusses the application of section 141FB. In particular, it describes the grounds for reducing a current penalty for evasion under section 141E(1) and for other grounds under sections 141A to 141D.  
      
    
57.  Inland Revenue's standard practice in relation to the application of the previous behaviour reduction is illustrated by the following examples:

### Example 1: disqualifying offence and current penalty for evasion

On 31 August 2005, a conviction is entered against a taxpayer for a knowledge offence under 143A. On 1 November 2005, the taxpayer takes a tax position that the taxpayer's income tax liability for the 2005 tax year is nil. Following an Inland Revenue investigation, a current penalty for evasion is imposed on 1 February 2006 for an income tax shortfall for the 2005 tax year. The taxpayer is not liable for another shortfall penalty.

The current penalty will not be reduced by 50% pursuant to section 141FB(1) because the taxpayer is convicted of a "disqualifying offence" after 26 March 2003 and before the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty for evasion relates.

![Example 1: disqualifying offence and current penalty for evasion.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/8/a/8a7e02804ba377369957bd9ef8e4b077/example1-thumb.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214256&hash=8E11D130E099FEE3657618EE1FC1E3AD)  
\[ [Larger version of image for Example 1:](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/9/9/9918cc804ba37605abcabf9ef8e4b077/example1-large.jpg "This link will open a new browser window. ")\
 | \]

### Example 2: disqualifying offence occurs after the tax position taken

Applying the same facts as example 1 but a conviction is entered against the taxpayer under section 143A on 30 November 2005. The current penalty for evasion will be reduced by 50% pursuant to section 141FB(1) because the conviction is entered after the taxpayer has taken the tax position to which the current penalty relates and therefore is not a "disqualifying offence". Furthermore, the taxpayer is not liable for a "disqualifying penalty".

![Example 1: disqualifying offence and current penalty for evasion.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/0/b/0b8ac9004ba3773a99e6bd9ef8e4b077/example2-thumb.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214251&hash=4FE89688F8ED91DE31E3929D015E389B)  
\[ [Larger version of image for Example 2:](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/2/8/28c07a004ba3760aac80bd9ef8e4b077/example2-large.jpg "This link will open a new browser window. ")\
 | \]

### Example 3: disqualifying penalty and current penalty for evasion  

A taxpayer takes a tax position on 1 May 2005. Following an Inland Revenue investigation, a current penalty for evasion is imposed on 1 August 2005 for an income tax shortfall for the 2004 tax year. The taxpayer has not been convicted of a "disqualifying offence". However, the taxpayer was liable to pay a shortfall penalty for evasion for an income tax position taken on 1 June 2003.

The shortfall penalty for evasion for the tax position taken on 1 June 2003 is a "disqualifying penalty" because:

1.  it is for the same tax type as the current penalty.  
      
    
2.  it is not reduced for voluntary disclosure by the taxpayer.  
      
    
3.  it relates to a tax position taken after 26 March 2003 and before the date on which the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty relates, ie 1 May 2005.

The current penalty will not be reduced by 50% under section 141FB(1) because the taxpayer is liable to pay a "disqualifying penalty".

![Example 3: disqualifying penalty and current penalty for evasion.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/5/5/5574ae804ba3773c9a34bf9ef8e4b077/example3-thumb.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214251&hash=7E6D37598AEE55B24ECE53E26C5FA317)  
\[ [Larger version of image for Example 3:](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/3/d/3d0974804ba37614ae13bf9ef8e4b077/example3-large.jpg "This link will open a new browser window. ")\
 | \]

### Example 4: disqualifying penalty for a different tax type

Applying the same facts as example 3 but the current penalty relates to an FBT shortfall. The current penalty will be reduced by 50% under section 141FB(1). The earlier shortfall penalty is not a "disqualifying penalty" because it relates to a different tax type from the tax shortfall relating to the current penalty.

![Example 4: disqualifying penalty for a different tax type.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/a/2/a25885004ba3773c9a41bf9ef8e4b077/example4-thumb.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214254&hash=3E99DA2739322611E2B90BE5DECF77CB)  
\[ [Larger version of image for Example 4:](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/f/0/f07269004ba37614ae2dbf9ef8e4b077/example4-large.jpg "This link will open a new browser window. ")\
 | \]

### Example 5: disqualifying offence and current penalty for gross carelessness

On 1 April 2003, a conviction is entered against a taxpayer for a knowledge offence under section 143A. Following an Inland Revenue investigation a current penalty for gross carelessness under section 141C is imposed for an FBT shortfall in relation to the tax position taken on 5 April 2005. The current penalty is imposed on 1 July 2005. The taxpayer is not liable for another shortfall penalty.

The current penalty will not be reduced by 50% pursuant to section 141FB(2) because the taxpayer is convicted of a "disqualifying offence" after 26 March 2003 and before the taxpayer has taken the tax position to which the current penalty relates, ie 5 April 2005. This is notwithstanding the fact that the conviction under section 143A was entered against the taxpayer over two years before the current penalty is considered. The "disqualifying offence" also means that the taxpayer will not be eligible for a 50% reduction of any later shortfall penalty for any tax type.

![Example 5: disqualifying offence and current penalty for gross carelessness.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/e/d/ed7298004ba3773c9a4ebf9ef8e4b077/example5-thumb.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214247&hash=414A84CE9E5BBE13281804C6662EC969)  
\[ [Larger version of image for Example 5:](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/4/0/40e9c6804ba37615ae3abf9ef8e4b077/example5-large.jpg "This link will open a new browser window. ")\
 | \]

### Example 6: disqualifying offence occurs after tax position taken

Applying the same facts as example 5 but a taxpayer pleads guilty to an offence on 1 April 2005 and a judge ratifies the guilty plea and enters conviction against the taxpayer for a knowledge offence under section 143A on 15 April 2005. The guilty plea on 1 April 2005 does not amount to a conviction. Therefore, there is no "disqualifying offence" because the conviction is entered (ie on 15 April 2005) after the taxpayer has taken the tax position to which the current penalty relates (ie 5 April 2005). The current penalty will be reduced by 50% pursuant to section 141FB(2).

![Example 6: disqualifying offence occurs after tax position taken.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/3/7/37f414804ba3773d9a5bbf9ef8e4b077/example6-thumb.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214249&hash=B7FC8E70516B618D8B02B9497080CD93)  
\[ [Larger version of image for Example 6:](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/8/c/8c9c70004ba37615ae47bf9ef8e4b077/example6-large.jpg "This link will open a new browser window. ")\
 | \]

### Example 7: disqualifying penalty and current penalty for gross carelessness

A taxpayer takes an income tax position on 31 July 2007 and a current penalty for gross carelessness under section 141C is imposed on 31 August 2007. Following a previous Inland Revenue investigation the taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position imposed under section 141D on 30 September 2003 for an income tax position taken on 1 September 2003. The shortfall penalty was not reduced for voluntary disclosure but was reduced for previous behaviour. The taxpayer is not convicted of a "disqualifying offence".  
  
The shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position is a "disqualifying penalty" because:

1.  it is for the same tax type as the current penalty.  
      
    
2.  it is not reduced for voluntary disclosure by the taxpayer.  
      
    
3.  it relates to a tax position taken after 26 March 2003, within the 4-year "satisfactory behaviour period" (1 August 2003 to 31 July 2007) and before the date of the taxpayer's tax position to which the current penalty relates, ie 31 July 2007.

![Example 7: disqualifying penalty and current penalty for gross carelessness.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/8/4/84d7eb004ba3773d9a68bf9ef8e4b077/example-7-thumb.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214254&hash=C32CCE9A21E6B17ADBB950A70A347251)  
\[ [Larger version of image for Example 7:](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/d/a/da18dd004ba37615ae54bf9ef8e4b077/example-7-large.jpg "This link will open a new browser window. ")\
 | \]

### Example 8: shortfall penalty outside satisfactory behaviour period

Applying the same facts as example 7 but the current penalty and earlier shortfall penalty relate to a GST position. In these circumstances the earlier shortfall penalty is not a "disqualifying penalty" because the tax position to which it relates does not fall within the two-year "satisfactory behaviour period" (1 August 2005 to 31 July 2007). The current penalty will also be reduced by 50% pursuant to section 141FB(2).

![Example 8: shortfall penalty outside satisfactory behaviour period.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/d/7/d7b1a2804ba3773d9a75bf9ef8e4b077/example8-thumb.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214256&hash=2952D403F3FF3F9139ECF6FD76232EA6)  
\[ [Larger version of image for Example 8:](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/2/9/29f7a4004ba37616ae61bf9ef8e4b077/example8-large.jpg "This link will open a new browser window. ")\
 | \]

### Example 9: voluntary disclosure by the taxpayer

A taxpayer files an income tax return and omits income from a particular source. After filing the return, the taxpayer voluntarily discloses the income omission and a shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care is imposed on 7 August 2005 which is reduced by 75% for the voluntary disclosure and a further 50% for previous behaviour.  
  
In the next two returns the taxpayer omits income and later discloses the omission. On both occasions the shortfall penalty for gross carelessness under section 141C is reduced by 75% for the voluntary disclosure and a further 50% for previous behaviour. As the shortfall penalties imposed on 7 August 2005 and 7 August 2006 are both reduced for voluntary disclosure, neither penalty is a "disqualifying penalty" and the additional 50% previous behaviour reduction is available for both the shortfall penalties imposed on 7 August 2006 and 7 August 2007 respectively. It is also noted that the shortfall penalty for taking lack of reasonable care imposed on 7 August 2005 cannot be a "disqualifying penalty", where the current penalty is for gross carelessness.

![Example 9: voluntary disclosure by the taxpayer.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/2/2/22cbb5804ba3773e9a82bf9ef8e4b077/example9-thumb.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214249&hash=160CE3E67F8F9D82577747DAB539A3E7)

### Example 10: Inland Revenue's investigation subsequent to the taxpayer's voluntary disclosure

A taxpayer files an income tax return and omits income from a particular source. After filing the return, the taxpayer voluntarily discloses the income omission and a shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care is imposed on 7 August 2004 which is reduced by 75% for the voluntary disclosure and 50% for previous behaviour.  
  
Inland Revenue decides to investigate the period following the first voluntary disclosure and a current penalty for evasion is imposed on 7 August 2005. This current penalty is reduced by 50% for previous behaviour under section 141FB(1), as the previous shortfall penalty was reduced for voluntary disclosure by the taxpayer and also was not imposed for evasion or a similar act. Therefore, the previous shortfall penalty is not a "disqualifying penalty".  
  
On 7 August 2006, the taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure of an income tax shortfall and the shortfall penalty is reduced by 75%. This shortfall penalty is not reduced for previous behaviour, as the previous shortfall penalty for evasion imposed on 7 August 2005 is a "disqualifying penalty". The previous shortfall penalty for evasion related to income tax and was not reduced for voluntary disclosure.  
  
The following year, Inland Revenue again investigates the period following the voluntary disclosure and a shortfall penalty for evasion is imposed on 7 August 2007. This shortfall penalty will not be reduced for previous behaviour under section 141FB(1), as the previous shortfall penalty for evasion imposed on 7 August 2005 is a "disqualifying penalty". The previous shortfall penalty for evasion related to income tax and was not reduced for voluntary disclosure.  
  
**Note:** the "satisfactory behaviour period" does not apply to the "disqualifying penalty" for the purpose of section 141FB(1).  
  
In a later period (on 7 August 2008) the taxpayer voluntarily discloses omitted income and a shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position is imposed under section 141D. The voluntary disclosure relates to an income tax position taken on 30 June 2008. This shortfall penalty will not be reduced for previous behaviour under section 141FB(2). The previous shortfall penalty for evasion imposed on 7 August 2005 is a "disqualifying penalty" because it is not reduced for voluntary disclosure and relates to an income tax position taken on a date falling within the four-year "satisfactory behaviour period" for the current penalty (ie 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2008).

![Example 10: Inland Revenue's investigation subsequent to the taxpayer's voluntary disclosure.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/6/f/6f16f5804ba3773e9a8fbf9ef8e4b077/example10-thumb.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214252&hash=4381B5E22DD0242090EF0974B0076BE4)

###   
Example 11: tax shortfalls arising from a single investigation

Separate shortfall penalties for gross carelessness are imposed in respect of a bad debt deduction and a depreciation claim respectively. The tax shortfalls are identified in a single investigation. Both tax positions are taken on the same date. The taxpayer is not liable for a previous shortfall penalty. Under section 141FB(5), in considering whether the current penalties can be reduced for previous behaviour, each penalty would be determined as if the taxpayer was not liable for the other penalty.

Tax Payments - when received in time (Feb 07) (WITHDRAWN)
=========================================================

Withdrawn statement SPS 07/01 Tax Payments - when received in time. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

This statement also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_, Vol 19, No 2 (March 2007).

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement ("SPS") sets out the Inland Revenue's practice for accepting tax payments as having been made in time.

### Application

2.  This SPS replaces SPS _PRC 101 Tax payments - when received in time_, which was published in _Tax Information Bulletin_, Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003), and will apply from 12 February 2007. (For GST return periods refer paragraph 4.)

### Background

3.  SPS _PRC 101_ set out when Inland Revenue would accept payments as having been received in time, including:

*   Payments by post,
*   Electronic payments (from New Zealand and overseas),
*   Physical delivery,
*   Post-dated cheques,
*   Weekends and public holidays,
*   Tax pooling, and
*   Tax transfers.

4.  Since the publication of SPS _PRC 101_, there have been legislative changes in GST return filing and payment due dates. The Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 and then the Taxation (Annual Rates, Savings Investment, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 amended section 16 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("GST Act"). For taxable periods ending on or after 31 March 2007, the GST return filing and payment due dates are:

*   The 28th day of the month following the end of the taxable period, if the taxable period does not end in March or November; or  
    
*   The 7th day of May, if the taxable period ends in March; or  
    
*   The 15th day of January, if the taxable ends in November.

5.  The changes in GST return filing and payment due dates represent the first step in preparation for the later alignment of GST and provisional tax payment due dates, which will take effect from the 2008-09 tax year. The objective of these changes is to make tax compliance easier for small businesses that operate in New Zealand.  
      
    
6.  Inland Revenue's practice in respect of when payments have been received in time remains unchanged and will apply to GST payments, as they are treated the same as other tax payments after the legislative changes in the return filing and payment due dates.

### Standard Practice

7.  This SPS applies to all tax types, including Goods and Services Tax ("GST") and Child Support payments.

**Payments by post**

8.  Payments will be accepted as being received in time if mailed and postmarked on or before the due date.  
      
    
9.  For Rural Delivery taxpayers, the date of payment is when it is received by New Zealand Post or similar providers. Inland Revenue does not treat the payment as received when the taxpayer places the payment in their personal mail box for collection.

**Overseas payments by post**

10.  An overseas postmark cannot be used to determine the date a payment was received by Inland Revenue from a taxpayer living or working overseas. Accordingly, the time of actual receipt by Inland Revenue will be used.

**Electronic payments**

11.  Taxpayers may make payments electronically, including by internet banking. A payment will be received in time when it has been electronically paid or direct credited into an Inland Revenue account either on or before the due date. Internet payments must be completed prior to the end of the banks' online business hours to be recorded as received on that specific day. Internet payments after these online business hours will be processed on the next business day.  
      
    
12.  In the context of electronic payments, "business hours" means the hours a bank makes available to customers to initiate electronic payments on any given day. Payments made after these hours will be processed by the bank as at the next business day.

**Overseas electronic payments**

13.  A payment will be received in time when it has been electronically paid or direct credited into an Inland Revenue account either on or before the New Zealand due date.

**Physical delivery**

14.  A payment will be accepted as being received in time if it is deposited into an Inland Revenue drop box by the close of business on the due date.

**Westpac payments**

15.  Taxpayers may also make payments at most branches of Westpac. Payments can be made over the counter or via drop boxes. The payment is received in time if it is physically handed into a Westpac branch by the close of business on the due date.

**Post-dated cheques**

16.  Inland Revenue will not bank post-dated cheques until the specified date. A cheque that is post-dated after the due date, even though it is received on or before the due date, will be treated as late. This applies to payments that are posted or physically delivered.

**Weekends and public holidays**

17.  If a due date falls on a weekend or a public holiday (including a provincial anniversary day), Inland Revenue will accept a payment as in time when it is physically delivered or posted on the next working day.  
      
    
18.  If a due date falls on a weekend or a public holiday (including a provincial anniversary day), then an electronic payment will be accepted as in time when it is credited into an Inland Revenue account on the next working day.

**Tax pooling**

19.  In cases of tax pooling, the date of payment is when the intermediary makes the tax payment to Inland Revenue. For more information on the implications of tax pooling please refer to _Tax Information Bulletin_ , Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003).

**Tax transfers**

20.  For the rules regarding the transfers of overpaid taxes please refer to _Tax Information Bulletins_ , Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002) and Vol 16, No 1 (February 2004).

Requests to amend assessments (May 07) (WITHDRAWN)
==================================================

Withdrawn SPS 07/03 - Requests to amend assessments (May 07). Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction 
-------------

1.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out Inland Revenue's practice for exercising the Commissioner's discretion to amend assessments to ensure their correctness. 

Application
-----------

2.  This SPS applies from 17 May 2007.
3.  This SPS applies to the exercise of the Commissioner's discretion under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to amend assessments to ensure their correctness. It replaces all previous policies and standard practices regarding the exercise of the discretion under section 113, including SPS _INV-510 Requests to Amend Assessments_ originally published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 14, No 8 (August 2002).
4.  Section 113 does not apply to the exercise of the Commissioner's discretion to amend assessments to ensure their correctness under section 82(3) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 and section 12G(2) of the Gaming Duties Act 1971. However, in exercising the discretion arising under either of those provisions, the Commissioner will, so far as permitted, apply similar principles to those set out in this SPS.
5.  Please note that SPS _INV-510_ included a discussion on the Commissioner's discretion in amending GST assessments under section 27(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("the GST Act"). However, section 27(2) was repealed with application for GST return periods beginning on or after 1 April 2005 , and the Commissioner's authority to amend GST assessments now arises pursuant to section 113.
6.  This SPS should be read in conjunction with SPS _INV-490 GST returns – correcting minor errors (and clarification)_ , SPS _INV-251 Voluntary Disclosures_ and any SPSs subsequently issued in replacement.
7.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("the TAA").

Legislation
-----------

8.  The relevant legislative provisions are:  
     
    1.  sections 6, 6A, 14, 15B, 89C, 89N, 107A, 108, 108A, 113, 138E, 141FB, 141G and 141KB,
    2.  section MD 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 ("ITA 1994"),
    3.  section MD1(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 ("ITA 2004"), and
    4.  sections 19C(8), 20(5), 45(1) and (3) and 46 of the GST Act.

Summary
-------

9.  Section 113 gives the Commissioner the discretion to amend assessments to ensure their correctness when they contain genuine errors, or following the application of the disputes resolution process in Part IVA.
10.  Section 113 is viewed in the context of taxpayers' obligations to make correct assessments, and the other duties arising under section 15B. The Commissioner has an obligation to protect the integrity of the tax system including applying the tax laws fairly, impartially and according to the law.
11.  Section 113 operates alongside, but is not part of the disputes resolution process provisions that set out the procedures for resolving disputes between Inland Revenue and taxpayers. The Commissioner will not amend assessments while any item of those assessments remains the subject of current disputes under Part IVA. However, assessments can be amended consequentially following completion of the disputes resolution process or to reflect agreed adjustments.
12.  When the Commissioner considers that assessments are incorrect (and there is no dispute), the Commissioner can exercise the discretion to amend assessments to correct the genuine errors.
13.  This SPS is therefore generally directed at those instances where taxpayers request amendments to assessments (amendment requests), including by making voluntary disclosures, where genuine errors have been made. This SPS also considers the situation where genuine errors are discovered in the course of an investigation. The Commissioner will amend assessments, on a case-by-case basis, when satisfied that genuine errors were made and that none of the limitations set out in paragraphs 49 to 62 of this SPS apply.

Discussion
----------

14.  The Commissioner acknowledges that correcting tax errors is an integral part of tax administration. At times, the Commissioner will correct incorrect tax positions to give effect to amendment requests, voluntary disclosures or Inland Revenue investigations. The Commissioner will make any such amendments irrespective of whether they increase or reduce the initial assessments.
15.  Pursuant to section 113, the Commissioner may amend assessments to ensure their correctness notwithstanding that taxpayers have not issued notices of proposed adjustment ("NOPAs") pursuant to section 89D in respect of the requested amendments. However, taxpayers seeking to amend incorrect tax positions that relate to:  
     
    1.  non-genuine errors including matters of regretted choice, or
    2.  matters of disputed statutory interpretation,  
         
16.  must issue NOPAs if within the applicable response period and may make voluntary disclosures when a tax shortfall results.  
     
17.  If the Commissioner has raised assessments pursuant to section 106(1) (commonly known as default assessments) and the taxpayers subsequently file tax returns in respect of those default assessments outside the relevant response periods, the Commissioner may treat the tax returns as amendment requests. The Commissioner will generally amend the assessments pursuant to section 113 after confirming that the tax returns contain correct tax positions. However, if taxpayers are within the relevant response periods they should consider issuing NOPAs with their tax returns pursuant to section 89D(1) in order to preserve their disputes rights against the possibility that the Commissioner declines the exercise of the section 113 discretion.
18.  Section 113 contains a broad discretion allowing the Commissioner to amend assessments to ensure their correctness, but provides little guidance about how the Commissioner should exercise this discretion in practice. Accordingly, it is necessary to look at the legislative scheme, context and the relevant case law.
19.  Section 113 reads:  
     
    1.  Subject to section 89N, the Commissioner may from time to time, and at any time, amend an assessment as the Commissioner thinks necessary in order to ensure its correctness, notwithstanding that tax already assessed may have been paid.
    2.  If any such amendment has the effect of imposing any fresh liability or increasing any existing liability, notice of it shall be given by the Commissioner to the taxpayer affected.

**Considering amendment requests**

19.  Taxpayers may make amendment requests pursuant to section 113 irrespective of whether disputes have been initiated in respect of other issues relating to the assessments.
20.  A threshold issue is whether the Commissioner must consider amendment requests from taxpayers after they are identified. As a matter of law, the Commissioner cannot be compelled to either investigate claims that assessments are in error or subsequently to amend the assessments. Please see _Commonwealth Agricultural Services Engineers Ltd (In Liquidation) v CIR_ \[1926\] 38 CLR 289, _CIR v Wilson_ (1996) 17 NZTC 12,512 and _Lawton v CIR_ (2003) 21 NZTC 18,042.
21.  Where it is decided to devote resources to verify genuine errors and a view can reasonably be formed on the basis of the amendment request's merits, the Commissioner will make appropriate adjustments to assessments subject to the principles set out in this SPS, in the spirit of promoting voluntary compliance by taxpayers and to protect the "integrity of the tax system" under section 6(1).
22.  When the Commissioner is not satisfied that assessments contain genuine errors, the Commissioner will not and cannot be compelled to amend the assessments. Please see _Wood v CIR_ (1999) 19 NZTC 15,255.

**"Care and management" considerations**

23.  The discretion to amend assessments under section 113 enables the Commissioner to act fairly towards all taxpayers including those who get their tax returns or assessments correct the first time and those who have made genuine errors. This also promotes integrity in the administration of the tax system.
24.  It is important, however, to recognise that Inland Revenue does not have unlimited resources to undertake lengthy verification processes to determine whether assessments should be amended. When meeting the obligation to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law under section 6A(3), the Commissioner must consider:  
     
    1.  the resources available to the Commissioner,
    2.  promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers, and
    3.  taxpayers' compliance costs.  
         
25.  Accordingly, it is consistent with the obligation under section 6A(3) for the Commissioner to limit the amount of time and other resources that will be spent investigating amendment requests. Therefore, at times not all requested amendments will necessarily be corrected. Ensuring a balance between time spent considering amendment requests and other activities is also consistent with the obligation to protect the integrity of the tax system under section 6(1). The principles set out below reflect that balance.
26.  The Commissioner will be reluctant to consider amendment requests that would require the application of disproportionate amounts of departmental resources (that is, excessive resources when compared to the amount of tax at stake). This is not to say that the Commissioner will only use minimal resources to determine amendment requests or never consider complex amendment requests. The extent and relevance of taxpayers' disclosures and the amount of tax at stake in respect of the amendment requests will indicate the amount of the Commissioner's resources needed to consider the requests. Ultimately, the allocation of resources will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
27.  To assist in the consideration of any amendment requests, taxpayers should provide sufficient relevant information with their requests to ensure that the facts and tax laws relating to the errors are clear and unambiguous. Determining unresolved factual or legal issues may require disproportionate amounts of departmental resources. Therefore, the amendment request might not be considered, or later declined notwithstanding that high dollar amounts are involved.

**Genuine errors**

28.  In this SPS, the term "genuine errors" is used to mean incorrect tax positions taken in assessments resulting in a tax liability being either overstated or understated. However, if taxpayers choose to take particular tax positions under tax laws where legitimate alternatives are available and later regret that choice, no error has occurred (please see paragraphs 37 and 38 ). This is because the Commissioner does not consider it appropriate to devote resources to correcting optional positions if the preferred positions could have been taken when the taxpayers made the original self-assessments by filing the tax returns. Arguably, to do so would not promote the integrity of the tax system pursuant to section 6(1).
29.  The Commissioner accepts that where a taxpayer has taken an incorrect tax position and the Commissioner amends the taxpayer's assessment following an investigation, other taxpayers' tax positions may also be incorrect as a result of the first-mentioned taxpayer's incorrect tax position. These will also be regarded as genuine errors. The Commissioner will need to amend the other taxpayer's assessment under section 113 upon the consequential error being identified (subject to other statutory requirements). This is because section 89C(k) permits the Commissioner to amend assessments in such cases without first issuing notices of proposed adjustment.

**Principles**

30.  In summary, the Commissioner will amend assessments to ensure their correctness, subject to resources being available and in accordance with the following principles:  
     
    1.  The relevant case law indicates that the Commissioner is not required to, either consider whether genuine errors have occurred, or subsequently to amend the assessments. That is, the Commissioner may not consider all amendment requests once they are identified.
    2.  The Commissioner must take into account all relevant factors when considering amendment requests. (Please see paragraphs 23 to 27 of this SPS for a discussion of the care and management considerations). Once the amendment requests are identified, the Commissioner will initially examine them to ascertain all the relevant factors that may affect the decision to investigate claims that assessments are in error and to amend the assessments. For example, the length of time that has passed since the errors were made may be a relevant factor, as it may become more difficult to independently verify the matters included in the taxpayers' requests. However, this will not necessarily determine whether or not the Commissioner will amend the assessments.
    3.  The facts and tax laws relating to the genuine errors must be clear and unambiguous. The Commissioner will not contemplate the use of section 113 in respect of complex unresolved issues (for example, issues that are currently being heard by a hearing authority or covered only by proposed new legislation, which is yet to be passed by Parliament).
    4.  When statutory interpretation is at issue (that is, due to disagreement about the meaning of the law), the Commissioner does not consider it appropriate to amend assessments. Disputed statutory interpretation should properly be considered in the disputes resolution process.
    5.  When amending assessments under section 113, the Commissioner must be satisfied that the amendments will ensure the correctness of those assessments taking into account the relevant legislative scheme and case law.
    6.  The onus is on taxpayers to provide all relevant information with amendment requests. This will enable the Commissioner to verify the genuine error by considering the merits of the amendment request.
    7.  Amendment requests that would require disproportionate amounts of the Commissioner's resources to resolve will not generally be accepted. If the resources needed to amend assessments considerably exceed the monetary value of the requested amendments, the Commissioner will not usually amend the assessments. Similarly, amendment requests that relate to very small amounts of tax, or are vexatious or fraudulent in nature given the resources likely to be required, will not usually be considered.
    8.  If the Commissioner is persuaded that the taxpayers made the genuine errors as a direct result of relying on advice given to them by Inland Revenue officers, favourable consideration will be given to the exercise of the discretion. Taxpayers should, however, note their obligation to take care in interpreting advice, especially in respect of statements not directed at them.
    9.  Where taxpayers request the Commissioner to change assessments from one valid option to another, there is no genuine error to correct. This is a matter of regretted choice, such as where taxpayers choose one of several legitimate options for the calculation of a tax liability and later request that option be changed (please see paragraphs 37 and 38 ). If, however, the taxpayers can show that their tax returns simply erroneously recorded their original intended choice under tax laws, the Commissioner may further consider the amendment requests.
    10.  The Commissioner will not amend assessments while any item of those assessments remains the subject of a current dispute under Part IVA.
    11.  Generally, incorrect tax positions arising from arithmetical, transposition and other types of obvious errors that are clear and easily verified by Inland Revenue will be corrected subject to the limitations set out in this SPS.
    12.  At times, an investigation commenced by Inland Revenue may indicate that following proposed or agreed adjustments there should be consequential changes made to the taxpayers' other tax periods (or to other taxpayers' tax periods as a result of the relevant transactions). In this circumstance, the Commissioner will also make consequential amendments pursuant to section 113 after the conclusion of the disputes resolution process and subject to taxpayers not commencing challenge proceedings in a hearing authority to:  
         
        1.  the taxpayers' other incorrect tax periods pursuant to section 89C(c), and
        2.  other taxpayers' incorrect tax positions that are taken as a result of the first-mentioned taxpayers' incorrect tax positions, in accordance with section 89C(k).  
             
    13.  Although the Commissioner does not have an absolute obligation to amend assessments that contain genuine errors, the Commissioner will do so after verifying the errors, unless overriding policy grounds exist that would lead to inconsistency with the Commissioner's obligations under sections 6 and 6A.
    14.  Amendments will be made unless they are subject to any time limitations imposed pursuant to the Inland Revenue Acts referred to in this SPS.

Standard Practice
-----------------

31.  The following standard practice has been developed from the principles set out in paragraph 30 .

**Taxpayers' amendment requests**

32.  Taxpayers or their agents making amendment requests must supply the Commissioner with all relevant information to substantiate the claim. The amendment request and this information must be provided in writing and should include:  
     
    1.  the tax types and periods containing the errors,
    2.  the amount of tax in error,
    3.  a description of the errors including the background circumstances and the reasons for their occurrence,
    4.  the nature of the errors, including any relevant tax laws,
    5.  how and why the errors were identified,
    6.  where relevant details of any incorrect advice given directly to the taxpayers by Inland Revenue and how the taxpayers relied on that advice,
    7.  the action required to ensure correctness, and
    8.  all other relevant documents and records supporting the amendment requests.

**Amended tax returns**

33.  Taxpayers cannot, by law, correct errors in their self-assessments by simply filing "amended tax returns". However, amended tax calculations (for example, in a copy of an amended tax return) with supporting information will be considered pursuant to section 113.

**Considering amendment requests**

34.  The Commissioner must first determine the extent to which the amendment requests will be considered. Generally, the Commissioner will consider amendment requests if the information supplied is clear and the principles set out in paragraph 30 are satisfied.
35.  When considering amendment requests, the Commissioner must take into account all relevant factors and merits on a case-by-case basis. These may include:  
     
    
    1.  the reasons for the errors,
    2.  the amount of time which has passed since the errors were made,
    3.  the resources required or difficulty faced by the Commissioner in verifying the errors, and
    4.  the relative importance or amount of the amendments sought.  
         
    
    If the amendment requests need further clarification, the Commissioner may either decline to consider them or ask for additional information from the taxpayers or their agents to verify the amendment requests.  
     
36.  In relation to arithmetical or transposition errors that are clear and result in incorrect tax positions, except for the application of the statutory time limitations, the length of time that has passed since the errors were made will not be a determining factor for exercising the discretion under section 113.
37.  If the taxpayers show that their tax returns simply incorrectly recorded their decisions under tax laws, the Commissioner would generally amend the assessments. For example, the taxpayer makes a transposition error in their 2006 income tax return after documenting a decision to allocate 40% of research and development (R & D) expenditure to their 2006 income year pursuant to section EJ 21 of the ITA 2004. The final deduction claimed did not reflect the 40% intended to be claimed. Thus, the tax position taken was incorrect. The Commissioner would amend the assessment under section 113 to correct the transposition error if the taxpayer provides accounting or business records that substantiate the taxpayer's intention to allocate 40% of the deduction to the 2006 tax year.
38.  However, the Commissioner cannot exercise the discretion under section 113 if the amendment requests involve matters of regretted choice. For example, as in paragraph 37 , a taxpayer seeks to deduct R & D expenditure incurred in the 2006 tax year pursuant to section DB 26 of the ITA 2004. The taxpayer has elected to allocate 40% of the allowable deduction in their 2006 income tax return pursuant to section EJ 21 of the ITA 2004. They have documented their decision and a notice of assessment has been issued reflecting that decision. The taxpayer later decides that they would like to allocate 60% of the allowable deduction to the 2006 tax year and requests that the assessment be amended pursuant to section 113. In this circumstance, the Commissioner cannot amend the taxpayer's request because it involves a matter of regretted choice and is not a genuine error.

**Amending assessments**

39.  After considering amendment requests, the Commissioner may amend assessments to ensure their correctness provided the following criteria are met:  
     
    1.  the amendment requests are clear, that is, the errors are identified clearly, both factually and legally,
    2.  the taxpayers have provided all relevant information to ensure that the Commissioner can make correct assessments,
    3.  the Commissioner has verified the errors as genuine,
    4.  the amendments are to be made within the relevant time limits (please see paragraphs 55 to 62 ), and
    5.  none of the other limitations apply (please see paragraphs to 49 to 54 ).  
         
40.  If, after considering all the relevant information and submissions, the Commissioner is not satisfied that genuine errors were made, the Commissioner cannot amend the assessments. For instance, the facts may indicate that the taxpayers adopted particular legitimate options or are relying on legal interpretations with which the Commissioner may disagree.
41.  Where such decisions are made, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayers or their agents of the decisions in writing and the reasons for the decisions.
42.  When amending assessments the Commissioner will ensure that all consequential adjustments to other tax types and/or periods (and taxpayers' assessments) are included once they are confirmed by the affected taxpayers. However, in some cases the Commissioner may require further information from the taxpayers before making such consequential amendments.
43.  Where the Commissioner is already investigating the tax type and period to which the amendment requests relate, the amendment requests will be considered as part of that investigation.

**Investigations and consequential amendments**

44.  Inland Revenue undertakes various types of investigation activities. For the purpose of this SPS, an investigation means any examination of taxpayers' financial affairs to verify that they have paid the correct amount of tax and complied with their tax obligations as required by the law.
45.  Irrespective of whether there is a current dispute, if the period and tax type relating to the amendment requests are already under investigation, the Commissioner will make any appropriate consequential amendments. That is, if the Commissioner is already devoting resources to verify the correctness of assessments, all reasonable consequential effects of the investigation will be considered (including the amendment requests) as part of that process.
46.  The Commissioner may make any consequential adjustments (that is, not requested by the taxpayers under investigation) to the taxpayers' other assessments or to other taxpayers affected by adjustments resulting from the investigation. The consequential amendments could relate to the same or different tax types. For example, a taxpayer mistakenly claims incorrect GST input tax deductions for an exempt supply. This is discovered after a routine Inland Revenue investigation. The Commissioner amends the GST assessment following agreement by the taxpayer and also makes a consequential amendment to the taxpayer's corresponding income tax assessment to reflect the disallowed expenditure.
47.  If, after following the standard practice set out in this SPS, the Commissioner agrees with the amendment requests, then subject to the limitations set out below, the amendments will be incorporated into the amended assessments arising from the investigation. The Commissioner cannot amend the assessments to reflect the amendment requests before finalising the position in relation to the other issues arising from the investigation. The amendments will be treated the same as any other agreed adjustments arising out of the investigation.
48.  Finally, please see the comments in paragraph 52 in relation to the effect of a decision by Inland Revenue's Adjudications Unit (an adjudication decision) arising in the course of a dispute.

**Limitations on the exercise of the discretion to amend assessments**

49.  In accordance with the obligations under sections 6 and 6A and the limitations set out in this SPS, the Commissioner will correct genuine errors once verified by Inland Revenue officers.
50.  The following may act as general limitations on the exercise of the Commissioner's discretion to amend assessments.

_Amendment requests following court and adjudication decisions_

51.  When taxpayers request assessment amendments to reflect court decisions affecting themselves or other taxpayers, the Commissioner will not necessarily amend the assessments. However, when exercising the discretion under section 113, the Commissioner will consider all relevant factors including whether:  
     
    1.  the taxpayers have consistently asserted that they are entitled to take tax positions reflecting the court decisions,
    2.  the taxpayers have been associated with claims or actions against Inland Revenue on issues relevant to the requests,
    3.  Inland Revenue has advised the taxpayers that the outcome of a particular issue would apply to them, and
    4.  Inland Revenue has previously advised the taxpayers directly in relation to particular matters and the taxpayers have acted on that advice, which has later proved to be incorrect.  
         
52.  Where the Commissioner has issued assessments to taxpayers after commencing a dispute but prior to determination of the issue by adjudication, and the Adjudication Unit has subsequently reached conclusions on another period or periods, the Commissioner will apply those conclusions and amend any assessed periods where:  
     
    
    1.  the dispute is in relation to the same issue, and/or
    2.  the Adjudication Unit has determined the issue in favour of the taxpayers.
    
      
    However, this approach is subject to no:  
     
    1.  material factual differences existing between the periods in question, and
    2.  special circumstances existing such that an adjustment would be inconsistent with the Commissioner's obligations under sections 6 and 6A. For example, where the Adjudication Unit holds that the assessment should be increased but the Commissioner cannot refund the resulting overpaid income tax because of the time restriction arising from section MD 1(1) of the ITA 2004.

_Amendment requests following a change in the Commissioner's practice_

53.  Generally, the Commissioner will not amend assessments where taxpayers have made amendment requests because of a change in the Commissioner's practice in administering the tax laws. This is because the Commissioner does not usually backdate the application of changes in practice. However, where the Commissioner does backdate the change in practice in a concessionary way, the application of the new practice will be made clear to the taxpayers.

_Current dispute_

54.  When the amendment requests are the subject of a current dispute under Part IVA, the Commissioner will not amend the assessments unless they are to reflect agreed adjustments and there are no other disputed issues in the period to which the agreed adjustments relate.

_Time limits on increasing assessments_

55.  Further to the limitations set out above, the Commissioner cannot increase previously assessed amounts:  
     
    1.  Pursuant to section 108, in respect of income tax if four years have elapsed from the end of the tax year when the income tax returns were provided unless the Commissioner considers those tax returns:  
         
        1.  are fraudulent or misleading, or
        2.  omit income for which tax returns must be provided:  
             
            1.  that is of a particular nature, or
            2.  was derived from a particular source, and/or  
                 
    2.  Pursuant to section 108A, in respect of GST if four years have elapsed from the end of the GST return period in which the GST returns were provided, unless the Commissioner considers that the taxpayers have knowingly or fraudulently failed to disclose all of the material facts needed to determine the amount of GST payable for a GST return period.

_Time limits on income tax refunds_

56.  Pursuant to section MD 1(1) of the ITA 1994 and the ITA 2004, the Commissioner cannot refund amounts of overpaid income tax including amounts arising from amendments made under section 113 in the following circumstances:  
     
    1.  For assessments relating to the 2004-2005 and later tax years, Inland Revenue cannot refund amounts of overpaid tax if four years have elapsed from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayers provided the tax returns. However, this four-year refund limitation period may be extended to eight years if the refunds arise as a result of:  
         
        
        1.  a "clear mistake or simple oversight" by the taxpayers, or
        2.  the taxpayers' entitlement to a rebate of income tax under subpart KD of the ITA 2004,
        
          
        and Inland Revenue receives any refund request from or on behalf of the taxpayers before, or within four years following, the end of the initial four-year limitation period.  
         
    2.  For assessments relating to tax returns before the 2004-2005 tax year, Inland Revenue cannot refund amounts of overpaid tax if eight years have elapsed from the end of the income year in which the original assessments were made.

_Time limits on GST refunds_

57.  Pursuant to section 45(1) of the GST Act, the Commissioner cannot refund amounts of overpaid GST for taxable periods beginning on or after 1 April 2005 in the following circumstances:  
     
    1.  if the Commissioner is satisfied that the amounts of tax paid exceed the amounts properly payable and four years have elapsed from the end of the taxable periods to which the assessments relate.
    2.  in respect of refunds pursuant to sections 19C(8), 20(5) or 46 of the GST Act, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayers did not receive refund amounts that they were clearly entitled to receive and four years have elapsed from the end of the year in which the refunds were made.  
         
58.  However, pursuant to section 45(4), the Commissioner may refund GST overpayments within four years of the end of the initial four-year limitation period if:  
     
    1.  the GST overpayments arise from a "clear mistake or simple oversight" by the taxpayers, and
    2.  the Commissioner:  
         
        1.  refunds the GST overpayment within four years of the end of the initial four-year limitation period, or
        2.  receives refund requests from or on behalf of the taxpayers during the four-year limitation period referred to in paragraph 57(b) or within four years of the end of that period.  
             
59.  For taxable periods beginning before 1 April 2005 , refunds for overpaid GST cannot be made if eight years have elapsed from the end of the taxable periods to which the assessments relate unless the taxpayers request the refunds in writing before the end of the eight-year period .

_Amended assessments after expiry of the four-year time limit for increasing assessments_

60.  When taxpayers request assessment reductions ("credit adjustments") after the four-year limitation period for increasing assessments has elapsed, the Commissioner in considering the amendment requests will incorporate any adjustments that would have definitely been made to increase the assessments ("debit adjustments") but for the application of the four-year time limit. This will ensure the correctness of the assessments.
61.  If the debit adjustments that the Commissioner would have made do not exceed the credit adjustments requested by the taxpayers, the Commissioner will reduce any credit adjustments by the amount of the debit adjustments.
62.  The Commissioner cannot increase assessments outside the four-year time limit through offsetting the debit adjustments that would have definitely been made with the credit adjustments requested by the taxpayers. However, if the Commissioner is not satisfied that amending the assessments will ensure their correctness they will not be amended as requested.

**General**

_Fresh or increased liability_

63.  Pursuant to section 113(2) if any assessment amendments impose fresh or increase existing liabilities the Commissioner will give written notice to the affected taxpayers.

_Shortfall penalties_

64.  Where amendment requests (for example, by way of voluntary disclosures) impose fresh liabilities or increase existing liabilities, taxpayers may also be liable to shortfall penalties.
65.  For further information about the assessment of shortfall penalties, please see the following current Interpretation Statements and any subsequently issued in replacement:  
     
    1.  _Shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care_,  
        (in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 17, No 9 (November 2005)),
    2.  _Shortfall penalty - unacceptable interpretation and unacceptable tax position_,  
        (in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol l7, No 9 (November 2005)),
    3.  _Shortfall penalty for gross carelessness_,  
        (in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 16, No 8 (September 2004)),

66.  Please also see _SPS 06/01 Discretion to cancel or not assess shortfall penalties for taking an unacceptable tax position_ regarding the exercise of the Commissioner's discretion to not impose shortfall penalties for taking an unacceptable tax position and any SPS subsequently issued in replacement.
67.  Taxpayers that make amendment requests resulting in debit adjustments will be eligible for voluntary disclosure reductions of any applicable shortfall penalties if the amendment requests meet the requirements under section 141G. Please see SPS _INV-251 Voluntary Disclosures_ and any SPS subsequently issued in replacement for further details on the reduction of shortfall penalties for voluntary disclosures.
68.  Furthermore, any applicable shortfall penalties will be further reduced by 50% for previous behaviour pursuant to section 141FB if the taxpayers are not:  
     
    
    1.  convicted of a disqualifying offence (please see section 141FB(3)), and/or
    2.  liable for a disqualifying penalty (please see section 141FB(3)).  
         
    
    Please see SPS 06/03 _Reduction of shortfall penalties for previous behaviour_ and any SPS subsequently issued in replacement for further details.

**No rights to challenge exercise of the discretion**

69.  Please note that pursuant to section 138E(1)(e)(iv) taxpayers cannot challenge the exercise of the Commissioner's discretion under section 113 by commencing proceedings in a hearing authority. However, the exercise of this discretion may be subject to judicial review.

=================================================================================================

Withdrawn SPS 08/01 Disputes resolution process commenced by the CIR (June 08). Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

This item also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 20, No 6 (July 2008).

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement ("SPS") sets out the Commissioner's rights and responsibilities with a taxpayer in respect of an adjustment to an assessment when the Commissioner commences the disputes resolution process.  
      
    
2.  Where a taxpayer commences the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner's practice is set out in _SPS 08/02: Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer._  
      
    
3.  This SPS has been updated due to changes made to the law under:  
    
    1.  the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, and  
        
    2.  the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, and  
        
    3.  the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007, and  
        
    4.  the Income Tax Act 2007, and  
        
    5.  the relevant case law decided since _SPS 05/03: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ was published.
    
      
    
4.  The Commissioner regards this SPS as a reference guide for taxpayers and Inland Revenue officers. Where possible, Inland Revenue officers must follow the practices outlined in this SPS.

### Application

5.  This SPS applies from 10 June 2008. _SPS_ _05/03: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ continues to apply from its commencement date up to 10 June 2008.  
      
    
6.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").

### Background

7.  The tax disputes resolution procedures were introduced in accordance with the recommendations of the Richardson Committee in the _Report of the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department_ (April 1994) and were designed to reduce the number of disputes by:
    
    1.  promoting full disclosure, and  
        
    2.  encouraging the prompt and efficient resolution of tax disputes, and  
        
    3.  promoting the early identification of issues, and  
        
    4.  improving the accuracy of decisions.
    
      
    
8.  The disputes resolution process ensures that there is a full and frank communication between the parties in a structured way within strict time limits for the legislated phases of the process.  
      
    
9.  The disputes resolution process is designed to encourage an "all cards on the table" approach and the resolution of issues without the need for litigation. It aims to ensure that all the relevant evidence, facts and legal arguments are canvassed before a case proceeds to a court or hearing authority.  
      
    
10.  In accordance with the objectives of the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner (unless a statutory exception applies under section 89C or 89N(1)(c)) must go through the disputes resolution process before the Commissioner can issue an assessment.  
      
    
11.  The disputes resolution process was introduced in 1996 and reviewed in July 2003. There have been changes made to the disputes resolution process following recent legislative amendments and cases since 2005.  
      
    
12.  The early resolution of a dispute is intended to be achieved through a series of steps specified in the TAA. The main elements of those steps are:  
    
    1.  a notice of proposed adjustment ("NOPA"): this is a notice that either the Commissioner or taxpayer issues to the other advising that an adjustment is sought in relation to the taxpayer's assessment, the Commissioner's assessment or other disputable decision (the requisite form is the _IR770_ _Notice of proposed adjustment_).  
        
    2.  a notice of response ("NOR"): this must be issued by the recipient of a NOPA if they disagree with it (the preferred form is the _IR771 Notice of response_).  
        
    3.  a disclosure notice and statement of position ("SOP"): the issue of a disclosure notice by the Commissioner triggers the issue of a SOP. Each SOP must provide an outline of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law with sufficient details to support the position taken. Each party must issue a SOP (the requisite form is the _IR773 Statement_ _of position_). The SOP is an important document because it limits the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law that either party can rely on if the case proceeds to court to what is included in the SOP (unless a hearing authority makes an order that allows a party to raise new facts or evidence under section 138G(2)).
    
      
    
13.  There are also two administrative phases in the process - the conference and adjudication phases. If the dispute has not been already resolved after the NOR phase, the Commissioner's practice will be to hold a conference, unless the parties agree to abridge the conference phase (please see paragraphs 228 to 232 of the SPS). A conference can be a formal or informal discussion between the parties to clarify and, if possible, resolve the issues.  
      
    
14.  If the dispute remains unresolved after the SOP phase, the Commissioner will refer the dispute to adjudication, except in certain circumstances. Adjudication involves an independent review of the dispute by Inland Revenue's Adjudication Unit which was formed to provide an internal but impartial review of unresolved disputes. Adjudication is the final phase in the process before the taxpayer's assessment is amended (if it is to be amended) following the exchange of the SOPs.

### Summary of key actions and indicative administrative time frames

15.  Set out below is a summary of the key actions and administrative time frames where a disputes resolution process is commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue.  
      
    
16.  These actions and time frames are intended to be administrative guide lines for Inland Revenue officers. Any failure to meet these administrative time frames will not invalidate subsequent actions of the Commissioner, or prevent the case from going through the disputes resolution process.

### Standard practice and analysis

#### **The Commissioner must issue a NOPA before making an assessment**

17.  The Commissioner must issue a NOPA before making an assessment (including an assessment of shortfall penalties but excluding other civil penalties and interest), unless an exception to the requirement that a NOPA be issued applies under section 89C.  
      
    
18.  Nevertheless, even if the Commissioner, in a very unlikely event, made an assessment in breach of section 89C, the assessment would be regarded as being valid under section 114(a).  
      
    
19.  Each exception under section 89C can apply independently or together depending on the circumstances. However, the Commissioner can also choose to issue a NOPA before making an assessment notwithstanding that an exception under section 89C applies.

##### A disputable decision

20.  The Commissioner will generally issue a NOPA before issuing an assessment that takes into account a disputable decision.  
      
    
21.  For example, the Commissioner issues a notice of disputable decision to a taxpayer who is a director and shareholder of a company advising that the company's loss attributing qualifying company election for the 2007 tax year is invalid because it is received late. However, the company's loss calculation and assessment for the 2007 tax year are not affected. The Commissioner intends to issue an assessment to the taxpayer that takes into account the notice of disputable decision by disallowing the company's losses that the taxpayer has claimed. The Commissioner will issue a NOPA to the taxpayer before making the assessment.

#### Exceptions

##### Exception 1: The assessment corresponds with a tax return

22.  Section 89C(a) reads:  
    
    > The assessment corresponds with a tax return that has been provided by the taxpayer.
    
23.  The application of section 89C(a) is limited under the self-assessment rules. Generally, a taxpayer makes an assessment and files a tax return that includes that assessment. If the taxpayer's assessment is supported by the information in the tax return and any underlying source documents that the taxpayer has provided and the Commissioner agrees with the taxpayer's return and assessment there is no need for the Commissioner to invoke the disputes resolution process.  
      
    
24.  In these circumstances, instead of issuing a notice of assessment the Commissioner will issue a statement of account that confirms the taxpayer's assessment. The statutory response period for the purposes of the disputes resolution process will commence from the date that Inland Revenue receives the taxpayer's assessment.  
      
    
25.  Sometimes, if there is a deficiency in the taxpayer's tax return, the Commissioner will issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA to the taxpayer because section 89C(a) applies. For example, the Commissioner can issue an assessment, where the taxpayer has provided all their income details but omitted to calculate their income tax liability in the tax return.

##### Exception 2: Simple or obvious mistake or oversight

26.  Section 89C(b) reads:
    
    > The taxpayer has provided a tax return which, in the Commissioner's opinion, appears to contain a simple or obvious mistake or oversight, and the assessment merely corrects the mistake or oversight.
    
27.  This exception is intended to apply to a simple calculation error or oversight that Inland Revenue's Processing Centres generally discover with computer edits and simple return checks. This maintains the status quo for the many assessments arising in this situation.  
      
    
28.  The Commissioner will generally treat the following as a simple mistake or oversight:  
    
    1.  an arithmetical error, and  
        
    2.  an error in transposing numbers from one box to another in a tax return, and  
        
    3.  double counting, such as inadvertently including in the taxpayer's income the same item twice, and  
        
    4.  not claiming a rebate to which the taxpayer is entitled or that was incorrectly calculated, for example, the low income rebate for a taxpayer.
    
      
    
29.  A "simple or obvious mistake or oversight" can be determined on a case-by-case basis with no dollar limit. The Commissioner may consider whether this exception applies irrespective of whether the taxpayer has requested that the Commissioner makes an amendment under section 113 or applies the exception under section 89C(b).  
      
    
30.  Where the Commissioner issues an assessment to correct a taxpayer's simple or obvious mistake or oversight, the Commissioner may consider imposing shortfall penalties on the taxpayer, if there is a tax shortfall and the taxpayer has committed one of the culpable acts, for example, lack of reasonable care and not relied on the action or advice of their tax advisor for the purposes of section 141A(2B).

##### Exception 3: Agreement to amend previous tax position

31.  Section 89C(c) reads:  
    
    > The assessment corrects a tax position previously taken by the taxpayer in a way or manner agreed by the Commissioner and the taxpayer.
    
32.  This situation can occur if the issue is raised by either the Commissioner or the taxpayer. There is no need to issue a NOPA because no dispute arises.  
    
33.  If the Commissioner proposes the adjustment, this exception cannot apply unless the taxpayer accepts the adjustment. For the purpose of section 89C(c), the agreement between the parties can be oral, although, generally, the Commissioner's practice will be to seek written agreement. Section 89C(c) applies if Inland Revenue officers can demonstrate that the Commissioner and taxpayer have agreed on the proposed adjustment.  
      
    
34.  However, if the parties agree on only one adjustment and dispute others in respect of the same assessment, the Commissioner cannot issue an assessment on the basis of the agreed adjustment because the tax position is not necessarily correct.  
      
    
35.  Where a taxpayer proposes an adjustment outside the disputes resolution process and the Commissioner agrees, for example a taxpayer makes a request to amend an assessment, the particulars must be recorded in writing and state that the assessment is made in accordance with the Commissioner's practice on exercising the discretion under section 113. (Please see _SPS_ _07/03_ _Requests to amend assessments_.) The Commissioner must also consider if shortfall penalties are applicable.

##### Exception 4: The assessment otherwise reflects an agreement

36.  Section 89C(d) reads:  
    
    > The assessment reflects an agreement reached between the Commissioner and the taxpayer.
    
37.  The same procedures apply for sections 89C(c) and (d). However, the agreement that the parties reach does not have to relate to a tax position that the taxpayer has previously taken.  
      
    
38.  For example, the taxpayer has disputed but now agrees that they are a "taxpayer" for the purpose of the definition in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 ("ITA 2007") and has not provided a tax return. The Commissioner will issue an assessment to the taxpayer under section 89C(d) to reflect this agreement. The Commissioner must also consider whether shortfall penalties are applicable.  
      
    
39.  An example is where, pursuant to section 6A, the Commissioner settles a tax case and disputes resolution process. In such cases, the Commissioner will usually enter into an individual settlement deed and agreed adjustment in writing with the taxpayer to confirm the settlement.  
      
    
40.  The Commissioner will then give effect to that settlement deed and agreed adjustment by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer under section 89C(d) without first issuing a NOPA.  
      
    
41.  This is notwithstanding that the assessment does not necessarily reflect the Commissioner's own view of the correct tax position.(The Commissioner can also issue an assessment under section 89C(c).)

##### Exception 5: Material facts and law identical to court proceeding

42.  Section 89C(db) reads:  
    
    > The assessment is made in relation to a matter for which the material facts and relevant law are identical to those for an assessment of the taxpayer for another period that is at the time the subject of court proceedings.
    
43.  Pursuant to section 89C(db), the Commissioner can issue an assessment to the taxpayer in relation to the other period that is the subject of court proceedings, without first issuing a NOPA. The Commissioner does not have to follow the disputes resolution process for the same issue in the other period because the matter is before the court to resolve. A dual process towards resolution does not need to be adopted. The Commissioner will also consider whether shortfall penalties are applicable.  
      
    
44.  However, a taxpayer who has been issued with an assessment in relation to another period under section 89C(db), can dispute that assessment by issuing a NOPA to the Commissioner under section 89D within the applicable response period.  
      
    
45.  Section 89C(db) is intended to reduce compliance costs. Notwithstanding this provision, the Commissioner can elect to issue a NOPA in respect of the other period in order to resolve the dispute through the disputes resolution process.

##### Exception 6: Revenue protection

46.  Section 89C(e) reads:  
    
    > The Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe a notice may cause the taxpayer or an associated person -
    > 
    >   
    > 
    > (i)  To leave New Zealand, or
    > 
    >   
    > 
    > (ii)  To take steps, in relation to the existence or location of the taxpayer's assets, making it harder for the Commissioner to collect the tax from the taxpayer.
    
47.  This exception is intended to ensure that the revenue is protected in the relevant circumstances. Section 89C(e) does not require that the taxpayer has physical possession of their assets.  
      
    
48.  If Inland Revenue officers apply the exception under section 89C(e), this should be supported by evidence of the "reasonable grounds" relied on (for example, the taxpayer's correspondence with third parties, application to emigrate overseas and any transcripts of interviews with the taxpayer, etc.)

##### Exception 7: Fraudulent activity

49.  Section 89C(eb) reads:  
    
    > The Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the taxpayer has been involved in fraudulent activity.
    
50.  Pursuant to section 89C(eb), a taxpayer has been involved in a fraudulent activity if they have:  
    
    1.  engaged or participated in, or has been connected with, any fraudulent activity that would have tax consequences for them, and
    2.  acted deliberately with the knowledge that they were acting in breach of their legal obligations and did so without an honest belief that they were so entitled to act.
    
      
    
51.  If the taxpayer has not been convicted of an offence relating to a fraudulent activity section 89C(eb) can still apply provided that the Commissioner believes on reasonable grounds that the taxpayer has been involved in a fraudulent activity.  
      
    
52.  For example, the Commissioner intends to issue an assessment for the 2007 tax year to a taxpayer who carries on business as an advertising agent. The taxpayer arranges advertising for his clients for which he receives a commission payment from the advertising providers. The taxpayer requires an initial payment from his clients from which he subsequently deducts any advertising costs that are incurred. The taxpayer advises his clients that the only remuneration that he receives for his services is the commission paid to him by the advertising providers.  
      
    
53.  However, the Commissioner is aware that the taxpayer's practice has been to obtain a discount from the advertising provider but not disclose this discount to his clients or deduct the amount of the discount from the amount charged to the client for the advertising. The taxpayer would then retain the difference between the amount charged to the taxpayer and the actual cost of the advertising to supplement the commission actually received from the advertising provider. The Commissioner was advised by one of the taxpayer's clients that the taxpayer has not been passing onto them discounts obtained from an advertising service provider and the Commissioner has confirmed this after making further enquiries.  
      
    
54.  In this circumstance, the Commissioner considers that the taxpayer has been involved in fraudulent activity. The Commissioner can issue to the taxpayer an assessment of income tax for the 2007 year that includes all the taxpayer's assessable income without first issuing a NOPA pursuant to section 89C(eb).  
      
    
55.  This is because the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the taxpayer has been involved in fraudulent activity based on the information provided by the taxpayer's client and the Commissioner's own enquiries.  
      
    
56.  If Inland Revenue officers apply the exception under section 89C(eb), this should be supported by sufficient evidence of the "reasonable grounds" relied on. For example, evidence that verifies that the taxpayer may have or has committed an offence and, therefore, has been involved in fraudulent activity. The evidence does not have to be absolute proof but, merely sufficient to verify the "reasonable grounds".

##### Exception 8: Vexatious or frivolous

57.  Section 89C(f) reads:
    
    > The assessment corrects a tax position previously taken by a taxpayer that, in the opinion of the Commissioner is, or is the result of, a vexatious or frivolous act of, or vexatious or frivolous failure to act by, the taxpayer.
    
58.  If Inland Revenue officers apply this exception, this should be supported by documentation that evidences:  
    
    1.  the action or inaction giving rise to the tax positions previously taken, and  
        
    2.  why that action is considered to be vexatious or frivolous and any shortfall penalties/prosecution consideration. Examples of a tax position taken as result of a vexatious or frivolous act are a tax position that is:
        1.  clearly lacking in substance, for example, where the taxpayer continues to take the same position that has previously been finalised, or  
            
        2.  motivated by the sole purpose of delay.
    
      
    
59.  Where this exception applies, the Commissioner must also consider the imposition of shortfall penalties in respect of the taxpayer's tax position resulting from a vexatious or frivolous act.

##### Exception 9: Taxation Review Authority or court determination

60.  Section 89C(g) reads:
    
    > The assessment is made as a result of a direction or determination of a court or the Taxation Review Authority.
    
61.  For the purpose of section 89C(g), a direction or determination includes any court or Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") decision that affects the particular taxpayer in relation to a specific tax period and a court decision on a "test case" that applies to the taxpayer irrespective of whether they were a party to the test case.  
      
    
62.  The Commissioner must retain a copy of the direction or determination to support the application of this exception. In these circumstances, the Commissioner will endeavour to make an assessment including imposing shortfall penalties, within two weeks after receiving the written direction or determination. However, if the direction or determination relates to a test case the Commissioner can issue an assessment within the period specified under section 89O(5).

##### Exception 10: "Default assessment"

63.  Section 89C(h) reads:
    
    > The taxpayer has not provided a tax return when and as required by a tax law.
    
64.  If section 89C(h) applies because the taxpayer has failed to provide a tax return the Commissioner can make an assessment or amended assessment pursuant to section 106(1) (commonly known as a "default assessment").  
      
    
65.  Where a taxpayer seeks to dispute a default assessment through the disputes resolution process, the taxpayer must, within the applicable response period (that is, four months from the date that the default assessment is issued):  
    
    1.  provide a tax return in the prescribed form for the period to which the default assessment relates (pursuant to section 89D(2C) for GST and section 89D(2) for all other tax types) notwithstanding that the tax return will not include the taxpayer's assessment, and  
        
    2.  issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the default assessment.
    
      
    
66.  The requirement to provide a tax return in respect of a default assessment made under section 106(1) before issuing a NOPA is an additional requirement of the disputes resolution process. This ensures that the taxpayer has provided the information that is required by the tax law before they are entitled to dispute the assessment.  
      
    
67.  If the Commissioner agrees with the taxpayer's NOPA and tax return, the Commissioner will generally amend the default assessment by exercising the discretion under section 113 subject to the statutory time bar in section 108 and any other relevant limitations. However, if the Commissioner does not agree with the taxpayer's tax return and NOPA the Commissioner can decide to not amend the default assessment and issue a NOR instead.  
      
    
68.  If a taxpayer cannot provide a NOPA because they are outside the applicable response period to dispute a default assessment or do not want to enter into the disputes resolution process they must still provide a tax return.  
      
    
69.  Although the Commissioner does not have to amend the initial assessment on receipt of the tax return from a defaulting taxpayer, the Commissioner can exercise the discretion to amend under section 113 subject to the time bar in section 108 or 108A and any other relevant limitations on the exercise of that discretion.  
      
    
70.  If the Commissioner decides not to exercise the discretion under section 113 to amend the default assessment on the basis of the tax return provided, the Commissioner can issue a NOPA in respect of the default assessment under section 89B(1) where, for example, new information received from the taxpayer suggests that the default assessment is incorrect. Any NOPA must be issued within two months after the date that the default assessment was issued.  
      
    
71.  The Commissioner is not precluded from further investigating an amended assessment issued on the basis of the taxpayer's tax return and, if necessary, issuing a NOPA to the taxpayer.

##### Exception 11: Failure to make or account for tax deductions

72.  Section 89C(i) reads:  
    
    > The assessment is made following the failure by a taxpayer to withhold or deduct an amount required to be withheld or deducted by a tax law or to account for an amount withheld or deducted in the manner required by a tax law
    
73.  This exception is intended to address a taxpayer's failure to withhold, deduct or account to the Commissioner for an amount of tax including PAYE, schedular payments to non-resident contractors (formerly withholding payments) and resident withholding tax ("RWT"). The Commissioner must also consider whether shortfall penalties are applicable.  
      
    
74.  The Commissioner may not apply this exception if there is a dispute that involves statutory interpretation (for example, whether a particular item attracts liability for RWT) and/or shortfall penalties.

##### Exception 12: Non-assessed tax return

75.  Section 89C(j) reads:
    
    > The taxpayer is entitled to issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of a tax return provided by the taxpayer, and has done so.
    
76.  If a taxpayer proposes an adjustment in a NOPA with which the Commissioner agrees, the Commissioner can issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA. This exception only applies to an adjustment that the taxpayer has proposed in their NOPA under section 89DA(1) within the applicable response period.

##### Exception 13: Consequential adjustment

77.  Section 89C(k) reads:  
    
    > The assessment corrects a tax position taken by the taxpayer or an associated person as a consequence or result of an incorrect tax position taken by another taxpayer, and, at the time the Commissioner makes the assessment, the Commissioner has made, or is able to make, an assessment for that other taxpayer for the correct amount of tax payable by that other taxpayer
    
78.  If transactions affect multiple taxpayers, whether in the same way or in related but opposite ways, the Commissioner can reassess any consequentially affected taxpayers under section 89C(k), if an assessment is, or could be issued to some of the taxpayers for the correct amount of tax payable. This is notwithstanding that the consequentially affected taxpayers have not agreed to the amended assessments.  
      
    
79.  However, those taxpayers subject to the amended assessments can still issue a NOPA to dispute the consequential adjustment if they are within the applicable response period. The Commissioner must also consider whether shortfall penalties are applicable.  
      
    
80.  Section 109(b) deems any assessment that the Commissioner makes to be correct and, therefore, the Commissioner can make any consequential amendment under section 89C(k) accordingly. However, the Commissioner must be satisfied that there is a direct consequential link between the taxpayers before making any consequential adjustment. For example:  
    
    1.  Group loss offsets: if a loss company has claimed losses to which it is not entitled and the Commissioner has amended the loss company's loss assessment to disallow those losses, pursuant to section 89C(k), the Commissioner can also make a separate assessment for the profit company that has incorrectly offset the loss company's losses against its profits.  
        
    2.  GST: the supplier and recipient of a supply have incorrectly assumed that a transaction was GST-exempt. The Commissioner later agrees that the recipient was entitled to a GST input tax credit and issues an assessment to them allowing the credit.The Commissioner can also issue an assessment to the supplier under section 89C(k) in respect of the output tax on the value of the supply.  
        
    
      
    
81.  However, in practice, the Commissioner can also issue a NOPA to all the taxpayers affected in such cases.

#### Taxpayer can dispute an assessment that is issued without a NOPA

82.  The Commissioner can issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA under section 89C in the circumstances outlined above. Although the Commissioner must always endeavour to apply the exceptions under section 89C correctly, any assessment made in breach of section 89C will still be treated as valid under section 114(a).  
      
    
83.  Where the Commissioner issues an assessment without first issuing a NOPA whether or not in breach of section 89C, the taxpayer can dispute the assessment through the disputes resolution process under section 89D(1). (Please see _SPS_ _08/02:_ _Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer_.)  
      
    
84.  However, where the Commissioner issues a NOPA to a taxpayer and they accept the proposed adjustment by written agreement or are deemed to accept the proposed adjustment, then section 89I(1) precludes the taxpayer from challenging the assessment.  
      
    
85.  However, section 89I cannot apply if the Commissioner and taxpayer have agreed on an adjustment before entering into the disputes resolution process. The parties can dispute the amended assessment, notwithstanding the previous agreement.

#### When the Commissioner can issue a NOPA

86.  Section 89B specifies when the Commissioner can issue a NOPA.  
      
    
87.  Under section 89B(1) the Commissioner can issue one NOPA for multiple issues, tax types and periods. Alternatively, the Commissioner can issue multiple NOPAs for the same issue and period, consistent with the obligation to correctly make an assessment within the four-year statutory time period.  
      
    
88.  A NOPA is not an assessment. It is an initiating action that allows open and full communication between the parties. If possible, the taxpayer will be given the opportunity to settle a dispute by entering into an agreed adjustment with Inland Revenue before the Commissioner issues a NOPA.  
      
    
89.  However, the Commissioner or taxpayer is not precluded from issuing a NOPA in respect of any amended assessment that the Commissioner issues to reflect the agreed adjustment within the applicable response period.  
      
    
90.  A NOPA forms a basis for ensuring that the Commissioner does not issue an assessment without some formal and structured dialogue with the taxpayer in respect of the grounds upon which the Commissioner will issue any assessment or amended assessment (_McIlraith v CIR_ (2007) 23 NZTC 21,456).  
      
    
91.  Once an investigation has commenced, the intended approach must be discussed with the taxpayer.If the Commissioner decides to issue a NOPA to a taxpayer, the responsible officer must endeavour to advise the taxpayer of this proposed approach within five working days before the date that the NOPA is issued to allow the taxpayer time to consider their position and/or seek advice. However, the taxpayer can also be advised earlier.  
      
    
92.  The Commissioner should ensure that any issues relating to the same period and tax type are kept together in the dispute.  
      
    
93.  The Commissioner can also exercise certain statutory powers (for example, issuing a section 17 notice) after a dispute has commenced and will continue to investigate the facts that relate to the dispute.  
      
    
94.  If the parties agree upon some and dispute other proposed adjustments for the same tax period and type, the Commissioner cannot issue an assessment that reflects any agreed adjustment already accepted under section 89J(1) until all the remaining disputed issues are resolved (even if the Commissioner does not pursue the disputed issue further) or determined by the Adjudication Unit. That is, the Commissioner will not issue a "partial" or "interim" assessment under section 89J(1) if the Commissioner is not satisfied that the assessment is correct.  
      
    
95.  However, where the statutory time bar is about to fall due, the Commissioner can issue an assessment to reflect both the agreed and disputed adjustment, provided that the requirements in section 89N are met. (Please see paragraphs 146 to 188 for further discussion.)  
      
    
96.  Where it is practicable, Inland Revenue officers will contact the taxpayer or their tax agent within 10 working days after the NOPA is issued to ensure that it has been received. Inland Revenue officers making written contact should comply with section 14.

##### Exceptions to the statutory time bar

  
 

###### (a)  Time bar waivers

97.  If it is contemplated that the disputes resolution process cannot be completed before the statutory time bar period for amending an assessment commences, the parties can agree in writing pursuant to section 108B(1)(a) to waive the time bar by up to 12 months to enable the full disputes resolution process to be applied.  
      
    
98.  The taxpayer can also give written notice to the Commissioner and waive the time bar for a further six months after the end of the 12-month period under section 108B(1)(b) to allow sufficient time for the dispute to progress through the adjudication process. This notice must be given to the Commissioner within the initial 12-month period.  
      
    
99.  If the time bar is waived, the taxpayer must be advised in writing that:  
    
    1.  a NOPA will be issued, and  
        
    2.  the disputes resolution process will be followed.  
        
    
      
    
100.  To be effective, a statutory time bar waiver must be agreed in writing on the prescribed form (_IR775 Notice of waiver of time bar_) and delivered to the Commissioner before the relevant four-year period expires.  
      
    
101.  The statutory time bar waiver only applies to those issues that the parties have identified and understood before the initial statutory time bar. Other issues not so identified will still be subject to the original statutory time bar, unless section 108(2) or 108A(3) applies. (Please see paragraph 107 in this SPS.)

###### (b)  The Commissioner's application to the High Court under section 89N(3)

102.  If a NOPA has been issued and the disputes resolution process cannot be completed before the statutory time bar period expires, the Commissioner can apply to the High Court for more time to complete the process. (Please see the discussion regarding section 89N(3) in paragraphs 175 to 186 of this SPS.)  
      
    
103.  However, where the Adjudication Unit has insufficient time (that is, before the statutory time bar arises or further time allowed under section 108B(1) to fully consider a matter submitted to it expires) the Adjudication Unit will return the matter to the responsible officer to decide whether to issue an assessment or amended assessment or accept the taxpayer's position. Section 89N(2)(b) allows the Commissioner to amend an assessment at any time after the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer's SOP in relation to the particular period. (Please see paragraph 144 for further discussion.)

###### (c)  Exceptions under section 89N(1)

104.  When a NOPA has been issued, the Commissioner will follow the disputes resolution process unless an exception under section 89N applies. (The application of section 89N is discussed in detail later in paragraphs 141 to 185 of the SPS.) The Commissioner must obtain and document administrative approval for any departure from the full disputes resolution process.

##### Limitations on the Commissioner issuing a NOPA

105.  Under section 89B(4), the Commissioner cannot issue a NOPA:
    
    1.  if the proposed adjustment is the subject of challenge proceedings, or  
        
    2.  after the statutory time bar has expired.
    
      
    
106.  The time bar that arises under sections 108 and 108A prevents the Commissioner from issuing an assessment that increases the amount assessed. The Commissioner can still issue an assessment that decreases the amount of the initial assessment subject to the limitation on refunding overpaid tax under sections RM 2(1) of the ITA 2007 and 45(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.  
      
    
107.  However, the Commissioner is not subject to the statutory time bar that arises under sections 108 and 108A, if the Commissioner considers that the taxpayer has:  
    
    1.  provided a fraudulent or wilfully misleading tax return (section 108(2)(a)), or  
        
    2.  omitted income for which a tax return must be provided that is of a particular nature or source (section 108(2)(b)), or  
        
    3.  knowingly or fraudulently failed to make a full and true disclosure of the material facts necessary to determine their GST payable (section 108A(3)).
    
      
    
108.  Furthermore, the Commissioner is not subject to the statutory time bar that arises under section 108 if a taxpayer has a remaining tax credit to which section LA 6(1) of the ITA 2007 applies and the Commissioner seeks to amend an assessment or determination to give effect to section LA 6(3) of the ITA 2007 (section 108(3B)).  
      
    
109.  When considering whether the exception under section 108(2)(b) applies, the Commissioner will disregard omissions of relatively small amounts of income by applying the principle of _de minimis non curat lex_ (_Babington v C of IR_ (1957) NZLR 861).  
      
    
110.  The Commissioner accepts that the time bar ensures finality in relation to assessments, is a key protection for most taxpayers and the exclusions from its protection must be only invoked if there is an adequate basis in fact and law to support their operation. Section 89B(4)(b) requires that the Commissioner initially decides whether an exception to the time bar applies, for example, whether a tax return is fraudulent or wilfully misleading, before determining whether a NOPA can be issued under section 89B(1).  
      
    
111.  Any opinion that the Commissioner forms regarding the application of the exceptions to the time bar must be honestly held and reasonably justifiable on the basis of the evidence available and the relevant law. The decision must be clearly documented and include reference to the grounds and reasoning on which it is based. Any decision that is made under section 108A is not, in itself, a disputable decision.  
      
    
112.  The Commissioner is generally limited to a four-year period within which a taxpayer's assessment can be increased following an investigation or in certain other circumstances. In respect of a dispute, the assessment is amended (if necessary) after the disputes resolution process is completed. The Commissioner will endeavour to undertake the various steps involved in the process within the four-year period.  
      
    
113.  Section 89B(4)(a) applies to individual proposed adjustments. Where the proposed adjustment is the subject of court proceedings, the Commissioner cannot issue a NOPA in respect of those proposed adjustments. However, the Commissioner can issue a separate NOPA to the taxpayer in relation to the same tax period provided it relates to a different adjustment.  
      
    
114.  For example, a taxpayer challenges the deductibility of feasibility expenditure in the 2006 tax year pursuant to section 138B. The Commissioner can also issue a NOPA to the same taxpayer in relation to the tax treatment of a bad debt in the same tax year.

#### Contents of the Commissioner's NOPA

115.  A NOPA is the document that commences the disputes resolution process. It is intended to identify the true points of contention and explain the legal or technical aspects of the issuer's position in relation to the proposed adjustment in a formal and understandable manner. This will ensure that information relevant to the dispute is quickly made available to the parties. Section 89F(1) and (2) specifies the content requirements for any NOPA that the Commissioner may issue.  
      
    
116.  Under section 89F(1)(b), the NOPA must be in the prescribed form (_IR770_ _Notice of Proposed Adjustment_). Any NOPA that the Commissioner issues must identify, in sufficient detail the adjustment proposed and explain concisely the facts and law that relate to the adjustment and how the law applies to the facts. When preparing a NOPA, the Commissioner should avoid repeating facts, arguments or using unnecessary detail.  
      
    
117.  Section 89F(2)(b) requires that the NOPA states the key facts and law concisely and in sufficient detail. The Commissioner must ensure that the document is relatively brief and simple to enable the parties to quickly progress the dispute without incurring substantial expenses or excessive preparation time but also detailed enough to explain all the issues relevant to the dispute.  
    
118.  The Commissioner should identify (but not reproduce in full) the relevant legislation and legal principles derived from leading cases. These references should be in sufficient detail to clarify the grounds for the proposed adjustment. However, lengthy quotations from cases should be avoided.  
      
    
119.  The Commissioner considers that Inland Revenue has a statutory obligation to inform a taxpayer adequately, but recognises that the matters relevant to the dispute will be set out in greater detail at the SOP phase if the dispute is not resolved.  
      
    
120.  Therefore, what is included in a NOPA or NOR is not conclusive as between the parties because they can introduce further grounds or information or adjust the quantum of the proposed adjustments later in the disputes resolution process (_CIR v Zentrum Holdings Limited_ (2006) 22 NZTC 19,912). However, the parties cannot propose another adjustment involving new grounds and a fresh liability at the SOP phase.  
      
    
121.  The Commissioner must always endeavour to issue a NOPA that has sufficient details, is of a high standard and has been considered by a legal adviser. The Commissioner must endeavour to advise the taxpayer during the conference phase of any new grounds, information or reduction in quantum that will be introduced in the SOP.  
      
    
122.  If the Commissioner decides to increase the quantum of any proposed adjustment after the NOPA is issued the Commissioner must issue a new NOPA to the taxpayer.  
      
    
123.  Although candid and complete exchanges of information are implicit in the spirit and intent of the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner's practice will be to ensure that the NOPA is, within those limits, as brief as practicable.  
      
    
124.  The content of any NOPA that the Commissioner issues must satisfy all the requirements specified in section 89F(2)(a) to (c).

##### Identify adjustments or proposed adjustments - section 89F(2)(a)

125.  The Commissioner must consider in respect of each proposed adjustment:  
    
    1.  the income amount or impact of the adjustment, and  
        
    2.  the tax year or period to which the proposed adjustment relates, and  
        
    3.  whether use-of-money interest will apply.
    
      
    
126.  The Commissioner will also consider whether shortfall penalties and/or other appropriate penalties of lesser percentages apply. That is, where sufficient evidence is held to support the imposition of the penalties and this can be justified (by reference to any relevant guidelines.)  
    

##### Shortfall penalties

127.  Shortfall penalties are separate items of adjustment that must be explained and supported in the same manner as the underlying tax shortfall. Section 94A(2) also requires that shortfall penalties must be assessed the same way as the underlying tax. However, although assessments of shortfall penalties relate to the underlying tax they are not subject to the time bars that arise under section 108 or 108A.  
      
    
128.  Where there is sufficient evidence to suggest that shortfall penalties should be imposed, the relevant Inland Revenue officer must ensure that the shortfall penalties are proposed in the same NOPA as the substantive issues. However, the officer can dispense with this practice if any the following exceptions applies:  
    
    1.  the evidence supporting the imposition of shortfall penalties does not become available until after the Commissioner has issued the NOPA on the substantive issues. In such circumstances, a separate NOPA may be issued in respect of the shortfall penalties at a later stage.  
        
    2.  before entering into the disputes resolution process, a taxpayer has accepted the proposed adjustment in relation to the substantive issues, but not accepted the imposition of the shortfall penalties. In this circumstance, the Commissioner may still issue a NOPA to the taxpayer for the proposed penalties.  
        
    3.  the taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure of the substantive issues to the Commissioner and the only disputed issue relates to the imposition of the shortfall penalties.  
        
    4.  prosecution action is being considered and shortfall penalties also apply because the taxpayer has committed one of the culpable acts (for example, evasion), in most instances the Commissioner must first complete any prosecution action against the taxpayer before the shortfall penalties can be imposed.  
          
        Pursuant to section 149(5), if shortfall penalties have been imposed the Commissioner cannot subsequently prosecute the taxpayer for taking the incorrect tax position unless the shortfall penalties are imposed under section 141ED. Therefore, the Commissioner may omit proposing shortfall penalties in a NOPA if prosecution is being considered as an option. The Commissioner must issue a new NOPA in respect of any shortfall penalties that are to be imposed after the prosecution.
    
      
    
129.  Furthermore, the Commissioner cannot propose shortfall penalties at the SOP phase if they were not previously proposed in the Commissioner's NOPA

##### State the facts and law - section 89F(2)(b)

  
 

###### Facts

130.  To provide a concise statement of facts, the Commissioner must focus on the material factual matters relevant to the legal issues. This includes, for each proposed adjustment, the facts relevant to proving all arguments made in support of the adjustment including any facts that are inconsistent with any arguments that the taxpayer has previously raised.  
      
    
131.  The Commissioner should endeavour to state all the material facts in brief, so as to avoid irrelevant detail or repetition. For example, where the parties both know the background to the disputed issues, a summary of the facts in the NOPA will suffice. Where possible, the Commissioner will refer to and/or append any documents that have previously set out the facts on which the Commissioner relies.  
      
    
132.  Although the Commissioner will make every attempt to be concise in the NOPA, the Commissioner considers that the explanation of the material facts should be relative to the complexity of the issues.

###### Law

133.  Under section 89F(2)(b) the Commissioner must state the law concisely by including an outline of the relevant legislative provisions and principles derived from leading cases that affect the proposed adjustment.  
      
    
134.  It is sufficient that the Commissioner explains the nature of the legal arguments without providing lengthy quotations from the relevant case law.

##### How the law applies to the facts - section 89F(2)(c)

135.  The Commissioner must apply the legal arguments to the facts to ensure that the proposed adjustment is not a statement that appears out of context. The application of the law to the facts must be stated concisely and logically support the proposed adjustment.  
      
    
136.  The Commissioner must outline all relevant materials and arguments (including alternative arguments) on which the Commissioner intends to rely. If more than one argument supports the same or a similar outcome, the NOPA must include all the arguments.  
      
    
137.  The evidence exclusion rule under section 138G(1) does not apply to the issues, facts, evidence and propositions of law that are raised in the Commissioner's NOPA. That is, the Commissioner is not restricted to raising the same issues, facts, evidence and propositions of law that are specified in the NOPA at the SOP phase or in challenge proceedings that the taxpayer has commenced where a disclosure notice has not been issued.

#### Time frames to complete the disputes resolution process

138.  If the Commissioner has commenced the disputes resolution process by issuing a NOPA to a taxpayer and the dispute remains unresolved, where practicable, the Commissioner must negotiate a time line with the taxpayer to ensure that the dispute is progressed in a timely and efficient way.  
      
    
139.  Although not statutorily required, agreeing to a time line is a critical administrative requirement that requires both parties to be ready to progress the dispute in a timely manner. The parties should endeavour to meet the agreed time line. Where there are delays in the progress of the dispute the responsible officer will manage the delay including any relationship with internal advisers and liaise with the taxpayer.  
      
    
140.  If the negotiated time line cannot be achieved, the Commissioner must enter into a continuing discussion with the taxpayer to either arrange a new time line or otherwise keep them advised of when the disclosure notice and SOP will be issued. This is consistent with the purpose of the disputes resolution process which is to promote the prompt and efficient resolution of disputes. Therefore, the failure to negotiate or adhere to an agreed time line will not prevent a case from progressing through the disputes resolution process in a timely manner.  
      
    
141.  In addition to the above administrative practice, the Commissioner is bound by section 89N(2). Under that provision, if a NOPA has been issued and the parties cannot agree on the proposed adjustment, the Commissioner cannot amend an assessment without completing the disputes resolution process unless any of the exceptions in section 89N(1)(c) apply. These exceptions are explained in paragraphs 146 to 186 of this SPS. If any of these exceptions apply the disputes resolution process will end and the dispute will not go through the adjudication phase.  
      
    
142.  Although not a statutory requirement, where practicable, it is the Commissioner's administrative practice to complete the adjudication phase for the purpose of resolving a dispute after the SOP phase.  
      
    
143.  However, if the adjudication phase cannot be completed (for example, because the statutory time bar is imminent), section 89N(2)(b) allows the Commissioner to amend an assessment after considering the taxpayer's SOP.  
      
    
144.  Inland Revenue officers must adequately consider the facts and legal arguments in the taxpayer's SOP before they decide whether to amend an assessment. Whether a SOP has been adequately considered will depend on what is a reasonable length of time and level of analysis for that SOP given the circumstances of the case (for example, the complexity of the issues).  
      
    
145.  Thus a simple dispute may only take a couple of days to consider adequately while a complex dispute could take a few weeks. If the statutory time bar is imminent the Inland Revenue officer will consider the taxpayer's SOP urgently.

##### Section 89N - exceptions - when an assessment can be issued without completing the disputes resolution process

146.  If a NOPA has been issued and the dispute is unresolved, the Commissioner can issue an assessment without completing the disputes resolution process under the following circumstances:

##### Exception 1: In the course of the dispute, the Commissioner considers that the taxpayer has committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act that has had the effect of delaying the completion of the disputes resolution process (section 89N(1)(c)(i)).

147.  Section 89N(1)(c)(i) reads:  
    
    > (i)  the Commissioner notifies the disputant that, in the Commissioner's opinion, the disputant in the course of the dispute has committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act that has had an effect of delaying the completion of the disputes process:
    
148.  The exception applies where the Commissioner may need to act quickly to issue an assessment because the Commissioner considers that the taxpayer has committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act that has caused undue delay to the progress of the dispute.  
      
    
149.  For example, in the course of a dispute a taxpayer obstructed Inland Revenue officers in obtaining information from the taxpayer's business premise under section 16. The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer in writing that the Commissioner considers that they have committed an offence under section 143H. The offence has the effect of delaying the completion of the disputes resolution process meaning that the Commissioner does not have to complete that process and can amend the taxpayer's assessment under section 113.  
      
    
150.  Another example of when the exception may apply is where, in the course of a dispute, a taxpayer wilfully refuses to attend an enquiry made under section 19 on the date specified in the Commissioner's notice. In these circumstances, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer in writing that the Commissioner considers that they have committed an offence under section 143F that has had the effect of delaying the completion of the disputes resolution process. The Commissioner can then exercise the discretion to amend the taxpayer's assessment under section 113 without completing the disputes resolution process.  
      
    
151.  In order to apply this exception, Inland Revenue officers must form an opinion that is honestly and reasonably justifiable on the basis of the evidence available. The Inland Revenue officer's decision must be clearly documented and stipulate the grounds and reasoning on which it is based.

##### Exception 2: A taxpayer involved in a dispute, or person associated to them, may take steps to shift, relocate or dispose of the taxpayer's assets to avoid or delay the collection of tax, making the issue of an assessment urgent (section 89N(1)(c)(ii) and (iii)).

152.  If the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the taxpayer or a person associated with them ("associated person") intends to dispose of assets in order to avoid or defer the payment of an outstanding or pending tax liability, the Commissioner can urgently issue an assessment to the taxpayer. Sections 89N(1)(c)(ii) & (iii) read:  
    
    > (ii)  the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the disputant may take steps in relation to the existence or location of the disputant's assets to avoid or delay the collection of tax from the disputant:
    > 
    >   
    > 
    > (iii)  the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that a person who is, under the 1988 version provisions in subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007, an associated person of the disputant may take steps in relation to the existence or location of the disputant's assets to avoid or delay the collection of tax from the disputant:
    
153.  In order to issue an assessment on the basis of either of the above exceptions, Inland Revenue officers must record any relevant correspondence and evidence (for example, the directors' written instructions to shift the company's assets overseas, evidence of electronic wiring of funds to overseas countries, transcripts of interviews with the taxpayer, etc) or other grounds for the reasonable belief.

##### Exception 3: The taxpayer involved in a dispute or a person associated with them involved in another dispute involving similar issues has begun judicial review proceedings in relation to the dispute (section 89N(1)(c)(iv) and (v)).

154.  Section 89N(1)(c)(iv) and (v) reads:  
    
    > (iv)  the disputant has begun judicial review proceedings in relation to the dispute:
    > 
    >   
    > 
    > (v)  a person who is, under the 1988 version provisions in subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007, an associated person of the disputant and is involved in another dispute with the Commissioner involving similar issues has begun judicial review proceedings in relation to the other dispute:
    
155.  These exceptions apply to any judicial review proceedings that are brought against the Commissioner. In judicial review proceedings, the parties' resources are likely to be directed away from advancing the dispute through the disputes resolution process.  
      
    
156.  For the purpose of section 89N(1)(c)(v), an associated person of a taxpayer under the 1988 version provisions in subpart YB of the ITA 2007 may be involved in a similar issue to the taxpayer even if the issue relates to a different revenue type. In other circumstances, the revenue type may be the same. For example, if the dispute between the Commissioner and taxpayer relates to PAYE issues, but the dispute between the Commissioner and person associated with the taxpayer relates to income tax the taxpayer may still be involved in similar issues to the person associated with them.  
      
    
157.  Even if the two disputes relate to the same revenue type, section 89N(1)(c)(v) will not apply in some circumstances. For example, the dispute with the taxpayer relates to the tax treatment of entertainment expenditure, whereas the dispute with the person associated with the taxpayer relates to the capital and revenue distinction of merger expenditure. The Commissioner would not regard these two disputes as involving similar issues.

##### Exception 4: The taxpayer fails to comply with a statutory requirement for information relating to the dispute (section 89N(1)(c)(vi)).

158.  Section 89N(1)(c)(vi) reads:  
    
    > (vi)  during the disputes process, the disputant receives from the Commissioner a requirement under a statute for information relating to the dispute and fails to comply with the requirement within a period that is specified in the requirement:
    
159.  Generally, a taxpayer provides information to Inland Revenue voluntarily. However, when this does not occur the Commissioner can seek information from the taxpayer under a statutory provision, for example section 17 or 19. (The Commissioner's practice regarding section 17 is currently set out in _SPS_ _05/08 Section 17 Notices_.) The requirement for statutory information will specify the period within which the information must be provided. This period will allow the taxpayer reasonable and sufficient time to comply.  
      
    
160.  Where the taxpayer does not comply with a formal requirement for information that relates to the dispute (for example, as a tactic to delay the progress of the disputes resolution process), the Commissioner can issue an assessment to the taxpayer without first completing the disputes resolution process.

##### Exception 5: The taxpayer elects to have the dispute heard by the TRA acting in its small claims jurisdiction (section 89N(1)(c)(vii)).

161.  Section 89N(1)(c)(vii) reads:  
    
    > (vii)  the disputant elects under section 89E to have the dispute heard by a Taxation Review Authority acting in its small claims jurisdiction:
    
162.  A taxpayer can issue a NOPA to the Commissioner under section 89D or 89DA or a NOR rejecting the Commissioner's NOPA under section 89B (please see _SPS_ _08/02:_ _Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer_).  
      
    
163.  At the same time, under section 89E(1)(a) the taxpayer can elect in their NOPA or NOR that the TRA acting in its small claims jurisdiction should hear any unresolved dispute arising from the NOPA (whether issued by the Commissioner or taxpayer), if the amount in dispute is $30,000 or less. Any such election is irrevocable, final and binding on the taxpayer. In this case, the full disputes resolution process does not have to be followed.

##### Exception 6: The parties agree in writing that the dispute should be resolved by the court or TRA without completing the disputes resolution process (section 89N(1)(c)(viii)).

164.  Section 89N(1)(c)(viii) reads:  
    
    > (viii)  the disputant and the Commissioner agree in writing that they have reached a position in which the dispute would be resolved more efficiently by being submitted to the court or Taxation Review Authority without completion of the disputes process:
    
165.  Under this exception, where the Commissioner or taxpayer commences the disputes resolution process, the parties can make such an agreement in writing before either party issues their SOP. This would occur, for example, if the parties could incur excessive compliance and administrative costs in completing the full disputes resolution process relative to the amount in dispute.  
      
    
166.  This exception allows the taxpayer to bring challenge proceedings against the Commissioner. Where this exception applies to disputes that the Commissioner or taxpayer has commenced (that is, after the parties have made the requisite agreement), the parties must have exchanged a NOPA and NOR before the taxpayer can bring challenge proceedings under section 138B(1) or (3).

##### Exception 7: The parties agree in writing to suspend the disputes process pending the outcome of a test case (section 89N(1)(c)(ix)).

167.  Section 89N(1)(c)(ix) reads:  
    
    > (ix)  the disputant and the Commissioner agree in writing to suspend proceedings in the dispute pending a decision in a test case referred to in section 89O.
    
168.  Section 89O(2) allows a dispute to be suspended pending the result of a test case. Pursuant to section 89O(3), the parties can agree in writing to suspend the dispute from the date of the agreement until the earliest date that:  
    
    1.  the court's decision is made, or  
        
    2.  the test case is otherwise resolved, or  
        
    3.  the dispute is otherwise resolved.
    
      
    
169.  If the parties agree to suspend the disputes resolution process, any statutory time bar affecting the dispute is stayed. The Commissioner can then make an assessment that is consistent with the test case decision. (However, the taxpayer is not precluded from challenging the Commissioner's assessment under section 89D(1), even if it is consistent with the test case decision.)  
      
    
170.  The Commissioner must issue an amended assessment or perform an action within the time limit specified in section 89O(5).  
      
    
171.  Section 89O(5) reads:  
    
    > The Commissioner must make an amended assessment, or perform an action, that is the subject of a suspended dispute by the later of the following:
    > 
    > (a)  the day that is 60 days after the last day of the suspension:
    > 
    > (b)  the last day of the period that -
    > 
    > > (i)  begins on the day following the day by which the Commissioner, in the absence of the suspension, would be required under the Inland Revenue Acts to make the amended assessment, or perform the action; and
    > > 
    > > (ii)  contains the same number of days as does the period of the suspension.
    
172.  If the statutory time bar arising under section 108 or 108A is imminent, section 89O(5) allows the Commissioner more time to complete the disputes resolution process.  
      
    
173.  For example, the Commissioner commences a dispute and on 1 March 2007 agrees with the taxpayer in writing to suspend the disputes proceedings pending the decision in a designated test case. The disputed issue is subject to a statutory time bar that commences after 31 March 2007 and the taxpayer does not agree to delay its application under section 108B(1)(a). A decision is reached in the test case on 31 July 2007.  
      
    
174.  The Commissioner must make an amended assessment or perform an action that is the subject of the suspended dispute by 29 September 2007. This date is calculated as follows:  
    1.  The suspension period commences on the date of the agreement (1 March 2007) and ends on the date of the court's decision in the test case (31 July 2007). This is a period of 153 days.  
          
        
    2.  The last date that the Commissioner can make an amended assessment falls on the later of the following two dates:  
          
        1.  29 September 2007, that is 60 days after the date that the suspension period ends on 31 July 2007 pursuant to section 89O(5)(a), and  
              
            
        2.  31 August 2007, that is 153 days after the period commences on 1 April 2007 pursuant to section 89O(5)(b).

##### Exception 8: The Commissioner applies to the High Court for an order to allow more time to complete or dispense with the disputes process.

175.  Section 89N(3) reads:  
    
    > ... \[T\]he Commissioner may apply to the High Court for an order that allows more time for the completion of the disputes process, or for an order that completion of the disputes process is not required.
    
176.  The Commissioner envisages that this exception will be used if section 89N(1)(c) does not apply and there are exceptional circumstances.  
      
    
177.  Any application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3) must be based on reasonable grounds. Whether there are reasonable grounds will depend on considerations such as the complexity of the issues in the dispute, whether the taxpayer has caused delays, the dispute involves large amounts of revenue or there were significant matters in the dispute that were unforeseen by either party and provided a justification for the delay.  
      
    
178.  For example, due to unusual circumstances the Commissioner does not learn about a proposed adjustment until late. Further delays by the taxpayer and the need for the Commissioner to obtain significant legal advice means that the Adjudication Unit cannot consider the dispute before the time bar starts. In this circumstance, the Commissioner may apply to the High Court for an order that allows more time for the disputes process to be completed under section 89N(3). (Note: This is only an example of a possible unforeseen situation and it is anticipated that there will be a wide variety of circumstances under which an application under section 89N(3) will be appropriate.)  
      
    
179.  The Commissioner's application to the High Court under section 89N(3) is subject to statutory time limits. The Commissioner must apply before the four-year statutory time bar falls due.  
      
    
180.  The Commissioner must also issue an amended assessment within the time limit specified in section 89N(5). Section 89N(5) reads:  
    
    > If the Commissioner makes an application under subsection (3), the Commissioner must make an amended assessment by the last day of the period that -
    > 
    >   
    > 
    > (a)  begins on the day following the day by which the Commissioner, in the absence of the suspension, would be required under the Inland Revenue Acts to make the amended assessment; and
    > 
    >   
    > 
    > (b)  contains the total of -
    > 
    >   
    > 
    > > (i)  the number of days between the date on which the Commissioner files the application in the High Court and the earliest date on which the application is decided by the High Court or the application or dispute is resolved:
    > > 
    > >   
    > > 
    > > (ii)  the number of days allowed by an order of a court as a result of the application.
    
181.  Section 89N(5) allows the Commissioner more time to complete the disputes resolution process where the statutory time bar under section 108 or 108A is imminent.  
      
    
182.  For example, the Commissioner commences the disputes resolution process. On 1 March 2007 the Commissioner applies to the High Court under section 89N(3) for an order allowing more time to complete the process. The disputed issue is subject to a statutory time bar that commences after 31 March 2007 and the taxpayer does not agree to delay its application under section 108B(1)(a). On 30 June 2007, the High Court makes an order that allows the Commissioner's application and gives the Commissioner 30 further days to complete the disputes resolution process.  
      
    
183.  Pursuant to section 89N(5), the Commissioner must make an amended assessment by 30 August 2007. This date is calculated as follows:  
    
    1.  The Commissioner would have one month to make the amended assessment before the statutory time bar commences. That is, 1 March 2007 to 31 March 2007. The period during which an amended assessment must be made under section 89N(5)(a) commences on 1 April 2007.  
        
    2.  The period during which the assessment must be made includes 122 days, that is the period between 1 March 2007 and 30 June 2007 (the date of the decision) under section 89N(5)(b)(i) and the 30-day period allowed by the High Court order under section 89N(5)(b)(ii). This is a total of 152 days.  
        
    3.  The Commissioner must issue an amended assessment to the taxpayer on the date that is 152 days from 1 April 2007. That is, by 30 August 2007.
    
      
    
184.  During the period from 1 March to 30 August 2007, the parties may continue to attempt to resolve the dispute. This may include exchanging SOPs and going through the adjudication process.  
      
    
185.  The above example indicates that the Commissioner has more time to complete the disputes resolution process. The time bar will not commence until 30 August 2007.  
      
    
186.  Where the Commissioner applies to the High Court under section 89N(3) for an order to truncate the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner must issue an assessment within the period as calculated under section 89N(5). Applying the same facts as in the above example, the Commissioner must issue an assessment to the taxpayer by 30 August 2007.

##### Application of the exceptions in section 89N(1)(c)

187.  The Commissioner's practice is that the parties must endeavour to resolve the dispute before or via the adjudication process. If this is not possible and any of the eight exceptions in section 89N(1)(c) apply the Commissioner can amend an assessment without completing the whole disputes resolution process, that is, before the parties accept a NOPA, NOR or SOP that the other has issued, or the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer's SOP. This will conclude the disputes resolution process and the dispute will not go through the Adjudication phase.  
      
    
188.  In this circumstance, the taxpayer can challenge the Commissioner's assessment by filing proceedings in the TRA (either acting in its general or small claims jurisdiction) or the High Court within the applicable response period, that is, within two months starting on the date that the notice of assessment is issued (please see paragraph 166 of this SPS).

#### Taxpayer's response to the Commissioner's NOPA: NOR

189.  If a taxpayer disagrees with the Commissioner's proposed adjustment, then, under section 89G(1), they must advise the Commissioner that any or all of the proposed adjustments are rejected by issuing a NOR within the two-month response period. That is, within two months starting on the date that the Commissioner's NOPA is issued. The Commissioner interprets this as requiring Inland Revenue's receipt of the NOR within the response period.  
      
    
190.  For example, if a NOPA is issued on 8 April 2007, the taxpayer must advise the Commissioner that it is rejected by issuing a NOR to the Commissioner for receipt on or before 7 June 2007. However, taxpayers are encouraged to issue their NOR to the Commissioner once they have completed it.  
      
    
191.  The Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent two weeks before the response period expires to ascertain whether the taxpayer will issue a NOR in response to the Commissioner's NOPA. Such contact may be made by telephone or letter.  
      
    
192.  Section 89G(2) specifies the content requirements of a NOR. The taxpayer must state concisely in the NOR:  
    
    1.  the facts or legal arguments in the Commissioner's NOPA that they consider are wrong, and  
        
    2.  why they consider that those facts and arguments are wrong, and  
        
    3.  any facts and legal arguments that they rely upon, and  
        
    4.  how the legal arguments apply to the facts, and  
        
    5.  the quantitative adjustments to any figure proposed in the Commissioner's NOPA that results from the facts and legal arguments that the taxpayer relies upon.
    
      
    
193.  In respect of the requirement under section 89G(2)(c) that the taxpayer specifies the facts and legal arguments upon which they are relying, the taxpayer can also refer to legislative provisions, case law and any legal arguments that are raised in the Commissioner's NOPA. The taxpayer does not have to refer to different legislative provisions, case law and legal arguments.  
      
    
194.  Pursuant to section 89G(2)(e), the requirement for a quantitative adjustment establishes to what extent the taxpayer considers that the Commissioner's adjustment in the NOPA is incorrect. This amount need not be exact, however, every attempt should be made to ensure that it is as accurate as possible. The amount in dispute can be altered, as the dispute progresses irrespective of whether the parties have agreed on the new figure.

#### Deemed acceptance

195.  Under section 89H(1), if the taxpayer:  
    
    1.  has not issued a NOR within the two-month response period, and  
        
    2.  there are no exceptional circumstances as defined in section 89K(3),  
          
        the taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the adjustment that is proposed in the Commissioner's NOPA and section 89I applies. The Commissioner will usually advise the taxpayer that the deemed acceptance has occurred within two weeks after the two-month response period expires.
    
      
    
196.  Pursuant to section 89I(2), the Commissioner must include or take into account each proposed adjustment that the taxpayer accepts or is deemed to accept in a notice of assessment issued to the taxpayer.

##### Exceptional circumstances under section 89K

197.  Section 89K(3) reads:  
    
    > (a)  an exceptional circumstance arises if-
    > 
    >   
    > 
    > > (i)  an event or circumstance beyond the control of a disputant provides the disputant with a reasonable justification for not rejecting a proposed adjustment, or for not issuing a notice of proposed adjustment or statement of position, within the response period for the notice:
    > > 
    > >   
    > > 
    > > (ii)  a disputant is late in issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, notice of response or statement of position but the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, or results from 1 or more statutory holidays falling in the response period:
    > 
    > (b)  an act or omission of an agent of a disputant is not an exceptional circumstance unless-
    > 
    >   
    > 
    > > (i)  it was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent that could not have been anticipated, and its effect could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct;
    > > 
    > >   
    > > 
    > > (ii)  the agent is late in issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, notice of response or statement of position but the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, or results from 1 or more statutory holidays falling in the response period.
    
198.  The legislation defines exceptional circumstances very narrowly. The cases regarding "exceptional circumstances," such as _Treasury Technology Holdings Ltd v CIR_ (1998) 18 NZTC 13,752, _Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR_ (1998) 18 NZTC 14,005, _Fuji Xerox NZ Ltd v CIR_ (2001) 17,470 (CA), _Hollis v CIR_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,570 and _Balich v CIR_, unreported High Court, Auckland Registry, CIV 2006-404-4113, 21 February 2007 are also relevant.  
      
    
199.  The case law confirms that the definition of "exceptional circumstances" in sections 89K(3) and 138D should be applied consistently. The following guidelines have emerged from the case law:  
    
    1.  a taxpayer's misunderstanding or erroneous calculation of the applicable response period will usually not be regarded as an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer's control under section 89K(3)(a)  
        
    2.  an agent's failure to advise their client that they have received a notice of assessment or other relevant document that causes the taxpayer to respond outside the applicable response period will not generally be considered to be an exceptional circumstance under section 89K(3)(b) (_Hollis v CIR_)  
        
    3.  an exceptional circumstance can arise if the taxpayer has relied on misleading information regarding the applicable response period given to them by the Commissioner that has caused them to respond outside that response period (_Hollis v CIR_).
    
      
    
200.  The Commissioner will only accept a late NOR on rare occasions. Please see _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 8, No 3 (August 1996) for some examples of situations that can be an "exceptional circumstance" beyond a taxpayer's control.  
      
    
201.  The exception for lateness as a result of statutory holidays is self explanatory. The Commissioner can also accept a late NOR if the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, that is, the document was only one to two days late and the other factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion under section 89K(1) are satisfied. (Please see discussion in paragraph 203.)  
      
    
202.  For example, the response period ends on Saturday and the taxpayer provides a NOR on the following Tuesday. The Commissioner treats the response period as ending on Monday on the basis of section 35(6) of the Interpretation Act 1999 and accepts that the lateness of the NOR was minimal. That is, the Commissioner has received the NOR within one to two days of Monday, the last day of the response period. If the response period ended on Friday and the taxpayer provided the NOR on the following Monday, the Commissioner would also accept that the lateness is minimal.  
      
    
203.  Besides the degree of lateness, the Commissioner considers that the exercise of the discretion under section 89K(1) requires that the following factors are also taken into account:  
    
    1.  the date on which the NOR was issued, and  
        
    2.  the response period within which the NOR should be issued, and  
        
    3.  the real event, circumstance or reason why the taxpayer failed to issue the NOR within the response period, and  
        
    4.  the taxpayer's compliance history in relation to the tax types under consideration (for example, has the taxpayer paid tax or filed a tax return or NOR late in the past?)
    
      
    
204.  For example, a taxpayer issues a NOR to the Commissioner two days after the applicable "response period" has expired. The taxpayer does not provide a legitimate reason for the lateness. The taxpayer also has a history of filing late NORs within the minimal allowable lateness period (that is, up to two days outside the applicable "response period") and has been advised on the calculation of the "response period" on more than one occasion.  
      
    
205.  Although the degree of lateness was minimal on each occasion, the Commissioner would not accept the taxpayer's NOR in this circumstance. This ensures that the section 89K(3)(b)(ii) exception is not treated as an extension of the "response period" in all circumstances.  
      
    
206.  The Commissioner will consider a taxpayer's application made under section 89K(1)(b) after receiving the relevant NOR or SOP. The responsible officer will document the reasons for accepting or rejecting the taxpayer's application and advise the taxpayer of their decision in writing within 15 working days after Inland Revenue receives the application.  
      
    
207.  The taxpayer must provide reasons to support their claim that exceptional circumstances exist under section 89K(3). The taxpayer should address the factors referred to in paragraph 203. If the reasons provided are unclear, the Commissioner may require further information and give the taxpayer an opportunity to provide that information before determining whether section 89K applies.  
      
    
208.  If the Commissioner rejects a taxpayer's application made under section 89K to treat a NOR or SOP as made within the response period, the taxpayer will be deemed to have accepted the proposed adjustment made in the Commissioner's NOPA. (Any decision that the Commissioner makes under section 89K is not a "disputable decision".)

##### Receipt of a taxpayer's notice of response

209.  When Inland Revenue receives a taxpayer's NOR, it will usually be forwarded to the responsible officer within five working days after its receipt. Upon receipt, the responsible officer will ascertain and record the following:  
    1.  the date on which the NOR was issued, and  
        
    2.  whether the NOR has been issued within two months starting on the date that the Commissioner's NOPA is issued, and  
        
    3.  the salient features of the NOR including any deficiencies in its content.  
          
        
210.  Where it is practicable, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer or their tax agent by telephone or in writing within 10 working days that Inland Revenue has received the NOR.  
      
    
211.  The Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to advise the taxpayer or their tax agent within one month after receiving the NOR whether the NOR is being considered or has been accepted, rejected in full or in part.  
      
    
212.  Where the NOR is accepted in full, the Commissioner will usually issue to the taxpayer written confirmation that the NOR has been accepted in full and, if applicable, a notice of assessment within one month after advising that the NOR is accepted.  
      
    
213.  If the Commissioner must investigate further before deciding to accept or reject a NOR, the responsible officer will regularly update the taxpayer or their agent on the progress of the further analysis or enquiry work that is undertaken.

##### Deficiencies in the content of the notice of response

214.  Where Inland Revenue has received a NOR that it considers has deficiencies (that is, the requirements under section 89G(2) are not met), the responsible officer will take reasonable steps to make the taxpayer correct the information in the NOR before the response period expires.  
      
    
215.  The taxpayer will be advised as soon as practicable that the NOR is invalid unless rectified and the additional or correct information must be provided within the response period.  
      
    
216.  The taxpayer will also be advised when the response period expires and that those deficiencies must be rectified to validate the NOR by then or within the minimal lateness period allowed pursuant to section 89K(3)(a)(ii) (please see paragraph 201) and whether the Commissioner intends to provide any additional information to the taxpayer.  
      
    
217.  Taxpayers are encouraged to issue their NOR immediately after they have completed it because they could have insufficient time to rectify any invalidities or deficiencies if the response period is due to expire.  
      
    
218.  If a taxpayer does not provide the correct information in respect of a deficient NOR before the response period expires, they will be deemed to have accepted the proposed adjustment under section 89H(1), unless any of the exceptional circumstances under section 89K applies. This will conclude the dispute and preclude the taxpayer's right to challenge the adjustments before the High Court or TRA.

#### Conference

##### Conduct of a conference

219.  Generally, if a dispute remains unresolved after the NOR phase, the conference phase will follow. The Commissioner will usually initiate the conference phase in a timely manner, that is within one month after the taxpayer's NOR is received. However, the Commissioner will not seek to advance the disputes resolution process by commencing the conference phase before the taxpayer's NOR has been fully considered.  
      
    
220.  If the start of the conference phase is delayed (for example, to allow legal advice to be obtained) the responsible officer will keep the taxpayer informed regarding the progress of the conference. The suggested average time frame for the conference phase is three months. However, this time will vary depending on the facts and complexities of the specific cases.  
      
    
221.  A conference is not statutorily required. Rather, the conference phase is an administrative process that aims to clarify and, if possible, resolve the disputed issues. However, the conference phase should not be used by either party to the dispute for the purpose of delaying the completion of the disputes resolution process.  
      
    
222.  The conference should be conducted in a way that is sufficiently flexible and consistent with the taxpayer's wishes and any other relevant factors such as the scope of the investigation. The Commissioner will establish a time frame to meet with the taxpayer and their advisors and, sometimes, if necessary, Inland Revenue officers will meet with the taxpayer immediately after considering further information. Where appropriate the conference can be adjourned to allow the parties to reconsider the positions that they have taken in the dispute.  
      
    
223.  A conference can range from a telephone call to several face-to-face meetings between the parties. If the parties are relying on expert evidence the experts may also attend the conference. All discussions in the conference must be recorded or otherwise documented (to provide the best record of such discussions and promote the free flow of conversation) and a consensus reached if possible.  
      
    
224.  Any discussions between the parties in the conference can include an agreement on facts, common grounds on which the dispute can proceed, a time frame for completing the disputes resolution process and an agreed adjustment. Recordings of discussions can be made on audio or video tape, MP3 and CD recorders, the FTR Gold system or by using any other suitable audio or visual technology. Any negotiations between the parties after the "on record" discussion of the disputed issues during the conference will be treated as being on a without prejudice basis if an agreement is not reached.  
      
    
225.  When a dispute remains unresolved after the conference phase has been completed, the Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice together with a SOP pursuant to section 89M(3) without any unnecessary delay.  
      
    
226.  The conference phase is not necessarily complete just because the parties have held the final meeting. For example, the parties may need further information or to consider further submissions made at the meetings. This will dictate when the Commissioner issues a disclosure notice. Also, the parties can engage in further discussions during or after the SOP phase to attempt to resolve some or all of the disputed issues.

##### Legal and other advisers attending a conference

227.  If a dispute is not settled earlier, the parties can obtain expert legal or other tax advice during the conference phase in addition to any legal or other advice previously obtained. These advisers can attend any meetings in relation to the dispute. The advisers may also revisit some items that the parties have previously discussed (but not agreed to in writing or otherwise accepted).

##### Conference not held or abridged

228.  The Commissioner considers that the conference phase is an important part of the disputes resolution process and will always attend a conference if requested by the taxpayer. If the parties are not in the same location the conference can be held at a place that is convenient for both parties.  
      
    
229.  In some circumstances, the Commissioner will not hold further discussions or a conference, notwithstanding that the Commissioner has not reached an agreement with the taxpayer.  
      
    
230.  However, the disputes resolution process will not be finished, because the disclosure notice and SOP phases will still be undertaken. A dispute that is not resolved in the SOP phase will generally be referred to adjudication for determination.  
      
    
231.  A conference can be dispensed with or abridged in one or more of the following situations, if:  
    
    1.  there are revenue losses incurred as a result of delaying tactics that the taxpayer used to frustrate the collection of tax and the completion of the disputes resolution process, or  
        
    2.  the Commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer or their agent is acting in a frivolous or vexatious manner. For example, where the taxpayer or their agent is setting unreasonable demands about the time, place, or terms of such meeting(s), or conducts themselves unreasonably at any meeting, or  
        
    3.  the taxpayer contests the Commissioner's policy and it is agreed to disagree or that a conference would not benefit the parties, or  
        
    4.  the taxpayer advises the Commissioner that they want to dispense with the conference.
    
      
      
    
232.  Where it is practicable, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer or their tax agent of the decision regarding whether or not the conference phase will be dispensed with or abridged in writing within seven days of that decision being made. The reasons for the final decision must be documented.

#### Disclosure notice

233.  The Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice under section 89M(1), unless the Commissioner:  
    1.  does not have to complete the disputes resolution process because any of the exceptions under section 89N(1)(c) apply (please see earlier discussion), or  
        
    2.  does not have to complete the disputes resolution process because the High Court has made an order that the dispute resolution process can be truncated pursuant to an application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3), or  
        
    3.  has already issued to the taxpayer a notice of disputable decision that includes or takes into account the adjustment proposed in the NOPA pursuant to section 89M(2).  
          
        
234.  Pursuant to the definition in section 3(1), a disputable decision is:  
    1.  an assessment, or  
        
    2.  a decision that the Commissioner makes under a tax law, except for a decision:  
        1.  to decline to issue a binding ruling, or  
            
        2.  that cannot be the subject of an objection or challenge, or  
            
        3.  that is left to the Commissioner's discretion under sections 89K, 89L, 89M(8), (10) and 89N(3).  
              
            
235.  When issuing a disclosure notice the Commissioner must also provide to the taxpayer the Commissioner's SOP (as discussed below) and include in the disclosure notice a reference to section 138G and a statement regarding the effect of the evidence exclusion rule pursuant to section 89M(3).  
      
    
236.  The Commissioner will usually advise the taxpayer two weeks before issuing the disclosure notice and SOP that these documents will be issued to them.  
      
    
237.  Where practicable, the Commissioner will contact the taxpayer shortly after the disclosure notice and SOP are issued to ascertain whether the taxpayer has received these documents.  
      
    
238.  If the taxpayer has not received the Commissioner's disclosure notice, for example, due to a postal error or an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer's control, the Commissioner will issue another disclosure notice to the taxpayer. In this circumstance, the response period within which the taxpayer must respond with their SOP will commence from the date that the Commissioner issued the initial disclosure notice.  
      
    
239.  Where the taxpayer cannot issue a SOP within the applicable response period, they may issue a late SOP with an explanation of why it is late. The Commissioner will consider the late SOP in terms of the discretion under section 89K(1). (Please see paragraphs 197 to 199 for further discussion).

##### Evidence exclusion rule

240.  A disclosure notice is the document that triggers the application of the evidence exclusion rule. The Commissioner must explain the effect of the evidence exclusion rule and refer to section 138G in the disclosure notice, because this is one of the guiding principles of the disputes resolution process (please see paragraph 260 for further discussion).

##### Issue of a disclosure notice

241.  The Commissioner can issue a disclosure notice at any time on or after the date that either party issues their NOPA.  
      
    
242.  Usually, the Commissioner will issue a disclosure notice after receiving a NOR, following the conference phase and in accordance with the time line agreed with the taxpayer.  
      
    
243.  The Commissioner's practice is to issue a disclosure notice within three months after all enquiries are concluded and the conference phase has been completed.  
      
    
244.  However, at times the Commissioner cannot issue a disclosure notice where, for example, the relevant Inland Revenue officer is still collecting additional information or further investigating the taxpayer. The responsible officer must ensure that any information gathering and investigative activity is not excessive and the disclosure notice is issued promptly once the information gathering or investigation is complete. The responsible officer will advise the taxpayer two weeks before issuing a disclosure notice that it will be issued to them.  
      
    
245.  In these circumstances, the relevant officer should use one of the relevant statutory provisions to obtain any information needed to complete the conference or disclosure notice and SOP phases to ensure that the disputes resolution process is conducted in a timely and efficient manner.  
      
    
246.  Where a disclosure notice is issued earlier (for example, the facts are clear, the taxpayer has agreed on the disputed issues or a conference is not required) the reasons must be documented and explained to the taxpayer.  
      
    
247.  When deciding whether to issue a disclosure notice before the conference phase has been completed, Inland Revenue officers must be aware that, if the taxpayer discloses any new or novel matters in their SOP, they only have two months to reply under section 89M(8) barring a High Court application before the two-month period expires. (Please see section 89M(10)).

#### Statement of position

248.  Pursuant to section 89M(3), when the Commissioner commences the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner must issue a SOP to the taxpayer together with the disclosure notice.  
      
    
249.  When the disputed issue relates to a tax type that is subject to the statutory time bar (for example, income tax, GST, etc) that falls within the current income year, the parties will endeavour to complete the disputes resolution process before the time bar starts. The parties can agree to a statutory time bar waiver if they have issued a SOP to each other and there is insufficient time to complete the adjudication process.  
      
    
250.  However, if no such agreement is reached, section 89N(2)(b) allows the Commissioner to advance to the next stage if the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer's SOP and completed the compulsory elements of the disputes process. The Commissioner can amend the assessment by exercising the discretion under section 113.  
      
    
251.  Whether the Commissioner has adequately considered a SOP will depend on what is a reasonable length of time and level of analysis for that SOP given the circumstances of the case (for example, the length of the SOP and the complexity of the legal issues).  
      
    
252.  Thus a simple dispute could only take a couple of days to consider adequately while a complex dispute could take a few weeks. If the statutory time bar is imminent the Inland Revenue officer will consider the taxpayer's SOP urgently.

##### Contents of a SOP

253.  Generally, the contents of a SOP are binding. This is because matters that proceed to court are subject to the "evidence exclusion rule" which limits the parties to the facts, evidence (excluding oral evidence), issues and propositions of law that either party discloses in their SOP unless a court order is made under section 138G(2) allowing new facts and evidence to be raised.  
      
    
254.  However, a mistaken description of facts, evidence, issues or propositions of law and submissions made in the SOP can later be amended if the parties agree to include additional information in the SOPs under section 89M(13).  
      
    
255.  Under section 89M(4) the SOP must be in the prescribed form (_IR773 Statement of position_). The SOP must contain sufficient detail to fairly inform the taxpayer of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law that the Commissioner wishes to rely on.  
      
    
256.  The minimum content requirements for a SOP under section 89M(4) are an outline of the relevant facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law. However, to allow the Adjudication Unit to successfully reach a decision, the SOP must also contain full, complete and detailed submissions.  
      
    
257.  An outline that consists of a frank and complete discussion of the issues, law, arguments and evidence supporting the argument is implicit in the spirit and intent of the disputes resolution process. (In very complex cases a full explanation of the relevant evidence and summary of less relevant evidence will be accepted.)  
      
    
258.  The disputes resolution process does not require that relevant documents are discovered or full briefs of evidence or exhaustive lists of documents exchanged. Rather, providing an outline of relevant evidence in the SOP will ensure that both parties appreciate the availability of evidence in respect of the factual issues in dispute. The Commissioner should ensure that an outline of any expert evidence on which they intend to rely is included in the SOP.  
      
    
259.  Submissions made in the NOPA phase must be sufficiently concise to enable the parties to progress the dispute without incurring substantial expense. However, at the SOP phase, if the issues are unresolved and likely to proceed to a court for resolution, then full, complete and detailed submissions should be made.  
      
    
260.  Subject to section 138G(2), the evidence exclusion rule prevents the court considering arguments and evidence that are not included in:  
    1.  the SOP, or  
        
    2.  any additional information that:  
        1.  the Commissioner provides under section 89M(8), that is deemed to be part of the Commissioner's SOP under subsection (9), and  
            
        2.  the parties provide pursuant to an agreement under section 89M(13), that is deemed to be part of the provider's SOP under subsection (14).  
              
            
261.  Section 89M(6B) reads:  
    
    > In subsection 4(b) and 6(b), evidence refers to the available documentary evidence on which the person intends to rely, but does not include a list of potential witnesses, whether or not identified by name.
    
262.  Pursuant to section 89M(6B), only documentary evidence and not potential witnesses must be listed in the SOP. Any witnesses' identities will continue to be protected without undermining the effect of the evidence exclusion rule.  
      
    
263.  If the SOP discusses shortfall penalties it must also state any other appropriate penalties of lesser percentages and shortfall penalty reductions (for example, voluntary disclosure or previous behaviour reductions) as alternative arguments. This ensures that the appropriate penalties are assessed in all cases. However, the Commissioner cannot propose shortfall penalties at the SOP phase that have not previously been proposed in the Commissioner's NOPA.

##### Receipt of a taxpayer's SOP in response

264.  Where the Commissioner has issued a disclosure notice and SOP, the taxpayer must, subject to section 89M(11), issue a SOP within the two-month response period that starts on the date that the disclosure notice was issued.  
      
    
265.  Therefore, the Commissioner cannot consider a document that the taxpayer purports to issue as a SOP before the Commissioner has issued the disclosure notice because it will not have been issued within the response period. The taxpayer should resubmit this document after the disclosure notice is issued.  
      
    
266.  Pursuant to section 89M(11), the taxpayer can apply to the High Court within the response period for more time to reply to the Commissioner's SOP. The taxpayer must show that they had not previously discussed the disputed issue with the Commissioner and, thus, it is unreasonable to reply to the Commissioner's SOP within the response period.  
      
    
267.  The Commissioner will make a reasonable effort to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent two weeks before the response period expires to determine whether the taxpayer will issue a SOP in response to the disclosure notice. Such contact can be made by telephone or in writing.  
      
    
268.  The taxpayer's SOP will be referred to the responsible officer within five working days after Inland Revenue receives it. Upon receipt, the responsible officer will ascertain and record the following:  
    1.  the date on which the SOP was issued, and  
        
    2.  whether the SOP has been issued within the relevant response period, and  
        
    3.  the SOP's salient features including any deficiencies in its content.  
          
        
269.  Where it is practicable, Inland Revenue will acknowledge the taxpayer's SOP as received within 10 working days after receiving it. However, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer or their agent of any deficiencies in the SOP's content as soon as practicable.  
      
    
270.  A taxpayer who has issued a SOP outside the applicable response period can apply for consideration of exceptional circumstances under section 89K. The reasons for accepting or rejecting the application must be documented and the responsible officer will make reasonable efforts to advise the taxpayer of the decision in writing within 15 working days after Inland Revenue receives the taxpayer's application.  
      
    
271.  A taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the Commissioner's SOP if they do not reply to it with their own SOP within two months after the date that the disclosure notice is issued and none of the exceptional circumstances under section 89K apply. Where practicable, the Commissioner will usually advise the taxpayer that deemed acceptance has occurred within two weeks after the date that the response period for the disclosure notice expires.

##### The Commissioner's response

272.  Pursuant to section 89M(8), the Commissioner can, within two months after the taxpayer's SOP is issued, provide to the taxpayer additional information in response to matters that they have raised in their SOP.  
      
    
273.  The Commissioner can only provide additional information in response to new or novel information or arguments that the taxpayer has raised in their SOP or agreed to add to their SOP under section 89M(13). The Commissioner cannot add further information simply because it was omitted from the Commissioner's SOP (for example, information that was received under a section 17 notice after the SOP was issued).  
      
    
274.  The additional information must be provided as far as possible in the same format as the SOP to which it relates (that is, in accordance with section 89M(4)). As mentioned above, the additional information can include documentary evidence but not lists of potential witnesses.  
      
    
275.  If the Commissioner intends to provide additional information to the taxpayer under section 89M(8), the Commissioner will usually advise the taxpayer or their tax agent of this within two weeks after the taxpayer's SOP is received. However, the timing of this advice can vary depending on the facts and complexity of the dispute. The additional information provided under section 89M(8) is deemed to be part of the Commissioner's SOP. Thus, the evidence exclusion rule under section 138G applies to the additional information.  
      
    
276.  The taxpayer cannot reply to the additional information that the Commissioner provides, unless the parties agree that additional information will be accepted under section 89M(13).

#### Agreement to include additional information

277.  Either party can agree to include additional information in their SOP under section 89M(13) at any time during the disputes resolution process including after the dispute has been referred to the Adjudication Unit. Although there is no statutory time limit, the Commissioner's practice is to allow one month (from the date that the Commissioner provides additional information under section 89M(8)) for such an agreement to be reached and information provided.  
      
    
278.  However, before agreeing to a request made by the taxpayer under section 89M(13) the Commissioner will consider the taxpayer's prior conduct and whether they could have provided the information earlier through the application of due diligence.  
      
    
279.  The Commissioner will usually also consider the materiality and relevance of the additional information and its capacity to help resolve the dispute and may decide to take it into account in coming to an assessment. In this circumstance, both parties will be expected to cooperate in resolving the relevance and accuracy of any such material. The Commissioner may wish to apply resources to verification and comment and this will be considered by the adjudicator.  
      
    
280.  If a taxpayer's request to include additional information in their SOP is declined, the reasons must be documented with detailed reference to the taxpayer's conduct, level of cooperation before the request was made and why the information was not provided earlier. The responsible officer will also advise the taxpayer or their tax agent of the reasons why their request was declined.  
      
    
281.  Any agreement to add further information to the SOP will be made subject to the taxpayer agreeing that the Commissioner can include a response to the additional information to the SOPs, if required, within an agreed time frame.  
      
    
282.  Any additional information that the parties provide under section 89M(13) will be deemed to form part of the provider's SOP under section 89M(14). Thus, the evidence exclusion rule under section 138G applies to the additional information.

#### Preparation for adjudication

283.  The Adjudication Unit is part of Inland Revenue's Office of the Chief Tax Counsel and represents the final step of the disputes resolution process. The adjudicator's role is to review unresolved disputes by taking a fresh look at a tax dispute and the application of law to the facts in an impartial and independent manner and provide a comprehensive and technically accurate decision that will ensure the correctness of the assessment.  
      
    
284.  Generally, the adjudicator will make such a decision within four months after the case is referred to the Adjudication Unit. However, this will depend on the number of disputes that are before the Adjudication Unit, any allocation delays and the technical, legal and factual complexity of those disputes. (For further information on the time frame for adjudication of disputes please see the article titled "Adjudication Unit - Its role in the dispute resolution process" that was published in the _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol. 19, No. 10 (November 2007).)  
      
    
285.  The adjudication process is an administrative (rather than a legislative) one. Recent judicial comments have been made in _C of IR v Zentrum Holdings Limited and Another, Ch'elle Properties (NZ) Limited v CIR_ (2004) 21 NZTC 18,618 and _ANZ National Bank Ltd and others v C of IR_ _(No. 2)_ (2006) 22 NZTC 19,835 indicating that, as a matter of law, it is not strictly necessary for Inland Revenue officers to send all disputes to the Adjudication Unit for review and Inland Revenue officers are not necessarily bound by the Adjudication Unit's decisions.  
      
    
286.  Notwithstanding the above judicial comments, if the parties have not agreed on all the issues at the end of the conference and disclosure phases or to truncate the disputes resolution process under section 89N(1)(c)(viii), it is the Commissioner's policy and practice that all disputes are to be sent to the Adjudication Unit for review, irrespective of the complexity or type of issues or amount of tax involved unless any of the following exceptions arise:  
    
    1.  the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer's SOP for the purposes of section 89N(2)(b) and referred the dispute to the Adjudication Unit for their preliminary consideration and the Adjudication Unit has determined that it has insufficient time to reach a decision in respect of the dispute before a statutory time bar would prevent an assessment from being increased (please see paragraph 250 to 252 for further discussion), or  
        
    2.  any of the legislative exceptions specified in section 89N(1)(c) apply (please see paragraphs 146 to 188for further discussion) so that the Commissioner can amend an assessment without first completing the disputes resolution process, or  
        
    3.  the High Court has made an order that the disputes resolution process can be truncated pursuant to an application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3) (please see paragraphs 175 to 186 for further discussion).
    
      
    
287.  The decision not to refer the case to adjudication must be made by an Inland Revenue officer with a senior level of authority in Service Delivery (for example, at the time of writing this SPS the delegation was with Assurance Manager level or above). In respect of the first exception mentioned in paragraph 286(a) it is necessary that the parties have exchanged a SOP and it is a matter solely for the Adjudication Unit to determine whether it has insufficient time to fully consider the dispute.  
      
    
288.  Thus, during the course of a dispute, the Commissioner can issue an amended assessment to the taxpayer, for example, if the parties have agreed under section 89N(1)(c)(viii) to abridge the adjudication phase. Furthermore, before the dispute is referred to the Adjudication Unit, the taxpayer can request that the Commissioner issues an amended assessment and then challenge that assessment under section 138B(1).  
      
    
289.  If the dispute is to be referred to the Adjudication Unit, the Commissioner should not issue an assessment or amended assessment before the adjudication process is completed unless a time bar is imminent. In this circumstance, the responsible officer will prepare a cover sheet that will record all the documents that must be sent to the Adjudication Unit.  
      
    
290.  The cover sheet together with copies of the documents (NOPA, NOR, notice rejecting the NOR, conference notes, both parties' SOP, additional information, material evidence including expert opinions and a schedule of all evidence held) and any recordings of discussions held during the conference must be sent to the Adjudication Unit.  
      
    
291.  If the dispute is to be referred to adjudication, the responsible officer will issue a letter together with a copy of the cover sheet to the taxpayer before sending the submissions, notes and evidence to the Adjudication Unit. The cover sheet and letter are usually completed within one month after the date that the Commissioner's reply to the taxpayer's SOP (if any) is issued or the response period for the taxpayer's SOP expires.  
      
    
292.  The purpose of this letter is to seek concurrence on the materials to be sent to the adjudicator - primarily in regard to documentary evidence that has been disclosed at the SOP phase. This letter will allow no more than 10 working days for a response.  
      
    
293.  Once the taxpayer has concurred on the materials to be sent to the Adjudication Unit, those materials will be so forwarded. However, if no response is received from the taxpayer the materials will be forwarded after the 10 working days allowed for the taxpayer's response have elapsed. The adjudicator may also contact the parties after the initial materials have been received to obtain further information.  
      
    
294.  Where an investigation has covered a number of issues, the cover sheet will outline any issues that the parties have agreed upon and any issues that are still disputed. The adjudicator will only consider the disputed issues and not those issues that have been agreed upon.  
      
    
295.  Generally, the adjudicator only considers the materials that the parties have submitted. They do not usually seek out or consider further information, unless it is relevant. The adjudicator may consider such additional information notwithstanding that the parties have not agreed that the provider can include this information in their SOP under section 89M(13).  
      
    
296.  However, any additional material that the parties have not disclosed in their SOP (or agreed to include in their SOP under section 89M(13)) cannot later be raised as evidence in court because the evidence exclusion rule in section 138G(1) will apply (as discussed in paragraphs 260 to 262).

#### Adjudication decision

297.  Once a conclusion is reached, the Adjudication Unit will advise the taxpayer and responsible officer of the decision. The responsible officer will implement any of the Adjudication Unit's decisions and follow up procedures where required including issuing a notice of assessment to the taxpayer where applicable.  
      
    
298.  Where the Adjudication Unit makes a decision against the Commissioner, the Commissioner is bound by and cannot challenge that decision. The dispute will come to an end.  
      
    
299.  Where the Adjudication Unit makes a decision against the taxpayer, they can challenge the assessment (whether made by the Commissioner or taxpayer) or disputable decision if they are within the applicable response period.  
      
    
300.  If the Commissioner has commenced the disputes resolution process, the taxpayer, if disagreeing with the adjudicator's decision and any later notice of assessment or amended assessment that is issued, can file proceedings in the general jurisdiction of the TRA or the High Court if any of the following conditions under section 138B(1) is met:  
    1.  the assessment includes an adjustment that the Commissioner has proposed and the taxpayer has rejected within the response period, or  
        
    2.  the assessment is an amended assessment that imposes a fresh or increases an existing liability.  
          
        
301.  A taxpayer can also challenge an assessment that the Commissioner issues before the dispute goes through the adjudication process (for example, when an exception under section 89N(1)(c) applies).  
      
    
302.  The taxpayer must file proceedings with the TRA or High Court within the two-month response period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the notice of assessment or amended assessment.  
      
    
303.  If applicable, the responsible officer will implement any decision made by the hearing authority and follow up procedures where required including issuing a notice of assessment or amended assessment to the taxpayer.

=========================================================================

Withdrawn statement SPS 08/02 - Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

This item also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 20, No 6 (July 2008).

 

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement ("SPS") discusses a taxpayer's rights and responsibilities in respect of an assessment or other disputable decision when the taxpayer commences the disputes resolution process.  
      
    
2.  Where the Commissioner commences the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner's practice is stated in _SPS 08/01: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ .  
      
    
3.  This SPS has been updated due to changes made to the law under:  
    
    1.  the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2005, and
    2.  the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, and
    3.  the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, and
    4.  the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007, and
    5.  the relevant case law decided since _SPS 05/04: Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer_ was published.
    
      
    
4.  The Commissioner regards this SPS as a reference guide for taxpayers and Inland Revenue officers. Where possible, Inland Revenue officers must follow the practices outlined in this SPS.

 

### Application

5.  This SPS applies to a dispute commenced on or after 9 June 2008 or in the case of a dispute involving Goods and Services Tax ("GST") to a GST return period that ends on or after 31 March 2007. _SPS 05/04: Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer_ continues to apply from its commencement date up to 9 June 2008.  
      
    
6.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").

 

### Background

7.  The tax dispute resolution procedures were introduced in accordance with the recommendations of the Richardson Committee in the _Report of the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department_ (April 1994) and were designed to reduce the number of disputes by:  
    
    1.  promoting full disclosure, and
    2.  encouraging the prompt and efficient resolution of tax disputes, and
    3.  promoting the early identification of issues, and
    4.  improving the accuracy of decisions.
    
      
    
8.  The disputes resolution process ensures that there is full and frank communication between the parties in a structured way within strict time limits for the legislated phases of the process.  
      
    
9.  The disputes resolution process is designed to encourage an "all cards on the table" approach and the resolution of issues without the need for litigation. It aims to ensure that all the relevant evidence, facts, and legal arguments are canvassed before a case goes to court.  
      
    
10.  The disputes resolution process was introduced in 1996 and reviewed in July 2003. There have been changes made to the disputes resolution process following recent legislative amendments and case law since 2005.  
      
    
11.  The early resolution of a dispute is intended to be achieved through a series of steps specified in the TAA. The main elements of those steps are the issue of:  
    
    1.  A notice of proposed adjustment ("NOPA"): this is a notice that either the Commissioner or taxpayer issues to the other advising that an adjustment is sought in relation to the taxpayer's assessment, the Commissioner's assessment or other disputable decision (the requisite form is the _IR770 Notice of proposed adjustment_ ).
    2.  A notice of response ("NOR"): this must be issued by the recipient of a NOPA if they disagree with it (the preferred form is the _IR771 Notice of response_ ).
    3.  A notice rejecting the Commissioner's NOR: this must be issued by the taxpayer if they disagree with the Commissioner's NOR (there is no prescribed form for a notice rejecting the Commissioner's NOR).
    4.  A disclosure notice and statement of position ("SOP"): the issue of a disclosure notice by the Commissioner triggers the issue of a SOP. Each SOP must provide an outline of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law with sufficient details to support the positions taken. Each party must issue a SOP (the requisite form is the _IR773 Statement of position_). The SOPs are important documents because they limit the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law that either party can rely on if the case proceeds to court to what is included in the SOPs (unless a hearing authority makes an order that allows a party to raise new facts or evidence under section 138G(2)).
    
      
    
12.  There are also two administrative phases in the process - the conference and adjudication phases. If the dispute has not been already resolved after the NOR phase, the Commissioner's practice will be to hold a conference, unless the parties agree to abridge the conference phase (please see paragraphs 180 to 183 of the SPS). A conference can be a formal or informal discussion between the parties to clarify and, if possible, resolve the issues.  
      
    
13.  If the dispute remains unresolved after the SOP phase, the Commissioner will refer the dispute to adjudication, except in certain circumstances. Adjudication involves Inland Revenue independently considering a dispute and is the final phase in the process before the taxpayer's assessment is amended (if it is to be amended) following the exchange of the SOPs.

### Summary of key actions and indicative administrative time frames

14.  Set out below is a summary of the key actions and administrative time frames where a disputes resolution process is commenced by a taxpayer.  
      
    
15.  These key actions and time frames are intended to be administrative guide lines for Inland Revenue officers. Any failure to meet these administrative time frames will not invalidate subsequent actions of the Commissioner or prevent the case from going through the disputes resolution process.

| Paragraph in the SPS | Key actions | Indicative time frames |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     | **The taxpayer's NOPA** |     |
| 32, 37, 54, 65 and 70 | A taxpayer's response period for issuing a NOPA in respect of an assessment or other disputable decision | Within four months from the date that the assessment or other disputable decision is issued. |
| 83  | A taxpayer's response period for issuing a NOPA that relates solely to a research and development tax credit in respect of a notice of disputable decision or notice revoking or varying a disputable decision issued by the Commissioner. | Within one year that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues a notice of disputable decision or notice revoking or varying a disputable decision that is not an assessment. |
| 86  | A taxpayer's response period for issuing a NOPA that relates solely to a research and development tax credit in a notice of assessment that they have issued if they are a single person for the purpose of section 68D. | Within the period that ends two years (for an assessment that relates to the 2008-09 and 2009-10 income years) or one year (for an assessment that relates to the 2010-11 and later income years) after the date that the Commissioner receives the taxpayer's assessment. |
| 86(b) | A taxpayer's response period for issuing a NOPA that relates solely to research and development tax credits in a notice of assessment that they have issued if they are a member of an internal software development group or partner of a partnership that chooses to apply section 68E for the 2008-09 and later income years. | Within the period that starts on the date on which the Commissioner receives the taxpayers' assessment and ends 2 years (for an assessment that relates to the 2008-09 and 2009-10 income years) or 1 year (for an assessment relating to the 2010-11 and later income years) after the latest date that the taxpayer can provide an income tax or joint income tax return. |

| 216 | The dispute is treated as if it was never commenced, if the taxpayer fails to issue a SOP within the applicable response period and none of the "exceptional circumstances" apply. | Usually 10 working days after the response period for the disclosure notice expires. |
|     | **The Commissioner's SOP** |     |
| 218 | The Commissioner issues a SOP in response to the taxpayer's SOP. | Within two months after the date that the taxpayer's SOP is issued, unless an application has been made to the High Court under section 89M(11). |
|     | **The Commissioner's addendum** |     |
| 224 | The Commissioner provides additional information via addendum to the Commissioner's SOP within the response period for the taxpayer's SOP. | Where applicable, within two months after the date that the taxpayer's SOP is issued. |
| 228 | The Commissioner considers a taxpayer's request to include additional information in the SOP. | Usually within one month after the date that the Commissioner's SOP or addendum is issued. |
|     | **Adjudication** |     |
| 241 | The Commissioner prepares a cover sheet and issues a letter (with a copy of the cover sheet) to the taxpayer to seek concurrence on the materials to be sent to the adjudicator. | Usually within one month after the date that the Commissioner's addendum (if any) or the response period for the taxpayer's SOP expires. |
| 242 | The taxpayer responds to the Commissioner's letter. | Within 10 working days after the date that the letter is issued. |
| 243 | The Commissioner forwards materials relevant to the dispute to the Adjudication Unit. | Usually when the Commissioner receives the taxpayer's response or within 10 working days after the date that the Commissioner's letter is issued. |
|     | Adjudication of the disputes case | Usually four months after the date that the Adjudication Unit receives the disputes files, depending on the number of disputes that are before the Adjudication Unit, any allocation delays and the technical, legal and factual complexity of those disputes. |
|     | The taxpayer can file challenge proceedings under section 138B in respect of an assessment or amended assessment | Within two months after the assessment or amended assessment is issued. |

 

### Standard Practice and Analysis

### Taxpayer's assessment

16.  Section 92(1) reads:
    
    > A taxpayer who is required to furnish a return of income for a tax year must make an assessment of the taxpayer's taxable income and income tax liability and, if applicable for the tax year, the net loss, terminal tax or refund due.
    
17.  Section 92(1) applies to tax on income derived in:
    
    1.  the 2005-06 and later tax years for a taxpayer whose income year matches the tax year, and
    2.  the corresponding income year for a taxpayer whose income year is different from the 2005-06 and later tax years.
    
      
    
18.  If a taxpayer has to file an income tax return they must make an assessment of their taxable income and income tax liability and, if applicable, the net loss, terminal tax or refund due. The definition of disputable decision in section 3(1) includes an assessment made by a taxpayer.  
      
    
19.  Similar requirements apply to a taxpayer who must file a GST return under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("the GST Act"). For a GST return period that begins on or after 1 April 2005, the taxpayer must make an assessment of the amount of GST payable. Section 92B(1) reads:
    
    > A taxpayer who is required under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to provide a GST tax return for a GST return period must make an assessment of the amount of GST payable by the taxpayer for the return period.
    
20.  Pursuant to sections 92(2) and 92B(2) the assessment date for an income tax or GST assessment made by a taxpayer is the date that Inland Revenue receives the taxpayer's tax return.  
      
    
21.  However, under section 92B(3) for a GST assessment and section 92(6) for an income tax assessment, a taxpayer cannot make an assessment of the amount of tax payable for a return period in their tax return if the Commissioner has previously made an assessment of the tax that is payable for that return period. This is commonly known as a "default assessment" and involves the Commissioner making a default determination that estimates the taxpayer's tax liability (for example, if they have missed a return filing deadline).  
      
    
22.  For further discussion regarding how a taxpayer can dispute a default assessment please see paragraphs 37 to 49. Any later amendment to a default assessment must be the Commissioner's assessment made under section 113. The Commissioner can make any such amendment on the basis of the information provided in the taxpayer's tax return and treat that return as a record of the taxpayer's assertion of their tax liability.  
      
    
23.  When the taxpayer's assessment is received, the Commissioner's practice is to stamp, either electronically or manually, the tax return with the date of receipt. This date is then entered into Inland Revenue's computerised database and a return acknowledgment form is sent to the taxpayer or agent. This practice ensures that the taxpayer will have a clear record of when their assessment was made.

 

### The Commissioner's assessment

24.  Notwithstanding section 92(1) and subject to the statutory time bar in sections 108 and 108A, the Commissioner can sometimes issue a notice of assessment to a taxpayer.  
      
    
25.  The Commissioner cannot make an assessment without first issuing a NOPA to a taxpayer, unless an exception under section 89C to the requirement for issuing a NOPA applies.  
      
    
26.  For example, under section 6A, the Commissioner settles challenge proceedings in the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") and a disputes resolution process commenced by the taxpayer. The Commissioner enters into an individual settlement deed and agreed adjustment with the taxpayer to confirm the settlement. The Commissioner will apply section 89C(d) and give effect to the settlement deed and agreed adjustment by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer under section 89J(1) without first issuing a NOPA. In this circumstance section 89J(1) prevents the parties from further disputing the previously agreed adjustment.  
      
    
27.  The exceptions under section 89C are explained in the Commissioner's practice as stated in _SPS 08/01: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_. (The Commissioner must ensure that any assessment is made in accordance with section 89C. However, if, on a rare occasion, an assessment was made in breach of section 89C, it will still be regarded as being valid under section 114(a)).  
      
    
28.  If the Commissioner issues an assessment without first issuing a NOPA, the taxpayer can issue a NOPA to the Commissioner under section 89D(1) or challenge proceedings under section 138B(3) in respect of that assessment.

 

### A taxpayer can issue a NOPA to the Commissioner

29.  A taxpayer can issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in the following six situations:

 

**Situation 1: NOPA in respect of the Commissioner's assessment**

30.  Section 89D(1) reads:
    
    > If the Commissioner:
    > 
    > (a)  Issues a notice of assessment to a taxpayer; and
    > 
    > (b)  Has not previously issued a notice of proposed adjustment to the taxpayer in respect of the assessment, whether or not in breach of section 89C,-
    > 
    >   
    > the taxpayer may, subject to subsection (2); issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of the assessment.
    
31.  When the Commissioner issues to a taxpayer a notice of assessment that does not relate to a "default assessment" (as discussed in paragraph 21) without first issuing a NOPA, the taxpayer can issue to the Commissioner for receipt a NOPA in respect of the assessment. A taxpayer's response to a default assessment is discussed under the heading Situation 2: NOPA in respect of the Commissioner's default assessment.  
      
    
32.  A taxpayer's NOPA is not an assessment. It is an initiating action that allows open and full communication between the parties. A NOPA forms a basis for ensuring that the Commissioner does not issue an assessment without some formal and structured dialogue with the taxpayer in respect of the grounds upon which the Commissioner is issuing any assessment or amended assessment (_McIlraith v CIR_ (2007) 23 NZTC 21,456).  
      
    
33.  If the Commissioner has issued an assessment the taxpayer can issue a NOPA under section 89D(1) in respect of any of the considerations that were relevant to making the assessment. This could include preliminary decisions which are necessary to make the assessment, for example, a decision made by the Commissioner under section 89C (_MR Forestry (No 1) Trust Ltd v CIR_ (2006) 22 NZTC 19,954).  
      
    
34.  The taxpayer must issue the NOPA within the applicable "response period" as defined in section 3(1). Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the assessment unless the Commissioner accepts a late NOPA under section 89K(1). However, this response period is subject to the exception discussed in **Situation 6 : NOPA that relates solely to a research and development tax credit.**  
      
    
35.  For example, if the Commissioner's notice of assessment is issued on 7 April 2008, under section 89D(1) the taxpayer must issue a NOPA in the prescribed form in respect of the assessment on or before 6 August 2008.  
      
    
36.  The taxpayer's right to issue a NOPA under section 89D(1) is unaffected, even if, in a very rare circumstance, the Commissioner made the assessment in breach of section 89C. The assessment will be deemed to be valid under section 114(a).

**Situation 2: NOPA in respect of the Commissioner's default assessment**

_Default assessment that does not relate to GST_

37.  If a taxpayer has not filed a tax return, the Commissioner can make a default assessment under section 106(1) without first issuing a NOPA to the taxpayer.  
      
    
38.  Section 89D(2) reads:
    
    > A taxpayer who has not furnished a return of income for an assessment period may dispute the assessment made by the Commissioner only by furnishing a return of income for the assessment period.
    
39.  A taxpayer that intends to dispute a default assessment through the disputes resolution process must:
    1.  pursuant to section 89D(2) provide a tax return for the period to which the default assessment relates notwithstanding that the tax return cannot include the taxpayer's assessment (section 89D(2A)), and
    2.  issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the default assessment within the applicable response period. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the default assessment.

_GST default assessment_

40.  Similar rules apply to a NOPA that a taxpayer issues in respect of a GST default assessment.  
      
    
41.  Section 89D(2C) reads:
    
    > A taxpayer who has not provided a GST tax return for a GST return period may not dispute the assessment made by the Commissioner other than by providing a GST return for the GST return period.
    
42.  Where a taxpayer has not filed a GST return, the Commissioner can make a GST default assessment without first issuing a NOPA to the taxpayer.  
      
    
43.  If a taxpayer wants to dispute a GST default assessment through the disputes resolution process, they must:
    
    1.  provide a GST return for the periods to which the GST default assessment relates pursuant to section 89D(2C) for return periods beginning on or after 1 April 2005, notwithstanding that the tax return cannot include the taxpayer's assessment (section 89D(2D)), and
    2.  issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the GST default assessment,
    
      
    within the applicable response period. That is, within four months from the date that the default assessment is issued.  
      
    
44.  The legislative requirement to provide a tax return i n respect of a default assessment made by the Commissioner under section 106(1) when issuing a NOPA is an additional requirement of the disputes resolution process. This ensures that the taxpayer has provided the requisite statutory information before they dispute the assessment.  
      
    
45.  If the Commissioner agrees with the taxpayer's NOPA and tax return, the Commissioner will amend the default assessment by exercising the discretion under section 113 subject to the statutory time bar in section 108 and any other relevant limitations on the exercise of that discretion.  
      
    
46.  However, if the Commissioner disagrees with the taxpayer's tax return and NOPA the Commissioner cannot amend the default assessment. Instead, the Commissioner must issue a NOR to the taxpayer within the relevant response period to continue the disputes resolution process.  
      
    
47.  The taxpayer cannot commence a dispute or challenge proceedings in a hearing authority by simply filing the tax return to which the default assessment relates. If the taxpayer does not want to enter the disputes resolution process they should not issue a NOPA with their tax return.  
      
    
48.  If a NOPA is not issued, the Commissioner cannot be compelled to amend the default assessment on receipt of the taxpayer's tax return. However, the Commissioner will amend the assessment under section 113 on the basis of the information provided in the tax return subject to the statutory time bar in section 108 and any other relevant limitations on the exercise of that discretion if this would ensure that the assessment was correct. (Please see _SPS 07/03: Requests to amend assessments_ for further details.) Any amended assessment must be treated as the Commissioner's assessment in this circumstance.  
      
    
49.  The Commissioner can decide not to amend the default assessment by exercising the discretion under section 113 on the basis of the tax return provided. For example, if the Commissioner considers that the taxpayer's tax position is incorrect. In this circumstance, the Commissioner can dispute the default assessment by issuing a NOPA in respect of the taxpayer's tax return under section 89B(1).

**Situation 3: NOPA in respect of a deemed assessment made under section 80H**

50.  Section 89D(2B) reads:
    
    > A taxpayer to whom section 80F applies who has not furnished an amended income statement for an assessment period may dispute a deemed assessment under section 80H only by furnishing an amended income statement for the assessment period.
    
51.  Section 89D(2B) applies to a taxpayer who derives income solely from salary, wages, interest and dividends and who will receive an income statement from the Commissioner under section 80D(1).  
      
    
52.  Generally, where the taxpayer considers that the income statement is incorrect, they must advise the Commissioner of the reasons and provide the relevant information to correct the income statement under section 80F(1). This must be done within the statutory time limit. That is, the later of:
    
    1.  the taxpayer's terminal tax date for the tax year to which the income statement relates, and
    2.  two months after the date that the income statement is issued.
    
      
    
53.  If the taxpayer does not provide the relevant information within the statutory time limit, they will be treated as having filed a tax return under section 80G(2) and made an assessment under section 80H in respect of that income statement. In this case, the date of the deemed assessment under section 80H will be the date that the statutory time limit under section 80F expires.  
      
    
54.  Pursuant to section 89D(2B), the taxpayer cannot issue to the Commissioner a NOPA in respect of the deemed assessment made under section 80H without first satisfying their statutory obligation to file an amended income statement for the assessment period.  
      
    
55.  If a taxpayer wants to dispute a deemed assessment under section 80H, they must:
    1.  provide an amended income statement for the assessment period, and
    2.  issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the assessment within the applicable response period (that is, four months after the date that the deemed assessment is issued).

 

**Situation 4: NOPA in respect of a disputable decision that is not an assessment**

56.  Under section 89D(3) a taxpayer can issue a NOPA in respect of a disputable decision that is not an assessment. Section 89D(3) reads:
    
    > If the Commissioner:
    > 
    > (a)  Issues a notice of disputable decision that is not a notice of assessment; and
    > 
    > (b)  The notice of disputable decision affects the taxpayer, -
    > 
    > the taxpayer, or any other person who has the standing under a tax law to do so on behalf of the taxpayer, may issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of the disputable decision.
    
57.  For the purpose of section 89D(3) a person with standing under a tax law to issue a NOPA on behalf of the taxpayer includes a tax advisor and an approved advisor group.  
      
    
58.  Section 3(1) defines a "disputable decision" to include:
    
    2.  A decision of the Commissioner under a tax law, except for a decision -
        1.  To decline to issue a binding ruling under Part VA ; or
        2.  That cannot be the subject of an objection under Part VIII; or
        3.  That cannot be challenged under Part VIIIA; or
        4.  That is left to the Commissioner's discretion under sections 89K, 89L, 89M(8) and (10) and 89N(3).
    
      
    
59.  A "decision of the Commissioner under a tax law" generally refers to a tax law that specifically confers a discretion or power on the Commissioner. Paragraph (b)(iii) excludes from the definition of "disputable decision" any decision that cannot be challenged under Part VIIIA.  
      
    
60.  For example, if the Commissioner:
    
    1.  does not exercise the discretion under section 113 to amend a taxpayer's income tax assessment, or
    2.  makes a decision under section 108A(3) regarding the application of the time bar, or
    3.  does not agree to a time bar waiver under section 108B,
    
      
    section 138E(1)(e)(iv) (within Part VIIIA) provides that this decision cannot be challenged and, therefore, is not a disputable decision for the purposes of section 89D(3). However, under section 89D(1), the taxpayer can issue a NOPA in respect of the initial assessment within the applicable response period if the Commissioner has not previously issued a NOPA in respect of that assessment.  
      
    
61.  A decision made by the Commissioner under section 108(2) (to increase an assessment) is not of itself, and in the absence of an assessment, a disputable decision. Any challenge to the correctness of the decision must be brought in the context of a challenge to the assessment itself ( _Vinelight Nominees Ltd & Anor v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (No 2)_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,519).  
      
    
62.  Paragraph (b)(iv) of the definition of "disputable decision" in section 3(1) also excludes any decision that is left to the Commissioner's discretion arising under sections 89K, 89L, 89M(8), (10) and 89N(3). For example, the Commissioner:
    
    1.  does not exercise the discretion under section 89K(1) in respect of a NOPA that a taxpayer has issued outside the applicable response period. This decision to not exercise the discretion in the taxpayer's favour is not a disputable decision.
    2.  provides the taxpayer with additional information under section 89M(8) after receiving their SOP. The decision to provide this additional information is not a disputable decision.
    
      
    
63.  The exceptions specified in paragraph (b) of the definition of "disputable decision" ensure that only substantive issues are disputed as disputable decisions and the procedural components of the disputes resolution process do not, in themselves, give rise to disputes although they may be amenable to judicial review.  
      
    
64.  The following examples illustrate what is a disputable decision:
    
    1.  a taxpayer who is a natural person can dispute the Commissioner's decision made under section YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 ("ITA 2007") that they are a New Zealand resident for taxation purposes.
    2.  under section RD 3(5) of the ITA 2007, the Commissioner can determine whether, and to what extent, a payment is subject to PAYE. This determination cannot be challenged by the taxpayer and, therefore, is excluded from the definition of "disputable decision" under section 3(1)(b)(iii). However, an employer or employee can dispute an assessment of tax deductions on the basis that a section RD 3(5) determination on which it is founded is wrong in fact or law.
    
      
    
65.  The taxpayer must issue the NOPA to the Commissioner within the applicable response period. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the notice of disputable decision or notice revoking or varying a disputable decision that is not an assessment unless the Commissioner allows a late NOPA under section 89K(1).

 

**Situation 5: NOPA in respect of a taxpayer's assessment**

66.  Section 89DA(1) reads:
    
    > A taxpayer may issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of an assessment made by the taxpayer for a tax year or a GST return period if the Commissioner has not previously issued a notice of proposed adjustment to the taxpayer in respect of the assessment.
    
67.  Section 89DA(1) applies to tax on income derived in:
    
    1.  the 2005-06 and later income years for a taxpayer whose income year is the same as the tax year, and
    2.  the corresponding income year for a taxpayer whose income year is different to the 2005-06 and later tax years.
    
      
    For tax on income derived in the 2002-03 to 2005-06 income years please see the discussion in _SPS 05/04: Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer_.  
      
    
68.  If a taxpayer needs to file an income tax return they must also make an assessment of their taxable income and income tax liability under section 92(1) unless the Commissioner has previously made an assessment for that tax year (section 92(6)).  
      
    
69.  Section 89DA(1) also applies to a taxpayer's GST assessment for a return period that begins on or after 1 April 2005. A taxpayer who has to file a GST return must also make an assessment of the amount of GST payable for the return period under section 92B(1).  
      
    
70.  Pursuant to section 89DA(1), a taxpayer can issue to the Commissioner a NOPA in respect of their own tax assessment.  
      
    
71.  The taxpayer's NOPA must be issued within the applicable response period as defined in section 3(1). Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner receives the taxpayer's assessment unless the Commissioner allows a late NOPA under section 89K(1).  
      
    
72.  The date that the Commissioner receives the taxpayer's assessment will be determined under section 14B. For example, under section 14B(8) the Commissioner will receive a NOPA that the taxpayer sends by post on the date that it would have been delivered in the ordinary course of post.

_Proposed adjustment – input tax credit_

73.  If a taxpayer receives a taxable supply and does not claim an input tax deduction under section 20(3) of the GST Act, they have several options.  
      
    
74.  Firstly, the taxpayer (registered person) can claim an input tax deduction in a later GST return period under section 20(3) of the GST Act within the applicable two-year period. Pursuant to paragraph (a) of the proviso to section 20(3) of the GST Act (appearing after paragraph (i) of the section), the two-year period is calculated from the earlier of the date that:
    
    1.  a payment is made for the taxable supply to which the input tax credit relates, and
    2.  a tax invoice in relation to that taxable supply is issued.
    
      
    
75.  However, pursuant to the proviso to section 20(3) of the GST Act, the taxpayer can have unlimited time to claim the input tax credit if their failure to make the deduction under that section arises from any of the following reasons:
    
    1.  their inability to obtain a tax invoice, or
    2.  a dispute over the proper amount of payment for the taxable supply to which the deduction relates, or
    3.  their mistaken understanding that the supply to which the deduction relates was not a taxable supply, or
    4.  a clear mistake or simple oversight made by the taxpayer.
    
      
    
76.  Alternatively, the taxpayer can propose an adjustment to the relevant assessment by issuing a NOPA to the Commissioner within the applicable response period.  
      
    
77.  If the taxpayer is outside the response period for issuing a NOPA and they have made a genuine error and otherwise satisfy the criteria set out in SPS 07/03: Requests to amend assessments they can request that the Commissioner amends the assessment by exercising the discretion under section 113.  
      
    
78.  For example, a taxpayer is registered for GST. They pay GST on an invoice basis and file monthly GST returns. In May 2005, they receive a tax invoice in respect of a taxable supply. However, the taxpayer omits to claim the input tax credit in respect of that taxable supply in the May 2005 GST return period. The omission occurs because the taxpayer has misplaced the tax invoice in one of their business files and only discovers it in December 2007.  
      
    
79.  The taxpayer has several options. They can claim an input tax deduction in the current GST return period under section 20(3) of the GST Act. The two-year restriction on claiming the deduction does not apply because the taxpayer's omission is due to their simple oversight.  
      
    
80.  Whether a "simple or obvious mistake or oversight" has occurred is determined on a case-by-case basis with no dollar limit. However, "a simple or obvious mistake or oversight" cannot include a taxpayer's GST position that they take as a result of:
    
    1.  a new, beneficial interpretation of, or favourable new case law, or
    2.  a regretted choice.
    
      
    
81.  The taxpayer can also propose an adjustment to an input tax credit in the May 2005 GST period by issuing a NOPA to the Commissioner. However, the NOPA will be issued outside the four-month response period unless the Commissioner considers that any of the "exceptional circumstances" in section 89K apply and accepts the late NOPA.  
      
    
82.  Alternatively, the taxpayer can request that the Commissioner considers their case in terms of the discretion under section 113 if they have made a genuine error. (Please see _SPS 07/03: Requests to amend assessments for details of this practice_).

 

**Situation 6: NOPA that relates solely to a research and development tax credit**

83.  Under section 89D, a taxpayer can issue a NOPA that relates solely to a research and development expenditure tax credit arising under section LH 2 of the ITA 2007 in respect of:
    
    1.  a notice of disputable decision (please see paragraphs 56 to 65), or
    2.  a notice revoking or varying a disputable decision that is not an assessment,  
        that the Commissioner issues in the 2008-09 or later tax years. In this circumstance section 3(1) provides that the response period for a NOPA that relates solely to a research and development expenditure tax credit is within the one-year period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues such a notice.
    
      
    
84.  For example, the Commissioner makes an assessment based on the taxpayer's tax return on 10 August 2009. The taxpayer later seeks to issue a NOPA in respect of the assessment under section 89D(1). The NOPA relates solely to a claim for a research and development expenditure tax credit arising under section LH 2 of the ITA 2007. The taxpayer must issue the NOPA within the one-year period that starts on 10 August 2009 and ends on 9 August 2010.  
      
    
85.  Under section 89DA, a taxpayer can also issue a NOPA that relates solely to a research and development expenditure tax credit arising from a notice of assessment that they have previously issued for the 2008-09 or later income years.  
      
    
86.  The NOPA must be issued within the period that pursuant to paragraph (e)(i) of the definition of "response period" in section 3(1):
    
    1.  ends:
        
        1.  two years (for an assessment that relates to the 2008-09 and 2009-10 income years), or
        2.  one year (for an assessment that relates to the 2010-11 and later income years),
        
          
        after the date that the Commissioner receives the taxpayer's assessment if the taxpayer is a single person for the purpose of section 68D (that is, not a member of an internal software development group ("ISDG") or partner of a partnership to which section 68E applies), or  
          
        
    2.  starts on the date on which the Commissioner receives the taxpayer's assessment and ends:
        
        1.  two years (for an assessment that relates to the 2008-09 and 2009-10 income years), or
        2.  one year (for an assessment relating to the 2010-11 and later income years),
        
          
        after the latest date on which the taxpayer can provide an income tax or joint income tax return for the relevant tax year under section 37 if the taxpayer is a member of an ISDG or partner of a partnership that chooses to apply section 68E for the 2008-09 and later income years (paragraph (e)(ii) the definition of "response period" in section 3(1)).
    
      
    
87.  For the purpose of paragraphs (d) and (e) of the definition of "response period" in section 3(1) the date that the Commissioner receives the taxpayer's assessment must be determined under section 14B (as discussed in paragraph 72).  
      
    
88.  For example, a taxpayer that is a member of an ISDG provides their partnership's 2009 income tax return to the Commissioner on 1 July 2009 which is before the return filing due date of 7 July 2009 under section 37(1)(c). The taxpayer discovers that they have under claimed research and development expenditure tax credits in the assessment in their tax return.  
      
    
89.  Under section 89DA, the taxpayer can issue in respect of their assessment a NOPA that relates solely to the claim for a research and development expenditure tax credit. The taxpayer must issue the NOPA within the period that starts on 1 July 2009 (the date that the Commissioner received their assessment) and ends on 6 July 2011 (two years after 7 July 2009 which is the due date for filing the member's income tax return under section 37).

 

### Contents of a taxpayer's NOPA

90.  A NOPA is the document that commences the disputes resolution process. It is intended to identify the true points of contention and explain the legal or technical aspects of the issuer's position in relation to the proposed adjustment in a formal and understandable manner. This will ensure that information relevant to the dispute is quickly made available to the parties. Section 89F(1) and (3) specifies the content requirements for any NOPA that a taxpayer may issue.  
      
    
91.  Section 89F reads:
    
    > (1)  A notice of proposed adjustment must -
    > 
    > > (a)  contain sufficient detail of the matters described in subsections (2) and (3) to identify the issues arising between the Commissioner and the disputant; and  
    > >   
    > > (b)  be in the prescribed form.
    
    ...
    
    > (3)  A notice of proposed adjustment issued by a disputant must -
    > 
    > > (a)  identify the adjustment or adjustments proposed to be made to the assessment; and  
    > >   
    > > (b)  provide a statement of the facts and the law in sufficient detail to inform the Commissioner of the grounds for the disputant's proposed adjustment or adjustments; and  
    > >   
    > > (c)  state how the law applies to the facts; and  
    > >   
    > > (d) include copies of the documents of which the disputant is aware at the time that the notice is issued that are significantly relevant to the issues arising between the Commissioner and the disputant.
    
92.  The prescribed form for a NOPA as required under section 89F(3)(b) is the IR770 Notice of proposed adjustment form that can be found on Inland Revenue's website: www.ird.govt.nz. A handwritten NOPA in this form is acceptable. Additional information can also be attached to the prescribed form.  
      
    
93.  If the Commissioner receives a NOPA that is not in the prescribed form or has insufficient detail under section 89F(1)(a) the Commissioner's practice will be to advise the taxpayer that the NOPA must be in the prescribed form or include sufficient information. If this occurs on the last day of the response period the Commissioner will consider any resubmitted NOPA under section 89K(1)(a)(iii) provided that the lateness is minimal (please see paragraph 130).  
      
    
94.  If the taxpayer's NOPA does not satisfy the content requirements under sections 89F(1)(a) and 89F(3) the Commissioner can reject the NOPA on the basis of the invalidity and not issue a NOR.  
      
    
95.  When issuing a NOPA, the taxpayer must state the facts and law in sufficient detail, how the law applies to the facts and include copies of the documents that are significantly relevant to the dispute and known to the taxpayer when they issue the NOPA. However, the taxpayer must avoid repeating facts, arguments or using unnecessary detail. The Commissioner cannot treat a tax return provided by the taxpayer as a NOPA because it will not satisfy the requirements in section 89F(1) and (3).  
      
    
96.  Section 89F(3)(b) requires that the taxpayer's NOPA states the key facts and law concisely and in sufficient detail. The term "sufficient detail" means that the document must contain adequate analysis of the law and facts that are relevant to the dispute. This means sufficient discussion of the law to enable the Commissioner to clearly understand the proposed adjustment.  
      
    
97.  The Commissioner considers that it is necessary that the taxpayer provides "a statement of the facts and law in sufficient detail" to ensure that they have fully considered issues before they raise them in their NOPA.  
      
    
98.  Although not a requirement under section 89F(3) the taxpayer must ensure that a NOPA is relatively brief and simple to enable the parties to quickly progress the dispute without incurring substantial expenses or excessive preparation time. However, the taxpayer must also provide sufficient information to support the proposed adjustments in their NOPA and to reduce further administrative and compliance costs.

 

**_Identify the proposed adjustment - section 89F(3)(a)_**

99.  The taxpayer must identify the proposed adjustment in their NOPA. This includes for each proposed adjustment:
    
    1.  the amount or impact of the adjustment, and
    2.  the tax year or period to which the proposed adjustment relates.
    
      
    
100.  The proposed adjustment should be set out as specifically as possible. For example: "increase the 2007 repairs and maintenance expenditure by $3,000"; "increase the GST input tax deduction by $4,000 in the August 2007 return period", etc.

 

**_Provide a statement of the facts and law in sufficient detail - section 89F(3)(b)_**

**Facts**

101.  To provide a brief and accurate statement of facts, the taxpayer must focus on the material factual matters relevant to the legal issues. The taxpayer must include the facts necessary for proving all the arguments raised in support of each adjustment, including any facts that are inconsistent with any argument that the Commissioner has previously raised.  
      
    
102.  The taxpayer should endeavour to disclose all the relevant material facts clearly and with adequate amounts of detail relative to the complexity of the issues. The taxpayer is best suited to do this because they are usually very familiar with the background and facts that relate to the dispute. Disclosing the background and facts at the NOPA phase helps to resolve the dispute at an earlier stage. However, the taxpayer should not overstate the facts with irrelevant detail or repetition.  
      
    
103.  In complex cases, the Commissioner expects the taxpayer to explain the relevant facts clearly and methodically. The taxpayer should also assist the Commissioner to understand the background and facts of the dispute, so as to facilitate a speedy resolution of the case. The taxpayer should explain the facts and law in sufficient detail to inform the Commissioner of the grounds for the adjustment. It is unhelpful and can cause delays if the Commissioner has to second guess the factual bases of the taxpayer's case.  
      
    
104.  For example, in a dispute that involves a complex financial arrangement, the taxpayer should explain each element of it. This includes explaining the background to the financial arrangement, identifying the parties involved, highlighting the relevant clauses in an agreement, etc.

**Law**

105.  Each proposed adjustment should stipulate the relevant section or sections that the taxpayer relies on including, if a section has multiple independent parts, the applicable subsection(s).  
      
    
106.  It is important that the taxpayer includes an adequate amount of analysis of the applicable legal principles or tests in their NOPA. If possible these should be supported by case authorities with full citations. For example, in a dispute that involves the tax treatment of a trade-tie payment, the taxpayer must apply the legal principles from a leading case such as _Birkdale Service Station v CIR_ (2000) 19 NZTC 15,981. However, it is not necessary to laboriously describe large numbers of precedent cases on the same issue or include extracts from each.

 

**_How the law applies to the facts - section 89F(3)(c)_**

107.  The taxpayer must apply the legal arguments to the facts. This ensures that the proposed adjustment is not a statement that appears out of context in relation to the rest of the document. The Commissioner considers that the application of the law to the facts must logically support the proposed adjustment and be stated clearly and in detail.  
      
    
108.  The taxpayer must present the materials and arguments on which they intend to rely or on which reliance will be placed. That is, if more than one argument supports the same or a similar outcome, all arguments must be made and supported by evidence. For each proposition of law, it is recommended that the NOPA makes a clear link to an outline of supporting facts.

 

**_Include copies of the relevant documents that support the adjustment - section 89F(3)(d)_**

109.  The taxpayer must provide full copies of the documents that they know are significantly relevant to the dispute and in existence when they issue the NOPA. This ensures that the Commissioner has all the relevant information necessary to respond to the NOPA.  
      
    
110.  For example:
    
    1.  a taxpayer proposes an adjustment to GST input tax credits in their NOPA. The taxpayer must provide copies of the relevant tax invoices as documentary evidence in their NOPA.
    2.  a taxpayer's dispute involves a sale of land transaction. The taxpayer must provide a copy of the sale and purchase agreement and other relevant correspondence between the vendor and the purchaser as documentary evidence in their NOPA.
    
      
    
111.  However, a NOPA will not necessarily be treated as invalid if the taxpayer has not provided all the documentary evidence with it. In some cases, new documentary evidence can emerge, as the dispute progresses. For example:
    
    1.  a dispute involves overseas parties who hold relevant documents outside of New Zealand.
    2.  the documentation is quite old and may have been misplaced.
    
      
    
112.  The taxpayer may be unaware of these documents when the NOPA was issued. The parties should then exchange this new evidence when it becomes known or available.  
      
    
113.  Where a taxpayer is aware of a particular document that is significantly relevant to their dispute, but cannot obtain a copy of it, the taxpayer should include the following matters in their NOPA:
    
    1.  the nature of the document and its relevance to the dispute, and
    2.  the reasonable steps that the taxpayer has taken to obtain a copy of the document, and
    3.  the expected date that the document will be made available to the Commissioner.
    
      
    
114.  However, the practice allowed in the immediately preceding paragraph should not be treated as dispensing with the requirements under section 89F(3)(d). The Commissioner expects the taxpayer to send copies of the relevant documents mentioned in their NOPA as soon as they become available and can reject the proposed adjustment if they fail to do so.

 

### Election of the small claims jurisdiction of the taxation review authority

115.  Pursuant to section 89E(1), if a taxpayer issues a NOPA they can elect in that NOPA that the TRA acting in its small claims jurisdiction hears any unresolved dispute that arises from the NOPA, if the following requirements are met:
    
    1.  the taxpayer's NOPA is issued under section 89D or 89DA (please see earlier discussion), and
    2.  the amount in dispute is $30,000 or less.
    
      
    
116.  The Commissioner's practice is not to oppose any election made by the taxpayer under section 89E(1), for example where the dispute involves complicated legal issues, because the taxpayer's election is irrevocable and is binding on them. In this circumstance, the full disputes resolution process does not have to be followed.  
      
    
117.  Section 89E(1) applies in respect of a disputes resolution process that is commenced under Part IVA on or after 1 April 2005.

 

### Receipt of a taxpayer's NOPA

118.  Inland Revenue will usually assign a taxpayer's NOPA to the responsible officer within five working days after it is received.  
      
    
119.  After receiving the NOPA, the responsible officer will determine and record the following:
    
    1.  the date on which the NOPA was issued, whether the NOPA has been issued within the applicable response period and the date by which the Commissioner's response must be issued, and
    2.  the NOPA's salient features including any deficiencies in its content.
    
      
    
120.  Where this is practicable, Inland Revenue will advise the taxpayer or their tax agent that it has received the NOPA by telephone or in writing within 10 working days.

**Deficiencies in the contents of a NOPA**

121.  If Inland Revenue has received a NOPA that it considers has deficiencies (that is, it has not satisfied the requirements under section 89F(1)(a) and (3)), the responsible officer must take reasonable steps to ensure that the taxpayer can correct the information in the NOPA before the response period expires.</<BR>  
    
122.  Any decision regarding the NOPA's validity made by the Commissioner must be based on reasonable grounds. For example, where the Commissioner treats the NOPA as invalid because there is insufficient information to allow the Commissioner to make an informed decision regarding the assessment. The taxpayer must be advised as soon as practicable that the NOPA is invalid unless rectified and the additional or correct information must be provided within the remainder of the response period.  
      
    
123.  Taxpayers are encouraged to issue their NOPA immediately after they have completed it because they could have insufficient time to rectify any deficiency or invalidity if the response period is about to expire.  
      
    
124.  If the Commissioner does not accept that a NOPA is valid because it has deficiencies and the information is not corrected before the response period expires, the dispute will be treated as if it has never been commenced (unless the taxpayer resubmits a late NOPA and the Commissioner accepts it under one of the exceptional circumstances under section 89K).  
      
    
125.  The responsible officer will document the reasons for not accepting a NOPA and advise the taxpayer of these reasons in writing immediately if the taxpayer is still within the response period or 15 working days after the response period for issuing the taxpayer's NOPA expires if there is insufficient time for the taxpayer to resubmit the NOPA.

 

### NOPA that a taxpayer has issued outside the applicable response period

126.  Unless an "exceptional circumstance" arises under any of the circumstances specified in section 89K(1) in respect of a dispute that was commenced on or after 1 April 2005, the Commissioner cannot accept a NOPA that a taxpayer issues under section 89D or 89DA outside the applicable response period.

_Exceptional circumstances under section 89K_

127.  The legislation defines exceptional circumstances very narrowly. The cases on "exceptional circumstances", such as _Treasury Technology Holdings Ltd v CIR_ (1998) 18 NZTC 13,752, Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 14,005, _Fuji Xerox NZ Ltd v CIR_ (2001) 17,470 (CA), _Hollis v CIR_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,570, and _Balich v CIR_ (2007) 23 NZTC 21,230 are also relevant. The case law confirms that the Commissioner should apply the definition of “exceptional circumstances” in sections 89K(3) and 138D consistently.  
      
    The following guidelines have emerged from the case law:
    
    1.  a taxpayer's misunderstanding or erroneous calculation of the applicable response period will usually not be regarded as an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer's control under section 89K(3)(a)
    2.  an agent's failure to advise their client that they have received a notice of assessment or other relevant documents that causes the taxpayer to respond outside the applicable response period will not generally be considered to be an exceptional circumstance under section 89K(3)(b) (_Hollis v CIR_)
    3.  an exceptional circumstance can arise if the taxpayer has relied on misleading information that the Commissioner has given them that causes them to respond outside the applicable response period (_Hollis v CIR_)
    
      
    
128.  The Commissioner will only accept a late NOPA on rare occasions. Please see _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 8, No 3 (August 1996) for some examples of situations that can be considered “exceptional circumstances” beyond a taxpayer's control.  
      
    
129.  Section 89K(3) reads:
    
    > an **exceptional circumstance** arises if-
    > 
    > > (i)   an event or circumstance beyond the control of a disputant provides the disputant with a reasonable justification for not rejecting a proposed adjustment, or for not issuing a notice of proposed adjustment or statement of position, within the response period for the notice:  
    > >   
    > > (ii)   a disputant is late in issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, notice of response or statement of position but the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, or results from 1 or more statutory holidays falling in the response period:
    > 
    > (b)   an act or omission of an agent of a disputant is not an exceptional circumstance unless-
    > 
    > > (i)   it was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent that could not have been anticipated, and its effect could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct; or  
    > >   
    > > (ii)   the agent is late in issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, notice of response or statement of position but the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, or results from 1 or more statutory holidays falling in the response period.
    
130.  The statutory holiday exception is self-explanatory. The Commissioner can also accept a late NOPA if the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, that is, the document was only one to two days late.  
      
    
131.  For example, the response period ends on a Saturday and the taxpayer provides a NOPA on the following Tuesday. The Commissioner treats the response period as ending on Monday on the basis of section 35(6) of the Interpretation Act 1999 and accepts that the lateness of the NOPA was minimal. That is, the Commissioner received the NOPA within one to two days of Monday, the last day of the response period. If the response period ended on Friday and the taxpayer provided the NOR on the following Monday, the Commissioner would also accept that the lateness is minimal.  
      
    
132.  Besides the degree of lateness, the Commissioner will consider the following factors when exercising the discretion under section 89K(1):
    
    1.  the date on which the NOPA was issued, and
    2.  the response period within which the NOPA should be issued, and
    3.  the real event, circumstance or reason why the taxpayer did not issue the NOPA within the applicable response period, and
    4.  the taxpayer's compliance history in relation to the tax types under consideration (for example, whether the taxpayer has a history of paying tax late or filing late tax returns or NOPAs in the past?).
    
      
    
133.  For example, a taxpayer issues a NOPA to the Commissioner two days after the applicable "response period" has expired. The taxpayer does not provide a legitimate reason for the lateness. The taxpayer also has a history of filing late NOPAs within the minimal allowable lateness period (that is, up to two days outside the applicable "response period") and has been advised on the calculation of the "response period" each time.  
      
    
134.  Although the degree of lateness was minimal each time, the Commissioner would not accept the taxpayer's NOPA in this circumstance. This ensures that the section 89K(3)(b)(ii) exception is not treated as an extension of the "response period" in all circumstances.  
      
    
135.  The Commissioner will consider a taxpayer's application made under section 89K(1) after receiving the relevant NOPA. The responsible officer will document the reasons for accepting or rejecting the taxpayer's application and advise them of their decision in writing within 15 working days after Inland Revenue receives their application.  
      
    
136.  If the Commissioner rejects a taxpayer's application made under section 89K(1), the Commissioner can still consider the validity of the taxpayer's tax position in terms of the practice for applying the discretion under section 113. Please see _SPS 07/03: Requests to amend assessments_ for details of this practice. However, the Commissioner's decision to reject an application made under section 89K(1) is not a "disputable decision" for the purposes of section 89D(3).

 

### Time frames to complete the disputes resolution process

137.  If a taxpayer has issued a NOPA to the Commissioner and the dispute remains unresolved, when practicable, the parties should negotiate a time line to ensure that the dispute is progressed in a timely and efficient way.  
      
    
138.  Agreeing to a time line is not statutorily required but, rather, is a critical administrative requirement that requires both parties to be ready to progress matters. The parties should endeavour to meet the agreed time line. If there are delays in the progress of the dispute the responsible officer must manage the delay including any relationship with internal advisers and liaise with the taxpayer.  
      
    
139.  If the negotiated time line cannot be achieved, the Commissioner must enter into continuing discussions with the taxpayer to, either arrange a new time line, or otherwise keep them advised of when the disclosure notice will be issued. Therefore, the failure to negotiate or adhere to an agreed time line will not prevent the case from progressing through the disputes resolution process in a timely manner.  
      
    
140.  In addition to the above administrative practice, the Commissioner is bound by section 89N. Under section 89N(2), if the parties cannot agree on the proposed adjustment, the Commissioner cannot amend the assessment without completing the disputes resolution process (that is, consider the taxpayer's SOP), unless any of the exceptions in section 89N(1)(c) apply. These exceptions are explained in _SPS 08/01: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_.  
      
    
141.  Although not a statutory requirement of the disputes resolution process, when practicable, it is the Commissioner's administrative practice to go through the adjudication phase for the purpose of resolving the dispute after the SOP phase.  
      
    
142.  However, if the adjudication phase cannot be completed (for example, because the statutory time bar is imminent), the Commissioner can amend the assessment under section 113 after considering the taxpayer's SOP. Inland Revenue officers will adequately consider the facts and legal arguments in the taxpayer's SOP before deciding whether to amend the assessment. It is expected that this will occur only in very rare circumstances.  
      
    
143.  Whether the Commissioner has adequately considered a SOP will depend on what is a reasonable length of time and level of analysis for that SOP given the circumstances of the case (for example, the length of the SOP and the complexity of the legal issues).  
      
    
144.  Thus a simple dispute could take only a couple of days to consider adequately while a complex dispute could take a few weeks. If the statutory time bar is imminent the Inland Revenue officer will consider the taxpayer's SOP urgently.  
      
    
145.  If the Commissioner issues an amended assessment because section 89N(1)(c) or 89N(2)(b) applies (please see the discussion in _SPS 08/01: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_) the disputes resolution process will end and the dispute will not go through the adjudication phase. Any decision that the Commissioner makes under section 89N(1)(c) is a disputable decision for the purpose of section 89D(3).

 

### The Commissioner's response to a taxpayer's NOPA: Notice of response

146.  If the Commissioner disagrees with the taxpayer's proposed adjustment, then, under section 89G(1) the Commissioner must advise the taxpayer that any or all of their proposed adjustments are rejected by issuing a NOR within the applicable response period. That is, within two months starting on the date that the taxpayer's NOPA is issued. The Commissioner interprets this to mean that the taxpayer must receive the NOR within this period. For example, if a taxpayer issues a NOPA on 8 April 2007, the Commissioner must advise the taxpayer of its rejection by issuing to them a NOR and they must receive that NOR on or before 7 June 2007.  
      
    
147.  Where it is practicable, the Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent within 10 working days before the response period expires to advise whether the Commissioner intends to issue a NOR to them in response to their NOPA. Such contact may be made by telephone or letter.  
      
    
148.  The Commissioner must issue the NOR to the taxpayer (section 14(3)(a)) or a representative authorised to act on their behalf (section 14(3)(b)). In respect of the latter, it is a question of fact whether the recipient is authorised to receive the NOR on the taxpayer's behalf. The taxpayer must ensure that their NOPA stipulates the name of the person or agent that they have nominated to receive any NOR issued by the Commissioner (_CIR v Thompson_ (2007) 23 NZTC 21,375).  
      
    
149.  For example, a tax agent sends a NOPA to the Commissioner. Although the tax agent would appear to have ostensible authority to receive the Commissioner's NOR, the Commissioner's practice will be to contact the tax agent to confirm whether the agent can accept service of the NOR. Therefore, the Commissioner must ensure that a NOR issued in accordance with section 14(3)(b) complies with any relevant instructions given by the taxpayer or the recipient's authority to receive can otherwise be verified.  
      
    
150.  Section 89G(2) specifies the content requirements for a NOR. The Commissioner must state concisely in the NOR:
    
    1.  the facts or legal arguments in the taxpayer's NOPA that the Commissioner considers are wrong, and
    2.  why the Commissioner considers that those facts and arguments are wrong, and
    3.  any facts and legal arguments that the Commissioner relies upon, and
    4.  how the legal arguments apply to the facts, and
    5.  the quantitative adjustment to any figures proposed in the taxpayer's NOPA that results from the facts and legal arguments that the Commissioner relies upon.
    
      
    
151.  Under section 89G(2)(e), the requirement for a quantitative adjustment establishes the extent to which the Commissioner considers that the adjustment in the taxpayer's NOPA is incorrect. This amount need not be exact, although, every attempt should be made to ensure that it is as accurate as possible. The amount in dispute can be varied, as the dispute progresses. For example, if the parties agree on new figures at the conference phase.  
      
    
152.  The Commissioner considers that Inland Revenue has a statutory obligation to inform the taxpayer adequately. Therefore, any NOR that the Commissioner issues to reject the adjustment proposed in the taxpayer's NOPA must be relatively brief but sufficiently detailed to explain all the relevant facts, quantitative adjustments, issues and law.

 

### Deemed acceptance

153.  Section 89H(2) reads:
    
    > If the Commissioner does not, within the response period for a notice of proposed adjustment issued by a disputant, reject an adjustment contained in the notice, the Commissioner is deemed to accept the proposed adjustment and section 89J applies.
    
154.  If the Commissioner issues a NOR outside the two-month response period, the Commissioner is deemed to have accepted the adjustment proposed in the taxpayer's NOPA under section 89H(2). This will finish the dispute and the Commissioner must issue an assessment or amended assessment to the taxpayer pursuant to section 89J(1) (please see the discussion in paragraphs 159 to 162).  
      
    
155.  However, the Commissioner is not precluded from later exercising the discretion under section 113 and issuing to the taxpayer an amended assessment that reflects another adjustment for a different issue to that previously accepted under section 89H(2) for the same tax period.

 

**Exception to deemed acceptance**

156.  Notwithstanding section 89H(2), the Commissioner can apply to the High Court for an order that a NOR can be issued outside the two-month response period under section 89L(1). Section 89L only applies if an exceptional circumstance has occurred or prevented the Commissioner from issuing a NOR to the taxpayer within the response period. The Commissioner will endeavour to apply the requirement for exceptional circumstances in section 89L(1)(a) consistently with the similar requirement in section 89K(1)(a) (please see discussion in paragraphs 127 to 136).  
      
    
157.  Under section 89L(3), an "exceptional circumstance":
    
    1.  is an event or circumstance beyond the control of the Commissioner or an officer of the Department that provides the Commissioner with a reasonable justification for not rejecting an adjustment proposed by a disputant within the response period; and
    2.  Without limiting paragraph (a), includes a change to a tax law, or a new tax law, or a decision of a court in respect of a tax law, that is enacted or made within the response period.
    
      
    
158.  For example:
    1.  A flood damaged an Inland Revenue office during the applicable response period for a taxpayer's NOPA. The taxpayer's NOPA was lost in the flood. The Inland Revenue officer could not obtain another copy of the NOPA within the applicable response period. The absence of information has prevented the Commissioner from forming a view on the subject matter in dispute. The Commissioner can apply for a High Court order under section 89L for further time to issue a NOR.
    2.  A taxpayer issues to the Commissioner a NOPA that claims additional tax depreciation on computer software. During the two-month response period, a High Court decision was made in respect of another taxpayer. The High Court held that a depreciation claim amounted to tax avoidance and should be disallowed. The Commissioner can apply to the High Court for further time to issue a NOR to the taxpayer, so as to consider the full effect of the High Court decision.
    3.  The Inland Revenue officer to whom a taxpayer's NOPA was assigned is absent on annual leave for the remainder of the response period. The Inland Revenue officer does not arrange for another officer to prepare and issue a NOR to the taxpayer within the response period. The Commissioner is deemed to accept the NOPA under section 89H(2). In this circumstance, the Commissioner does not consider that an exceptional circumstance prevented the Inland Revenue officer from rejecting the adjustment within the response period for the purpose of section 89L(1)(a).

 

**Implication of section 89J**

159.  Pursuant to section 89J(1), if the Commissioner accepts or is deemed to accept any adjustment that is proposed in a taxpayer's NOPA, the Commissioner must include or take account of the adjustment in:
    
    1.  a notice of assessment, and
    2.  any further notice of assessment or amended assessment,
    
      
    that is issued to the taxpayer unless the Commissioner has applied to the High Court for an order that a notice can be issued rejecting the proposed adjustment under section 89L(1).  
      
    
160.  In this circumstance, the Commissioner's practice will be to not later issue a NOPA that purports to reverse any proposed adjustment previously accepted under section 89H(2) because section 89J(1) prevents the Commissioner from issuing to the taxpayer a further amended assessment that does not include or take into account the previously accepted adjustment.  
      
    
161.  However, pursuant to section 89J(2) the Commissioner can issue a notice of assessment or amended assessment that does not include or take into account an adjustment that the Commissioner has, or is deemed to have accepted, if the Commissioner considers that, in relation to the adjustment, the taxpayer:
    
    1.  was fraudulent, or
    2.  wilfully misled the Commissioner.
    
      
    
162.  If the Commissioner considers that section 89J(2) applies following a deemed acceptance under section 89H(2) the Commissioner cannot resume the earlier disputes resolution process but can later issue a NOPA in respect of any of the adjustments proposed in the earlier disputes resolution process.  
      
    
163.  Pursuant to section 89J(2), the Commissioner must decide whether any of the exceptions to section 89J(1) apply before an assessment or amended assessment that does not include an adjustment that the Commissioner has, or is deemed to have accepted can be issued.  
      
    
164.  Any opinion that the Commissioner forms under section 89J(2) must be honestly held, based on a correct understanding of the relevant grounds and reasonably justifiable on the basis of the facts and law available. An opinion formed by the Commissioner under section 89J(2) is a disputable decision for the purposes of section 89D(3).

 

### Rejection of the Commissioner's notice of response

165.  If the Commissioner has issued a NOR under section 89G(1) that rejects the adjustment proposed in the taxpayer's NOPA, the taxpayer must reject the Commissioner's NOR within the applicable response period. That is, within two months starting on the date that the Commissioner issues the NOR. Otherwise, the taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the Commissioner's NOR under section 89H(3) and the dispute will finish.  
      
    
166.  The Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent two weeks before the response period for the Commissioner's NOR expires to determine whether the taxpayer will reject the Commissioner's NOR in writing. Such contact can be made by telephone or in writing.  
      
    
167.  The taxpayer must reject the Commissioner's NOR in writing. The written rejection must be issued within the response period and can be in any form. The taxpayer does not have to expressly reject each of the rejections of proposed adjustments that are included in the Commissioner's NOR. The taxpayer's written rejection must simply make it clear that the taxpayer rejects the Commissioner's NOR.  
      
    
168.  For example, in certain circumstances, the Commissioner can treat a notice of proceedings and statement of claim that the taxpayer serves on the Commissioner within the response period to commence challenge proceedings as a valid rejection in writing of the Commissioner's NOR under section 89H(3)(a). However, if the parties do not agree to suspend the dispute under section 89N(1)(c)(viii) the Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice and the taxpayer must issue a SOP in response within the applicable response period to continue the disputes resolution process.  
      
    
169.  Where it is practicable, the taxpayer's written rejection will be referred to the responsible officer within five working days after Inland Revenue has received it and acknowledged as received within 10 working days.  
      
    
170.  If deemed acceptance occurs (that is, the taxpayer has not rejected the Commissioner's NOR in writing), the Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to advise the taxpayer of this within two weeks after the response period to the Commissioner's NOR has expired.

### Conference

 

**Conduct of a conference**

171.  Generally, if a dispute remains unresolved after the Commissioner's NOR has been rejected, the conference phase will follow. The Commissioner will usually commence the conference phase in a timely manner, that is, within one month after receiving the taxpayer's notice rejecting the Commissioner's NOR. However, the Commissioner must not endeavour to advance the disputes resolution process by initiating the conference phase before the taxpayer's rejection of the NOR has been fully considered.  
      
     
172.  If the start of the conference phase is delayed (for example to obtain legal advice) the responsible officer will keep the taxpayer informed regarding the progress of the conference. The suggested average time frame for the conference phase is three months. However, this time frame will vary depending on the facts and complexity of the specific case.  
      
    
173.  A conference is not statutorily required. Rather, the conference phase is an administrative process that aims to clarify and, if possible, resolve the disputed issue by conducting an open discussion. However, the conference phase should not be used by either party to the dispute for the purpose of delaying the completion of the disputes resolution process.  
      
    
174.  The conference should be conducted in a way that is sufficiently flexible and consistent with the taxpayer's wishes and any other relevant factors such as the scope of the investigation. The Commissioner will establish a time frame to meet with the taxpayer and any advisors and, sometimes, if necessary, Inland Revenue officers will meet with the taxpayer immediately after considering further information. Where appropriate a conference can be adjourned to allow the parties to reconsider the position that they have taken in the dispute.  
      
    
175.  A conference can range from telephone calls to several face-to-face meetings between the parties. If the parties are relying on expert evidence the expert may also attend the conference. All discussions in the conference must be recorded or otherwise documented (to provide the best record of such discussions and promote the free flow of conversation) and a consensus reached if possible.  
      
    
176.  Recordings can be made on audio or video tape, MP3 and CD recorders, the FTR Gold system or by using any other suitable audio or visual technology. This can include any agreement on facts, common grounds on which the dispute can proceed, a time frame for completing the disputes resolution process and an agreed adjustment. Any negotiations between the parties after the “on record” discussion of the disputed issues during the conference will be treated as being on a without prejudice basis if an agreement is not reached.
177.  When a dispute remains unresolved after the conference phase has been completed, the Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice under section 89M(1) without delay.  
      
    
178.  The conference phase is not necessarily complete just because the parties have held the final meeting. For example, the parties may need further information or to consider further submissions made at the conference. This will dictate when the Commissioner issues the disclosure notice. Also, the parties can engage in further discussions during or after the SOP phase to attempt to resolve some or all of the disputed issues.

 

**Legal and other advisers attending a conference**

179.  If a dispute is not settled earlier, the parties may want to obtain expert legal or other tax advice at the conference phase in addition to any legal or other advice previously obtained. These advisers can attend any meetings in relation to the dispute. The advisers can revisit some items that the parties have already discussed (but not agreed to in writing or otherwise accepted).

 

**Conference not held or abridged**

180.  The Commissioner considers that the conference phase is an important part of the disputes resolution process and will always attend a conference if requested by the taxpayer. If the parties are not in the same location the conference can be held at a place that is convenient for both parties or by telephone or videoconference.  
      
    
181.  In some circumstances, the Commissioner will not hold further discussions or a conference, notwithstanding that the parties have not reached an agreement. However, the disputes resolution process will not end, because the disclosure notice and SOP phases will still be undertaken. Where the dispute is not resolved in the SOP phase, the parties will endeavour to resolve the dispute via the adjudication process.  
      
    
182.  Conferences can be dispensed with or abridged in one or more of the following situations. If:
    
    1.  there are revenue losses incurred as a result of delaying tactics that the taxpayer has used to frustrate the collection of tax, or
    2.  the Commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer or their agent is acting in a frivolous or vexatious manner. For example, where the taxpayer is setting unreasonable demands about the time, place, or terms of such meetings, or conduct themselves unreasonably at any meeting, or
    3.  the taxpayer contests the Commissioner's policy and it is agreed to disagree or that a conference would not benefit the parties, or
    4.  the taxpayer advises the Commissioner that they want to dispense with the conference phase.
    
      
    
183.  Where it is practicable, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer or their tax agent of the decision regarding whether or not the conference phase will be dispensed with or abridged in writing within five working days after that decision is made. The reasons for the final decision must be documented.

 

### Disclosure notice

184.  The Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice under section 89M(1), unless the Commissioner:
    
    1.  does not have to complete the disputes resolution process because any of the exceptions under section 89N(1)(c) apply (please see the discussion in _SPS 08/01: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_), or
    2.  does not have to complete the disputes resolution process because the High Court has made an order that the dispute resolution process can be truncated pursuant to an application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3), or
    3.  has already issued to the taxpayer a notice of disputable decision that includes or takes into account the adjustment proposed in the NOPA pursuant to section 89M(2). Section 89M(1) and (2) reads:
        
        > (1)  Unless subsection (2) applies, and subject to section 89N, the Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice in respect of a notice of proposed adjustment to a disputant at the time or after the Commissioner or the taxpayer, as the case may be, issues the notice of proposed adjustment.  
        >   
        > (2)  The Commissioner may not issue a disclosure notice in respect of a notice of proposed adjustment if the Commissioner has already issued a notice of disputable decision that includes, or takes account of, the adjustment proposed in the notice of proposed adjustment.
        
          
          
        
    4.  The meaning of disputable decision is discussed earlier in paragraphs 56 to 65.  
          
        
    5.  The Commissioner will usually advise the taxpayer two weeks before a disclosure notice is issued that it will be issued to them.  
          
        
    6.  Where practicable, the Commissioner will contact the taxpayer shortly after the disclosure notice and SOP are issued to ascertain whether they have received these documents.  
          
        
    7.  If the taxpayer has not received the Commissioner's disclosure notice, for example, due to a postal error or an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer's control, the Commissioner will issue another disclosure notice to the taxpayer. In this circumstance, the response period within which the taxpayer must respond with their SOP will commence from the date that the Commissioner issued the initial disclosure notice.  
          
        
    8.  Where the taxpayer cannot issue a SOP within the applicable response period, they should issue a late SOP with an explanation of why it is late. The Commissioner will consider the late SOP in terms of the discretion under section 89K(1) (please see paragraphs 127 to 136 for details).
    
    _Evidence exclusion rule_
    
    190.  A disclosure notice is the document that can trigger the application of the evidence exclusion rule under section 138G(1). This rule restricts the evidence that the parties can raise in court challenges to matters disclosed in their SOP. (Both parties can refer to evidence raised by either party.)  
          
        
    191.  Any disclosure notice that the Commissioner issues will explain the effect of the evidence exclusion rule and refer to section 138G because this is one of the guiding principles of the disputes resolution process.  
          
        
    192.  Section 89M(6B) defines "evidence" for the purposes of the evidence exclusion rule to mean the available documentary evidence and not lists of potential witnesses. Therefore, the identities of both parties' witnesses in sensitive cases will continue to be protected, without undermining the effect of the evidence exclusion rule.
    
    _Issue of a disclosure notice_
    
    193.  The Commissioner can issue a disclosure notice at any time on or after the date that the taxpayer issues a NOPA because there is no statutory time frame specifying when the notice must be issued.  
          
        
    194.  The Commissioner does not have to issue a disclosure notice to a taxpayer when they ask for one to be issued. However, the Commissioner will usually discuss such a request with the taxpayer and advise whether a disclosure notice will be issued and, if not, the reasons why and the implications for the dispute.  
          
        
    195.  Generally, the Commissioner's practice is to issue a disclosure notice after the exchange of a NOPA, NOR, notice rejecting the NOR, the conclusion of the conference phase and any other enquiries and in accordance with any time line agreed with the taxpayer. The Commissioner will usually issue a disclosure notice within three months after all enquiries are concluded and the conference phase has been completed.  
          
        
    196.  However, sometimes the Commissioner cannot issue a disclosure notice within the three months mentioned in paragraph 195 if, for example, the relevant Inland Revenue officers are still further investigating the taxpayer. In this case the responsible officer must ensure that any information gathering and investigative activity is reasonable and not excessive. The responsible officer must endeavour to issue the disclosure notice immediately after any further information gathering or investigation is complete. The responsible officer will advise the taxpayer two weeks before issuing a disclosure notice that it will be issued to them.  
          
        
    197.  When possible, the responsible officer should use the relevant statutory power under the TAA to obtain any information needed to complete the conference or disclosure phases. This will ensure that the disputes resolution process is conducted in a timely and efficient manner. If the Commissioner is waiting for information to be provided pursuant to a statutory power Commissioner will defer issuing a disclosure notice to ensure that any information provided by the taxpayer can be included in the Commissioner's SOP.  
          
        
    198.  If a disclosure notice is issued earlier (for example, the facts are clear, the taxpayer agrees, or a conference is not required) the reasons must be documented and explained to the taxpayer.
    
    ### Taxpayer's statement of position
    
    199.  Pursuant to section 89M(5), once the Commissioner has issued a disclosure notice, the taxpayer must issue to the Commissioner a SOP in the prescribed form (the _IR773 Statement of position_ found on Inland Revenue's website) within the two-month response period that starts on the date that the disclosure notice is issued.  
          
        
    200.  The Commissioner cannot consider a document that the taxpayer purports to issue as a SOP before the Commissioner has issued the disclosure notice because it would have been issued outside the applicable response period. The taxpayer must submit another SOP after the disclosure notice is issued to satisfy their obligation under section 89M(5).  
          
        
    201.  Unless an "exceptional circumstance" in section 89K applies, if the taxpayer issues a SOP to the Commissioner outside the response period, the Commissioner will treat the dispute as if it was never commenced. The Commissioner does not have to issue an assessment to include or take account of the taxpayer's proposed adjustment. Section 89M(7)(b) reads:
        
        > 7  A disputant who does not issue a statement of position in the prescribed form within the response period for the statement of position, is treated as follows:  
        > ...  
        > 
        > > (b)  if the disputant has proposed the adjustment to the assessment, the disputant is treated as not having issued a notice of proposed adjustment.
        
    
    **Contents of a taxpayer's statement of position**
    
    202.  The content of a SOP is binding. If the matter proceeds to court, then pursuant to section 138G(1) the parties can only rely on the facts, evidence (excluding oral evidence), issues and propositions of law that either party discloses in their SOP barring an application by the parties to the court to include new information under section 138G(2).  
          
        
    203.  The taxpayer's SOP must be in the prescribed form (the _IR773 Statement of position_ form that can be found on Inland Revenue's website: www.ird.govt.nz) and include sufficient detail to fairly inform the Commissioner of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law on which the taxpayer wishes to rely. In particular, the taxpayer must clarify what tax laws are being relied on and advise if any of these are different to those relied on in the taxpayer's NOPA.  
          
        
    204.  However, if the Commissioner receives a SOP that is not in the prescribed form (as described in paragraph 203) the Commissioner's practice will be to advise the taxpayer that the SOP must be in the prescribed form. If this occurs on the last day of the response period the Commissioner will consider the resubmitted SOP under section 89K(1)(a)(iii) provided that the lateness is minimal.  
          
        
    205.  Section 89M(6) reads:
        
        > A disputant's statement of position in the prescribed form must, with sufficient detail to fairly inform the Commissioner,-
        > 
        > > a.  Give an outline of the facts on which the disputant intends to rely; and  
        > > b.  Give an outline of the evidence on which the disputant intends to rely; and  
        > > c.  Give an outline of the issues that the disputant considers will arise; and  
        > > d.  Specify the propositions of law on which the disputant intends to rely.
        
    206.  The minimum content requirement for a SOP is an outline of the relevant facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law. To allow the Adjudication Unit to successfully reach a decision, the outline in the SOP must contain full, complete and detailed submissions.  
          
        
    207.  An outline that consists of a frank and complete discussion of the issues, law, arguments and evidence supporting the arguments is implicit in the spirit and intent of the disputes resolution process. (In very complex cases the taxpayer should provide a full explanation of the relevant evidence.)  
          
        
    208.  The disputes resolution process does not require that relevant documents are discovered or full briefs of evidence or exhaustive lists of documents exchanged. Rather, providing an outline of relevant evidence in the SOP will ensure that both parties appreciate the availability of evidence in respect of the factual issues in dispute. The taxpayer should include an outline of any expert evidence on which they intend to rely in the SOP.  
          
        
    209.  If the Commissioner considers that the SOP has insufficient detail to allow a correct assessment to be made the SOP can be treated as invalid under section 89M(4).  
          
        
    210.  Subject to any order made by the court under section 138G(2), the evidence exclusion rule found in section 138G(1) prevents a hearing authority from considering arguments and evidence that are not included in:
        
        1.  the SOP, or
        2.  any additional information that:
            1.  the Commissioner provides under section 89M(8), that is deemed to be part of the Commissioner's SOP under subsection (9), or
            2.  the parties provide pursuant to an agreement under section 89M(13), that is deemed to be part of the provider's SOP under subsection (14).
        
          
        
    211.  Section 89M(6B) reads:
        
        > In subsection 4(b) and 6(b), evidence refers to the available documentary evidence on which the person intends to rely, but does not include a list of potential witnesses, whether or not identified by name.
        
    212.  Pursuant to section 89M(6B), the SOP must list any documentary evidence but cannot list potential witnesses. Any witnesses' identities will continue to be protected without undermining the effect of the evidence exclusion rule.
    
    **Receipt of a taxpayer's statement of position**
    
    213.  If a taxpayer has issued a SOP the Commissioner can accept the SOP or issue a SOP in response to the taxpayer's SOP. Furthermore, section 89N(2) allows the Commissioner to amend an assessment under section 113 after the Commissioner has considered the SOP. (However, the Commissioner's practice is to send the dispute through the adjudication process. Please see paragraphs 234 to 245 for details.)  
          
        
    214.  The Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent 10 working days before the response period expires to determine whether the taxpayer will issue a SOP in response to the disclosure notice. Such contact will be made by telephone or in writing. The taxpayer's SOP will be referred to the responsible officer within five working days after Inland Revenue receives it. Upon receipt of the SOP, the responsible officer will ascertain and record the following:
        
        1.  the date on which the SOP was issued, and
        2.  whether the SOP has been issued within the relevant response period, and
        3.  the salient features of the SOP including any deficiencies in its content.
        
          
        
    215.  Where it is practicable, the Commissioner will acknowledge that the taxpayer's SOP is received within 10 working days after it is received. However, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer or their agent of any deficiencies in the SOP's content as soon as practicable. They will be further advised when the response period expires that those deficiencies must be rectified to validate the SOP and whether the Commissioner intends to provide any additional information to the taxpayer.  
          
        
    216.  Where a SOP is issued outside the applicable response period, the taxpayer can apply for consideration of exceptional circumstances under section 89K. The reasons for accepting or rejecting the application must be documented and the responsible officer will make a reasonable effort to advise the taxpayer of the decision in writing within 15 working days after Inland Revenue has received the taxpayer's application.  
          
        
    217.  As mentioned above, the dispute will be treated as if it was never commenced, if the taxpayer issues a SOP outside the applicable response period and none of the exceptional circumstances under section 89K apply. Where practicable, the Commissioner must advise the taxpayer of this within 10 working days after the response period for the disclosure notice has expired.
    
    ### Commissioner's statement of position in response
    
    218.  When the taxpayer has issued a NOPA, section 89M(3) allows the Commissioner to issue a disclosure notice without a SOP. If the dispute remains unresolved the Commissioner's practice is to issue a SOP that addresses and responds to the substantive items in the taxpayer's SOP within the applicable response period (that is, within two months starting on the date that the taxpayer issued their SOP).  
          
        
    219.  However, in very rare circumstances the Commissioner may not issue a SOP in response to the taxpayer's SOP. For example, where an assessment must be issued because a statutory time bar is imminent, an exception arises under section 89N(1)(c) or the High Court has made an order that the disputes resolution process can be truncated pursuant to an application made under section 89N(3).  
          
        
    220.  If there is insufficient time to provide a SOP in response the Commissioner can apply to the High Court for further time to reply to the taxpayer's SOP under section 89M(10) if the application is made before the response period expires and the Commissioner considers that it is unreasonable to reply within the response period because of the number, complexity or novelty of matters raised in the taxpayer's SOP.  
          
        
    221.  Such applications are expected to be rare but can arise if the taxpayer is less than co-operative with supplying information and/or has failed to maintain proper and adequate records.  
          
        
    222.  The Commissioner's SOP must be in the form that the Commissioner has prescribed under section 35(1) and include sufficient details to fairly inform the taxpayer of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law on which the Commissioner wishes to rely.  
          
        
    223.  Section 89M(4) reads:
        
        > The Commissioner's statement of position in the prescribed form must, with sufficient detail to fairly inform the disputant,-  
        > (a)  Give an outline of the facts on which the Commissioner intends to rely; and  
        > (b)  Give an outline of the evidence on which the Commissioner intends to rely; and  
        > (c)  Give an outline of the issues that the Commissioner considers will arise; and  
        > (d)  Specify the propositions of law on which the Commissioner intends to rely.
        
    224.  If the Commissioner has issued a SOP, the Commissioner can also provide to a taxpayer additional information in response to matters raised in their SOP under section 89M(8) within two months starting on the date that the taxpayer's SOP is issued. This is intended to cover situations where new evidence becomes available after the Commissioner has issued a SOP and before the response period expires. For example, where the Commissioner learns that certain information has been omitted from the Commissioner's SOP and this information can be added to the SOP within the applicable response period. The additional information can include documentary evidence but not lists of potential witnesses.  
          
        
    225.  Any additional information must be provided as far as possible in the same format as the SOP in which it is included. The additional information provided under section 89M(8) is deemed to form part of the Commissioner's SOP and, thus, subject to the evidence exclusion rule under section 138G(1).  
          
        
    226.  However, when the taxpayer has commenced the dispute, the Commissioner must endeavour to include all the relevant details in the Commissioner's SOP. The Commissioner's practice is to issue a SOP to the taxpayer towards the end of the response period to allow sufficient time for gathering any further information in response and considering the SOP's content. This will minimise the occasions when additional information must be provided under section 89M(8).  
          
        
    227.  The taxpayer cannot reply to the Commissioner's SOP or any additional information provided, unless the Commissioner agrees to accept additional information under section 89M(13). (Please see the discussion under "Agreement to include additional information" below.)
    
      
    
    ### Agreement to include additional information
    
    228.  The parties can agree to include additional information in their SOP under section 89M(13) at any time during the disputes resolution process including after the dispute has been referred to the Adjudication Unit. Although there is no statutory time limit, the Commissioner's practice is to allow one month (from the later of the date that the Commissioner issues a SOP or provides any additional information under section 89M(8)) for such an agreement to be reached and information provided.  
          
        
    229.  However, before agreeing to a request made by the taxpayer under section 89M(13) the Commissioner will consider the taxpayer's prior conduct and whether they could have provided the information earlier through the application of due diligence.  
          
        
    230.  The Commissioner will usually also consider the materiality and relevance of the additional information and its capacity to help resolve the dispute and may decide to take it into account in coming to an assessment. In this circumstance, both parties will be expected to cooperate in resolving the relevance and accuracy of any such material. The Commissioner may wish to apply resources to verification and comment and this will be considered by the adjudicator.  
          
        
    231.  If a taxpayer's request to add additional information to their SOP is declined, the reasons must be documented with detailed reference to the taxpayer's conduct, level of cooperation before the request was made and why the information was not provided earlier. The responsible officer will also advise the taxpayer or their tax agent of the reasons why their request was declined.  
          
        
    232.  Any agreements to add further information to the SOP will be made subject to the taxpayer agreeing that the Commissioner can also include responses to the additional information to the SOP under section 89M(13), if required.  
          
        
    233.  Any additional information that the parties provide under section 89M(13) will be deemed to form part of the provider's SOP under section 89M(14). Thus, the evidence exclusion rule under section 138G(1) applies to the additional information.
    
    ### Preparation for adjudication
    
    234.  The Adjudication Unit is part of the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel and represents the final step in the disputes resolution process. The Adjudicator's role is to review unresolved disputes by taking a fresh look at the tax dispute and the application of law to the facts in an impartial and independent manner and provide a comprehensive and technically accurate decision that will ensure the correctness of the assessment.  
          
        
    235.  Generally, the adjudicator will make such a decision within four months after the case is referred to the Adjudication Unit. However, this will depend on the number of disputes that are before the Adjudication Unit, any allocation delays and the technical, legal and factual complexity of those disputes. (For further information on the time frame for adjudication of disputes please see the article titled "Adjudication Unit - Its role in the dispute resolution process" that was published in the _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol. 19, No. 10 (November 2007)).  
          
        
    236.  The adjudication process is an administrative (rather than a legislative one). Recent judicial comments have been made in _C of IR v Zentrum Holdings Limited and Another_, _Ch'elle Properties (NZ) Limited v CIR_ (2004) 21 NZTC 18,618 and _ANZ National Bank Ltd and others v C of IR (No. 2)_ (2006) 22 NZTC 19,835 indicating that, as a matter of law, it is not strictly necessary for Inland Revenue officers to send all disputes to the Adjudication Unit for review, and Inland Revenue officers are not necessarily bound by the Adjudication Unit's decisions.  
          
        
    237.  Notwithstanding the above judicial comments, if the parties have not agreed on all the issues at the end of the conference and disclosure phases or to truncate the disputes resolution process under section 89N(1)(c)(viii), it is the Commissioner's policy and practice that all disputes are to be sent to the Adjudication Unit for review, irrespective of the complexity or type of issues or amount of tax involved unless any of the following exceptions arise:
        
        1.  the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer's SOP for the purposes of section 89N(2)(b) and referred the dispute to the Adjudication Unit for their preliminary consideration and the Adjudication Unit has determined that it has insufficient time to reach a decision in respect of the dispute before a statutory time bar would prevent the Commissioner from subsequently increasing the assessment (please see paragraph 142 for further discussion), or
        2.  any of the legislative exceptions specified in section 89N(1)(c) apply (please see _SPS 08/01: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ for further discussion) so that the Commissioner can amend an assessment without first completing the disputes resolution process, or
        3.  the High Court has made an order that the disputes resolution process can be truncated pursuant to an application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3).
        
          
        
    238.  The decision not to refer the case to adjudication must be made by an Inland Revenue officer with a senior level of authority in Service Delivery (for example, at the time of writing this SPS the delegation was with Assurance Manager level or above). In respect of the first exception mentioned in paragraph 237(a) it is necessary that the parties have exchanged a SOP and it is a matter solely for the Adjudication Unit to determine whether it has insufficient time to fully consider the dispute.  
          
        
    239.  Thus, during a disputes resolution process, the Commissioner can issue an amended assessment to the taxpayer, for example, if the taxpayer has reached an agreement with the Commissioner under section 89N(1)(c)(viii) to abridge the adjudication phase. Furthermore, before the dispute is referred to the Adjudication Unit, the taxpayer can request that the Commissioner issues an amended assessment and then challenge that assessment under section 138B(1).  
          
        
    240.  If the dispute is to be referred to the Adjudication Unit, the Commissioner should not issue an assessment or amended assessment before the adjudication process is completed unless a time bar is imminent. The responsible officer will prepare a cover sheet that records all the documents that must be sent to the Adjudication Unit.  
          
        
    241.  The cover sheet together with copies of the documents (NOPA, NOR, notice rejecting the NOR, conference notes, both parties' SOP, additional information, material evidence including expert opinions and a schedule of all evidence held) and any recordings of discussions held during the conference must be sent to the Adjudication Unit.  
          
        
    242.  When the dispute is to be referred to adjudication, the responsible officer will issue a letter and copy of the cover sheet to the taxpayer before sending the submissions, notes and evidence to the Adjudication Unit. The cover sheet and letter is usually completed within one month after the date that the Commissioner issues the SOP or provides additional information under section 89M(8).  
          
        
    243.  The purpose of this letter is to seek the taxpayer's concurrence on the materials to be sent to the adjudicator - primarily in regard to the documentary evidence that has been disclosed at the SOP phase. This letter will allow the taxpayer no more than 10 working days from when it is received to provide a response.  
          
        
    244.  Once the taxpayer has concurred on the materials to be sent to the Adjudication Unit, those materials will usually be so forwarded. However, if the taxpayer does not provide a response the materials will be forwarded within 10 working days after the date that the letter is issued to the taxpayer advising that the materials will be sent to the Adjudication Unit. The adjudicator can also contact the parties after the initial materials have been received to obtain further information.  
          
        
    245.  Where an investigation has covered multiple issues, the cover sheet will outline any issues that the parties have agreed upon and any issues that are still disputed. The adjudicator can then consider the disputed issues and not reconsider those issues that have been agreed upon.  
          
        
    246.  Generally, the adjudicator only considers the materials that the parties have submitted. They do not usually seek out or consider further information, unless it is relevant. The adjudicator may consider such additional information notwithstanding that the parties have not agreed that the provider can include this information in their SOP under section 89M(13).  
          
        
    247.  However, any additional material that the parties have not included in their SOP (or is not deemed to be included in their SOP under section 89M(14)) cannot later be raised by the parties as evidence in the TRA or a hearing authority because of the evidence exclusion rule in section 138G(1) (please see the discussion above).
    
    ### Adjudication decision
    
    248.  Once a conclusion is reached, the Adjudication Unit will advise the taxpayer and responsible officer of the decision. The responsible officer will implement the Adjudication Unit's recommendations and follow up procedures where required, including issuing a notice of assessment to the taxpayer where applicable.  
          
        
    249.  If the Adjudication Unit makes a decision that is not in the Commissioner's favour, the Commissioner is bound by and cannot challenge that decision. The dispute will come to end. The Commissioner will issue an assessment or amended assessment to the taxpayer to reflect the decision.  
          
        
    250.  If a taxpayer commences the disputes resolution process, they can file challenge proceedings in the general jurisdiction of the TRA, its small claims jurisdiction (if the taxpayer so elects in their NOPA under section 89E(1)) or the High Court within the applicable response period if any of the following conditions is met:
        
        1.  the Commissioner or taxpayer has issued an assessment that was the subject of an adjustment that the taxpayer proposed and Commissioner rejected within the applicable response period and the Commissioner has later issued an amended assessment to the taxpayer (section 138B(2)), or
        2.  the Commissioner or taxpayer has issued an assessment that was the subject of an adjustment that the taxpayer proposed and the Commissioner rejected within the applicable response period by a NOR or other written disputable decision and the Commissioner has not issued an amended assessment (section 138B(3)), or
        3.  the Commissioner or taxpayer has issued a disputable decision that is not an assessment that was the subject of an adjustment that the taxpayer proposed and the Commissioner rejected within the applicable response period (section 138C).
        
          
        
    251.  A taxpayer must file proceedings with the TRA or High Court within the two-month response period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues:
        
        1.  the amended assessment if the challenge proceedings are filed under section 138B(2), or
        2.  the written disputable decision rejecting the taxpayer's proposed adjustment if the challenge proceedings are filed under section 138B(3), or
        3.  the written disputable decision rejecting the taxpayer's proposed adjustment if the challenge proceedings are filed under section 138C.
        
          
        
    252.  If applicable, the responsible officer will implement any decision made by the hearing authority and follow up procedures where required including issuing a notice of assessment or amended assessment to the taxpayer.

Income Tax Act 2007 - Penalties and interest arising from unintended legislative changes (WITHDRAWN)
====================================================================================================

SPS 08/03 sets out the treatment of shortfall penalties and use of money interest when a confirmed unintentional legislative change gives rise to a tax shortfall.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

### Date of withdrawal: 1 July 2018

This statement also appears in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 10.

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out the treatment of shortfall penalties and use of money interest when a tax position is taken under the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA 2007) and a confirmed unintentional legislative change gives rise to a tax shortfall.

### Application

2.  This SPS applies from the 2008/2009 and subsequent income years in relation to unintended legislative changes arising in the ITA 2007.
    
3.  SPS 05/02 "Income Tax Act 2004 - Penalties and interest arising from unintended legislative changes" continues to apply for the 2005/2006 to 2007/2008 income years for unintended legislative changes arising in the ITA 2004

### Background

4.  The ITA 2007 was enacted on 1 November 2007 and represents the final stage of a program to progressively rewrite New Zealand's income tax legislation to make it clear and easy to understand. The ITA 2007 applies from the 2008/2009 income year.
    
5.  The ITA 2007 rewrites Parts F to Y of the Income Tax Act 2004 (ITA 2004) as well as making consequential amendments to Parts A to E. No change is intended from the pre-existing law except as specifically listed in Schedule 51 of the ITA 2007 as an identified change in legislation.
    
6.  The ITA 2004 rewrote Parts C to E of the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA 1994). When reporting back on the Bill that would become the ITA 2004, the Finance and Expenditure Committee (FEC) noted that unintended legislative changes may still arise due to the difference in language from the ITA 1994. The FEC recommended the appointment of an independent committee to review submissions regarding any differences between the Acts and recommend appropriate action to the Government. The Rewrite Advisory Panel (the Panel), which advised on the rewrite of the ITA 1994, took on this role and will carry on this role in regards to the ITA 2007. Details of the Panel and the unintended legislative change process are contained in the Panel statement RAP 001 "_Process for resolving potential unintended legislative changes in the Income Tax Act 2004_". This statement is able to be viewed on the Panel's website at [www.rewriteadvisory.govt.nz](http://www.rewriteadvisory.govt.nz/)
    .
    
7.  The FEC received submissions expressing concern about shortfall penalties and use of money interest (interest) arising from unintended legislative changes made during the rewrite process. Transitional provisions enacted in the 2004 Act carried over the interpretation of the 1994 Act when the meaning arising under the 2004 Act was unclear or gave rise to an absurdity. Inland Revenue's advice to the FEC was that taxpayers who incurred tax shortfalls as a result of an unintended legislative change would still be required to meet their tax obligations but should not be subject to penalties and any interest where reasonable care had been taken. Similar transitional provisions have been included in the ITA 2007 and the same will apply.
    
8.  Accordingly this SPS sets out Inland Revenue's practice regarding the imposition of penalties and interest when an unintended legislative change results in a tax shortfall for a taxpayer. Unintended legislative changes will generally be reversed by amending legislation. Although the Government will take account of the advice of the Panel, ultimately the final decision is that of the Government. The Government may decide that the unintended legislative change should be retained. The outcome of all unintended legislative change submissions can be followed on the log on the rewrite advisory panel website, at the address above.

### Legislation

#### Income Tax Act 2007

##### ZA 3 Transitional provisions

When reference to this Act includes earlier Act

1.  A reference in an enactment or document to this Act, or to a provision of it, is to be interpreted as a reference to the Income Tax Act 2004, or the Income Tax Act 1994, or the Income Tax Act 1976, or to the corresponding provision of the earlier Act, to the extent necessary to reflect sensibly the intent of the enactment or document.

When reference to earlier Act includes this Act

2.  A reference in an enactment or document to the Income Tax Act 2004, or the Income Tax Act 1994, or the Income Tax Act 1976, or to a provision of that earlier Act, is to be interpreted as a reference to this Act, or to the corresponding provision in this Act, to the extent necessary to reflect sensibly the intent of the enactment or document.

Intention of new law

3.  The provisions of this Act, including any amendments made by this Act to the Tax Administration Act 1994, are the provisions of the Income Tax Act 2004 in rewritten form, and are intended to have the same effect as the corresponding provisions of the Income Tax Act 2004. Subsection (5) overrides this subsection.

Using old law as interpretation guide

4.  Unless a limit in subsection (5) applies, in circumstances where the meaning of a taxation law that comes into force at the commencement of this Act (the new law) is unclear or gives rise to absurdity-
    1.  the wording of a taxation law that is repealed by section ZA 1 and that corresponds to the new law (the old law) must be used to determine the correct meaning of the new law; and
    2.  it can be assumed that a corresponding old law provision exists for each new law provision.

Limits to subsections (3) and (4)

5.  Subsections (3) and (4) do not apply in the case of-
    1.  a new law listed in schedule 51 (Identified changes in legislation); or
    2.  a new law that is amended after the commencement of this Act, with effect from the date on which the amendment comes into force.

#### Tax Administration Act 1994

183D. Remission consistent with collection of highest net revenue over time-

1.  The Commissioner may remit-
    1.  A late filing penalty; and  
        (aa) A non-electronic filing penalty; and  
         
    2.  A late payment penalty; and  
        (bb) A shortfall penalty imposed by section 141AA; and  
        (bc) A civil penalty imposed under section 215 or 216 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006; and  
        (bd) a penalty for not paying employer monthly schedule amount imposed by section 141ED; and
    
    4.  Interest under Part VII-  
        payable by a taxpayer if the Commissioner is satisfied that the remission is consistent with the Commissioner's duty to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law.
2.  In the application of this section, the Commissioner must have regard to the importance of the late payment penalty, the late filing penalty, and interest under Part7 in promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts.
3.  The Commissioner must not consider a taxpayer's financial position when applying this section.

### Discussion

#### Transitional Provisions

9.  The transitional provisions are contained in Part Z of the ITA 2007. The basic premise as reinforced in section ZA 3(3) is that the ITA 2007 is the ITA 2004 in rewritten form. Apart from the identified legislative changes contained in schedule 51 of the ITA 2007 and subsequent amendments, the provisions in the ITA 2007 are intended to have the same effect as the corresponding provisions in the ITA 2004. The intent is to preserve case law and Inland Revenue practice and policy statements made under the ITA 2004 so they can be applied to interpret the ITA 2007.
    
10.  The ITA 2007 has full effect from the 2008/2009 income year and from this time must be used instead of the ITA 2004. In general taxpayers must consider and apply the ITA 2007 on its own terms.
    
11.  However, in situations where the meaning of a provision of the ITA 2007 is unclear or gives rise to an absurdity, the wording of the former provision under the ITA 2004 is to be used to determine the correct meaning of the new law (section ZA 3(4)). In general terms the Commissioner's statements in respect of the ITA 2004 may be relied upon - however this will not always be the case, for example, where the legislation has changed or there is a change in case law.
    
12.  If it is considered that the wording in the ITA 2007 gives rise to a change in meaning from the ITA 2004, a submission can be made to the Panel identifying the potential unintended legislative change (refer Panel statement RAP 001).
    
13.  Section ZA 3(5) excludes from the transitional provisions intended changes as listed in Schedule 51 (Identified changes in legislation) and it also excludes any amendments made to the ITA 2007 after the commencement of the new Act from the application date of the amendment. Therefore if an amendment is retrospective back to the commencement date of the ITA 2007 then the transitional provisions will not apply from that commencement date. In these situations the normal rules of statutory interpretation will apply.
    
14.  If the meaning of the words in the ITA 2007 are clear, then the tax position that a taxpayer takes in their return should be based on the meaning of the words in that Act. This is the case even if the tax liability is greater than was thought to be the case under the ITA 2004. If, on the other hand, it is reasonably believed that the words are unclear or lead to an absurd result, reference should be made to the ITA 2004 to ascertain the meaning of the ITA 2007.
    
15.  In taking a tax position under the ITA 2007, if there is any material doubt about the meaning of the law, a taxpayer is entitled to assume that a provision that has not been amended since the introduction of the Act and not included in Schedule 51 has the same effect as the corresponding provision in the ITA 2004.

#### Shortfall Penalties

16.  If a tax shortfall subsequently arises due to an unintended legislative change from the corresponding provision in the ITA 2004 then it is reasonable that the taxpayer will not have to pay interest on the tax shortfall or be liable to a shortfall penalty.
    
17.  To avoid a shortfall penalty, a taxpayer will still have to take reasonable care in taking a tax position whether or not they are applying a Commissioner's published statement. In addition, in relation to income tax the taxpayer will need to have taken an acceptable tax position. An acceptable tax position is a tax position that meets the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. This means that the position taken by the taxpayer should have around or close to a 50% chance or more of being upheld in court.
    
18.  In the event that a taxpayer is liable for a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care or for taking an unacceptable tax position, the level of the shortfall penalty is 20% of the tax shortfall. This will be reduced by 100% if the taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure before being notified of a pending tax audit or investigation or by 40% if the disclosure is made after being notified of a pending tax audit or investigation but before the audit or investigation starts.

#### Interest

19.  Interest is automatically calculated when the taxpayer's account is assessed with the correct amount of tax. A taxpayer who incurs a tax shortfall as a result of an unintended legislative change will receive a statement showing interest charged. This cannot be prevented.
    
20.  However section 183D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) allows the Commissioner to remit interest if the Commissioner is satisfied that remission is consistent with the Commissioner's duty to collect the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law. In applying section 183D the Commissioner must have regard to the importance of interest in promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers.
    
21.  The Commissioner considers that enforcing the payment of interest in situations where taxpayers incur a tax shortfall as a result of an unintended legislative change would be to the detriment of encouraging voluntary compliance among taxpayers.
    
22.  A taxpayer seeking a remission of interest under section 183D of the TAA is required by section 183H of the TAA to make an application in writing requesting the remission.

### Standard Practice

#### Tax Shortfall due to an unintended legislative change

23.  If a taxpayer incurs a tax shortfall as a result of an unintended legislative change in the ITA 2007, no shortfall penalty will be charged and the taxpayer will be entitled to apply in writing to the Commissioner for a remission of interest.
    
24.  The taxpayer will still need to have taken reasonable care and an acceptable tax position.
    
25.  To obtain a remission of the interest charged, a taxpayer will need to write to the Commissioner requesting remission as this is a legislative requirement.
    
26.  The taxpayer will still be required to pay the shortfall of tax by the due date that is set for it.
    
27.  The Commissioner has identified two scenarios when a shortfall incurred by a taxpayer is a result of an unintended legislative change to the ITA 2007:

##### Scenario 1

In taking a tax position in their tax return, a taxpayer applies the ITA 2007 as the law is clear. An unintended legislative change from the ITA 2004 is later identified and confirmed by the Panel. On advice by the Panel, the Government amends the ITA 2007 retrospectively to be consistent with the ITA 2004. As a result of the amendment, a tax shortfall arises. It is established that the taxpayer has taken reasonable care and an acceptable tax position.

##### Comment

In this situation, the taxpayer had taken an interpretation based on the words in the ITA 2007. The tax shortfall that subsequently arose is solely due to the unintended legislative change and the Government's decision to amend the ITA 2004 retrospectively. In this instance no shortfall penalty will be imposed and the taxpayer will be entitled to a remission of interest upon written application to the Commissioner.

##### Scenario 2

In taking a tax position in their tax return a taxpayer is required to have regard to the wording of the corresponding provisions of the ITA 2004 as the law in the ITA 2007 is unclear or leads to an absurd result. An unintended legislative change in the ITA 2007 is later identified and confirmed by the Panel. The Government decides not to amend the ITA 2007. As a result, a tax shortfall arises. It is established that the taxpayer has taken reasonable care and an acceptable tax position.

##### Comment

In this scenario the law in the ITA 2007 is not clear or leads to an absurdity. As required under section ZA 3(4), the taxpayer has used the law in the ITA 2004 to interpret the meaning of the law in the ITA 2007. However, it is later established by the Panel that the meaning of the law in the ITA 2007 is different from that of the corresponding provision in the ITA 2004. The Government decides to retain the new meaning. Thus the tax shortfall that the taxpayer consequently incurs does not arise due to any fault of the taxpayer. No shortfall penalty will be imposed and the taxpayer will be entitled to a remission of interest upon written application to the Commissioner.

#### Tax Shortfall not due to an unintended legislative change

28.  Outside the 2 scenarios above and this SPS, a taxpayer's liability to shortfall penalties and interest will be considered on a case by case basis according to normal principles. This will include the situations where an unintended legislative change is confirmed by the Panel but the tax shortfall incurred by the taxpayer did not arise due to the unintended legislative change. Rather, the tax shortfall arose as a result of an incorrect interpretation by the taxpayer.
    
29.  There will also be instances where an unintended legislative change is not confirmed by the Panel. In this case, it will be clear that a tax shortfall incurred by the taxpayer did not arise due to an unintended legislative change but is the result of an incorrect interpretation by the taxpayer.
    
30.  These cases are no different to any other case when a tax shortfall arises. Whether a taxpayer incurs a shortfall penalty will be decided on the facts of each case, and whether the taxpayer took reasonable care and an acceptable tax position.
    
31.  Interest charged on the shortfall will be payable along with the outstanding tax. Generally, no remission of interest will be allowed. However the taxpayer will still have the right to apply in writing to the Commissioner for a remission of interest and each case will be considered on its merits in accordance with the relevant Standard Practice Statement (currently SPS 05/10 _"Remission of penalties and interest"_ ).
    
32.  By way of contrast to the two scenarios covered above, below are four scenarios that are outside the SPS. The first two are when there is a confirmed unintended legislative change but the tax shortfall that arises is not a result of the unintended legislative change. The following two are when a potential unintended legislative change is not confirmed:

#### Unintended legislative change confirmed by the Panel

##### Scenario 3

A taxpayer takes a tax position under the ITA 2007 as the law is clear. The tax position taken by the taxpayer is not correct and a tax shortfall arises. An unintended legislative change is later identified and confirmed by the Panel. However, the Government decides not to amend the ITA 2007. It is established that the taxpayer has taken reasonable care and has an acceptable tax position.

##### Comment

The taxpayer has interpreted the ITA 2007 in taking their tax position. An unintended legislative change has been confirmed but the law in the ITA 2007 is not changed. The tax position that the taxpayer has taken is an incorrect interpretation of the ITA 2007 and the tax shortfall is not due to the unintended legislative change. There will be no shortfall penalty charged but interest will be payable. This scenario highlights the need to have particular regard to the wording of the ITA 2007. An acceptable tax position based on the ITA 2004 will not necessarily give rise to an acceptable tax position under the ITA 2007.

##### Scenario 4

A taxpayer interprets the law in the ITA 2004 in taking a tax position in their return as the corresponding provision in the ITA 2007 is unclear or leads to an absurd result. An unintended legislative change in the ITA 2007 is later identified and confirmed by the Panel. The Government decides to amend the ITA 2007 retrospectively to be consistent with the ITA 2004. Nevertheless, a tax shortfall arises as a result of an incorrect interpretation of the ITA 2004. It is established that the taxpayer has taken reasonable care and has an acceptable tax position.

##### Comment

As directed by section ZA 3(4) the taxpayer has used the ITA 2004 to ascertain the meaning of the corresponding provision in the ITA 2007 as it is unclear or leads to an absurd result. The ITA 2007 is amended to have the same effect as the ITA 2004 but the taxpayer still has a tax shortfall that is the result of an incorrect interpretation of the provision in the ITA 2004, not the unintended legislative change. There will be no shortfall penalty but interest will be payable.

#### Potential unintended legislative change not confirmed by the Panel

##### Scenario 5

A taxpayer applies the law in the ITA 2007 in taking a tax position in their return as the law is clear. A potential unintended legislative change is identified but is not confirmed by the Panel. The tax position taken by the taxpayer is not correct and a tax shortfall arises. It is established that the taxpayer has taken reasonable care and has an acceptable tax position.

##### Comment

This case is similar to scenario 3 but the Panel has decided that there is no unintended legislative change in the ITA 2007. The taxpayer has a tax shortfall from taking an incorrect interpretation of the ITA 2007. There will be no shortfall penalty but interest will be payable. As with scenario 3, this scenario highlights the need to have regard to the wording of the ITA 2007 when taking a tax position, even when it is thought that there has been an unintended legislative change.

##### Scenario 6

A taxpayer interprets the law in the ITA 2004 in taking a tax position in their return as the corresponding provision in the ITA 2007 is unclear or leads to an absurd result. A potential unintended legislative change is later identified but not confirmed by the Panel. A tax shortfall arises as a result of an incorrect interpretation of the unchanged ITA 2004. It is established that the taxpayer has taken reasonable care and an acceptable tax position.

##### Comment

This case is similar to scenario 4 but the Panel has decided that there is no unintended legislative change in the ITA 2007. The taxpayer has incurred a tax shortfall from taking an incorrect interpretation of the law. There will be no shortfall penalty but interest will be payable.

33.  Please note that all six scenarios have been based on the assumption that the taxpayer has taken reasonable care and has an acceptable tax position when taking their tax position. In cases where a taxpayer has not taken reasonable care or has an unacceptable tax position, a shortfall penalty will be imposed.
    
34.  The following matrix summarises the Commissioner's practice when a tax shortfall arises. This matrix assumes reasonable care and an acceptable tax position.

| Scenario | Unintended change confirmed? | Unintended change reversed retrospectively? | Shortfall penalties? | Remission of Interest? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 - Relies on new law | Yes | Yes | No  | Yes |
| 2 - New law unclear and relies on old law | Yes | No  | No  | Yes |
| 3 - Relies on new law | Yes | No  | No  | No  |
| 4 - New law unclear and relies on old law | Yes | Yes | No  | No  |
| 5 - Relies on new law | No  | N/A | No  | No  |
| 6 - New law unclear and relies on old law | No  | N/A | No  | No  |

#####   
Overpayments by a taxpayer

35.  If a taxpayer has an overpayment due to any of the scenarios outlined in the table above the normal rules, as they pertain to the Commissioner paying the taxpayer interest, will apply.

##### Savings - existing documents and publications

36.  All references to the ITA 2004 in existing documents and publications such as standard practice statements and booklets should be read as references to the ITA 2007 and all policies and practices contained within these documents should be applied to the corresponding provisions in the ITA 2007.

This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 14 November 2008

Elections to change a balance date (WITHDRAWN)
==============================================

This Standard Practice Statement ("SPS") sets out Inland Revenue's practice for considering applications for the Commissioner's consent to change a balance date for income tax purposes. This includes taxpayers who wish to change from a non-standard balance date to a 31 March balance date.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

This statement also appears in the _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 20, No 11 (February 2009).

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement ("SPS") sets out Inland Revenue's practice for considering applications for the Commissioner's consent to change a balance date for income tax purposes. This includes taxpayers who wish to change from a non-standard balance date to a 31 March balance date.

### Application

2.  This SPS applies from 1 January 2009.
3.  This SPS applies to the exercise of the Commissioner's discretion under section 38 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("the TAA") when considering whether to give consent to taxpayers' elections to change their balance dates. It replaces all previous Inland Revenue policy statements on changes of balance dates for income tax purposes, including those published in the _Tax Information Bulletins_, Vol 3, No 9 (June 1992) and Vol 5, No 11 (April 1994).
4.  Due to the recent enactment of the portfolio investment entity rules, this SPS also updates the standard practice set out in _SPS 05/06 Non-standard balance dates for managed funds and "as agent" returns_, which was published in the _Tax Information Bulletin_,Vol 17, No 4 (May 2005). _SPS 05/06_ is therefore withdrawn from the application date of this SPS.
5.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the TAA.

### Legislation

6.  The relevant legislative provisions are:
    1.  sections 6, 6A, 33, 37 and 38 of the TAA
    2.  sections HD 16 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 ("ITA 2007").

### Summary

7.  Section 38 allows taxpayers, with the consent of the Commissioner, to elect to furnish a return of income for the year ending on the date corresponding with the balance date of their annual accounts, instead of using the standard 31 March otherwise required by the TAA.
8.  Only taxpayers with an obligation to file returns under section 33 (generally being persons in business or those who receive income which is not taxed at source) may apply under section 38 to adopt a balance date other than 31 March. In addition, a portfolio tax rate entity that does not make payments of tax under section HL 23 of the ITA 2007 is not able to make an election under section 38.
9.  The Commissioner has an obligation to protect the integrity of the tax system, including applying the tax laws fairly, impartially and according to the law. In doing this regard will be given to the general legislation intent that taxpayers are required to return income to 31March. The Commissioner will also ensure that the timing of tax revenue to the Government is not seriously eroded. Every application will be considered on individual merit in accordance with this SPS.
10.  The Commissioner will consent to a taxpayer's election when the taxpayer is able to demonstrate that a 31 March balance date (or previously approved non-standard balance date) is impractical due to the nature of their business or their circumstances. Consent will not be given when elections are made for the purposes of smoothing administration/management workloads or deferring payments of tax liabilities.

### Discussion

11.  The Commissioner acknowledges there are situations where a balance date of 31 March may be impractical, and will provide consent to allow taxpayers to align their balance date to:
    1.  adopt an alternative balance date when taxpayers can demonstrate that the nature of their business makes a 31 March balance date impractical, or
    2.  align with an agreed industry balance date, or
    3.  allow a shareholder-employee to use the same balance date as the relevant company, or
    4.  allow a subsidiary to use the same balance date as the parent company, or
    5.  align balance dates for business entities with a close working relationship, where they share a common business/management accounting system or central administration structure and already have an approved non-standard balance date, or
    6.  allow managed funds to adopt a balance date in common with a fund manager or trustee when it can be demonstrated that a parent-subsidiary like relationship exists between parties (excludes a portfolio tax rate entity that does not make payments of tax under section HL 23 of the ITA 2007), or
    7.  allow entities deemed to be agents of non-resident insurers to file "as agent" returns in terms of section HD 16 of the ITA 2007 (excludes a portfolio tax rate entity that does not make payments of tax under section HL 23 of the ITA 2007), or
    8.  adopt a balance date applicable to a non-resident taxpayer's tax jurisdiction, when they perform business activities in New Zealand that have a centre of management outside New Zealand (does not apply to passive investment income), or
    9.  allow an estate to adopt the date that coincides with the date of death of the deceased taxpayer as the balance date for the continuing estate, or
    10.  allow a previously tax exempt entity to continue to use a balance date consistent with an existing date for financial reporting purposes. (For example, a charity that had only exempt income so was not previously required to file tax returns and is now required to file returns, may continue to use the non-standard balance date they had used prior to entering the tax base.)

#### Commissioner's consent required

12.  When a taxpayer wishes to adopt a non-standard balance date, or change from a non-standard balance date back to 31 March (or to change from one non-standard balance date to another), they are required to obtain the Commissioner's consent under section 38 before they can file a return on the basis of that new balance date.
13.  Section 38 reads:  
     
    
    > 38(1) \[Returns to annual balance date\] Instead of furnishing a tax year return under section 33 on the basis of a corresponding income year that ends on 31 March, a taxpayer (other than a taxpayer to whom section 33A(1) or (5) applies) may, with the consent of the Commissioner, elect to furnish a return based on a corresponding income year that ends with the date of the annual balance of the taxpayer's accounts.
    > 
    > 38(1B) \[When portfolio tax rate entity must not make election\] A portfolio tax rate entity that does not make payments of tax under section HL 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007 must not make an election under subsection (1).  
    > ...
    > 
    > 38(3) \[Approval required for change of election\] Any election made by a taxpayer for the purposes of this section shall continue in force unless and until it is altered by the taxpayer with the prior approval in writing of the Commissioner.
    
14.  Section 38(1) provides that the Commissioner may consent to taxpayers furnishing their tax returns for a tax year that does not end on 31 March. However, the legislation provides no further guidance on how this discretion will be exercised. By implication, taxpayers will need to show that the use of a 31 March balance date would be impractical for their specific circumstances. (31 March is a default position by reference to the term "tax year" under section 33, and section YA 1 of the ITA 2007 defines "tax year" as a period starting 1 April and ending 31 March.)
15.  In considering an election for a non-standard balance date, the Commissioner will form an independent view on matters, consistent with his statutory responsibilities under section 6 to maintain the integrity of the tax system. Consent will be provided where the Commissioner agrees that a taxpayer's circumstances are such that requiring them to return income to 31 March would be impractical (meaning that taking into account their circumstances, including industry practice, a 31 March accounting for tax would place an unfair burden on them).
16.  The Commissioner will not provide consent when a significant reason for the change is to defer the payment of tax, or to take earlier advantage of a tax incentive or concession than would otherwise have been the case had no change of balance date occurred. Nor would a wish to smooth out administrative or managerial workloads within the taxpayer's business (setting aside matters relating to seasonal businesses) be sufficient reason on its own for the Commissioner to agree to a non-standard balance date.

#### Commissioner's considerations

17.  Careful consideration will be given to the reasons and information supplied in each application in support of a taxpayer's election to change a balance date, particularly business and commercial factors. The Commissioner's considerations may also extend to other relevant information held for a taxpayer and wider industry practice to establish an informed view whether the circumstances of a particular case provide sufficient cause for the taxpayer not to return income to 31 March or their current balance date. Paragraphs 19 to 33 of this SPS explain the relevant matters that will be considered by the Commissioner. Paragraphs 32 and 33 address the standard practice for election to change balance dates for managed funds and "as agent" returns. Paragraph 11 outlines the most common situations where the discretion has been exercised - some of these are the subject of further comment below.
18.  When providing consent to a new balance date, the Commissioner will only agree to a balance date that is the last calendar day of a month, e.g. 30 November rather than 15November - except for a continuing estate that elects to adopt a balance date that coincides with a deceased taxpayer's date of death.

#### Compliance costs

19.  Business taxpayers will always incur administration costs in a number of ways, including general accounting, financial and reporting requirements. Compliance costs will be considered as a factor when a taxpayer is able to show that they will incur unreasonable or excessive such costs as a consequence of having to return income to 31 March. The Commissioner will have regard to normal compliance costs, excluding for instance those incurred by choice by taxpayers through self-imposed internal planning or reporting requirements.
20.  The Commissioner will also have regard to the impact of other statutory reporting requirements on taxpayers' annual accounts and their tax obligation to return income.

#### Passive income

21.  Passive income is generally income derived from investments or property without any direct physical exertion or application of specialist skill by a taxpayer (for example, income from interest or dividends). In contrast, a business activity includes a profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for a pecuniary profit.
22.  Taxpayers whose primary source of income is from passive investments will generally be required to return income to 31 March. Much of the information on earnings required to file a return is available from financial institutions on a periodic basis.
23.  An exception to taxpayers with passive income being required to return income to 31March is when related entities are engaged in a common business activity that has a non-standard balance date. This concession is intended to avoid additional compliance costs and disruption with preparing annual accounts when a taxpayer derives passive income through the business activity of a related entity. For example, a family trust leases a factory to a family trading partnership. The family trust passively derives their primary source of income from the related family trading partnership, which has a non-standard balance date. In this case, the Commissioner will consent to the family trust adopting a common non-standard balance date. This will align the balance date with the partnership.
24.  A further exception applies to taxpayers with an attributing interest in a Foreign Investment Fund ("FIF") when they calculate their FIF income using the accounting profits method or branch equivalent method. Section EX 69 of the ITA 2007 provides specific rules for change of FIF balance dates and also require the Commissioner's consent before a new accounting year can be used.

#### Taxpayers with wage/salary as well as business income

25.  In situations where a taxpayer has income from salary or wages as well as business income the Commissioner may still agree to a non-standard balance date under the normal rules. For example, a taxpayer earns a salary as a teacher and also has a small orchard from which she derives business income. The taxpayer wishes to adopt a non-standard balance date of 30 June. The Commissioner would agree to the change of balance date as it is an industry approved balance date, despite the income from salary/wages. (In this situation the taxpayer will return their business income to 30 June, but will continue to return the income from her salary to 31 March.)

#### Annual business cycle

26.  Some businesses have a "natural" end to their income year. For example, the end of a growing season, the end of a traditionally busy trading period, or the time in the annual business cycle in which the majority of income and relevant costs can be brought to account. Examples of businesses which have "natural" income years not ending on 31March include farmers, or growers or harvesters of primary produce subject to seasonal climate conditions or natural cycles of stock breeding. That may also extend to directly related service industries involved in say harvesting, processing, packaging and exporting of produce.
27.  Market demands of manufactured goods and seasonal impacts on growing/harvesting of produce influence the trading patterns of many businesses. Taxpayers impacted by seasonal constraints or demands on their businesses may find a 31 March balance date impractical when their attention is on those seasonal activities and the majority of their income is yet to be derived.
28.  The natural end to a season for growers or retail manufacturers can be identified with the end of their production cycle when the last, or majority, of their produce is delivered to a processor or retail outlet. Once the harvest or peak business period is completed, a grower or manufacturer then commences preparation for the next annual busy season.

#### Industry balance dates

29.  The Commissioner recognises a number of industry specific non-standard balance dates (refer to Appendix A). These dates have been determined following representations to the Commissioner by the industries concerned. Taxpayers within these industries may apply for consent to adopt these approved industry balance dates. Refer to paragraphs 34 to 37 for the method of application.
30.  Taxpayers aligned to an industry that has a recognised non-standard balance date still have the option to seek an alternative non-standard balance date (or remain with 31 March) if the industry balance date does not suit their circumstances.
31.  Where taxpayers want to adopt an alternative non-standard balance date, they are required to make a full application that will be decided on the merit of each individual case as provided under paragraph 48(a).

#### Managed funds and "as agent" returns for non-resident insurers

32.  Inland Revenue will consider elections for non-standard balance dates from the following entities (excludes portfolio tax rate entities that do not make payments of tax under section HL 23 of the ITA 2007):
    1.  the trustee of a unit trust that wishes to align its balance date with that of its manager, or
    2.  the trustee of a group investment fund that wishes to align its balance date with that of its manager, or
    3.  the trustee of a superannuation fund that wishes to align its balance date with that of its trustee or, where the fund is administered by an employer for the benefit of its employees, the balance date of the employer, or
    4.  a taxpayer (who is a resident for taxation purposes) required to file an "as agent" return that wishes to align the balance date of that return with the taxpayer's own non-standard balance date.

_Indicative examples of recognised relationship_

33.  A taxpayer may adopt a non-standard balance date if one of the following examples apply:
    1.  **A unit trust wishes to align its balance date with that of its manager**  
        A unit trust may choose to align its balance date with that of its manager. The manager is the entity with responsibility for the management of the unit trust and is appointed under the trust deed. Adoption of the manager's balance date is appropriate only if the manager has retained the responsibility for day-to-day administration of the unit trust.
    2.  **A group investment fund wishes to align its balance date with that of its manager**  
        A group investment fund is administered and overseen by a manager. The fund may have a separate trustee, although there is no requirement that the trustee and manager be separate entities. Consent will only be granted to align the fund's balance date with that of the manager.  
        As with unit trusts, the concession applies when the manager has retained the responsibility for day-to-day administration of the trust and for preparing the trust's accounts. When these functions have been contracted out to a third party, it is not appropriate to adopt the manager's balance date.
    3.  **A managed fund wishes to align its tax balance date for financial reporting purposes**  
        A managed fund (including unit trusts, group investment funds and superannuation funds) may choose to align its balance date with that for financial reporting purposes if it can be demonstrated that the alignment of balance dates helps reduce the managed fund's tax risks. The purpose of this concession is to promote voluntary compliance and good tax practices. Inland Revenue expects the managed fund to set out the reasons for changing their balance dates. These reasons will be examined on a case-by-case basis.  
        However, this concession does not apply if:
        1.  the reason for changing the balance date is to improve the managed fund's administration of human resources (e.g. smoothing the workflows of their managers)
        2.  the managed fund cannot provide evidence of what the tax risks are and how the change of balance date helps to mitigate these risks
        3.  the managed fund can identify some of its tax risks but the change of balance date is irrelevant to the mitigation of these risks.
    4.  **Superannuation funds**  
        **An employer superannuation fund wishes to align its balance date with that of the employer**  
        A scheme established for the benefit of employees of an employer may apply to adopt the balance date of that employer. **Any other superannuation fund (e.g. a wholesale or retail fund) wishes to align its balance date with that of its trustee**  
        The trust deed under which a superannuation fund is established will appoint a trustee to supervise the fund. Consent will be given for a fund to align its balance date with that of the trustee, provided that the trustee's role has not been contracted out to a third party.
    5.  **A taxpayer who is an agent of a non-resident insurer wishes to align the balance date of its "as agent" return to its own non-standard balance date**  
          
        A taxpayer who insures with a non-resident insurer is required to return part of the premiums paid as income in a return known as an "as agent" return (section HD 16 of the ITA 2007). This income is returned by the taxpayer "as agent" for the non-resident insurer.  
          
        Taxpayers with an approved non-standard balance date for their own returns will be granted consent to align the balance dates of their "as agent" returns to this date.

#### Election methods

34.  Some elections to adopt a non-standard balance date can be made by telephone (0800 377 774) or in writing. This applies to the following types of balance date changes where:
    1.  a taxpayer who operates a business wants to adopt a recognised industry balance date as listed in Appendix A, or
    2.  a shareholder-employee wants the same non-standard balance date as a company to which their shareholding relates, where earnings from the company is their primary source of income, or
    3.  a continuing estate wants to adopt a balance date that coincides with a deceased taxpayer's date of death, or
    4.  a subsidiary company wants to align to the balance date used by a parent company, or
    5.  a non-resident taxpayer wants to adopt a balance date applicable in their country of residence, when they perform a business activity in New Zealand that has a centre of management outside New Zealand (does not apply to passive investment income).
35.  These elections can be made by phone because the criteria for adopting a non-standard balance date can be easily verified at the time of contact. This is because the Commissioner will have this information in his records.
36.  Other elections to adopt a non-standard balance date must be in writing where:
    1.  taxpayers adopt an alternative balance date when they consider 31 March is an inappropriate balance date, due to the circumstances of their business activity, or
    2.  taxpayers align balance dates for business entities with a close working relationship, where they share a common business/management accounting system or central administration structure with an approved non-standard balance date, or
    3.  managed funds want to adopt a balance date common with a fund manager or trustee when it can be demonstrated a parent-subsidiary like relationship exists between parties, or
    4.  entities deemed to be agents of non-resident insurers file "as agent" returns in terms of section HD 16 of the ITA 2007.
37.  The above elections are required in writing as these are more complex situations that generally require careful consideration, research and confirmation of the relevant information.

#### Unacceptable reasons for a balance date change

38.  The anniversary date of the commencement of a business is not a valid reason for a balance date other than 31 March.
39.  Elections to change a balance date for reasons of tax deferral or tax avoidance, or to take advantage of any tax incentive or concession, will not be accepted.

#### Retrospective elections

40.  Ideally, elections to change a balance date will be made and the Commissioner's consent received prior to the commencement of a new income year, so taxpayers can avoid additional compliance costs should consent be withheld.
41.  Sometimes, the Commissioner's consent to a change in balance date will not have been received until after the start of an income year, or delays have been experienced with consent where the Commissioner has required further information. In situations where the timing of the application has been the only reason for withholding the Commissioner's consent past practice has been to defer the effective date for change of a balance date to the following income year.
42.  The Commissioner's practice is modified to provide some flexibility, in limited circumstances, to provide consent to a retrospective application of a balance date change for current income year elections. Late applications for a change of balance date will be accepted if made before the earlier of the return filing date under section 37(1) for the current balance date and that for the proposed balance date but does not include extension of time arrangements for filing returns. Consent will be provided where taxpayers can show that:
    1.  it is possible to file returns for all the income years, and
    2.  the late election was not made for reasons of tax deferral or tax avoidance, or to take undue advantage of any tax incentive or concession, and
    3.  any incidental tax deferral as a consequence of the proposed balance date is only insignificant when compared with their tax liability for the year under their current balance date.

#### New business taxpayers

43.  The Commissioner will consider elections from new business taxpayers to adopt a balance date other than 31 March, with application to their first return/tax year.
44.  In addition previously tax exempt activities that become new business taxpayers continuing the same activity may (with the Commissioners consent) retain the use of a non-standard balance date already used for existing financial reporting purposes.

#### Misleading information

45.  Once an election is received, the Commissioner will examine the reasons and information provided in support of the taxpayer's election to change their balance date. The onus is on taxpayers to make a full disclosure of the reasons for their election and to provide all relevant information to support their application. This will enable the Commissioner to adequately consider the taxpayer's election to change their balance date.
46.  However, the Commissioner is not bound by any consent given based on misleading information.

#### Consequential changes

47.  When the Commissioner agrees to a change of balance date, the taxpayer will be advised of the effective date of the change and the period for which they will be required to file a transitional return. Further information on transitional return periods is attached at Appendix B.

### Standard practice

#### Commissioner's consent to a change in balance date

48.  The Commissioner will agree to adopting a change in balance date in the following situations (excluding portfolio tax rate entities that do not make payments of tax under section HL 23 of the ITA 2007):
    1.  A business taxpayer elects to change a balance date and can present good business reasons to persuade the Commissioner a 31 March balance date is impractical for returning income, or their circumstances have changed significantly and they should be permitted to further change a non-standard balance date previously consented to. This will include consideration by the Commissioner to elections by new business taxpayers to adopt a non-standard balance date, with application to their first return/tax year.
    2.  A business taxpayer elects to adopt a recognised industry balance date.
    3.  A franchise owner is required as a condition of a franchise agreement to use a non-standard balance date for financial reporting purposes and the applicable balance date has been recognised via agreement between the Commissioner and the master franchisor.
    4.  A shareholder-employee elects to adopt the same non-standard balance date as the company to which the shareholding relates and from which they derive their primary source of income.
    5.  A continuing estate wants to adopt a balance date that coincides with a deceased taxpayer's date of death.
    6.  A subsidiary company elects to adopt the same non-standard balance date as used by a parent company.
    7.  A non-resident taxpayer, operating a business activity in New Zealand that has a centre of management outside New Zealand, elects to use a balance date for preparing annual accounts and returning income in their country of residence.
    8.  A business entity with a close trading relationship with another business entity with a shared accounting system or central administration structure, elects to adopt a common non-standard balance date.
    9.  A managed fund elects to adopt a balance date common in with a fund manager or trustee when it can be demonstrated a parent-subsidiary like relationship exists between parties.
    10.  An entity deemed to be agent of a non-resident insurer is required to file "as agent" returns in terms of section HD 16 of the ITA 2007.
49.  The Commissioner will confirm his agreement in writing as required under section 38(3), and also set out the transitional return period.

#### Elections to change a balance date

50.  Elections to change a balance date for the situations listed under paragraph 48 (b) to (g) may be made by telephone 0800 377 774 or in writing, advising the following details (where relevant):
    1.  full name of the taxpayer seeking the non-standard balance date;
    2.  Inland Revenue number if already registered;
    3.  details of reasons for election to change the balance date;
    4.  name of tax agent.

51.  Since elections to change a balance date for the situations listed under paragraph 48 (a) and (h) to (j) are potentially more complex applications are required to be made in writing. For this group of applications, the following information should be provided (where relevant):
    1.  full name of the taxpayer seeking the balance date change;
    2.  Inland Revenue number if already registered;
    3.  details of reasons for election to change the balance date;
    4.  name of tax agent;
    5.  details of cash flows;
    6.  details of stock patterns;
    7.  details of any significant business transactions that will impact on their tax liability for the current financial year;
    8.  other evidence to show that financial information prepared to the proposed balance date will be more appropriate to the entity;
    9.  where a new business is seeking a non-standard balance date (other than a recognised industry balance date);
    10.  where businesses claim they have a close trading relationship and share a common accounting system or central administration structure, evidence to show this.

#### Unacceptable reasons for a change of balance date

52.  The Commissioner will not agree to a change of balance date, where the basis of the application is one or more of the following:
    1.  The elected non-standard balance date is the anniversary date of the commencement of the business.
    2.  A reason for changing the balance date is tax deferral or tax avoidance, or to take advantage of a tax incentive or concession.
    3.  An election is made in order to smooth the workflow of a manager, or trustee, or tax agent.
    4.  An election is made for reasons of administrative convenience.
    5.  Functions have been contracted out to a third party (for example, a specialist administration manager) and the taxpayer elects to adopt the manager's balance date.

#### No right to challenge

53.  Please note that section 138E(1)(e)(iv) does not confer a right of challenge to a decision by the Commissioner under section 38. However, if taxpayers consider that their election to change a balance date was not given proper and/or adequate consideration they are invited to discuss this with us or seek judicial review.

This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 22 December 2008.

### Appendix A: Industry specific non-standard balance dates

The Commissioner recognises a number of industry-specific balance dates. These dates have been determined following representations to the Commissioner by the industries concerned. Taxpayers within these industries, or closely aligned to them, may elect to adopt these approved industry balance dates, subject to the Commissioner's consent in writing under section 38(3).

Please refer to paragraph 29 to 31 of the SPS.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |     Industry specific non-standard balance dates
| Apiarists | 30 November or 31 December |
| Education/childcare related services | 31 December |
| Farmers |     |
| cattle | 31 May |
| dairy | 31 May, or 30 June, or 31 July\* |

\* expanded to 30 June or 31 July to recognise regional variances within the dairy industry.

**Note**  
When there is more than one recognised industry balance date for an activity, the Commissioner's consent will be required for any subsequent election to adopt an alternative industry balance date.

**Appendix B: Transitional period returns**

This explains how the Commissioner applies the legislation concerning the transitional income tax returns required following the Commissioner's approval of a change of balance date. It also states the Commissioner's policy on the application date for a change of balance date.

Section 39 set out the treatment for transitional returns.

When the new balance date is an early balance date (i.e. between 1 October and 31 March) the taxpayer's transitional year will run from the original balance date to the new balance date. (This will generally be a period of 6 months or more.)

When the new balance date is a late balance (i.e. between 1 April and 30 September) the taxpayer's transitional year will run from the original balance date to the new balance date in the succeeding year. (This will generally be a period of more than 12 months.)

Under section 39, when there is a change of balance date the taxpayer must file a transitional tax return.

This return is for the income derived during the transitional period which begins on the day after the original balance date and ends on the new balance date.

Section 39 reads:

> **39(1)** If the Commissioner approves a change to a new balance date that is earlier in the year than the original balance date, the change is effected by the taxpayer having a transitional year of the period from the original balance date up to and including the new balance date in the next succeeding year.
> 
> **39(2)** If the Commissioner approves a change to a new balance date that is later in the year than the original balance date, the change is effected by the taxpayer having a transitional year of the period from the original balance date up to and including the new balance date in the same year.
> 
> **39(3)** If the change in balance date means that a taxpayer has 2 corresponding income years for the same tax year, the figures for both corresponding income years are aggregated when the taxpayer's net income or net loss is determined.
> 
> **39(4)** For the purpose of giving effect to this section and section 38, the Commissioner may, for any corresponding income year, make any assessment that the Commissioner considers necessary.
> 
> **39(5)** For the tax year corresponding to the income year or years in which the change of balance date occurs, the basic tax rate for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007 and this Act is the rate that would apply if the person's taxable income for the tax year were calculated using the formula-
> 
> **39(6)** In the formula,-
> 
> (a)  **income year days** is the total days in the income year or years that correspond to the tax year:
> 
> (b)  **taxable income** is the person's taxable income for the tax year.
> 
> |     |
> | --- |
> | 365 |
> | income year days x taxable income |

**Note**  
Section 39 uses the terms "earlier" and "later". These should not be confused with the terms "early balance date" and "late balance date". Section 39 refers to a balance date that is "earlier in the year than the original balance date" and a new balance date that is "later in the year than the original balance date". The "original balance date" may itself be a non-standard balance date.

**Example 1**

A 31 March balance date is to change to 31 January. The return for the 2007-08 income year will cover the period from 1 April 2007 to 31 January 2008 (a 10-month transitional year). The return for the 2008-09 income year will be from 1 February 2008 to 31 January 2009.

**Example 2**

A 31 March balance date is to change to 30 June. The return for the 2007-08 income year will cover the period 1 April 2007 to 30 June 2008 (a 15-month transitional year).

Returns for less than six months or more than 18 months

Changes to balance dates will generally result in a transitional period of more than 6 months, but no longer than 18 months. However, in some circumstances returns are required for a period of less than six months or more than 18 months. Returns for a period longer than 18 months only occur when there is a change from an early balance date to a late balance date. Returns for a period shorter than six months only occur when there is a change from a late balance date to an early balance date.

**Example 3**

In 2008 a taxpayer changes from a balance date of 30 September to 30November for the 2008 income year:

1/10/07 - 30/9/08: 2007-08 income year

1/10/08 - 30/11/08: Two-month period within the 2008-09 income year

1/12/08 - 30/11/09: 2009-10 income year.

In this case it is not possible to include the income derived during the two-month period in the 2008-09 income year with other income derived in the same income year, because there is no other income derived during the 2008-09 income year. The taxpayer must file a two-month return.

**Example 4**

In 2006 a taxpayer changes from a balance date of 30 November to 31 July for the 2007-08 income year:

1/12/05 - 30/11/06: 2006-07 income year

1/12/06 - 31/7/07: Eight-month period within the 2006-07 income year

1/8/07 - 31/7/08: 2007-08 income year.

The legislation requires the taxpayer to add the income derived during the transitional period to other income derived in the same income year. Therefore, the taxpayer must add the income derived in the eight-month period from 1 December 2006 to 31 July 2007 to the income derived in the period from 1 December 2005 to 30 November 2006 giving a return for a 20-month period.

#### Adjustments when return is for a period of more or less than a year

Some adjustments may be necessary when the return is for other than a 12-month period. Under section LC 10 of the ITA 2007, when there is a change of balance date and the taxpayer is assessed for income tax for a period of less than a year, any tax credits (formerly rebates) allowable under sections LC 1 to LC 8 of the ITA 2007 are proportionately reduced. Similarly, when the taxpayer is assessed for a period of more than a year, the total of such tax credits is proportionately increased. Similar provisions relate to tax rates in section 39(5).

Compulsory deductions from bank accounts (WITHDRAWN)
====================================================

Withdrawn statement SPS 09/01 considered compulsory deductions from bank accounts. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

This statement also appears in **Tax Information Bulletin**, Vol 21, No 2 (April 2009).

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement ("SPS") sets out Inland Revenue's practice on the use of statutory notices (referred to in this statement as "deduction notices") which are from time-to-time issued to banks requiring them to make deductions from their customers' accounts.

### Application

2.  This SPS applies to deduction notices issued under the following enactments:
    *   Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA")
    *   Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("GST Act")
    *   Child Support Act 1991 ("CS Act")
    *   Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 ("SLS Act")
    *   Gaming Duties Act 1971 ("GD Act")
3.  This SPS applies to deduction notices issued from 12 March 2009. It replaces SPS RDC 3.1, published in TIB Vol.11, No.7 (August 1999), which is withdrawn with effect from the date of this SPS.

### Legislation

4.  The relevant sections and enactments are as follows:
    *   Section 157 of the TAA
    *   Section 43 of the GST Act
    *   Section 154 of the CS Act
    *   Section 46 of the SLS Act
    *   Section 12L of the GD Act.

### Discussion

5.  A deduction notice is an important debt collection tool for Inland Revenue. The relevant legislative provisions grant to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("Commissioner") wide powers to require a third party to make deductions from amounts that are payable, or will become payable by that third party, to a taxpayer who has tax arrears. The deduction notice may require deductions to be made by way of a lump sum or by instalments and will require the third party to forward the amount deducted to Inland Revenue by the date specified in the notice.
6.  Inland Revenue will not issue a deduction notice in respect of tax arrears that are the subject of an instalment arrangement between the taxpayer and the Commissioner.
7.  An amount payable by the third party includes money deposited with a bank to the credit of the taxpayer. It includes funds deposited on current account as well as funds on fixed and unfixed deposit. A deduction notice will apply to all deposits the bank receives from the day the deduction notice is received by the bank and will continue to apply until it is revoked or withdrawn.
8.  A deduction notice may require deductions to be made to cover daily interest. The interest starts on the date of the deduction notice and ends on the day on which the amount required to be deducted, has been deducted. If interest is to be calculated the rate of interest will be advised in the deduction notice.
9.  Deductions made by the bank are held in trust for the Crown until they are forwarded to Inland Revenue. Section 157(9) of the TAA, and sections 43(8) and 43(9) of the GST Act state that a bank is charged with holding in trust for the Crown amounts that become payable to a taxpayer from the time when the bank receives a deduction notice until the time when the deduction is required to be made by the notice. In addition, section 46 of the SLS Act refers back to the recovery provisions of section 156 to 165 of the TAA and will apply in respect of outstanding student loan debts.
10.  If the deduction is not made by the bank, the amount required to be deducted is recoverable by Inland Revenue from the bank as if it were tax payable by the bank.  
    

### Standard Practice  
  

#### Joint Accounts

11.  In most cases, Inland Revenue is not able to issue a deduction notice to obtain funds from a joint account in respect of a tax debt owed by one of the joint bank account holders. The High Court case of **Commissioner of Inland Revenue v ANZ Banking Group (New Zealand) Limited** (1998) 18 NZTC 13,643 concerned a deduction notice issued by Inland Revenue in respect of a joint account that the taxpayer held with his wife. In concluding that the bank was not required to make the deductions, the Court stated that the wife's rights in respect of the joint account could not be over-ridden unless by express statutory provision.
12.  Notwithstanding the above, Inland Revenue reserves the right to issue a deduction notice in relation to a joint account where both parties jointly have tax arrears (for example, in a partnership) or where each party has separate tax arrears (and neither are under an instalment arrangement).
13.  Further, Inland Revenue reserves the right to issue a deduction notice on a joint account that is being used by one of the account holders to hide funds with the intention to defeat attempts by Inland Revenue to recover tax arrears. For example, where Inland Revenue is able to demonstrate that cheques for a business have been deposited to a joint, non-business account. This will be restricted to cases where those funds can be separately identified from those of the other party of the account.

##### Overpaid Working for Families tax credits

14.  Inland Revenue may also issue a deduction notice on a joint account where there has been an overpayment of a Working for Families tax credit. Where this has occurred the person who received the overpayment (the recipient) and their partner or spouse (if they were the partner or spouse throughout the income year to which the overpayment relates) are jointly and severally liable for the overpayment: section MF 5(2) Income Tax Act 2007. Inland Revenue is therefore able to issue a deduction notice for an account in the name of the partner or spouse or for a joint account in the name of the recipient and the partner or spouse.  
    

#### Child Support debts

15.  Another situation where Inland Revenue may issue a deduction notice is in relation to child support debt. Section 128 of the CS Act provides that any amount of financial support payable under the CS Act is a debt due to the Crown. Similar to section 157 of the TAA, section 154 of the CS Act allows the Commissioner to issue a deduction notice to a third party requiring them to make deductions from money payable to liable parents for a child support debt. Any amount deducted under a deduction notice is deemed by section 167(2) of the CS Act to be held in trust for the Crown.
16.  Section 155 of the CS Act extends this to money held in joint accounts in the name of the liable parent and one or more other persons, where the liable parent can draw from that account without the signature of the other person

#### Gaming Machine Duty

17.  Section 12K of the GD Act 1971 provides that any gaming machine duty is recoverable as a debt due to the Crown.
18.  Section 12L of that Act allows the Commissioner to issue a deduction notice to a third party where a person is in default in payment of any gaming machine duty, and any amount deducted is to be paid to Inland Revenue by the date specified in the deduction notice. Any amount deducted under a deduction notice is deemed to be held in trust for the Crown until it is paid to Inland Revenue: section 12L(6)  
    

#### Prosecution

19.  If a bank fails to make the deductions required by the deduction notice, and there was an amount payable, or an amount became payable, Inland Revenue has the power to prosecute for not complying with the terms of the deduction notice under section 157A of the TAA.

#### Account Monitoring

20.  Under sections 6 and 6A of the TAA, the Commissioner has a responsibility to protect the integrity of the tax system and to collect the highest net revenue practicable over time while having regard to resources, the importance of promoting compliance and compliance costs faced by taxpayers. Inland Revenue acknowledges that compliance with a deduction notice results in costs to banks, especially if constant monitoring of their customers' accounts is required in all instances.
21.  With this in mind, Inland Revenue will not usually require banks to conduct daily monitoring of their customers' accounts to comply with a deduction notice. Banks will only be required to check the account of their customer on receipt of a deduction notice and deduct any funds that are available at that time. If no funds are available, the bank will only need to advise Inland Revenue of this fact and will not be required to check the account any further.
22.  However, Inland Revenue reserves the right to require daily monitoring of bank accounts where that is considered necessary. If Inland Revenue decides that daily monitoring is necessary, this will be communicated to the bank concerned at the time of issuing the deduction notice.
23.  If daily monitoring is to be undertaken it will usually be for a maximum of 10 working days, although, from time-to-time Inland Revenue may request a bank to monitor an account over a longer period where it is considered necessary. The period of monitoring will be communicated to the bank at the time of issuing the deduction notice

#### Term Investments

24.  A deduction notice will apply to money that is held in a term investment whether or not that investment is due to mature.

#### Overdraft facilities

25.  Inland Revenue cannot, by requiring a deduction to be made from a bank account, put a taxpayer into, or further into overdraft.
26.  If Inland Revenue issues a deduction notice for an account which is in credit and the taxpayer attempts to avoid complying with that notice by transferring funds from that account so that it will go into overdraft then the deduction notice will take priority.
