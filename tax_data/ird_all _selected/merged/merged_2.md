However, there are also spill-over relationships for software developed for in-house use and commissioned software which are related to the potential for distortion of classifications to obtain the most favourable timing treatment for expenses. ensure that the The core principles applied are: Software developed for in-house use: •pre-development expenses deducted as incurred •Development expenses capitalised until project completed (WIP) •Depreciation 40% DV 30% SL •Unsuccessful development deducted when unsuccessful decision made •Ongoing maintenance deducted as incurred •Upgrades capitalised (same as for original development) Commissioned software As for software developed for in-house use except there would be no pre-development costs Software developed for Sale or license •Development costs deductible in year incurred •Value of unbilled work in progress and unsold completed software must be taken into account as trading stock. The value of trading stock at balance date must be included as income in your return. (effectively defers deduction until year of sale or licence) The project focus is the tax treatment of expenditures on software developed for sale or licence. The review document is IRRUIP -10 Overview of review document This file note documents key points from a number of sources to build up information about the various approaches to tax treatment of software development costs around the world. The core issues: Deduc tibility of software development costs Absorption costing & software development costs An appropriate timing of deductions for software development costs An appropriate treatment for disposals of developed software. Not in scope 2 Accounting & software development NZIAS 18 The trend in the accounting field is to capitalize software development costs.54 According to a recent survey, twenty percent, if not more, of computer industry firms capitalize some of their software expenditures. The capitalisation of software increases earnings per share because amortisation is less than immediate deduction.

Spark business Works November 26 2018 Important to financial health and operation of any company that is building or buying software to understand the principles of expensing and capitalising that expenditure in the financial reports of the software developer.. GAAP is promoted as the basis to determine what to expense and what to capitalise. However the purpose of GAAP is to enable investors and creditors to compare contrast extract and analyse financial information of an organisation. GAAP guidelines are rooted in the concept of whether the software development will result in an enduring economic benefit – software development costs can be classified as either: • Costs that produce value at a later date; and • Costs that do not produce value at a later date. In essence, this is the underlying question for tax policy, and the core issues for costs that produce value at a later date, are: The timing of deductibility of those costs; and The recovery (including timing of recovery) of costs on disposal of an asset or on recovery of sunk expenses. Types of software development processes under GAAP Waterfall approach Software development follows sequential steps. Expense/ capitalisation depends on the which step the costs are categorised as. The steps themselves differ depending on whether the development is for internal use or external use (e.g. sale or licence or commissioned work) Software for internal use: Examples, CRM tools; Accounting systems; Project Management Tools, Internal Data tools Project Stage Typical costs Expense/Capitalise Planning Creating requirements, developing a project plan Expensed Development/Coding Testing, third-party developers, software purchase costs, encoding Capitalise Implementation User training, data usage analysis Expense Not in scope 4 Software for external use (sale, licence/lease) Project Stage Typical costs Expense/Capitalise Feasibility & Planning Creating requirements, developing a project plan, creating requirements, developing a project plan Expensed Software established as feasible Testing, third-party developers, software purchase costs, encoding Capitalise Software available for use User training, customer service, other post-launch costs.

Examples of new or improved product, process or device: Codec software Web information system & document management on the web Protein structure prediction software A new or improved product process or device can be from a combination of hardware and software. (slide 8) Software development may be necessary but the developed software is not part of the product process or device (slide 9) Technology is the practical application of scientific knowledge and principles. The development of cloud technology has allowed a platform for modern big data applications. Slide 15: Understanding the capability and limitations of systems to develop an information system is about a product and is not related to the concept of technology or advancement of technology or scientific uncertainty. The question is whether the current state of technology is insufficient to resolve a problem. If a system has technological deficiencies that prevent the desired outcome -that can be development but if the new system merely replicates what is kept manually it is no more than an information database that is developed.

The business of designing and selling software for a business (DataCom) 2. The business of designing and licensing software to multiple businesses (Xero) 3. The business of designing and using software internally (Banking, agritech, Fintech). - Designing software, although the details and focus can vary between business model, is relatively simple. The key building blocks are: 1. Coding and engineering. 2. Minimum viable product. 3. Customer acquisition. 4. Feedback. 5. Improvement. 6. Scalability. - The development of software has changed rapidly over time, shifting from a traditional “waterfall” model to an agile “incremental” model. Submitters agreed that the incremental development business model is now commonplace in the industry. The incremental model has no clear beginning, middle and end. Agile methodologies may result in the developed software never being a “finished” product as improvements are constantly being made based on customer feedback. - The incremental development models go hand-in-hand with the recent boom in “subscription business models”. Where consumers receive products or services on a recurring basis often for an annual fee (McKinsey report). - Cash for software businesses. - Exernalities - Other initiatives : R&D. - Options 1.

Both goodwill and the LIC database have indefinite useful lives. They are recognised at cost and are not amortised, are allocated to a cash generating unit ("CGU") and tested for impairment annually. At reporting date, software includes $20.565 million (2019: $17.290 million) of work in progress, which is not being amortised until it is ready for use. IFRS NZ IAS 38 Intangible assets 9 Entities frequently expend resources, or incur liabilities, on the acquisition, development, maintenance or enhancement of intangible resources such as scientific or technical knowledge, design and implementation of new processes or systems, licences, intellectual property, market knowledge and trademarks (including brand names and Not in scope 5 publishing titles). Common examples of items encompassed by these broad headings are computer software, patents, copyrights, motion picture films, customer lists, mortgage servicing rights, fishing licences, import quotas, franchises, customer or supplier relationships, customer loyalty, market share and marketing rights. 10 Not all the items described in paragraph 9 meet the definition of an intangible asset, ie identifiability, control over a resource and existence of future economic benefits. If an item within the scope of this Standard does not meet the definition of an intangible asset, expenditure to acquire it or generate it internally is recognised as an expense when it is incurred. However, if the item is acquired in a business combination, it forms part of the goodwill recognised at the acquisition date (see paragraph 68).

Research and Development Tax Credit - The Government has set a target of raising the total amount of R&D performed in New Zealand to 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2028. To meet this goal, there needs to be a significant increase in the amount of business R&D performed in New Zealand. - The rationale for providing R&D tax credits to businesses is that there is under- investment by businesses in R&D because the investing firm does not capture all the benefits of the investment. Some of the benefit is captured by other businesses or consumers, rather than by the investing firm. The tax credit is intended to provide an offset for the likely spill-over benefits to other firms and individuals in New Zealand. This is expected to help transform the New Zealand economy into a high-skill, knowledge-based, and productive economy. - Most types of expenditure incurred on R&D activities are eligible, including the costs of creating intangible property. - A $25 million cap applies to eligible internal software development expenditure. - A person who receives a Callaghan Innovation Growth Grant for the whole or a part of an income year is excluded from claiming the R&D tax credit for that income year. - Excluded R&D activities: 1.

PUB00240/c Instead of being the cost of producing trading stock, the issues paper suggested software development expenditure should be treated as the cost of producing a depreciable asset. Starting point: described within TIB V 4, No 10 (May 1993). The TIB items says software development expenditure is the cost of producing trading stock. This means it is deductible when incurred but may be added back as income as the value of any trading stock on hand at balance date. However, the TIB item also treats the software as sold outright when it is first licensed. This means all software development expenditure is deducted in the income year the software is first licensed. First, there was ag reement with the issues paper’s analysis that the: • trading stock approach is inappropriate (and was always so); • the depreciable asset approach is correct; and • the R&D provisions can apply. 1. The depreciable asset approach would adversely affect cash-flows. 2. Its practical application would raise complex and compliance-heavy issues. This is especially so considering the practice of incremental development. 3. It would possibly lead to tension with Callaghan Innovation grant requirements which cannot be met once an asset is recognised. Generally, there was a preference was for the R&D provisions to apply, with the choice of applying the depreciable asset approach. Incremental development business model is now commonplace in the industry and that this model blurs the lines between the traditional phases of developing software. There was also concern that, if finalised, the issues paper’s proposals would have the result of one arm of government counteracting the efforts of others to promote the industry.

Exit strategy – without big exits, the ecosystem is like a roach model, money can come in, but it doesn’t get out. And that’s not a good thing for anyone. Deductibility of computer software expenditure - The deductibility of computer software expenditure depends upon the nature of the expenditure incurred. For example: 1. expenditure on developing computer software that creates an asset to be used in the taxpayer’s business can be expected to be of capital nature that may be allowed as deduction by way of a depreciation loss. 2. The same outcome applies for expenditure incurred in creating a website. 3. Expenditure on purchasing computer software with a cost of $500 or less can be claimed as an immediate deduction. 4. Expenditure on computer software may be eligible for the deduction allowed fo research and development 5. S DB 40B allows taxpayers an immediate deduction for the costs associated with unsuccessful software development where the taxpayer incurs expenditure on the development of software for use in the taxpayer’s business, the development is abandoned before the copyright in the software is depreciable property and, if the development had been completed, the copyright in the software would have been depreciable property. The deduction is available to the extent to which no other deduction has been allowed for the expenditure, and it is allocated to the income year in which the development is abandoned. The section overrides the capital limitation, but the general permission must still be satisfied. Not in scope 11 6. Software developers  Development costs may be expensed, the trading stock treatment of value as income at the end of the income year applies to unbilled WIP and unsold but completed software, and maintenance costs may be expensed with upgrading costs to be capitilsed. 7. IS 17/04 (taxpayers who purchase, lease, license, develop, or commission software for use in a business.  Software purchased will generally be a capital asset that must be depreciated at 50% diminishing value or 40% straight-line.  An immediate write-off for software costing less than $500 will be allowed where the conditions in s EE 38 are satisfied.  Maintenance costs may be deducted when incurred.  Upgrade costs must be capitalised and depreciated. 8. Periodic payments for the right to use or access software (often online software) are generally deductible when incurred. 9. Background The Commissioner’s current tax treatment is that software development is the cost of producing trading stock. This means expenditure is deductible when incurred but added back as income as the value of any asset on hand at balance date. The Commissioner also treats software when it is first licensed as sold outright. This means all software development expenditure is deducted in the income year the software is first licensed. Research and Development (R&D) provisions, specially DB 34 allow for immediate deductibility for expenditure they incur on research and development which can apply to some types of software development. Issues paper, IRRUIP 10, suggested the current treatment may not be correct in most cases. Suggesting the expenditure should be treated as the cost of producing a depreciable asset, not trading stock. Issues The depreciable asset approach would adversely affect cash-flow. Cash-flows are essential for funding growth and the continuing R&D expenditure needed to maintain competitiveness. Issues incremental development Positive externality Not in scope 1 Policy Commissioning Paper Policy Commissioning Paper – Timing of deductions of software expenditure (for software developed for sale or licence) Prepared by: Ben Hammond and Craig Phillips Date: 13 March 2020 Description of policy issue – what is the problem? • Inland Revenue’s current administrative approach for the income tax treatment of development on software for sale or licence is based on a statement published in 1993 (TIB Vol 4 No 10). This administrative approach adopted the trading stock framework for deduction of costs. • Under this framework, it was intended that the deduction for software development expenses developed for sale, lease or licence would be allocated (timed) to the year in which the software was first able to be exploited by the developer. However, in practice, the sector is treating software development expenditure as deductible when incurred under the mechanics of the trading stock rules (i.e. the value of work-in-progress is treated, for income tax purposes, as nil). • In 2016 OCTC released an issues paper for external consultation titled IRRUIP 10: Income tax treatment of software development expenditure (IRRUIP 10). This issues paper suggested Inland Revenue’s 1993 approach may not be correct and software development expenditure should, in most cases, be capitalised and depreciated. • External submissions to IRRUIP 10 raised widespread concern at the practical difficulties and adverse commercial effects of implementing a capitalise and depreciation approach for software development expenditure. Submitters were also concerned that the depreciation model proposed was based on an outdated process for software development. • The problem is that if we do nothing, we are left with either the trading stock approach, or the depreciation model proposed in IRRUIP 10. Neither of these two options may be consistent with policy frameworks or appropriate for current business practices and the Government’s 2019 economic plan Policy context and purpose • External submissions to IRRUIP 10 raised widespread concern at the practical difficulties and adverse commercial effects of implementing the capitalisation approach and it’s inconsistency with current software development life cycle processes (often termed an agile methodology) and the use and exploitation of open-source software. • OCTC subsequently referred the income tax treatment of expenses incurred for developing software for commercial exploitation to Policy in December 2016 (IR PUB00240/c refers). • Policy tensions already exist between: o the research and development incentive rules (the R&D rules) which give immediate deductibility; o the timing of software development expenses under the trading stock approach which is intended to defer the deduction of software development expenses until the time the software could be exploited; and Not in scope 2 o the suggestion in IRRUIP 10 that software development expenditure should be capitalised and depreciated over the useful life of the software. • The issues raised in IRRUIP 10 requiring policy consideration are as follows: o uncertainty about what costs should be included in the tax cost base of the asset due to the changing nature of development processes in the software sector; o uncertainty about when the software asset should be recognised; o tension between the depreciation rules and deductibility for certain research and development expenses; o IRRUIP 10 precedes and so does not address the relationship between subsequently enacted tax credit rules (R&D tax credits and R&D tax losses) and the depreciation rules; o IRRUIP 10 notes that the question of feasibility expenditure also needs to be addressed; o depreciation rates for software in New Zealand are more favourable than many overseas jurisdictions; and o without further legislative amendment the depreciable asset approach may have a negative impact on the software development industry in New Zealand. • If we continue to delay work on the policy issues, there are two possible scenarios that will occur i.e.: o current trading stock treatment remains - OCTC continues to wait for Policy to complete its review of the tax treatment of software developed for sale, lease, or licence; or o the Capitalisation approach is adopted – OCTC confirms their public item that ex penses incurred to develop software for commercial exploitation should be either capitalised and depreciated unless the expenses are subject to the R&D deduction rules. • An interpretation that negatively impacts the software market in New Zealand would be inconsistent with Government priorities, as recognised within their 2019 Economic Plan to build a productive, sustainable, and inclusive economy. • The risks of doing nothing are as follows: o if the current treatment remains, then software development costs will continue to be deductible in the year the costs were reported. This, as mentioned is inconsistent with policy intent and generally accepted policy frameworks for the timing of deductions relating to expenditure giving rise to revenue account property or an asset able to be exploited commercially other than by sale or assignment; and o if the capitalisation approach is adopted in line with IRRUIP 10, Policy would be concerned that without critical analysis of the capitalisation approach there may be severe negative consequences and political backlash from New Zealand’s growing software development industry. • Further concerns identified are as follows: o uncertainty and timeliness for the private sector: The private sector expects timely and certain responses to policy issues raised that have a potential material impact on commercial activity; and Not in scope 3 o uncertainty for OCTC, which referred the issues for policy consideration in December 2016. The uncertainty is whether a policy project is to be commenced or whether they should proceed with implementing the capitalisation and depreciation approach set out in IRRUIP 10. Policy impact and quality • The project will consider the most appropriate treatment of software development costs for software intended for sale or licence or assignment, and for the treatment of consideration derived from disposing or assigning (not licencing) of a software asset. • Submissions from members of the industry referred to the effects as “severe”, “very damaging”, “massive” and “disastrous”. In their view it would “undermine the growing \[software\] industry” or be “stifling to innovation efforts”. One submitter () suggested “the result would be software development companies increasingly looking offshore to establish innovation and development centres”(we note that some trading partners in the ASEAN region incentivise the establishment of innovation and development centres). Common reasons raised for these views were: o it would adversely affect cash-flows needed to fund on-going R&D expenditure essential to maintaining business competitiveness and further growth; o its practical application would raise complex and compliance costs - tracking time and costs; o it would possibly lead to tension with the Callaghan Innovations grants and the R&D provisions; and o since 1993, the sale, leasing or licencing of software has evolved to include new ways of delivering software, for example, software as a service (e.g. online accounting software). Any new rules would need to take account of these innovations to ensure that as much as possible the effects of tax are neutral on investment decisions. • The project will consider the most appropriate treatment of software development costs for software intended for sale, lease, licence or assignment, and for the treatment of consideration derived from disposing or assigning (not licencing) of a software asset. • Ideally, we would want to update the tax treatment of software development costs to be consistent with relevant current policy settings, including recovery income on disposal of an asset. • Note that there is likely to be some pressure to extend the scope of the review to include issues identified by the private sector with the current R&D rules. These are outside the scope of the project and would be referred to the R&D team, if appropriate. Nevertheless, this makes scope creep a risk. Policy Approach and collaboration • Factors that contribute to making this project a priority are: o The importance placed by Government on innovation in its 2019 Economic Plan. o The uncertainty about the income tax treatment of software development expenditure developed for sale, licence or lease since consultation was completed on IRRUIP 10. • The following policy approach will be undertaken, if the project is accepted: • Inclusion of the policy project on the internal work programme: s 9(2)(ba)(i) Not in scope 4 o consult with the software development sector to clearly define the policy problems that need to be resolved; o identify and critically analyse a possible range of high-level policy options (including the status quo) for consultation with stakeholders, using the generally accepted evaluation criteria:  Equity (horizontal and vertical).  Efficiency.  Fiscal impacts.  Compliance costs.  Administrative costs.  Trade-offs. o As part of this option analysis, engage with SD&I (Government Solutions) and consider the following at a high level:  What is the likely volume of taxpayers affected?  Is it likely to change how taxpayers interact with Inland Revenue? Or is this something new?  When does it take effect? Might the change be retrospective?  Do these taxpayers use external software developers and/or open-source software? This affects the lead in time required to implement. • The project’s scope is limited to the income tax treatment of expenses incurred to develop software for commercial exploitation. The project will also include consideration of practical concerns with the treatment and overlap with the R&D provisions. The R&D provisions will be taken at face value and any specific concerns relating to the R&D provisions generally are out of scope and will be referred to the R&D policy team, where appropriate. • Given consultation was already undertaken as part of IRRUIP 10, targeted engagement with those submitters would be sufficient (see consultation plan for further details). • The broad timeframes are to complete consultation and consideration of submissions in 2020 with a view to developing legislation for a bill in 2021. • A data set has been developed (by the Forecasting unit) that identifies the volume and incidence of tax across the sector based on current administrative practices.

At present, they consider there are significant structural differences between the income tax treatment of these expenses and the commercial practices followed in developing such software. After the General Election, officials intend to consult with stakeholders in this sector (including MBIE) to address the concerns raised , with a view to reporting on outcomes of consultation. From:Craig Phillips To:Yvonne Coghlan Cc:Chris Gillion; David Cuellar Subject:RE: 1993 Policy Statement - Income Tax Treatment of Computer Software Date:Wednesday, 9 September 2020 1:52:39 PM Attachments:image001.png HiI Yvonne I am not sure what you mean by PAS work on the policy (operational) statement in the TIB from 1993. So I will set out what we are currently working on as this may be of help to you. The policy work we are undertaking is a review of the tax policy settings for software development expenditure incurred in the process of developing software for commercial exploitation in conjunction with MBIE’s innovation work stream. This work is derived from IRRUIP-13 released by TCO (which reviewed the operational policy set out in the 1993 TIB) and for which some considerable number of submissions were received. I understand TCO has released a practice memo that undertakes to continue the practices set out in the 1993 operational statement until such time as we have concluded our policy review. This policy work will carry on through to 2021 and we are consult with the Sector as well as across the various processes in IR before making any recommendations to MoR and cabinet. Should we make recommendations for legislative change on this to Cabinet we would plan any necessary amendments be included in an available omnibus tax bill in the latter part of 2021. However, if we do not recommend legislative change, we will advise TCO at the time we make this decision.

Profits for each year are determined as the difference between income and expenses that relate to each year. The annual determination of taxable profit requires consideration of general accounting principles and specific tax rules that both interact to determine: •when income is derived or a business expense (which includes the cost of business assets) is incurred; and •whether that income or expense relates to that year or other years (for example, the cost of a business asset is usually amortised over the economic life of the asset – this is known as tax depreciation). We are presently reviewing the policy settings and practices relating to the taxation of software development in order to determine an appropriate tax accounting treatment for income and expenses within the software development sector. This review has identified a variety of practices that are either being applied or are proposed for the deductibility of development expenses, including: •deduction of the expenses in full as they incurred; •deduction of the expenses in full when the developed software is first able to be commercially exploited; and •capitalised as a business asset, and the cost amortised over the economic life of the developed software (this is the general tax policy framework applying to assets that are used within a business setting). Our policy review arises from Inland Revenue publishing an exposure draft of a proposed change in Inland Revenue’s view on the tax treatment of software development expenses (IRRUIP10 – Income tax treatment of software development expenditure 1 ). A number of submissions were received on the views expressed in that document: •Many submitters opposed any change to existing tax accounting practices in the software development sector. •Existing provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 gave inconsistent outcomes for the treatment of software development expenses. This inconsistency between provisions has been creating confusion within the software development sector. 1 https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/-/media/project/ir/tt/pdfs/consultations/issues- papers/irruip10.pdf?la=en&hash=85038059438AB31059D4273F86406A27 Not in scope 2 Implications of problem Submissions to IRRUIP10 were consistent in noting that if the tax policy problem is not solved, then the software development sector would likely be adversely impacted because of: • the tax effects on operational cashflows within the sector; and • an increase in demand for capital due to the need to fund higher cash flows. Consultation with MBIE This letter is written as part of our review, and we have identified some issues for which we seek your feedback from the perspective of your policy objectives for the innovation sector. In particular, we are wanting to determine an appropriate framework for the taxation of the software development sector’s business income and expenses. This requires analysis of: • the size of the software development industry in terms of participants, contribution to the economy, and profitability; • characteristics of business processes used in developing software; • characteristics of funding and funding limitations within the software development sector; • characteristics of an expected life cycle of software developed for commercial exploitation; • Government policies administered by other Government agencies relating to the software development sector; and • Government policies in other jurisdictions for their innovation sectors. Wide Government policy on supporting innovation (and in particular the development of software) will be relevant when considering the analysis of the appropriate tax treatment of development costs for software. To this end, we are interested in any insight you can provide for the following questions:” 1. Are you able to either provide data on the size of the software development sector (number of participants, contribution to the economy, profitability), or point us to where this data could be obtained? 2. Are you able to differentiate between software developers that mainly produce software for their internal use (e.g. banks have developed software internally to comply with anti-money laundering legislation), and other developers? 3. What MBIE policies relate to the innovation sector and are any of these objectives linked to any particular characteristics of their business processes and if so, how? 4. What MBIE policies relate to capital funding for the innovation sector? For example, are there any particular special funding schemes (e.g. the R&D Loan Scheme developed in response to COVID-19) and what is the policy purpose of any such funding scheme? 5. Are there any MBIE policies for the innovation sector that are related to the life cycle of software development, and if so what is their objective? 6. Are there any other Government agencies that you are aware of that implement Government policies relating to the innovation sector (we are aware of Callaghan Innovation), and if so, who are they and what is their focus? 7. Are you able to provide us with an analysis of Government policies relating to the innovation sectors in overseas jurisdictions that you have analysed in the development of innovation sector policies for New Zealand? Next steps We are wanting to meet with you later in October or early November to receive your feedback on our questions and to identify any other sources that you may be aware of relating to data for this sector. We will be in touch to arrange a time to meet, either digitally or in person. After receiving your feedback, we will be consulting with stakeholders in the software development sector on issues raised in this letter plus some tax technical matters. We are planning to undertake this consultation post-general election We also plan to engage you in this process if you think that is desirable. We are planning to complete our review by mid–2021, with a view to making any necessary recommendations to Government after that time. Not in scope Software development expenditure Notes from pre-consultation call with MBIE Attendees IR: Chris Gillion Craig Phillips David Cuellar MBIE (on Teams): Robyn Henderson Mary Mulholland Katie Sadetskaya Notes MBIE is engaged with Keith and Graham on software development issues to do with the Research and Development Tax Incentive (RDTI). Preamble from David, Craig, Chris, on the scope of the project: • Background and objectives. • Current expectations versus what is happening in practice (businesses claiming deductions as they go, trading stock models). • Potential for treatment of some software as a capital asset. Questions (numbered in consultation letter): Q1 MBIE will send us some data. MBIE has their Digital Technology Transformation Plan and are getting updated data. Also have an IT sector report (seen by IR already). Another report (behind paywall) that MBIE will send to us. Software development sector is important with regard to growth potential. MBIE is going to interview some of the most successful companies to understand their success and how it can be replicated. Q2 Key difference between types of software developers will be skills and employers, e.g. software developers employed by banks for internal use. Want to get a handle on the number of entities of each type. Commercially exploitable software is developed over a longer period of time, whereas internal software is developed on shorter timeframes. Will ask tech sector to clarify. Agri-tech sector is growing and experiencing a lot of activity. IR interested in the differences between general innovation and what is required for agri-tech. MBIE says there are difficulties in defining the agri-tech sector. Software development is not their main activity; they are more concerned with investment in AI and machine learning to produce different outputs. More into robotics. Not in scope Q3 Innovation policies are sector-agnostic. RDTI is their flagship one but the software sector is having a lot of challenges with it. CI helps MBIE with investing in innovative businesses. Note project grants have a significant proportion of digital and software recipients. The overarching goal is to increase business investment in R&D. May start to see more initiatives targeted at encouraging businesses to collaborate more as well. Craig asks about the R&D Loan Scheme’s contribution to the innovation space and talking to CI. MBIE has initial figures from CI but notes that the impact is difficult to measure; can send over their statistics regardless. CI has digital sector specialists. MBIE’s role more to do with Government objectives and policies, whereas CI focuses on implementation and operationalisation (they are much closer to individual companies than MBIE so have good sector intelligence). MBIE has a focus on the start-up sector and trying to improve the evidence base of that sector. Have just procured a company to build a database. MBIE has a focus on innovative activity across the economy. Role for these businesses to play in selling services to other sectors in New Zealand and helping to improve national productivity. Q4 Emphasis on sector-agnostic initiatives. Elevate NZ Venture Fund – a fund to create more funds in New Zealand to invest in more companies. Aspire NZ Seed F und – addresses the capital needs of start-ups, a large proportion being digital/software sector companies and assists at an early stage in fundraising (seed stage, up to $2 million). Type of venture capital. (More info on these funds in a proactively released Cabinet paper titled “Update on the Venture Capital Fund’s Progress and the Wider Capital Markets.) Tech incubators fall into this category but are more targeted at tech science, but work with digital/software firms as well. They are more to do with IP, used to be more focused on software but moving toward science. MBIE has just signed a new tech incubators contract. Project grants – software companies would make use of these. Grants are part of CI, and MBIE funds them (similar to tech incubators program). Not in scope Q5 Policy settings target different business growth stages rather than different stages of the software development life cycle. Aspire NZ Seed Fund targeted at building capability rather than proof of concept. CI has Regional Business Partner programme, co-funded by NZTE and they provide a lot of support for companies at early stages. On the RDTI, the software sector has not benefitted much. There is a broad spectrum of innovation - the RDTI is targeted at the R&D end but eligibility requires expenditure on activities that resolve scientific or technological uncertainty. Software companies do that up front and then spend a lot of the time/effort/money later on in development, whereas previously they were qualifying for CI G rowth Grants that captured a broader range of their activities . Funding to commercialise ideas that come out of universities. Centre for Digital Excellence in Otago targeted at the early ideas stage, students based in Dunedin can get funding for ideas related to software development. Q6 NZTE has digital marketing campaign and has a fund regarding digital enablement for exporting firms. Like CI, they do not take a sector-specific approach; NZTE works with high-export growth potential companies regardless of what sector they are in. Tech sector lead at NZTE is worth talking to, and they are working closely within the Industry Transformation Plan. Q7 Craig notes we are interested in trading partners' tax frameworks and impacts on cross- border economy. MBIE suggests that how other countries treat depreciation is important.

This review is a “first pr inciples” review of general income tax principles as they relate to the software development sector. This review does not include within its scope any aspect of the research and development tax incentive or any other incentives promoting innovation in the sector. The tax system is based on a broad-base low-rate approach to taxing profits of businesses on an annual basis. On a first-principles basis, profits for each year are determined as the difference between income and expenses that relate to each year.

Not in scope Software development expenditure Notes from pre-consultation call with NZTE Attendees IR: Craig Phillips David Cuellar NZTE (on Teams): Mark Debenham Notes Craig David General NZTE comes at this issue from an NZTE perspective and the associated challenges and frictions. Regarding the RDTI, NZTE observed businesses trying to get access to R&D credits but they either did not know whether they were eligible for the credits or what they needed to do to access the credits. NZTE were offering workshops to assist but it became an expensive exercise to go through the process of accessing the credits. – Deloitte – sits on the R&D Tax Credit advisory (committee?) Questions (numbered in consultation letter): Q1 NZTE says five years ago, tech companies in a broad sense may have been one or two in ten new companies that go through NZTE. Nowadays that is approximately about five out of ten. NZTE has a dedicated tech team, which is the biggest team they have. Growth has been tenfold. NZTE has to talk to firms in sectors including manufacturing, food and beverage, and widget sellers to get them through the door to NZTE. Conversely, tech companies are much more likely to proactively approach NZTE, so it does not have to make as much of an advertising effort to tech companies. 1,500 companies at NZTE are managed (in portfolios of ~15 with a lot more focus) and 4,000 are unmanaged (which get help by reaching out to NZTE). TIN100 and TIN200 reports have a lot of commentary of numbers and the size of the industry. Not in scope s 9(2)(a) Note that a lot of “tech companies” do not develop and/or sell software but perceive themselves to be tech companies, especially in the manufacturing space. Q2 NZTE are enablers and connectors, but not innovators or drivers of policy. Role of NZTE is to support, push, drive, build awareness of sector so as to position New Zealand in the world market in accordance with its competitive advantages. Hayley Horan sits on Government Tech Action Group for NZTech, but NZTE does not generally set policy or drive the industry. NZTE has access to a lot of industry around the tech sector and aligns to some areas more than others, such as the FinTech sector. Next major sector was the AgTech sector; a lot of movement around boosting AgTech. Note Digital Technologies Industry Transformation Plan that is being developed as a partnership between MBIE and NZTech. New Zealand is not behind gaming technology but perhaps should be getting into it. Also, not behind the payments sector as an area of tech. For example, Ultimately, bigger businesses are able to help themselves before NZTE can get to them. At the same time, NZTE markets itself more toward smaller businesses. There are misconceptions about NZTE being able to help pre-revenue firms – they can do but it is not their focus/speciality. Callaghan Innovation helps with that first gear and NZTE helps in second gear. Q3 NZTE administers growth funds. A lot of due diligence undertaken, requires a lot of information about plans and people involved. Amounts are matched dollar for dollar up to $600,000. Market validation fund is for the first stage where a business is still trying to validate whether a certain international market is the right one to enter into. Has a cap of $100,000 contribution from NZTE i.e., for a $200,000 project. Prior to COVID-19, this would involve sending people into markets, attending conferences, going to trade shows, etc. Given restrictions imposed by COVID-19 , much more of this activity involves paying people already in the market to undertake those activities. Essentially a feasibility analysis. Full international growth fund is for helping to execute in the market, accelerate growth, double-down on expansion.

Additional funding was provided by the Government in June, doubling the total bucket from $30 million to $60 million. NZTE not expecting to spend the whole amount. NZTE does not fund any roles to do with software or product development – all about delivery and moving the dial with products being sold in market. Funding software developers would be seen as funding business-as -usual. Q4 Not entirely applicable to NZTE. Companies grow and get acquired or list/undertaken an IPO. NZTE will still work with them insofar as R&D/innovation is still undertaken in New Zealand and/or New Zealanders are being employed. In one sense, New Zealand companies getting bought ou t is a sign of success, but it also represents lost IP. May be nice for New Zealand funds to be buying that IP. Otherwise New Zealand profits then become foreign profits. Q5 NZTE compares itself to close equivalents in other jurisdictions with respect to size and location. Countries doubling down on the tech sectors and provide a lot of promotion/support include: • Australia o Rules around closer economic ties have been restricted during COVID-19. • Ireland • United Kingdom • Singapore (Economic Development Board) • Ukraine, Hungary, other Eastern-Europe countries • South Korea o Big tech sector New Zealand does not have the same scale – big difference in how careful New Zealand is in disbursing funding compared to the leniency observed in other countries.

My only question is do we need to wait for a response before we propose to set up a meeting? We could make it clear if we're expecting acknowledgment before we reach out for consultation or if we will just send a follow-up request for a meeting regardless.

It is unlikely that we will be able to send a Cabinet paper to Ministers for their review/sign-off before 20 May. It sounds like Ministers will not be comfortable consulting on what might be a net-positive proposal during the moratorium. Given that we will likely need to report after the moratorium, we would only have about two weeks between reporting to Ministers and lodging the Cabinet paper, Not in scope Not in scope s 9(2)(a)s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) which is possible but significantly pushing timeframes. We would need to test this with Thomas Allen/Paul Young/Paul Fulton. If we can’t report and have the Cabinet paper lodged within approximately two weeks after the moratorium, then we won’t make Bill introduction. There are likely to be a number of other projects facing the same constraints as us, which will make it more difficult to expedite this project from Ministers’ offices’ perspectives. If we can’t make Bill introduction, then our options are: Include software development changes in a SOP at the select committee stage. Include software development changes in a SOP at the COWH stage. Delay software development changes until the next bill. Interested in thoughts from both of you. There a number of different permutations so you may have alternative views on timelines.

We are presently reviewing the policy settings and practices relating to the taxation of software development in order to determine an appropriate tax accounting treatment for income and expenses within the software development sector. 2. Our policy review arises from Inland Revenue publishing an exposure draft of a proposed change in Inland Revenue’s view on the tax treatment of software development expenses (IRRUIP10 – Income tax treatment of software development expenditure 1 ). 3. Several submissions were received on the views expressed in that document: • Many submitters opposed change to existing tax accounting practices in the software development sector. • Existing provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 have inconsistent outcomes for the treatment of software development expenses. This inconsistency between provisions is creating confusion within the software development sector. 4. Submissions on IRRUIP10 were consistent in noting that if the tax policy problem is not solved, then the software development sector would likely be adversely impacted because of: • tax impacts on operational cashflows within the sector; and • an increase in demand for capital due to the need to fund higher cash flows. Purpose of this review 5. The objective of the review is to identify appropriate tax policy settings that are consistent with: • optimal economic efficiency for the sector; • the nature of business practices in the sector; and • the broad-base low-rate tax framework underpinning the tax system in New Zealand. 1 https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/-/media/project/ir/tt/pdfs/consultations/issues- papers/irruip10.pdf?la=en&hash=85038059438AB31059D4273F86406A27 s 9(2)(ba)(i) s 9(2)(a), s 9(2)(ba)(i) 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6. Given these objectives and the background, this is a “first-principles” review of general income tax principles as they relate to the software development sector. This review does not include within its scope any aspect of the research and development tax incentive or any other incentives promoting innovation in the sector. Economic efficiency, taxation, and the broad-base low-rate system 7. Economic efficiency is important, as it relates to policies that seek to minimise the effects of deadweight costs arising from the taxation system. Efficiency considerations require an understanding of both the framework of the New Zealand tax system and the way in which business sectors carry on their business. 8. The tax system is based on a broad-base low-rate approach to taxing profits of businesses on an annual basis. This framework supports business activity by ensuring that: • business activities having similar capital and operational characteristics are treated on a similar basis (horizontal equity); and • tax settings do not give rise to distortions for investment decisions. 9. A first-principles review is based on the following elements of the income tax system: • The annual profits of a business are taxable. In the income tax system, these annual profits are known as taxable income. • Taxable income for a year is the difference between total assessable income and deductible expenses relating to that year. • The calculation of taxable income considers applies accounting principles and specific tax rules for recognising the existence and timing of both assessable income and deductible expenses. Current practices 10. To date, this review has identified a variety of tax accounting practices for the deductibility of software development expenses, including: • deduction of these expenses in full as they incurred; • deduction of these expenses in full when the developed software is first able to be commercially exploited; and • capitalisation of these expenses until the developed software is recognised as an asset, with the capitalised expenses are amortised (as a deductible expense) over the economic life of the related developed software. Consultation 11. This letter is written as part of our review of the tax policy settings for software development expenses. IRRUIP10 proposes to apply a capitalisation model to recognise software assets based on a business process that is similar to that applied to traditional manufacturing activities. 12. We acknowledge that the software development sector and the technology sector generally is an important part of the Government’s economic policy. Up until now, we have been consulting with other government agencies to better understand the economic and incentive policies for your sector that are promoted and managed by other agencies. 13. Other government agencies have indicated that operational processes in your sector have characteristics and methodologies that differ from a traditional manufacturing business. This observation is consistent with several submissions from your sector on the proposals in IRRUIP10. Consequently, the purpose of this letter is to assist us in understanding operational processes within your sector before consulting on any changes in the tax policy frameworks for software development expenditure. 14. Issues for which we seek your feedback are: 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • the size of the software development sector in terms of participants, contribution to the economy, types of organisations (e.g. agritech) and profitability; • characteristics of business processes used in developing software; • characteristics of funding and funding limitations within the software development sector; • characteristics of an expected life cycle of software developed for commercial exploitation; • Government policies in other jurisdictions for their innovation sectors. 15. To this end, we are interested in any insights or information you have on: • Typical business and life-cycle processes adopted across all aspects of the software sector in New Zealand. • Why Government policies for the innovation sector are or should be linked to any specific characteristics and life cycle of the sector’s business processes and, if so, how? • Any specific characteristics of capital funding and funding risks that exist for the innovation sector that differ from general capital funding principles. • The processes of developing and using open source software to create software that can be commercially exploited. • Any other matter relating to your sector that you consider provides any insights on structural or operational differences to traditional manufacturing activities. Next steps 16. We are wanting to meet with you in February of 2021 to receive your feedback on our questions. We will be in touch shortly to arrange a time to meet, either digitally or in person. We would also appreciate an indication from you of any other key stakeholders in this sector for the next consultation step (see below). 17. After receiving and analysing your feedback, we intend to consult further with stakeholders on whether the general tax policy frameworks discussed above would be appropriate going forwards or whether some alternative approach should be considered that appropriately reflects the sectors businsess practices. 18. We are planning to complete our review of tax policy settings for the treatment of software development expenses as soon as possible following that second round. We would make any necessary recommendations to Government after that time to clarify the tax policy settings for software development expenses. 19. If you have any questions, please contact us.

Agency's policy, and link with business processes • CH - Overall, Callaghan's objective is to increase the spend on R&D in New Zealand as a percent of GDP. • CH - You have to remember that the 'software market' encapsulates a number of different subparts: • Building and selling software products e.g. Datacom • SAAS models - in-house building for exploitation e.g. Xero • Internal design and use of software e.g. Banking software • CH - IRD's tax incentive is not about the internal design and use but about developing products to be sold overseas to contribute to NZ's GDP, and leading to higher paying jobs for New Zealanders. • IR - As you know, internal software use (e.g. banking) would increase output of the user and therefore contribute to GDP, so I am assuming we see further increases in GDP from external exploitation of software - some type of spill-over benefits? • CH - Yes, spill-over benefits are globally recognised within the software industry. As an example, the number of accounting firms that popped up after Xero, or the Navman software which created opportunities for marine audio. We don’t see these types of clear benefits from internally exploited software. Not in scope s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) • NZTE are focused primarily on increasing exports and that link to maximising GDP, while we at Callaghan are more focused on medium sized businesses. Software is everywhere, there is a large amount of product services - largely website designs. We general think the software is a vertical industry, where software is the product being developed and sold, but a lot of software is horizontal, as different industries try to integrate software into their businesses (agri-tech, fintech etc.), software is not often their main business. • Software in fintech is actually a growing industry In NZ, the FMA allow businesses to push the boundaries more, and aren't sand-boxed like they are in Australia. Policies of your agency that relate to capital funding for the innovation sector • CH - The main one is the R&D tax incentives. However, we also still have project grants but these are much smaller. Generally, we see companies with good prospects have no issue getting funding via Blackrock, simplicity etc. etc. There is a large amount of capital waiting for a home, and a lot of the venture capital funds will say they have money but there aren’t enough opportunities. It should be said that some companies will tell you that they are struggling to find capital but in general we do not think it is an issue. • CH - Venture capitalists are attracted to companies that already have traction, that have demonstrated product market fit (the product meets a customer's desires, solves a problem in the market). If the company is struggling with product market fit it is unlikely they will have access to capital. • CH - traction is usually measured by demonstrating that product market fit through growing customer acquisitions and usage. • CH - The venture capital space, is a bit of a chicken and egg exercise, businesses generally want funding to grow and scale production to acquire customer acquisitions and usage. While venture capitalist generally don’t provide funding until the business demonstrates that, by that time the businesses may not need funding. • CH - NZ tec () might also be able to help you guys. Life-stages • CH - There is no clear end product (and in some cases there will never be a final product). For most SAAS products they will have a minimum viable product that they will test in the market, and then they’ll see if the product is being used, what customers want from it, how it can be improved. Xero is again a great example of this they started off as bookkeeping software, then moved to a full suite accounting software, now they’ve added tax capabilities. • CH - Once product market fit and MVP is achieved. The next big step for any SAAS provider is scalability, sales have to be ready to scale - can you create an engine that creates a cycle. Not in scope s 9(2)(a) • CH - The life stages are 'linear' but they can overlap significantly, there is no clear start and finish to each stage. Once sales take-off, you need to keep improving your product, its kind of like 'building a plane while it flies'. • CH - The largest expense, or the point with the most cost pressures is the coding and engineering of the software. This is the point businesses are most susceptible to falling over. Engineers are often in short supply and cost a lot. Generally, businesses prefer NZ based engineers and prefer for them not to work remotely, but often when they grow their engineering base they will look overseas (Brazilian example). Once the business is in the scalability stage - family and friends will often retract their money, and the venture capitalists will come in (if needed). The business during this stage is generally more robust (i.e. they have a product market fit and have acquired some customers). • CH - in terms of internally used software, much of the development can be outsourced, e.g. banking software. When is an asset formed and valued? • CH – As mention, an asset is never finished. But the company will be able to identify that their idea is exploitable quite early. If the business has good accounting processes then in theory they could value the business. The method of valuing the asset may be another story, but when I was developing software we simply used a contributions of cost method. Other valuation methods could be based on sales, compound growth rates, discounted cash flow methods etc. What do you see internationally? • CH - Callaghan is a little unique when you look overseas, most countries don’t generally have a comparable. And sometimes we see NZ firms being overly reliant on Callaghan. • CH - As mentioned that ability of fintech's to think outside the sandbox (unlike in Aus) is important. • CH - Every country is always trying to tinker to maximise R&D. Estonia is a unique example: They have a growing digital market, and a big part of that growth is their innovative procurement process, where many of the big tech contracts go to local firms, which then helps them to grow. Singapore is another example with a booming tech industry, as part of this they try to match up complementary tech firms to help them both grow. They also have a National Digital Identity (NDI) project - a centralised identification system. Closing remarks. End. Not in scope From:David Cuellar To:Benjamin Hammond; Craig Phillips Cc:Chris Gillion Subject:RE: Software expenditure consultation - Callaghan Date:Thursday, 4 February 2021 5:28:00 PM Thanks very much Ben, this is great. I thought it was interesting that they perceived the software development process, including bringing product/service to market and scalability, to be linear. They did note the overlap between stages, but I had thought from prior reading there might be a few more feedback loops. I think the distinction between software as a product and software as a service will be one of the harder things to grapple with as we think about what the most appropriate tax treatment for certain expenditures within the sector is. I expect there will be big grey areas in cases where it’s not clear whether some software is a product or service.

Please make changes and inclusions as you see fit. Great job facilitating the discussion David, even with the internet issues. My four crude takeaways from the discussion were: 1. The software development process although never-ending could be considered linear, in the sense there are a few steps that need to be completed (at least partially) for the company to progress: Minimum viable product (MVP), Product market fit and scalability. ‘Build the plane as it flies.’ 2. Currently, acquiring capital is not an issue for companies with good ideas and traction (However, to get to this point you still need family and friends $). 3. Companies with good accounting processes (unsure what % this is) should be able to “value” their software asset. The method of valuation does vary: Book value, Sales multiples and growth rates, Discounted cash flow. 4. We need to be clear what software expenditure we are focused on and the different treatments. Internal use, SAAS or building and designing software. Am keen to hear others key takeaways.

Talk to you all soon. A perennial problem for software companies is the treatment of software development costs in terms of whether to capitalise those costs or not. The underlying difference from any other type of investment really comes from software being infinitely copyable(i.e. There can be near zero marginal cost for reuse). Consider the following development activities and what we might consider reasonable in terms of whether that investment could be capitalised from the perspective of a tax office combined with the effect on the business. SituationCapitalisation Approaches Effect on business if changed A company develops a piece of software for a client for an agreed price Tax on profit derived by the business, may be capitalised by the client Unlikely to affect developers A company develops a piece of software for a client but keeps a copy of the developed IP on the hope of finding an opportunity to reapply the same solution in the future Tax on profit from sale. Some argument may now exist for capitalising a portion of the build Similar to other businesses. Tax disincentive to keep IP if required to capitalise, which will lower long-term productivity of the sector A company develops a new piece of software which they resell to multiple clients Some business capitalise, while others treat as the cost of servicing the contracts with each client Tax burden lies heaviest on companies that are trading profitably as they are taxed on both the sales and the growth of the internal asset. Less effect on funded startups as they rarely aim to turn a profit in early years. A company develops a piece of software intending to find buyers but only achieves low sales Indistinguishable from previous case so both options plausible Being forced to capitalise would significantly affect profitability threshold required for a product to “bootstrap” as the minimum amount of revenue before the business realised a profit after tax would increase markedly. s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) A company develops or purchases a tool for internal use Some combination of opex and capex with amortization over the life of tool’s use Comparable to non-software purchases A company develops a piece of software which it publishes as open source In practice never capitalised but would need a special carve out if guidance from government enforced stronger capitalization rules. Major reduction in contributions to the commons if businesses are forced to capitalise. Potential increase in contributions if given a carve-out by itself. These scenarios illustrate a few key problems with the idea of capitalising software development with broad strokes: Software’s ease of duplication leads to inflated balance sheets if all software is capitalised by everyone using Some businesses, especially those trying to build products off the back of profits, would be heavily affected by enforced capitalisation as they would show both sales and the cost of those sales as income. While some of these situations(such as the growing software startup with many clients leveraging off a platform) appear to make sense for capitalisation it is hard to know ahead of time that a business will be in that situation - i.e. the business that kept a copy of a solution may suddenly find their solution in demand but they might never have bothered keeping that copy if it had a negative tax effect in the short term. While some of these problems could be solved with policy if the government still wished to enforce stronger capitalisation there is a significant problem of vagueness around the asset value of software - most software business valuations are done entirely on the basis of revenue multiples rather than asset analysis. Given the direct impact of lowering lowing term productivity outcomes for New Zealand, being complex to enforce, and likely generating limited we would recommend against the broad capitalisation of software development costs. -- \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ s 9(2)(a), s 9(2)(ba)(i) s 9(2)(a), s 9(2)(ba)(i) www.ird.govt.nz Policy and Strategy Te Wāhanga o te Rautaki me te Kaupapa Notes from Consultation – and NZ Tech Date: 18 and 19 February 2021 Subject: Deductibility of software expenses 18 February 2021 – Attendees: , David Cuellar, Craig Phillips, Ben Hammond (Inland Revenue). Background: Setting the scene - Our previous submission on this topic and past discussions with IRD were about added flexibility in the area of deducting software expenses. We agree that the 1993 TIB needs updating, even at the time it was released it was arguably out of date. This is because for most software products there is no clear final product. However, any changes should consider the potentially massive adverse impacts on business cash flows. Questioned the purpose of re-visiting the issue, since its been 5 years from when the issues paper was released, wondered if it was due to overall tax revenue concerns following COVID. The sector – Treatment of software expenses is different across the sector. Many businesses focus on EBITDA figures, even if this is likely to show the business is more profitable than it really is. If they go down that route, they would prefer immediate expensing. This is likely to be common for businesses in the product improvement model. It is very hard to describe the whole sector, there are some businesses with software legacy systems, which pay a monthly service type fee, others may give the product out for free (an open source model) where they look to receive revenue through support services and maintenance fees – i.e. they try to gain traction first. Other businesses build bespoke products or develop plug-ins on the big global platform – Microsoft/google etc. The life-cycle of software has changed significantly and is varied across the sector, you can get the legacy systems that were created in the 1980s that can still be used today, others like in the game development can be released and be switched off in a matter of days or weeks, there can be a huge range. The sector calls this “bit rot” where the decay of computer software can be exponential and start depreciating immediately. Software development is similar to creative work like writing. Books can be written hundreds of years ago and can still be relevant, others might write articles or books about the book, on the other hand certain news articles are obsolete the day after they are released. Not in scope s 9(2)(ba)(i) s 9(2)(ba)(i) s 9(2)(a), s 9(2)(ba)(i) s 9(2)(ba)(i) 2 It is not worth developing software if the business is not going to constantly improve the product or provide support for customers. Other Government interactions and policies – Callaghan are largely focused on the early-stage and start-up businesses. The Callaghan grants were very good, we used to receive them for 5-6 years (might have misheard that). The R&D expensing and the tax credit seem good but we cannot qualify for that, there is a good guidance document out on it though, so that’s been helpful. It would be good to see what projects are approved so we know if we could be approved. Especially to see how many Agri-tech or Health-Tech are actually receiving and what for. Issues facing the sector - Cashflow is the key driver. Cash to pay salary and wages and other expenses. Simplicity is also important, but less so. Most businesses employee an external accountant, but try to limit the amount that the accountant has to do though to keep costs down. Getting bank finance at an early stage is often quite hard, businesses are less likely to want to capitalise the expenses because it is difficult to lend against an intangible asset like IP (also mentioned Banks look at key person risk, i.e. 1 big customer). However, if you can show a bank you have good cash flow (immediate expensing helps with this) it can help show serviceability. On the other side of financing is venture capital. But there is a reason these are often referred to as vultures, it is a ruthless business. It is more at the start-up stage. VC is changing in NZ there is more of it available, but it is still incredibly expensive, far more than debt financing which is a very cheap form of finance. In terms of aligning accounting standards, we really don’t think that’s a big deal at all (had not even heard of IFRIS, and knew very little about GAAP). Potentially that’s once your business gets larger, but believed that only 0.5% of business would be impacted . did mention that some of the businesses they manage were starting to think about what they had to report, but mentioned it was more for publicly listed companies (mentioned ). Open source and other models – Open source is a different model it is underpinned by copyright (back to that analogue of creative works). A permissible license is used, where other business are free to use the software. They provided some examples of a library system (Colab?) and a car manufacturer (Catapult?). A good example of an open source business is RedHat, which were recently acquired by IBM. The sector often refers to the benefits of open source software as “buy a brick and you get a house”. The software is not really licensed, no-one owns it. Software development is risky- there is no certainty as to whether anyone will buy the product. It may take some time to receive sales, and often each customer can make up 5-15% of revenue. Might only be selling to a few customers. Cash flow is king in all models, we think many businesses may not have survived during the early years if they could not deduct all expenses. That 2 nd year when prov tax kicks in can be very tight, salaries for software development can be very high (hinting at both the cash flow and the amount of tax paid on wages). The level of reinvestment required and can be very high, we are often competing with MNEs who at times have a vast amount of cash due to other ventures or wealthy owners, we often need as much support as we can get. s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(ba)(i) s 9(2)(b)(ii) Not in scope 3 19 February 2021 – NZTech Attendees: (NZTech), Chris Gillion, David Cuellar, Craig Phillips, Ben Hammond (Inland Revenue) Background: NZTech are a not for profit NGO whose purpose is to connect, promote and advance tech ecosystems and to help the economy grow to create a prosperous digital nation. The organise the NZ Tech week and Tech story with MBIE. The entire ecosystem can be quite confusing. The questionnaire to our members is now live on how the treat software expenses, we email this out to all our members, and hundreds of small, medium and large software businesses read each email. Capitalisation vs expensing: Without seeing the results, I would guess that 70% of companies would expense, many being early stage concerned about cash flow, and 30% would capitalise. The sector is very diverse for example game developers will often be working on a game for 12-18months for release, once they release it, it is available for use – an asset has been formed. They will still have to continuously be trying to improve, create new characters or expand the map etc. It is akin to a movie that gets better the longer you watch it. Rocketwerkz are a good example of this, I can pass on any contact details and be the link between you and the actual businesses. On the other hand SAAS companies may never actually have an asset per se, they might always be improving it and seeking customer feedback the likes of Pushpay or Xero who are constantly improving. Concerns of members: Obviously cash is always a concern but businesses are currently struggling with the border closures, like many firms they are struggling to employee those with the skills that they need. Probably 80% of software developers are immigrants. Many businesses are now employing remotely from other countries, which comes with it challenges but it is a work around for now. NZ does not get the same benefits from that type of employment. Another issue is the Māori and Pasifika communities and how we are still not capturing all the benefit that can come from these communities, we are also seeing the use of algorithms which import values from big tech companies like Google, which can be issue. Recent research Treasury a few years ago commissioned NZIER to report on the business models of 20 SAAS companies and where correlations were. I remember one was that they all used AWS, which could be a future issue. Cost pressures Software companies face massive costs, due to very high wages and salaries - some of the highest in New Zealand. These are paid every month so if you have a down month in terms of revenue then this can be tough. s 9(2)(a) Not in scope From:Chris Gillion To:Craig Phillips; David Cuellar; Benjamin Hammond Cc:Paul Fulton Subject:RE: Policy work on software development?

I work in Policy and Regulatory Stewardship at Inland Revenue – Steph has passed on your details. I am emailing to let you know about a review that officials are undertaking on the taxation of software development. Craig, Ben, Chris, and I make up the team working on this. The project is a first- principles review on the tax treatment of software development expenditure. This review is motivated by uncertainty within the sector and inconsistency as to how different firms involved in developing software account for their expenses. For example, some businesses may take tax deductions as software development expenses are incurred while others may use a capitalisation and depreciation model. I have attached an issues paper from 2016 (available on the Inland Revenue tax technical website) that serves as background. We do not yet have any options or recommendations to disclose. At this stage, we are just giving an early heads- up to interested parties about our review and are seeking views on business models within the software development sector. This review is not confidential, and we expect that some NZLS members may have interested clients. Our current aim is to finalise any legislative amendments in time for introduction of the next tax bill (currently expected to be in August). We expect to be going back and forth on consultation with interested parties for the next three months. Toward the end of March/beginning of April, we will be seeking to send out a consultation letter that outlines the taxation options under consideration, at which point we will invite feedback more specifically on those options. Unless you see a reason to the contrary, we would like to undertake consultation with members of the NZLS Tax Law Committee if they are interested, rather than seeking the formal views of the NZLS. This is the first time that we are emailing you with respect to this review. We have a couple of questions at this stage: 1. Will members of the NZLS Tax Law Committee be interested in engaging on this project and, if so, how would they like to engage? 2. Will members be interested in engaging with us to inform our understanding of the software sector, or only on proposed amendments once we have firmed our understanding of the sector? As we have not been in touch before, please let me know if there is anything else that you wish to bring to our attention at this stage, whether to do with this project or more generally.

We envisage a two-step consultation process, the first being to tap into the Advisory Group’s skill set so that we are able to develop a better understanding (from an accountant’s perspective) of the various business processes within the sector, the relative importance of clear and settled tax settings for the sector, the nature of software assets and obsolescence (We are also canvassing the sector to develop an understanding about their business processes, the different types of software development, the risks and impact of risks on their capital needs and business processes, all with a view to establishing how the tax system could address those concerns. The second stage we envisage will be about developing and consulting on any policy proposals for addressing key concerns raised in the first stage. We envisage that any proposals would likely be included in an omnibus tax bill that could be introduced in the third or fourth of this year. This would mean both stages of consultation would occur over the next three or so months. We would like to engage with you and those in the advisory group that have a particular interest in this sector via a digital meeting platform within the next two weeks. We envisage a time commitment for the first stage of approximately one hour. We are happy to accommodate your time frames to maximise the participation by those in the advisory group that have a particular interest in this sector as well as your tax team more generally.

We are presently reviewing the policy settings and practices relating to the taxation of software development in order to determine an appropriate tax treatment for income and expenses within the software development sector. 2. Our policy review arises from Inland Revenue publishing an issues paper on the tax treatment of software development expenses (IRRUIP10 – Income tax treatment of software development expenditure 1 ). This issues paper asked whether the current tax treatment of software development expenditure is outdated and inappropriate. 3. Submissions we received on that document included: • Many submitters agreeeing that the current treatment is outdated but opposed change to existing tax practices in the software development sector. • Many submitters raising concerns that existing tax rules create inconsistent outcomes for the treatment of software development expenses. This inconsistency between rules is creating confusion within the software development sector. 4. Submissions noted that if the tax policy problem is not solved, then the software development sector would likely be adversely impacted because of: • tax impacts on operational cashflows within the sector; and • an increase in demand for capital due to the need to fund higher cash flows. Purpose of this review 5. The objective of the review is to identify appropriate tax policy settings that are consistent with: • optimal economic efficiency for the sector; • the nature of business practices in the sector; and • the broad-base low-rate tax framework underpinning the tax system in New Zealand. 6. Given these objectives and the background, this is a “first-principles” review of general income tax principles as they relate to the software development sector. This review does not include within its scope any aspect of the research and development tax incentive or any other incentives promoting innovation in the sector. 1 https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/-/media/project/ir/tt/pdfs/consultations/issues- papers/irruip10.pdf?la=en&hash=85038059438AB31059D4273F86406A27 2 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Consultation 7. This letter is written as part of our review of the tax policy settings for software development expenses. IRRUIP10 proposes to apply a capitalisation model to recognise software assets based on a business process that is similar to that applied to traditional manufacturing activities. 8. We acknowledge that the software development sector and the technology sector generally is an important part of the Government’s economic policy. Up until now, we have been consulting with other government agencies to better understand the economic and incentive policies for your sector that are promoted and managed by other agencies. 9. Other government agencies have indicated that operational processes in your sector have characteristics and methodologies that differ from a traditional manufacturing business. This observation is consistent with several submissions from your sector on the proposals in IRRUIP10. Consequently, the purpose of this letter is to assist us in understanding operational processes within your sector before consulting on any changes in the tax policy frameworks for software development expenditure. 10. Issues for which we seek your feedback are: • characteristics of business processes used in developing software; • characteristics of funding and funding limitations within the software development sector; • characteristics of an expected life cycle of software developed for commercial exploitation; • Government policies in other jurisdictions for their innovation sectors. 11. To this end, we are interested in any insights or information you have on: • The life-cycle processes of developing, selling and improving a product. • How and when is a product ready for exploitation or sale? • Does the decision on whether to the sell the product or license the rights to the product change the life-cycle or exploitation process? • Any specific characteristics of capital funding and funding risks that exist for the innovation sector that differ from general capital funding principles. • The processes of developing and using open-source software to create software that can be commercially exploited. • Any other matter relating to your sector that you consider provides any insights on structural or operational differences to traditional manufacturing activities. Next steps 12. After discussing and consulting with software businesses in an attempt to understand the processes within the software sector, we intend to consult further with stakeholders on how general tax policy frameworks would apply to the software sector and whether that application is appropriate. 13. We are planning to complete our review of tax policy settings for the treatment of software development expenses as soon as possible following that second round. We would make any necessary recommendations to Government after that time to clarify the tax policy settings for software development expenses. 14. If you have any questions, please contact us.

We understand that this survey was raised in a conversation with TGC. This memo provides relevant context and further details about the survey. Background OCTC (now TCO) released an issues paper, IRRUIP10, in 2016 that proposed a capitalisation and depreciation treatment for software development expenditure. This conflicts with the trading stock treatment endorsed in a 1993 TIB item. As a result, there is uncertainty and inconsistency with regard to how software development expenditure should be treated for tax purposes. The project A policy project commenced on the software development sector, in part because of inconsistent tax treatment within the software sector and in part because of strong opposition by the software sector to TCO’s proposed change to the treatment of expenditure. The first stage of this project, the “discovery” stage, is to seek to understand the business processes and risks within the software sector. This knowledge will support the second stage of the project, the “options analysis” stage, which is to identify the preferred tax treatment of software expenditure. Project update Since November 2020, we have been consulting with Government agencies, tax practitioners and software businesses to understand the nature of the sector (the “discovery” phase). Once we conclude these initial discussions with the sector, we will consider appropriate tax settings for the sector and engage in consultation targeted at determining what those settings should be . Not in scope 2 The survey As part of our consultation to date, we have engaged with NZTech’s . NZTech is an industry body within the software sector with more than 1000 members. NZTech designed and launched a survey titled “Tax Accounting Treatment for Software Development”. 1 The survey is an NZTech initiative and was published on NZTech’s website on 18 February 2021. The purpose of this survey is to gather feedback from members of NZTech on practices and attitudes of businesses involved in software development. The survey is NZTech’s initiative and was not requested by PaRS. We were informed of it before it was launched. The questions asked in the survey are contained in Appendix 1. The survey’s landing page notes that “the results will be used to produce industry facts to support the development of a tax policy that benefits the majority of software companies”. This is contrary to the language we have been using in our consultation to date, which has not been about benefitting the software sector. We have been consistent in saying that we are beginning the project from a stance of tax neutrality and we have no pre-conceived ideas about what changes we may recommend to the tax treatment of the sector. One of the project’s core objectives is to provide more certainty for the sector. Attached to this memo in Appendix 2 are preliminary insights from the survey as of 19 February 2021. NZTech has noted that the full results will be sent through soon. The survey is now closed. If you have any further questions, please get in touch with any of us.

Most are unsure. • 64% fund software development from revenue, 29% from equity and 7% from other business units. • 46% are developing SAAS solutions, 29% custom applications, 18% cloud solutions, 7% standalone software. • The revenues from the software development as a proportion of all revenues is spread, but it was 100% for 30% of respondents. • Most respondents have less than 20 software developers, but 3 had over 100. • Most were spending up to $500K on development, with 5 spending over $5m a year.

It is a review of the treatment of income and expenditure within the software sector that was approved by PPAC in June 2020. The industry is complex, and regulators (including for the tax system) often struggle to keep up with how the software sector develops. Our project will consider what are the appropriate tax settings for the sector. Some of the issues we are looking at include different variations of commercial exploitation (assignment of rights, licencing, leasing, etc.), major subsectors (AgriTech, HealthTech, game development, etc.), and what are repairs and maintenance versus capital improvements of software. We are particularly interested in understanding the reasons (if there are any) for why the software industry is different from other industries in a way that would justify having industry-specific tax rules. We are emailing because we anticipate there is a chance you or the Minister may hear about our review from interested stakeholders, but we are not planning to report to the Minister on it for a while since we are still in the early stages of the project. Currently, we are talking to stakeholders within the industry to understand business models within the sector; NZTech has launched a survey to get some data that they have offered to share with us. Our next stage of consultation will then move onto developing options for any potential changes and testing those with the sector and tax practitioners. Let us know if you have any questions or require more details.

Consultation letter provided prior to the meeting: Software Development consultation\_Business Stakeholders 1. Introduction and project background – Craig 2. Open question – Craig 3. Consistency with accounting - R&D expenditure. The continuation of the deduction rules in DB 33-40B work well. - It generally follows accounting principles, see IAS 38 Intangible Assets. - The difference between sale and license should be contemplated within the rules. o The rules currently appear to favour the seller not the retainer. - In 2016, a business I was advising was making changes on the fly and we found it difficult to know what to do. - The Depreciation rate seems appropriate from what I know of it. 4. Is Software different? - When developing when does the business start expensing vs capitalising. - It is simply a capital vs expenditure question, and although difficult is not exclusive to software. o When is an asset generated? o There are different phases of software development. o We don’t want a situation where everything just defaults to capitalisation. o Its similar to the retirement home business you need to make judgement calls, on what planning and construction costs are expensed vs capitalised. - There is a slight difference between when software is created than other assets. o This is because there is a practical overlay, around the question of when is the software ‘available for use’. - There could be an argument that the sector should be treated different. You build the asset and have to continuously add to and develop and maintain it. - Capitalisation is probably the correct outcome. - Members disagreed about whether software was inherently different or similar to businesses that develop tangible assets. - A commercial building example was used. o Maintenance of a building could be ripping out tilling or walls, those things are now gone. With software maintenance is different. - Some agreement that at the early stage there might be more of a case to depreciate until the asset is available for use but this is difficult to apply. s 9(2)(a) 2 5. Abandoning/blackhole - There is always concerns here. - If you have partial completed the software for commercial exploitation, then you use EE50. - It is always fact specific. - DB40B means that abandoned items should be covered. 6. Sales of outright code - Is not the norm - If this happens the purchaser will just purchase the whole company and not specific assets. - This is not their usual business. From experience, one business I advised did sell and treated the software like it was trading stock, and therefore would be on revenue account. - Other members of the group confirmed it is quite rare. www.ird.govt.nz Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Kaupapa me te Tiaki i ngā Ture File note Date: 18 March 2021 Subject: Results from NZ Tech Alliance Survey – Tax Accounting Treatment for Software Development – March 2021 Background 1. NZTech is assisting the Inland Revenue consultation phase by undertaking a survey across a broad range of member organisations that engage in software development. The survey, ran in March 2021, had 60 responses. The sample size can only be treated as indicative and not statistically significant. 2. The survey was to support understanding of the different software development business models and the resulting different approaches to tax. Results and key takeaways Demographics – responders were primarily small-medium enterprises in the business of software development (mainly in the SAAS subsector), who used revenue to fund software development. 1. The majority (71%) of respondents could be regarded as small software development businesses with less than 20 staff engaged in developing software on a daily basis. However, 15% of more respondents have more than 50 staff developing software on daily basis. About half of respondents develop SAAS products. 2. 59% of respondents reported that the majority (>60%) of there revenue was sourced from developing software. The majority (72%) reported average annual expenditure of less than $2.5 million. 3. The majority (65%) of respondents’ fund development of software through revenue, with about a quarter (28%) funding expenses through equity. Accounting rules - Responders primarily expensed software for accounting purposes but felt the rules were inadequate. 4. Nearly two-thirds (62%) of respondents are expensing software development for accounting purposes. Common responses to the accounting treatment question, included: a. Depended upon the nature of the project. b. Software development costs are expensed due to uncertainty of the outcome. c. We expense to align with R&D cash out, RDTI and Callaghan reporting. d. We capitalised in the past and now have that asset on our balance sheet and it doesn’t feel correct. 5. The majority of respondents (68%) found the existing accounting rules for developing software as inadequate. Common answers to why, included: a. Current rules are heavily focused on the traditional fixed asset-reach or service- based technology businesses, but poorly address agile process or current trends. 2 b. Software by its very nature is a continuously evolving product. Hence it is hard to define completion of a product. c. The don't cover the wide range of software activities taking place in NZ. It seems to me the IRD doesn't understand the sector and what is involved in software. d. Typical approach with US companies is to capitalise, and so the fact we expense everything always raises questions with potential investors or acquirers. Tax rules – Responders signalled that tax poses a significant issue for the business and thought better access to tax credits would help improve the tax treatment of sof tware. 1. The majority of respondents (75%) confirmed that income tax implications posed a significant issue for their business. 2. Respondents though the following could help improve the taxation treatment of developing software for use in a business: a. Improved ability to classify software development as R&D for RDTI. b. All expenditure able to be deductible immediately. c. Reduce blackhole expenditure risk. d. Clear understanding of the rules and how we can leverage incentives to grow this sector. e. Existing rules are fit for purpose. Alignment of tax and accounting is critical. f. The switch from Growth Grant to RDTI does not work for loss making software businesses. We rely on the cashflow to help co-fund R&D. www.ird.govt.nz Policy and Strategy Te Wāhanga o te Rautaki me te Kaupapa File note Date: 26 March 2021 Author: Craig Phillips Subject: Accounting Treatment of Software Development under GAAP Purpose of this note This note provides background from accountancy practices that could be helpful for resolving the policy issue in the software development project around the lack of statutory of clarity on how to account for development costs for tax purposes. The note is divided into 4 parts: • PART 1: Why the timing of cost recognition is important for the sector. • PART 2: An outline of the financial accounting reporting framework mandated by the External Reporting Board (this has the status of secondary legislation) \[NZ Conceptual Framework\]. • PART 3: An outline of the financial statement requirements \[NZ IAS 1\]. This part of the note also outlines: o core terms (and their meanings) used in accounting standards; and o tax minimum reporting requirements. • An overview of the elements of XRB standards that could be relevant to our policy analysis: o NZ IAS 38 Intangible Assets o IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts o IFRS 16 Leases Recent law changes in the ARFER bill (feasibility, IFRS 16, purchase price allocation) may have relevance to our policy analysis, but this note does not include a discussion on those items. For completeness, I attach an appendix comparing the application of NZ IAS to software costs incurred for developing intangible property to the outcomes set out in IS 17/04 and IRRUIP 10 Part 1: Recognising Costs for Accounting Purposes: Research Stage & Development Stage Why does recognition of costs matter to investors? Submissions to IRUIPP-13 identified that both high-tech start-ups and new projects generally devote a significant amount of their time and money into software development. The accounting and tax treatment of these costs likely have a huge impact on both the current and future financial performance of the entity. There are a few things that need to be understood prior to diving into how the accounting rules for NZ IAS 38 might be thought of as a conceptual resource for tax policy frameworks. Not in scope 2 Part 2: NZ’s Financial Reporting framework Various enactments prescribe specific types of preparers of general-purpose financial reports (GBFR) (e.g. Financial Reporting Act, Charities Act, Incorporated Societies Act. These preparers may be required to comply with reporting standards set by the External Reporting Board (XRB). The XRB standards are developed using the principles set out in the NZ Conceptual Framework (issued by the XRB, 2018) and modified from time to time. NZ Conceptual Framework The NZ Conceptual Framework (NZCF) sets out the objectives of GPFR and some definitions that are important to understand each of the standards. The main objective for GPFR is about providing financial information (about the reporting entity) that is useful for investors (existing and potential), lenders and other creditor in making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity. IR as a creditor does not seem to fall within this concept. This is clearly set out in para 1.10 of NZCF where regulators stated as not being a primary user of GPFR. However, as tax is a major cost to the company, it is recognised with its own reporting standard. At para 1.12 the framework identifies that GPFR provides information about the reporting entity’s economic resources and claims against the entity, the effects of transactions and other events that change economic resources and claims, based on the accrual accounting concept. As such the nature of GPFR may have relevance to our BBLR tax base, as our tax system seeks to tax the economic outcomes of transactions subject to considerations related to the government objectives as to appropriate timing of income and expenditure. Tax outcomes may differ from accounting constructs as to timing, in particular the treatment as expenditures as a capital or a period cost and also generally does not take account of economic impacts not having a transaction effect (exceptions exist, including impairment of trading stock and impairment & revaluation of lease asset values – recent IFRS 16 provisions). Qualitative characteristics of transactional effects for GPFR – likely also relevant for tax policy settings • Relevance e.g. nature (research or development), nexus for deductions • Materiality e.g. relevant in IS 12/01 R&M statement • Faithful representation: complete, neutral and error free but does not mean error free e.g. the different scales of offence in the penalties’ regime is largely based on this principle • Comparability e.g.(year-by -year trends), verifiability e.g. record storage rules, IR audit, timeliness (e.g. annual return of income enables forecasting of revenue information), and understandability (e.g. foreign exchange conversion rules, language requirements) are also central factors to the concept of integrity of the tax system. GPFR identifies and values: assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses and also provides non-financial information on assets labilities don’t meet recognition criteria (e.g. future events having potential effect on current value of net assets e.g. effects of pandemic on a health insurer). Key definitions of GPFR elements Asset: a present economic resource controlled by the entity because of past events. An economic resource is a right that has the potential to produce economic benefits. This principle is probably relevant to BBLR tax settings in determining when an asset is created (see paras 4.3 to 4.25 of the NZ Accounting Framework) Liability: a present obligation to transfer an economic resource because of a past event. Not in scope 3 (e.g. a right to receive contractual cash flows or produces cash flows related to a resource implies an asset exists for the entity. This principle is relevant to BBLR as it has a high relevance to determine timing of deductions – i.e. when an expenditure is incurred (whether capital or revenue) Executory contracts combined right and obligations to transfer economic resources A contract, or a portion of a contract, that is equally unperformed—neither party has fulfilled any of its obligations, or both parties have partially fulfilled their obligations to an equal extent.. Contractual rights - Need also to consider the impact of FA leasing rules and IFRS 16 for leased software. Income : an increase in assets or decrease in liability that results in an increase in equity (other than equity transactions) Expense: a decrease in assets or decrease in liability that results in an increase in equity (other than equity transactions) Potential to produce economic benefit: Does not require certainty, or likelihood – however the right (to own/control the resource) must already exist (e.g. trademark, ownership) i.e. until the right exists, there is no potential to produce economic benefit. 1 A potential to produce economic benefits arises fr om: • Receipt of contractual cash flows • Exchange of economic resources on favourable terms • Receipt of cash or other resources by disposing of the resource • Extinguishing liabilities by transferring the resource (e.g. distributing the asset to settle a liability); or • Receiving cash outflows or avoiding cash outflows by using the resource to either: o produce goods or services (e.g. cloud services); or o enhance the value of another resource (e.g. using data to produce reports); or o leasing (licensing?) the resource to another party. 1 – this might be a cornerstone of any legislative change around capitalising software – it doesn’t answer the question of what the tax value of that right should be – I will go to NZ IAS 38 to explore this question. Not in scope 4 Part 3: XRB A1 – Application of the Accounting Standards Framework Entities having public accountability ( defined in XRB A1: Application of the Accounting Standards Framework) must comply with generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP). In this context public accountability arises because the entity either has: • debt or equity instruments traded in a public market; or • holds assets in a fiduciary capacity (e.g. banks, credit unions, insurance companies, securities brokers etc) • Smaller reporting entities are subject reduced disclosure requirements for compliance cost reasons. These RDRs are identified in the relevant NZ IAS standard. • However, most small, and medium sized for-profit entities do not have public accountability and, consequentially, have no obligation to prepare financial statements that comply with GAAP. Companies not required to comply with GAAP are required under the TAA to file annual financial statements that meet statutory minimum financial reporting requirements (ss. 21B and 21C, and related regulations) 2 . Public benefit entities and not-for profit entities having intangible assets may be required to prepare financial statements under the public entity standards which do not require full compliance with GAAP (e.g. NZ Automobile Association). However, entities may optionally elect financial reports in accordance with GAAP. For-profit entities are required to comply with NZ IAS as follows: • Tier 1 entity: has public accountability (e.g. listed on NZX) or is a large for-profit public sector entity with total expenses > $30million. • Tier 2 entity has no public accountability and is not a large for-profit public sector entity with total expenses ≤$30million and elects to be in Tier 2. Public benefit entities (for not-for -profit & public sector) are required to comply with the Public benefit entity standards as follow • Tier 1 entity has public accountability or is a large PBE with total expenses greater than $30million. • Tier 2 entity, h as no public accountability, is not large, has total expenses less than $30million but greater than $2million, and that elects to be in Tier 2 follows the PBE Standards Reduced Disclosure Regime. • Tier 3 entity h as no public accountability and has total expenses less than $2million that elects to be in Tier 3, follows the PBE Simple Format Reporting Standard. • Tier 4 entity has no public accountability and is allowed by law to use cash accounting, and elects to be in Tier 4. Accounting requirements under NZ IAS 1 Tier 1 (compulsory) and Tier 2 (by election) for-profits must comply a range of accounting standards, as to the types of financial statements e.g. they must produce a statement of financial position, a statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, a statement of changes in equity and a statement of cash flows: NZ IAS, NZ IAS 2, NZ IAS 7, NZ IAS 8, NZ IAS 27. There are many standards that apply to specific elements of a balance sheet or income statement. Some are likely to have relevance to policy analysis within the software project as they provide an understanding how accountants think about the economics involved. 2 Tax Administration (Financial Statements) Order 2014, and also for trusts under section 59 of the TAA and the Tax Administration (Financial Statements—Foreign Trusts) Order 2017, and new trust reporting requirements for trusts (sections 59BA and 59AB of TAA). Not in scope 5 Standards that apply to Intangible assets and associated revenue flows – are NZ IAS 38 (intangible assets), NZ IFRS 15 (revenue from contracts), NZ IFRS 16 (leases – lessor and lessee) Statutory accounting requirements (tax laws) Note there are minimum financial statement requirements for a company (also applies to look through companies) in the TAA under subpart 3AC – ss 21B, 21C, and the Small companies ( including incorporated societies & small look-through companies) are exempt from the minimum financial statement requirements (income < =< 30,000 and not in tax loss and not part of a group of companies. However, if another enactment prescribes minimum requirements then the other act must be complied with e.g. Charities Act requirements, large company Part 11 of Companies Act. Minimum statutory accounting requirements (Tax laws) • Balance sheet (A – L = OE) and P&L. • Must use double-entry & accrual accounting and comply with certain valuation rules. Reconciliation of accounting income to taxable income, fixed asset schedule (tax values), and certain associated persons transactions. Not in scope 6 Part 4: Standards relevant to software development costs NZ IAS 38: Intangible assets This part of the note provides an overview of NZ IAS 38 and comments how it could be used a resource in considering appropriate policy settings for the software development sector. as to how it could relate to our software project. Objective of NZ IAS 38:prescribe when to recognise and how to measure the value of intangible assets not otherwise dealt with specifically in another standard (e.g. NZ IAS 32, intangibles held for sale in ordinary course of business (inventory). IAS 38 doesn’t apply to: Software that is integral to the operation of hardware – that is part of the hardware, e.g. the operating system of a laptop is part of the laptop asset. Software development costs for internally created software Under NZ IAS 38, the accounting treatment of software costs for internally created intangible asset is the same whether the software asset is created to be used by the entity or created for commercial exploitation. 3 The only issue is whether the recognition criteria can be satisfied (future economic benefits 4 from an existing right and reliability of cost measurement satisfied). Under NZ IAS 138 – Intangible Assets, software costs are either 5 : • Capitalised to an asset, with the asset value being based on the costs 6 ; or • Expensed in the year in which they are incurred (research costs). The accounting treatment of software costs depend on whether to whether they are either: • costs of research • costs of development; or development costs; or • occur within either a research phase or a development phase; and NB if the research phase cannot be distinguished from the development phase, the expenditure is treated as research expenditure (para 53). Definitions and some more detailed comment Definition of intangible asset: an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance (see earlier for definition of “asset”). Recognition of a “thing” as an intangible asset is the same as for assets generally under GAAP. There are 3 requirements (typically, these are the same things that are considered when an asset is recognised for taxation purposes): • identifiability and • control over a resource; and • the existence of future economic benefits i.e. the economic benefits must exist and be able to be accessed (assuming the software is not acquired in a takeover/merger). Identifiability requires: • the ability to either dispose of or exchange the software in any manner (sale/assignment/other disposal); or • contractual or legal rights relating to the software (e.g. acquired/ licensed) Control requires: • The “owner” to have the power to obtain the future economic benefits; • Generally, requires existence of enforceable legal rights (e.g. copyright, trademarks) , but may have this control through other means. 3 This raises the issue as to whether IS 17/04 and our work should be aligned – this has an impact for TOC 4 Future economic benefits can be either receiving cash outflows or avoiding cash outflows by using the resource to either: o produce goods or services (e.g. cloud services); or o enhance the value of another resource (e.g. using data to produce reports to meet regulatory oversight requirements); or o lease (license?) the resource to another party. 5 Paragraphs 52 to 67 6 This treatment depends on identifying the existence of a present right to future economic benefit to the entity and their reliable measure Not in scope 7 Future economic benefits include: • revenue from the sale of products or services, • cost savings, or • other benefits resulting from the use of the asset by the entity (e.g. software that reduces production costs). Key requirements for recognition of an intangible asset – 7 • probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity; and • the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. An intangible asset is normally measured using historic cost principles. 8 Historic cost is the basis of for measuring an expense or a revenue in the tax system. Accounting treatments differ for an intangible asset: 9 ’’ The Standard sets out recognition and measurement criteria for the software development expenses as they relate to a stated “characteristic” of how the asset has become “owned”: • acquired (unique items) • acquired in a business combination • acquired by way of a government grant • exchanges of intangible assets • internally generated intangible assets (same treatment applies whether used internally or commercially exploited) 10 . For each of the above “classes”, recognition of an asset on a balance sheet can only occur if the recognition requirements are satisfied. Whatever outcomes we arrive at for policy settings, we need to analyse what effects recent law changes will have: • Check if to be subject to the recently enacted purchase price allocation rules in GC 20 and GC 21. • Check if feasibility rules could apply or should apply or should be excluded – note especially DB 67(1) and any potential interface. • Check effect of IFRS 16 rules for leases (recognition of asset & sale of) Brief overview of the different “classes/characteristics” of how an asset has become owned Separate acquisition Usual basis is price paid and other attributable costs that relate to the acquisition. Para 27 sets out attributable costs to include, and para 28 sets out examples of directly attributable costs, and paras 29 & 30 list examples of costs not included in the carrying cost. Para 32 addresses contemplates deferred payment contracts where the cost and the inherent interest component are treated separately. Acquired in a business combination Fair value, if separable from aggregate assets. Fair value must be supported by evidence. Subsequent expenditure following acquisition Apply approach in paras 54 to 62 for both research and development expenditure, i.e. 7 Paras 21 – 23 of NZ IAS 38 : probability of expected future economic benefits based on reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management’s best estimate of the set of economic conditions that will exist over the useful life of the asset. Judgement is used to determine the degree of certainty attached to the flow of future economic benefits that are attributable to the use of the asset on the basis of the evidence available at the time of initial recognition, giving greater weight to external evidence. (relevant to how most assets are recognised for tax). 8 What is included in the historic cost of an asset is set out in paras 25 to 53, recognition of an expense of an intangible item is set out from paragraph 68. The type of costs included in the cost of an intangible asset is set out in paragraphs 54 to 67 9 Paras 25 ff 10 This has relevance to our work as it relates to the discrepancies between IS 17/04 and IRRUIP-10 Not in scope 8 • Research costs expensed • Development costs expensed if do not meet recognition criteria • Development cost capitalised if meet recognition criteria Acquired by way of a government grant (e.g. Maori settlements) NZ IAS 20 may apply – fair value plus costs of preparing for use e.g. software included in 11 Exchanges of intangible assets Fair value of exchanged assets, subject to no commercial substance exception and subject to reliable measurement criterion Internally generated intangible assets • Is there an identifiable asset? • Reliably measure the cost 12 - as per paras 52 to 67 of NZ IAS 38 13 • Cost classification required – Research/Development with only development costs capitalised Definitions Research: Research is original and planned investigation undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding. Research phase 14 : the period in which an entity cannot demonstrate that an intangible asset exists that will generate probable future economic benefits. Examples of research activities – • obtaining new knowledge. • feasibility analysis. • search for alternatives for materials devices, products, processes, systems, or services. • formulation of design, evaluation, and final section of possible alternatives Development: Development is the application of research findings or other knowledge to a plan or design to produce new or substantially improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems, or services before the start of commercial production or use. Development Phase: The period in which the entity can demonstrate it meets all the stated requirements in para 57. Examples of development activities are given in para 59 If the stated requirements are not met, satisfied, the software cost is expensed Costs of an internally generated intangible asset are set out in the standard 15 Nb para 71 prevents reinstatement of costs previously expensed. If an entity can’t distinguish whether a cost is in the research phase or in the development phase, the costs is expensed. Note that interest costs may be capitalised – NZ IAS 23 applies See example 65 in NZ IAS 38. Recognition of expense requirements Expenditure is expensed as incurred unless: 11 Nb -government grants in ITA are netted off against cost of asset so only additional costs should be recognised for tax to be consistent 12 Constant issue is distinguishing cost of running day to day operations vs cost of the internally generated asset – we will need to draw a boundary here if we adopt a capitalisation route 13 Note the exclusions in para 67 and the example 14 Paras 54 to 56 15 Paras 65 to 67 Not in scope 9 • It is part of the cost of an intangible asset that meets the recognition criteria; or • The expenditure relates to an item acquired in a business combination and can’t be recognised – intangible goodwill on consolidation.

Below are some nuggets. From officials’ issues paper 2.14 The possibility of depreciable property having a value greater than cost has increased considerably since fixed life intangible property and software became depreciable. Such property is often self-created, which tends to produce a very low cost-base due to a failure to accurately capitalise expenditure. However, it can have a s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a)s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) very high value. The asymmetry between the vendor’s treatment (on capital account, to the extent it exceeds cost) and the purchaser’s (depreciable, sometimes over a relatively short period) means that the parties may have a common interest in overstating the amount allocated to such property. Excerpts from submissions on issues paper Deloitte ‘Concerning software, Officials should focus on reviewing and reforming the tax treatment of software more generally instead of correcting capital / revenue issues by legislating on PPA.’ ‘As with other integrity issues we believe that specific concerns with mixed supplies involving commercial property, software and fixed life intangible property (“FLIP”) can be resolved without affecting all mixed supplies.' ‘We consider that the issues paper presents a ‘sledgehammer’ reaction to specific concerns about the asymmetric tax treatment of transactions involving commercial property and, potentially, FLIP (most notably software).’ ‘Noting previous discussions we have had with Inland Revenue Officials concerning the tax treatment of software, we consider that outside of commercial property, the core problem is the tax code’s archaic capital / revenue treatment of software. Instead of changing the PPA rules as they relate to software, we submit that Officials should focus on reviewing and reforming the tax treatment of software more generally. This will resolve the underlying issues that give rise to the ‘common interest’ issue described at \[2.14\].' ‘Software is highlighted as an area of potential concern, due to taxpayers failing to adequately capitalise software expenditure. This is a capital / revenue issue which is quite separate to the issue of purchase price allocations. The tax treatment of software is a broader matter which should have a tax policy review applied to it (including provisions overriding the capital limitation) if Officials consider the current policy framework is incorrect.' Corporate Taxpayers Group ‘The issues paper raises a base maintenance concern about software at paragraph 2.14. The Group acknowledges that there is a concern in some parts of the Inland Revenue about software and the Group is aware of protracted disputes being undertaken in this space with a number of taxpayers. However, the Group does not consider that it is appropriate to pursue a law change for all business sales as a consequence of a few disputes focused around software. In particular, a change to law around purchase price allocations would not address the perceived concern that there is “a failure to accurately capitalise \[software\] expenditure”. Whether or not expenditure should be capitalised relies on a number of factors, including the application of the general permission, the capital limitation and specific provisions overriding the capital limitation. A business who is undertaking software development may expense a wide range of costs associated with the creation of software, and this may be permitted under financial reporting standards, in particular NZ IAS 38 (Intangible Assets). NZ IAS 38 specifies when amounts related to intangible assets should be expensed as research or development. In particular paragraph 57 of NZ IAS 38 specifies: An intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) shall be recognised if, and only if, an entity can demonstrate all of the following: a) the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale. b) its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it. c) its ability to use or sell the intangible asset. d) how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, the entity can demonstrate the existence of a market for the output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset. e) the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset. f) its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. Paragraph 65 of NZ IAS 38 also specifies: The cost of an internally generated intangible asset for the purpose of paragraph 24 is the sum of expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria in paragraphs 21, 22 and 57. Paragraph 71 prohibits reinstatement of expenditure previously recognised as an expense. Section DB 34 overrides the capital limitation and specifically allows a deduction for expenditure on research or development which has been expensed in accordance with NZ IAS 38. The Group submits that if legislative reform is to be made which applies to software that Inland Revenue first needs to undertake a full analysis of what the tax policy framework is intended to be for intangible assets, as the Income Tax Act 2007 (and its predecessors) clearly contemplate the ability to claim immediate deductions for certain software expenditure despite the capital limitation. This project should not be used as a back door way to introduce a partial capital gains tax on software assets. If, after the policy review, it is felt that there is evidence of a “failure to adequately capitalise \[software\] expenditure” then Inland Revenue should look at providing guidance in the form of an interpretation statement (or similar) in relation to software expenditure as well as appropriate enforcement action to ensure that there is compliance. We see little merit in advancing law if the real issue is compliance, simply because those who do not comply with the current law are equally as likely to not comply with any new law.’ Thomas Thomas Minot | Policy Advisor | Kaitohutohu Kaupapa Policy and Regulatory Stewardship | Kaupapa me te Tiaki i ngā Ture Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake s 9(2)(a) From:David Cuellar To:Emma Grigg Cc:Craig Phillips; Benjamin Hammond Subject:FW: TGC Action points Date:Thursday, 15 April 2021 12:11:00 PM Attachments:2021-03-15 - Memo - Tax treatment of the software development sector (3) docx Hi Emma, Responding on your action point re: software developers. This looks like a reference to a survey that was undertaken by NZTech on their own initiative. In the preamble to the survey, NZTech stated that “the results will be used to produce industry facts to support the development of a tax policy that benefits the majority of software companies”. This is not what we have been saying to the sector in our initial consultation. We have been consistent in stating that we are coming at the review from a tax neutrality perspective and to provide certainty to the sector – I think this is what you are looking for regarding “what we’ve said to people externally”. Please let us know if you have any more questions. I’ve attached a memo that has more detail on the background of the project and the survey itself.

Officials are currently reviewing the tax treatment of software development expenditure. This is motivated by an OCTC draft issues paper that was released in 2016 indicating a shift toward capitalisation and depreciation of software development expenditure (as opposed to trading stock treatment which has largely been applied to date). The project is intended to be a first-principles review to consider what the appropriate tax treatment of software development expenditure should be. Part of the project’s aim is to provide clarity/certainty for software developers as there are inconsistencies in how they treat software expenditure for tax purposes (some expense and some depreciate the same type of expenditure). b. At this stage, we have not formulated any options or recommendations, and it is not guaranteed that we will recommend any legislative changes (we may consider that any issues are better dealt with from a compliance or educational viewpoint, for example). To date, officials have mostly talked to industry bodies and individual software developers, as well as other Government agencies (MBIE, NZTE, CI). At the moment, we are seeking to understand software, software businesses, and any business/process reasons that the sector would require different tax rules from other sectors (if any). This is part of the first stage of consultation (a discovery phase), which is ongoing and expected to be completed within the next month. Next steps will be to consider whether any issues identified are best addressed by a legislative solution. We will engage in a second stage of consultation with the industry and tax practitioners over the second half of 2021 to outline possible options and seek feedback, with any recommendations going to Ministers in early 2022. c. This project has already been discussed with software industry bodies (e.g. s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a)s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) Not in scope NZTech, ), some individual software developers, and briefly with tax bodies (CTG and CA ANZ). The NZLS Tax Law Committee has been notified of the project. There is no issue with this project being released as one of the upcoming projects for consultation, though I have noted that consultation is targeted so we are not expecting a consultation document to go on the Tax Policy website (consultation on options will occur via a targeted consultation letter). d. A memo is attached regarding a survey that NZTech undertook in relation to this project. The survey landing page had already publicly indicated that IR officials are reviewing the tax treatment of software development expenditure. Let me know if you need anything else.

Yes, we have had several helpful discussions with a number of tech firms and other Government agencies. Thank you again for referring us to many of the firms we have spoken to. The consultation to date as been about understanding the software sector with a particular focus on business processes, commercialisation and product life-cycles. It was not our intention to be consulting on specific tax options, instead we were trying to understand the sector and subsequently identify if the tax rules for software development expensing were appropriate. Throughout the consultation we have referred to the IR Ruling Unit’s issues paper, that you identify below, this was as a way of introducing why we (Policy) were looking into the tax treatment of software development expenses. In short, the topic had been referred to us by our colleagues in the Rulings Unit following that draft paper. As referred to above, it was our goal to look at the tax treatment from a first-principles review - taking a step back and trying to understand the sector and whether a problem existed before thinking of whether changes were necessary (and what those changes could be). In terms of where we are up to with the review, we are currently going through an internal refresh of our work-programme so have put further consultation on hold until this refresh is finalised. We should have a greater understanding on what this refresh means for the project in the coming weeks. We will keep you updated, alongside other stakeholders, on where this gets to. I would like to thank you for the offer though (and your ongoing support on this project).

How have your conversations been going with the various tech firms? The reason I ask is that I have had some of them coming back to me very concerned that things might be tracking the wrong way. The impression they got was that IR was very focused on pushing to a capitalisation model. They referred me to the 2016 discussion paper (https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/- /media/project/ir/tt/pdfs/consultations/issues-papers/irruip10.pdf). Are you still using this as the basis of your thinking or are you developing a new approach that better aligns with the reality that software development is not a vanilla exercise? If IRRUIP10 is out of date maybe we can help with the comms on any new papers or thinking. Would it be valuable if we organised a zoom call with a broader number of tech firms where we can discuss this? We often run what we call NZTech Inform member zoom calls where I have a chat with an agency on a subject, they share their latest thinking, and then we open up for questions.

I look forward to assisting where relevant as you look into this complex issue. In case it is useful a couple of data points from the respondents to our survey so far. While 78 have responded, only 45 have competed the full survey. 78% think there are issues with tax treatment of software development 70% expense and 30% capitalise, but in the comments about 10 said they use a mix, so we have added that as a new option. Pretty much no one thinks any other country is doing this better. Most are unsure. 64% fund software development from revenue, 29% from equity and 7% from other business units. 46% are developing SAAS solutions, 29% custom applications, 18% cloud solutions, 7% standalone software. The revenues from the software development as a proportion of all revenues is spread, but it was 100% for 30% of respondents. Most respondents have less than 20 software developers, but 3 had over 100. Most were spending up to $500K on development, with 5 spending over $5m a year. Hope that is useful. Will send a final version once the responses stop coming in.

This memo: a. responds to PPAC’s request to consider the merits of commencing a policy project to develop appropriate tax policy settings for software development expenses that results in the sale, lease or licence of IP software; b. outlines the issues arising if the project does not proceed; and c. recommends that PPAC approves the commencement of this project (the relevant policy commissioning documents have been previously submitted to PPAC). 2. In support of the recommendation to initiate a full policy project on the tax treatment of software development expenses, this memo: a. recaps the policy problem referred to PAS by the Tax Counsel Office (TCO) following its release of of a proposed treatment for software development expenses under the current law (IRRUIP 10: Income tax treatment of software development expenditure (IRRUIP 10)); b. raises concerns that delaying policy action would be undesirable including issues identified by both our Tax Counsel Office and submitters in response to the propose treatment set out in IRRUIP 10; and c. summarises and comments on key policy issues raised by submitters in response to the proposed treatment set out in IRRUIP 10). Background 3. In July 2016, the TCO released a draft interpretation statement IRRUIP 10 for external consultation. IRRUIP 10 was released as part of a review of an IR practice (published in TIB Vol 4, No 10 – May 1993) that that the trading stock rules should apply to software development expenditure that results in a sale, lease or licence of that software. 4. IRRUIP 10 suggested the current treatment may not be correct in most cases and suggested the expenditure should be treated as the cost of producing a depreciable asset, not trading stock. 5. Several submissions were received on IRRUIP 10, mostly adverse to the suggested capitalisation and depreciation proposal. Not in scope 6. Consequently, the TCO did not progress the suggested treatment and instead referred the matter to PAS to consider fully. 7. The project was then considered for the Tax Policy work programme; a project to consider the treatment of software development expenses incurred in developing software for sale, lease or licence. 8. PPAC initially considered, at its 26 September 2019 meeting, a policy commissioning document titled “Deductibility of Software development expenditure ( 11 February 2019).” 9. After its October meeting, PPAC requested that research be undertaken on the risks arising from further delaying this policy project This memo responds to that request. Delaying policy action 10. Delaying policy action would result in three major consequences, which are outlined below; a. Continued mistreatment of software development expenses continues; b. Continued uncertainty for software businesses; c. Continued non-recovery of previously deducted costs on a sale or assignment of copyright in software; and d. Potential ramifications if Inland Revenue change their treatment without considering polic y considerations. Continued mistreatment of software development expenses 11. As identified within IRRUIP 10 there are key practical issues with existing law. In summary these are: a. Inland Revenue’s considers its long-standing practice for treating as trading stock software development expenses incurred to develop software for sale, lease or licence to be outdated and inappropriate for some forms of software business operations; and b. current practice appears inconsistent with the Income Tax Act 2007, that generally would require software development expenditure to be capitalised and depreciated. 12. These issues can be expanded, as follows: a. Uncertainty about what costs should be included in the tax cost base of the asset due to the changing nature of development processes in the software sector. b. Uncertainty about when the software asset should be recognised. c. Tension between the depreciation rules and deductibility under section DB 34 for certain research and development expenses. d. The relationship of recently enacted R&D tax credit rules (R&D tax credits) and possible further changes (R&D tax losses) to the depreciation rules. The question of feasibility expenditure also needs to be addressed. 1 e. Depreciation rates for software in New Zealand differ from those applying in our major trading partners, without clear reported justification. Continued uncertainty for businesses 13. Although submitters, in general, agreed that the trading stock approach is inappropriate and that the depreciable asset approach is correct (in principle), they raised concerns on what impact the depreciable asset approach would have on the software market. 2 14. Submitters suggested the proposed depreciable asset approach would have “severe”, “very damaging”, “massive” and “disastrous” consequences on the software market in New Zealand. Submitters said it would “undermine the growing \[software\] industry” or be “stifling to innovation efforts”. 1 IRRUIP 10 precedes these changes and does not address these changes. Not in scope 15. Failure for Inland Revenue (especially Policy) to fully consider the effects of shifting to the proposed depreciable asset approach would be inconsistent with our responsibilities as regulatory stewards of the tax system. 16. Furthermore, an interpretation that negatively impacts the software market in New Zealand would be inconsistent with the Government’s priority, as recognised within their 2019 Economic Plan, to build a productive, sustainable, and inclusive economy. Software can be a key driver in shifting to “investing in new technology and being at the forefront of digital innovation”. 3 a. Continued non-recovery of previously deducted costs on a sale or assignment of copyright in software; and Continued non-recovery of previously deducted costs on a sale or assignment of copyright in software; and 17. The trading stock approach allows deductibility of development costs of software on the “as incurred” basis. This arises because the value of any work-in-progress at year end is nil and so no costs are carried forward from year to year as normally occurs under the trading stock principles. 18. As a result, on sale or assignment of the copyright in software, the proceeds are entirely untaxed because the copyright sold or assigned is a capital asset and there are no provisions that would recover the capital costs of developing the software. Agile policy within an increasingly a gile market 19. The development of software has changed rapidly over time, shifting from a traditional “waterfall” model to an agile “incremental” model. Submitters agreed that the incremental development business model is now commonplace in the industry. The incremental model has no clear beginning, middle and end.: Potential ramifications if policy work is delayed 20. On the other hand, the depreciation model proposed is based on the increasingly outdated waterfall or linear model for developing software. Illustrated by TSL within Example 1. 21. Modern non-linear approaches to the software development life cycle (SLDC), often termed “agile methodologies”, may result in the developed software never being a “finished” product as improvements are constantly being made based on customer feedback, see ZSL within example 1. Examples of this non-linear incremental approach, include: a. Software apps distributed through the google play store/apple store b. Adobe Photoshop and other creative cloud products; and c. MS Office 365. 22. One can consider the number of versions, updates and annual subscriptions when considering how widespread and popular incremental development models are. The incremental development models go hand-in-hand with the recent boom in “subscription business models”. Where consumers receive products or services on a recurring basis often for an annual fee. According to consultancy company McKinsey, the subscription e- commerce market has grown by more than 100 percent a year over the past five years .4 23. Adopting the depreciation model, for businesses using the agile methodologies or the waterfall methodologies, would: 24. have an adverse cash flow impact on the software development industry; and a. consequently, have an adverse effect on innovation in New Zealand. 3 Government Economic Plan – For a productive, sustainable and inclusive economy, September 2019, at pg 6. 4 https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/thinking-inside-the- subscription-box-new-research-on-ecommerce-consumers Not in scope 25. The depreciation model would raise compliance costs because of the uncertainties about when and which costs are to be capitalised particularly under: a. agile methodologies for developing software; and b. differing business practices (e.g. non-exclusive licensing, services; websites), 26. Submitters also raised a number of technical issues mainly focusing on the lack of clear guidance as they relate to software development. Some of the key questions were: a. whether the traditional capital /revenue model is appropriate for agile SDLC methodologies; b. whether capitalisation of open-source software code is appropriate, particularly as this may not generate revenue.; c. the nature of revenue streams (relevant for withholding tax rules); and d. uncertain relationship between copyright and patent rules. 27. The depreciation model proposed is also inconsistent with R&D policies and practices of the Callaghan Institute. Not in scope

### Policy report: Cabinet paper - tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting

* * *

1\. This report recommends that you authorise the attached Cabinet paper for lodgement with the Cabinet Office by 10am Thursday 20 July 2017 for the Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee to consider at its meeting on 26 July 2017. This report also recommends you agree to a change to our previously recommended hybrids measures in respect of foreign trusts.

2\. The attached Cabinet paper provides an overview of three other Cabinet papers which seek approval for a package of measures to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) in New Zealand. The Cabinet paper also summarises the background to the other papers, highlights the most important aspects of the proposals, and discusses matters common to all three papers (including application dates, publicity, and financial implications). The other papers are:

*   BEPS – interest limitation submissions and policy decisions;
*   BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance submissions and policy decisions; and
*   BEPS – recommendations on addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements.

3\. At the request of your office we have prepared the attached Cabinet paper in advance of the other three. We are currently working on the other papers and will provide those to you next week.

4\. We reported to you on the package of BEPS measures to which all four Cabinet Papers relate on 22 June 2017 (T2017/1576, IR2017/325; T2017/1577, IR 2017/330; T2017/1578, IR2017/329; T2017/1604, IR2017/353).

5\. If you agree with the drafting of the attached Cabinet paper, we recommend you authorise it for lodgement with the Cabinet Office (together with the other 3 Cabinet papers) by 10am Thursday 20 July 2017 for consideration at the Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee meeting of 26 July 2017.

#### Foreign Trusts

6\. In regards to foreign trusts, the Cabinet paper is consistent with our recent hybrids policy report (T2017/1604 / IR2017/353), but it also reflects some further policy development as well as filling in a gap in the recommendations contained in the policy report. As set out in that report, in principle we believe that New Zealand foreign trusts can result in double non-taxation due to a hybrid mismatch, where:

*   New Zealand does not tax the New Zealand trustee because the beneficiary or settlor is non-resident; and
*   the beneficiary’s or settlor’s residence country does not tax that person because the trustee is non-resident.

7\. We now recommend amending that proposal slightly, to clarify that the New Zealand trustee should not be taxable on income so long as someone is required to include that income in their taxable income. So, for example, New Zealand should not tax an amount allocated to a beneficiary if the settlor is required to include that amount in its tax return in its own jurisdiction in that year. Similarly, we should not impose tax on unallocated income retained by the trustee if a beneficiary is required to include the amount in their tax calculation for that year. This clarification is important to avoid our proposed rules imposing two layers of tax on the trust income.

8\. Accordingly, we recommend taxing a New Zealand trustee on foreign-sourced beneficiary income allocated to a non-resident beneficiary as if the trustee were a New Zealand resident individual taxpayer to the extent that:

*   the beneficiary is in the same control group as the trustee (many family trusts would meet this requirement);
*   the beneficiary would be taxed on the trust income if it held the trust assets directly; and
*   the income is not subject to tax as the income of any person other than the trustee (such as the beneficiary or settlor).

9\. We also recommend taxing the New Zealand trustee of a foreign trust on foreign-sourced trustee income to the extent that:

*   the settlor is in the same control group as the trustee (again this would often be the case);
*   the settlor would be taxed on the trustee income if it held the trust assets directly; and
*   the income is not subject to tax as the income of any person other than the trustee.

10\. In error, our policy report did not include any recommendations on trustee income (see recommendation (k)). We therefore take this opportunity to clarify that trustee income is within the scope of the proposed rules, subject to the modifications discussed above.

11\. We recommend a de minimis, so that neither of these rules applies if the total foreign sourced income of the trustee does not exceed the greater of $10,000 and 20% of the total income of the trust.

12\. Importantly, we do not consider any of the changes proposed here are inconsistent with the discussion between officials and Ministers at our meeting on 29 June. We are still only proposing to tax income of foreign trusts to the extent they are “reverse hybrids” and we are not proposing to impose tax on all income of trustees of foreign trusts.

### Recommended action

We recommend that you:

(a) **Agree** that New Zealand should tax a New Zealand resident trustee on foreign-sourced beneficiary income allocated to a non-resident beneficiary as if the trustee were a New Zealand resident individual taxpayer to the extent that:

*   the beneficiary is in the same control group as the trustee; and
*   the beneficiary would be taxed on income from the assets giving rise to the beneficiary income if it held the assets directly; and
*   the income is not subject to tax as the income of any person other than the trustee (such as the beneficiary or settlor).

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

(b) **Agree** that New Zealand should tax a New Zealand trustee of a foreign trust on foreign-sourced trustee income to the extent that:

*   the settlor is in the same control group as the trustee;
*   the settlor would be taxed on the trustee income if it held the trust assets directly; and
*   the income is not subject to tax as the income of any person other than the trustee.

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

(c) **Agree** that a de minimis apply, so that neither of the rules in recommendation (a) and (b) applies if the total foreign sourced income of the trustee does not exceed the greater of $10,000 and 20% of the total income of the trust.

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

(d) **Authorise** the attached Cabinet paper for lodgement with the Cabinet Office by 10am Thursday 20 July 2017 for the Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee to consider at its meeting on 26 July 2017.

### TAX MEASURES TO PREVENT BASE EROSION AND PROFIT SHIFTING

### Proposal

1\. This paper provides an overview of three attached Cabinet papers seeking approval for measures to address base erosion and profit shifting in New Zealand. This paper also summarises the background to the attached papers, highlights the most important aspects of the proposals, and discusses matters common to all three papers (including application dates, publicity, and financial implications). The attached papers are:

*   BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules;
*   BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance; and
*   BEPS – addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements.

### Background

2\. Since late 2012, there has been significant global media and political concern about evidence suggesting that some multinationals pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. Initially matters surfaced in the context of Parliamentary and Senate inquiries in the UK, US and elsewhere into the tax avoidance strategies used by multinationals. In 2013 the issue formed part of the G20 agenda who asked the OECD to report back to it on global strategies to address countries’ concerns.

3\. The OECD reported back to the G20 in July 2013 highlighting the aggressive tax practices used by multinationals to exploit gaps and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules to avoid tax, now known as “base erosion and profit shifting” (BEPS). They found that BEPS strategies distort investment decisions, allow multinationals to benefit from unintended competitive advantages over more compliant or domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens’ trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole.

4\. The end result was the adoption of a G20/OECD 15 point Action Plan recommending a combination of domestic reforms, tax treaty changes, and administrative measures that would allow countries to strengthen their laws in a consistent manner and work together in combatting BEPS. Recognising our own vulnerability to BEPS and the value of working cooperatively, New Zealand actively participated in the OECD/G20 project, which was finalised at the end of 2015.

### New Zealand’s response to BEPS

5\. On the whole, New Zealand is fairly well placed when we assess our tax system against the OECD/G20 recommendations. However, while the majority of multinationals operating in New Zealand are compliant, there are some that adopt BEPS strategies to minimise or eliminate their New Zealand tax obligations. It is important to address these BEPS activities without reducing the general attractiveness of New Zealand as an investment destination.

6\. In June last year the Government released its own programme to address BEPS issues in New Zealand (CAB-16-MIN-0218 refers). This programme presented a measured approach that prioritises the problems observed in relation to New Zealand’s laws. At the same time, it is a coherent package of measures. Stripping the tax benefits from one type of arrangement is ineffective if multinationals can get the same benefit from switching to a different type of arrangement.

7\. In summary the Government’s package of New Zealand domestic law measures:

*   prevent multinationals from using artificially high interest rates on loans from related parties (interest limitation);
*   prevent multinationals from using artificial arrangements to avoid having a taxable presence (a permanent establishment) in New Zealand;
*   prevent multinationals from using transfer pricing payments to shift profits to their offshore group members in a manner that does not reflect the actual economic activities undertaken in New Zealand and offshore; and
*   remove the tax advantages of exploiting hybrid mismatches between different countries’ tax rules.

8\. New Zealand’s response to BEPS is generally aligned with Australia’s response. It is also broadly consistent with the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan, although the specific proposals are tailored for the New Zealand environment. Appendix One provides a table that compares New Zealand’s and Australia’s response to the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan.

9\. The detail of the BEPS proposals was subsequently set out in three Government discussion documents, which were released for public consultation in September 2016 and March 2017:

*   _BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules;_
*   BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance; and
*   _Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements._

10\. Our officials have since received a significant amount of feedback on the discussion documents. Most of the submissions were from tax advisors to the affected businesses and raised concerns about uncertainty and compliance costs. We consider that these additional costs will mostly be borne by those who the measures are designed to address (taxpayers engaging in BEPS activities) and that the overall benefits to New Zealand of addressing BEPS outweigh these costs. We have used this feedback to refine the measures, so they are more certain for taxpayers and better targeted. These refinements should not reduce the overall effectiveness of the proposed measures. We consider the measures will address the BEPS issues we are concerned about.

11\. The following are what we consider to be the most important matters coming out of consultation. This is not an exhaustive list. The individual Cabinet papers accompanying this paper also discuss other significant issues raised by submitters.

12\. Finally we note the progress in relation to the OECD’s _Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS_ (also known as the multilateral instrument or MLI) signed by the Minister of Revenue on behalf of New Zealand in June. The MLI is intended to prevent our double tax agreements from being used to facilitate BEPS.

#### Main issues on BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules

13\. One of the easiest ways to shift profits out of New Zealand is for a foreign parent of a New Zealand subsidiary to fund the subsidiary with a loan rather than equity. This is because the interest paid to the parent is deductible to the subsidiary thereby reducing its taxable income. The specific problem we have identified is that transfer pricing rules are not effective in limiting the rate of interest that can be charged on that loan.

##### Proposal on pricing related-party debt

14\. The discussion document proposed a hard rule to limit the interest rate on related-party debt to an amount close to the parent’s cost of external borrowing - specifically an interest rate cap, based on the credit rating of the offshore parent plus a small margin. Submitters argued that this proposal could affect the interest rates of companies with only small amounts of debt (so not seen as a risk to the tax base) and could be difficult to apply if the parent has no credit rating. They were also concerned that it could produce results that were inconsistent with our tax treaties, leading to double taxation.

15\. In light of these concerns we recommend using what we have termed a “restricted transfer pricing approach” for debt. We expect that this approach will generally result in the interest rate on related-party debt being in line with that facing the foreign parent. This is because the debt would be priced under a transfer pricing methodology but (i) be carried out with a rebuttable presumption that the borrower could be expected to be supported by its foreign parent; and (ii) disregard any commercially unattractive terms used to justify an excessive interest rate. We also intend that taxpayers be able to challenge the rate using the dispute resolution process in tax treaties. The Australian Taxation Office has recently released administrative guidelines which outline a similar approach for limiting related party interest rates (albeit Australia is implementing this approach as an operational policy, rather than a law change).

##### Proposal on allowable debt levels

16\. The second interest limitation issue relates to allowable debt levels under our thin capitalisation rules. These rules limit the quantity of debt a foreign-owned subsidiary can have (generally to 60 percent of the subsidiary’s assets). We propose to adjust what counts as “assets” by reducing them by “non-debt liabilities” (liabilities other than interest-bearing debt).

17\. While there was some support for the broad proposal, submitters were very concerned about one aspect: that the proposed change would include what are known as “deferred tax liabilities.” Accounting standards require deferred tax to be recognised in certain situations – broadly, where profits for tax and accounting purposes differ. This is a complicated issue, with some types of deferred tax liabilities having a stronger case for exclusion than others. We recommend that officials consider this matter further as part of future consultation on the detailed design of the interest limitation proposals, with Cabinet delegating us the power to make a decision.

#### Main issues on BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance

18\. The _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_ Cabinet paper contains measures to strengthen our transfer pricing rules, counter permanent establishment avoidance and help Inland Revenue deal with uncooperative multinationals.

##### Proposal on Transfer Pricing Time Bar

19\. The discussion document proposed extending Inland Revenue’s time bar for adjusting a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position from four to seven years. Submitters opposed this extension on the basis that it increased uncertainty and was out of step with the general time bar, which applies to other areas of tax. However, we are continuing to recommend the seven year rule. Having a longer time bar for transfer pricing cases is consistent with both Australia and Canada (who also have shorter time bars for other tax disputes) and reflects the information asymmetry that exists in transfer pricing cases (especially where taxpayers may hold relevant information offshore).

##### Proposal on permanent establishment avoidance

20\. This proposal is aimed at preventing taxpayers from structuring their affairs to avoid a taxable presence in New Zealand where one exists in substance. The OECD has updated their model tax treaty to address this issue and New Zealand is adopting this into our tax treaties by signing the OECD’s multilateral instrument. In addition to this, like Australia and the UK, we are also introducing a permanent establishment avoidance rule into our domestic law. The domestic law change is necessary to cover cases where the relevant tax treaty does not yet include the OECD’s new recommendation. Submitters were of the view that the proposed rule was too broad and would catch ordinary commercial arrangements that were not its intended target. We agree that any rule should be more narrowly targeted at avoidance arrangements and therefore recommend that officials consult further with submitters to achieve this result.

#### Main Issues on BEPS – Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements

21\. The _BEPS – addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements_ Cabinet paper proposes measures to remove the tax advantages of hybrid mismatch arrangements. Hybrid mismatch arrangements arise when countries classify transactions and entities differently from each other under their domestic tax laws. For example, fixed rate shares may be treated as debt in one country and shares in another, thus allowing the payment of an amount that is deductible in the payer’s country but non-assessable in the payee’s. Australia, the UK and EU member countries are taking similar actions to address BEPS from hybrid mismatches.

##### Scope of the rules

22\. The hybrids proposals in the discussion document covered the full suite of OECD recommendations in this area, even though there is limited evidence of some of the structures being used in New Zealand. Submitters therefore suggested that our rules should concentrate on the known mischief. On balance, we recommend a comprehensive adoption of the OECD recommendations on hybrid mismatch arrangements with suitable modifications for the New Zealand context. Tackling only the known structures might leave a loophole to use those that are not covered, encouraging taxpayers to move into different tax-efficient hybrids rather than converting to more conventional funding structures. A partial response also ignores the fact that some of the other structures might actually be in use, but have not been picked up by Inland Revenue audit.

##### Foreign Trusts

23\. Foreign trusts are, simply put, trusts that have a New Zealand trustee, but are set up by a non-resident (the settlor) and generally derive only foreign-sourced income. Under current settings, foreign trusts are not taxed in New Zealand, except on any New Zealand sourced income. This was confirmed as appropriate by the 2016 Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules (the Shewan Inquiry). However, the Shewan Inquiry’s conclusion was based on the existing tax settings and the hybrids project has the potential to change these settings in certain circumstances.

24\. From a tax policy perspective, foreign trusts are treated as transparent in New Zealand. New Zealand takes the view that, to the extent the income is not paid to beneficiaries more or less as earned, it should be taxed to the settlor in their home jurisdiction. By contrast, the jurisdiction of the settlor may see the trust as a separate entity and not tax the income on the mistaken assumption that the trustee is being taxed in New Zealand. When the income of the trust is not taxed anywhere in the world because of the different tax treatment the relevant countries place on the trust structure, we recommend the New Zealand trustee be subject to tax. This measure would not result in double taxation of current year trust income.

25\. We anticipate this meaning that most foreign trusts will be taxed in New Zealand on their foreign sourced income. However, it is important to note that this does not mean that they all will be. The relevant enquiry is “would the income be included in the tax calculation of the settlor in their own country if they had earned that income directly?” If the answer is “no” (and there might be numerous reasons why this would be the case, such as if the settlor is tax exempt, or in a country that does not tax residents on their worldwide income) then no New Zealand tax would be imposed. If the answer is “yes” then New Zealand tax should be imposed unless the income is included in the tax calculation of any person in the same control group (for example, the settlor or a beneficiary) in their own country in the corresponding income year.

26\. Finally, we note that taxing foreign trusts in this way was signalled when the hybrids consultation paper was released in September 2016. However, because this rule has the potential to apply to both foreign trusts and limited partnerships, and because the foreign trust industry has very recently incurred significant compliance costs associated with the recommendations of the Shewan Inquiry, we are recommending a delayed effective date to give these structures time to assess their options.

#### Application dates and transitional measures

27\. The measures should generally apply from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Cabinet has already noted that the reforms are expected to apply from this date (CAB-17-MIN-0164 refers). This is based on the expectation that the legislation will be progressed to enactment before this date.

28\. The new administrative powers for Inland Revenue to deal with uncooperative multinationals should apply from the date the legislation is enacted. We also propose different application dates for two of the specific hybrid mismatch proposals. We recommend the unstructured imported mismatch rule (explained more fully in the attached BEPS – addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements Cabinet paper) apply from 1 January 2020 and the reverse hybrid measures (generally expected to apply to limited partnerships and foreign trusts) apply for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2019.

29\. We do not recommend any additional transitional relief from the measures, except:

*   relief from the hybrids measures for certain hybrid financial instruments issued to the public before 6 September 2016 (the date on which the hybrids discussion document was released); and
*   relief from the transfer pricing and interest limitation measures for arrangements subject to an advance pricing agreement entered into before 1 July 2018. (An advance pricing agreement is a binding ruling from Inland Revenue that confirms that the taxpayer’s planned transfer pricing positions are compliant with the transfer pricing rules for up to five years.)

### Consultation

30\. Officials consulted widely on the measures in the attached papers. Discussion documents were released for public feedback on the relevant topics (referred to in paragraph 8 above). For the hybrids proposals, given the earlier release of that discussion document, officials have undertaken a further round of consultation on the details of the proposals with interested stakeholders. Inland Revenue and Treasury officials have also consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. In addition, officials have discussed some of the measures with their counterparts in the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Treasury and the OECD secretariat.

#### General feedback on measures

31\. Submitters generally acknowledged the importance of addressing BEPS risks facing New Zealand and agreed in principle that change is needed to strengthen the current rules. However, they did raise issues with certain features of the proposed measures and made suggestions to make them more workable and better targeted. We have incorporated many of these suggestions into the measures on which we now seek Cabinet approval.

#### Feedback on economic impact

32\. Some submitters argued that the proposals will have a detrimental effect on New Zealand being an attractive investment destination and should not be implemented. They also argued that the proposed measures were complex and onerous, and may induce foreign companies to remove their existing personnel from New Zealand.

33\. It is true that there will be additional tax and compliance costs for some investors but these are necessary to address the issues. We have used consultation to refine the proposals, minimise unintended impacts and better target the BEPS concerns. This should reduce the additional compliance costs, although it will not eliminate them. The higher tax payments resulting from these measures will inevitably make New Zealand a less attractive investment location for multinationals engaged in BEPS arrangements. At the same time, these multinationals should not be allowed to exploit weaknesses in our tax rules to achieve a competitive advantage over more compliant multinationals or domestic firms. Furthermore, arbitrary reductions in tax, depending upon the opportunism of taxpayers, are likely to distort the allocation of investment into New Zealand. New Zealand is also undertaking these BEPS measures in line with a number of like-minded partners throughout the OECD and the expected tax revenue increase is expected to be relatively small. Given this, we believe any impacts on foreign direct investment into New Zealand will not be material and implementing these measures remains in New Zealand’s best economic interests.

#### Feedback on application date

34\. The discussion documents did not indicate a likely application date. However, some submitters expected the Government to seek an early application date and argued that it would be better to allow taxpayers time to consider the proposals and rearrange their affairs if necessary.

35\. We expect to receive more submissions on, and opposition to, the application date once affected parties become aware it is proposed to be 1 July 2018.

#### Further consultation

36\. Following Cabinet decisions on these papers, we recommend Inland Revenue and Treasury officials engage in further targeted consultation on outstanding policy issues and technical design details relating to the measures. Due the timing constraints necessary for a 1 July 2018 application date, we are not proposing that submitters be consulted on an exposure draft of the entire bill before the bill is introduced to Parliament. However, we recommend targeted consultation of specific sections where additional consultation will provide the most value ahead of the bill’s introduction.

### Financial implications

37\. Some of the revenue for these proposals has already been included in Budget 2017 forecasts. These are:

| Vote Revenue | 2016/17 | 2017/18 | 2018/19 | 2019/20 | 2020/21 | 2021/22 | 2022/23 & Outyears |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |$m – increase/(decrease)
| Foreign hybrid entity double deductions | \-  | \-  | 25.000 | 50.000 | 50.000 | 50.000 | 50.000 |
| BEPS taxation bill | \-  | \-  | 25.000 | 50.000 | 50.000 | 50.000 | 50.000 |
| **Total Revenue effect** | \-  | \-  | 50.000 | 100.000 | 100.000 | 100.000 | 100.000 |

38\. If our recommendations in these Cabinet papers are agreed and adopted by the Government, then the forecasts would be adjusted upward by these additional amounts:

| Vote Revenue  <br>Minister of Revenue | 2017/18 | 2018/19 | 2019/20 | 2020/21 | 2021/22 | 2022/23 & Outyears |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |$m – increase/(decrease)
| Grand-parenting of certain hybrids issued to the public | \-  | 19.000 | 19.000 | 19.000 | 14.000 | \-  |
| Other BEPS measures | \-  | 45.000 | 90.000 | 90.000 | 90.000 | 90.000 |
| **Total Revenue effect** | \-  | 64.000 | 109.000 | 109.000 | 104.000 | 90.000 |

39\. The additional revenue from the hybrids measures results from our proposed grand- parenting approach for hybrid financial instruments issued to the public before 6 September 2016. This revenue is contingent on taxpayer behaviour after the implementation of the hybrid rules.

40\. We are recommending that officials continue to consult on details of how deferred tax liabilities and assets should be dealt with under the interest limitation measures - specifically, the measure to eliminate assets funded by non-debt liabilities from a taxpayer’s total assets for thin capitalisation purposes. The above fiscal impact assumes deferred tax liabilities are included in the non-debt liabilities adjustments (as per the proposal in the discussion document). If these assets and liabilities were excluded from the adjustments the revenue forecast would be $10 million per year lower. In the attached paper on interest limitation we are asking Cabinet to delegate to us the authority to make a decision on this along with an authority to update the relevant revenue forecasts, if necessary.

41\. The revenue in paragraph 37 was treated as a saving in Budget 2017. We propose the additional revenue in paragraph 38 be treated as a saving in Budget 2018.

### Administrative impacts

42\. The changes proposed in the BEPS discussion documents and recommended in these Cabinet papers are not expected to increase administrative costs or require any significant systems changes for Inland Revenue. This is because the reforms largely change the way some taxpayers self-assess the income and deductions that they report to Inland Revenue. Further, the administrative amendments we are recommending should make it easier for Inland Revenue to deal with uncooperative multinationals.

43\. We note, however, that a common theme in submissions on all three discussion documents was that administration of the proposals would place a higher demand on Inland Revenue’s audit and investigation functions. Our view is that any required increase in Inland Revenue’s resourcing as a result of the BEPS package will be accommodated within existing baselines.

### Human rights

44\. There are no human rights implications arising from the measures.

### Legislative implications

45\. Legislative changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 will be required to implement the proposed measures. To achieve this, we intend to include the measures in a BEPS taxation bill introduced after the General Election. The BEPS bill will need to be introduced and have its first reading by 14 December 2017 in order to be enacted in time for the planned 1 July 2018 application date.

### Impact Analysis Requirements

46\. There are no regulatory implications arising directly from this Cabinet paper.

47\. The regulatory impact analysis for each set of measures is set out in the Cabinet paper for those measures.

### Publicity

48\. We will arrange for an appropriate announcement of the policy decisions on these BEPS measures.

49\. We also recommend that the Government proactively release the BEPS Cabinet papers, policy reports and submissions on the BEPS discussion documents and the issues paper on the multilateral instrument (including the pre-Budget 2017 policy report and Cabinet paper (T2017/949, IR2017/237)). This could be done when we announce the package. Given their inevitable release under the Official Information Act in any event, releasing these documents proactively will promote transparency around the policy process to the public, rather than just individual requestors. It would also be consistent with the approach taken for previous BEPS Cabinet papers.

### Recommendations

50\. We recommend that the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee:

1\. **Note** we have developed and consulted on a package of measures to counter certain base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) activities we are concerned about in New Zealand. In summary, the measures in the package:

*   prevent multinationals from using artificially high interest rates on loans from related parties (interest limitation);
*   prevent multinationals from using artificial arrangements to avoid having a taxable presence (a permanent establishment) in New Zealand;
*   prevent multinationals from using transfer pricing payments to shift profits to their offshore group members in a manner that does not reflect the actual economic activities undertaken in New Zealand and offshore; and
*   remove the tax advantages of exploiting hybrid mismatches between different country’s tax rules.

2\. **Note** the attached three Cabinet papers seek Cabinet approval to introduce these BEPS measures.

3\. **Agree** that work progresses along the indicative timeline, where we plan to introduce a BEPS taxation bill by the end of this year, and enact the bill by 1 July 2018.

4\. **Agree** that the measures should apply from income years starting on or after 1 July 2018, apart from:

*   The new administrative powers for Inland Revenue to deal with uncooperative multinationals should apply from the date the legislation is enacted;
*   the hybrids unstructured imported mismatch measure, which should apply from 1 January 2020; and
*   the reverse hybrid measures (generally expected to apply in relation to limited partnerships and foreign trusts), which should apply for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2019.

5\. **Agree** that there should be transitional relief from the measures:

*   in relation to the hybrid measures, relief for hybrid financial instruments issued to the public before 6 September 2016; and
*   in relation to the transfer pricing and interest limitation measures, relief for arrangements subject to an advance pricing agreement entered into before 1 July 2018.

6\. **Note** the original BEPS revenue that was forecast in April:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |$m – increase/(decrease)
| Vote Revenue | 2016/17 | 2017/18 | 2018/19 | 2019/20 | 2020/21 | 2021/22 | 2022/23 & Outyears |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Foreign hybrid entity double deductions | \-  | \-  | 25.000 | 50.000 | 50.000 | 50.000 | 50.000 |
| BEPS taxation bill | \-  | \-  | 25.000 | 50.000 | 50.000 | 50.000 | 50.000 |
| **Total Revenue effect** | \-  | \-  | 50.000 | 100.000 | 100.000 | 100.000 | 100.000 |

7\. **Note** the following changes as a result of the decisions in recommendations 1 to 5 above, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance:

| Vote Revenue  <br>Minister of Revenue | 2017/18 | 2018/19 | 2019/20 | 2020/21 | 2021/22 | 2022/23 & Outyears |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |$m – increase/(decrease)
| Tax Revenue: BEPS taxation bill | \-  | 64.000 | 109.000 | 109.000 | 104.000 | 90.000 |
| **Total Revenue effect** | \-  | 64.000 | 109.000 | 109.000 | 104.000 | 90.000 |

8\. **Note** the attached paper on interest seeks delegated authority for the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to make a decision on the treatment of deferred tax liabilities which includes authority to reduce the revenue forecast by $10 million per year.

9\. **Note** that forecast BEPS revenue in recommendation 6 above was treated as savings in Budget 2017.

10\. **Agree** that the additional revenue in recommendation 7 be treated as savings in Budget 2018 (total to be confirmed after the decision on the treatment of deferred tax liabilities which could reduce the revenue forecast by $10 million per year).

11\. **Agree** that Inland Revenue and the Treasury undertake further targeted consultation on outstanding policy issues, technical design details and selected parts of an exposure draft of the planned BEPS bill in relation to the measures.

12\. **Agree** to proactively release the Cabinet papers, policy reports and submissions for the BEPS discussion documents and the issues paper for the multilateral instrument.

| **3 – Strengthen Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) rules** | Recommendations regarding the design of domestic rules | NZ and Australian CFC rules are already consistent with OECD recommendations. | No proposal to change CFC rules. | **Same response as New Zealand**. No proposal to change CFC rules. |
| **4 – Limit base erosion via interest deductions and other financial payments** | Recommended interest limitation using an EBITDA approach. | New Zealand and Australia both have an asset-based thin capitalisation test to control quantity of debt, which the OECD also recommends.<br><br>Transfer pricing has limited ability to control high-priced debt. | New Zealand is improving its thin capitalisation rules by limiting interest rates on related party debt having particular regard to the interest rate of the foreign parent, and an adjustment for so-called “non-debt liabilities”.<br><br>_Consulted on interest limitation rules in March 2017. Legislation planned for 2017/18._ | **Similar response to New Zealand**. Australia has already tightened its transfer pricing rules. Since the New Zealand discussion document was published the ATO has released administrative guidelines (in draft) on what arrangements are considered low risk and close alignment with the interest rate of the foreign parent is an important factor. Both these changes will help it challenge high interest rates on related-party debt.<br><br>**New Zealand is proposing the same rules as Australia in relation to the adjustment for non-debt liabilities**. Australia already requires an adjustment for non-debt liabilities. |
| **5 – Counter harmful tax practices more effectively, taking into account transparency and substance** | Finalise review of member country regimes. Expand participation to non-OECD members and revision of existing criteria. | NZ’s and Australia’s laws are already robust – no harmful tax practices identified. | NZ complies with requirements to exchange binding rulings and advanced pricing agreements as recommended by OECD. | **Same response as New Zealand**. Australia complies with requirements to exchange binding rulings and advanced pricing agreements as recommended by OECD. |
| **6 – Prevent treaty abuse** | Changes to the OECD Model Tax Convention and changes to DTAs through MLI to insert a general anti-avoidance provision called a “principal purpose test” (PPT). | NZ’s and Australia’s anti-avoidance law is generally strong, but MLI presents opportunity to further strengthen. | NZ to adopt PPT through signing the MLI.<br><br>_Consulted on MLI in March 2017. NZ signed the MLI on 7 June 2017. Ratification of the MLI will follow._ | **Same response as New Zealand**. Australia to adopt PPT through signing the MLI.<br><br>_Consulted on MLI in December 2016. Australia signed the MLI on 7 June 2017. Ratification of the MLI will follow._ |
| **7 – Prevent the artificial avoidance of Permanent Establishment (PE) status** | Changes to the OECD Model Tax Convention and changes to DTAs through MLI to prevent PE avoidance. | NZ’s and Australia’s PE definition is generally based on the existing OECD and UN Models. | NZ to implement OECD best practice standards for majority of DTAs by signing the MLI.<br><br>_Consulted on MLI in March and signed MLI on 7 June 2017. Ratification of the MLI will follow._<br><br>NZ also proposing a new anti-avoidance rule for large multinationals that structure to avoid having PE in NZ.<br><br>_Consultation on PE anti-avoidance rule in March 2017.

Australia signed the MLI on 7 June 2017. Ratification of the MLI will follow._<br><br>Australia’s Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL) targets PE avoidance.<br><br>_Applies from 1 January 2016._ |
| **Actions 8-10 – relate to transfer pricing to ensure transfer pricing reflects economic substance** | Changes to the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. | NZ and Australia currently apply the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.<br><br>Recent Australian law changes are consistent with the new OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.<br><br>New Zealand law requires updating to reflect new OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. | New Zealand will follow the changes to the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. This involves making changes to domestic legislation.<br><br>_Consulted on transfer pricing in March 2017. Legislation planned for 2017/18._ | **Similar response to New Zealand** on transfer pricing, but generally goes further than New Zealand (and OECD recommendations), by applying a separate Diverted Profits Tax (DPT).<br><br>Legislation for the separate DPT was introduced on 9 February 2017 and it will take effect in July 2017. |
| **11 – Establish methodologies to collect and analyse data on BEPS and the actions to address it** | Recommendations regarding data to be collected and methodologies to analyse them. | NZ and Australia collect and analyse certain data on BEPS as a matter of course. | Since 2015 Inland Revenue has conducted an annual International Questionnaire that collects key data to assess BEPS risks. The most recent survey covered almost 600 foreign owned corporates.<br><br>Additional data collection from significant enterprises is being considered as part of the BT programme of work. | **Similar response to New Zealand**. ATO requires taxpayers to complete an international dealings schedule and has implemented an International Structuring and Profit Shifting (ISAPS) initiative.<br><br>This initiative requested data from certain Australian companies at a level similar to the country-by-country (CbC) data requested under the OECD BEPS Action Plan. |
| **12 – Require taxpayers to disclose their aggressive tax planning arrangements to revenue authorities** | Recommendations regarding the design of domestic disclosure rules. | For both NZ and Australia, no requirement under current law to disclose aggressive tax planning arrangements, however the combination of our strong anti-avoidance laws and the binding rulings and penalties regimes incentivise disclosure. | No law reform planned but existing law incentivises disclosure. Taxpayers will often apply for binding rulings on potentially aggressive transactions to obtain certainty as to the tax treatment – especially in light of our strong anti-avoidance law. Penalties on aggressive transactions are reduced for early disclosure of the arrangement. | **Different to New Zealand**. While Australia has a rulings regime and reductions in penalties for voluntary disclosure, the Australian Treasury is also consulting on whether to adopt the OECD proposals for mandatory disclosure of tax information. Submissions closed on 15 July 2016. Australia also recently implemented transparency measures allowing the ATO to publish the taxable income and income tax liabilities of large companies. |
| **13 – Re-examine transfer pricing documentation** | Changes to OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and recommendations regarding the design of domestic rules, including country-by-country (CbC) reporting. | NZ and Australia currently apply the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, but do not have a formal programme for automatic exchange of transfer pricing documentation. | Inland Revenue is implementing CbC reporting. NZ has signed the multilateral agreement on exchanging CbC reports with other tax authorities. NZ also recently entered into a bilateral arrangement with the US Internal Revenue Service to share CbC reports.<br><br>_Where domestic legislation is required to support the changes to the Transfer Pricing Guidelines, this will be introduced in 2017/18._ | **Similar response as New Zealand**. Australia is implementing CbC reporting. It has enacted necessary domestic law and has signed the multilateral agreement on exchanging CbC reports with other tax authorities. In addition, Australia requires large multinationals to file their local and master file documentation with the ATO.<br><br>_Applies from 1 January 2016._ |
| **14 – Make dispute resolution mechanisms more effective** | Recommendations on operational minimum standards and best practices for dispute resolution | NZ and Australia have strong dispute resolution systems, but do not currently allow taxpayers to approach the competent authority (CA)[\[1\]](#footnote1)<br> of _either_ DTA partner for resolution of dispute (taxpayer must approach home country CA) and do not generally offer arbitration of CA disputes. | NZ will implement OECD recommendations on dispute resolution by signing the MLI – in particular, NZ will allow taxpayers to approach the CA of either DTA partner in a treaty dispute and provide for arbitration of CA disputes.<br><br>NZ also recently issued guidance on the mutual agreement procedure (MAP).<br><br>_Consulted on the MLI in March 2017 and signed the MLI on 7 June 2017. Ratification of the MLI will follow._ | **Same response as New Zealand**. Australia will implement OECD recommendations on dispute resolution by signing the MLI – in particular, it will allow taxpayers to approach the CA of either DTA partner in a treaty dispute and provide for arbitration of CA disputes.<br><br>_Consulted on the MLI in December and signed the MLI on 7 June 2017. Ratification of the MLI will follow._ |
| **15 – Develop the MLI to strengthen DTAs** | The MLI implements substantive recommendations made in OECD’s Action 2, 6, 7 and 14 reports.<br><br>Report identified public international law and tax issues; and recommended an Ad-Hoc Group be set up to develop the MLI. | NZ has a network of 40 DTAs. Some of the MLI provisions are already included in a few DTAs. | NZ officials participated in the Ad Hoc Group to develop the MLI and New Zealand signed the MLI on 7 June 2017. NZ expects to ratify the MLI in 2018 and our DTAs are likely to begin to be modified in 2019.<br><br>_Consulted on the MLI in March 2017 and signed the MLI on 7 June 2017.

www.ird.govt.nz Page 1 of 4 Ref: 22 OIA1519 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 14 February 2022 Dear Th ank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 29 December 2021. You requested the following: 1. What is the biggest issues that you have identified that people and companies have been found to be done - illegal activities? 2. What is the IRD's approach to educate the public on detecting and reporting such things - e.g. Tax Avoidance, Fraud? 3. What is IRD doing to try and identify those who are avoiding paying taxes - e.g. IRD reference number supplied to companies that customers and suppliers can confirm that they are operating legally? 4. What types of confirmation is there that people who are providing services such as Contractors or Companies that they are paying taxes and such? On 18 January 2022, you withdrew question 4 and clarified your request for questions 1 and 2: 1. “Illegal activities” refers solely to tax and social policy fraud, evasion and avoidance. This does not relate to illegal activities addressed by other agencies such as drug dealing or theft. 2. This is specifically around Inland Revenue’s approach to members of the public who are doing the right thing, rather than marketing toward people who are being non- compliant. Inland Revenue’s ‘Right from the Start’ approach to tax compliance Inland Revenue (IR) has overall responsibility for the administration of New Zealand’s tax system. This includes a range of tax revenues for individuals and non-individuals on the concept of voluntary compliance. IR’s approach is to help customers get it ‘right from the start’, being more proactive and making it simpler and more certain for customers. IR’s recent business transformation programme has seen significant changes to the way information is received and processed. We can now analyse information we receive at scale, allowing IR to make smarter decisions and take a more targeted approach to compliance activities. We can now understand our customers better and the reasons for not getting it right. This allows us to intervene with actions that are tailored and efficient when we see deliberate non-compliance. Page 2 of 4 Ref: 22 OIA1519 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Question 1 What are the biggest issues that you have identified that people and companies have been found to be done - illegal activities? Most issues arise through error rather than intentional behaviour, where information provided is incomplete or is incorrectly entered into returns and either requires further verification or correction. There are however some areas where we do observe issues that need a greater level of IR attention or the need for a wider range of interventions and I have summarised several examples of these below. Return, Refund and Entitlement Integrity While most customers who are required to file a return report their affairs accurately, there is a small proportion who do not, and attempt to obtain a refund or other disbursement that they are not eligible to. Our new technologies enable us to automatically check new and amended returns and ve rify refunds and claims using a variety of rules and checks in our system. These capabilities allow us to stop assessments and refunds where they do not match other information we hold or there is a high possibility that they are wrong or fraudulent. These tools also enable us to track and review customers’ activities within our systems. This helps us improve our processes and make it easier for customers, and to identify where multiple changes are being made and further investigation may be needed. Where IR identifies that a return requires further review, we will seek additional information from the customer or from third parties. This may result in a voluntary disclosure or a decision to undertake a more extensive investigation. Where adjustments have been made, the Commissioner is also able to monitor future activity to ensure that these issues and behaviours are not repeated. In serious cases where customers have intentionally failed to get it right the Commissioner will prosecute where necessary. As a general observation, the Courts view tax crimes seriously and custodial sentences are now commonly being imposed. For further information on recent prosecutions, please visit https://www.ird.govt.nz/index/media- releases#sort=%40mediaz95xpubdate%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irsccor emediacategories=\[From%20the%20Courts. Residential Investment Property and Bright-line Compliance with the bright-line rules, relating to the sale of residential property, continues to be an important issue. Recent changes to bright-line ownership tests, including the introduction of limitations to interest deductions on residential investment properties, and we are helping customers understand these are areas of focus. Hidden Economy The Hidden Economy poses a constant risk to the integrity of the tax system. The hidden economy encompasses individuals and/or businesses that attempt to operate outside of the tax system and intentionally not report some or all of their income. IR has maintained an active focus on hidden economy activities. IR has worked closely with a number of sectors to bring about improvements in record keeping, including reporting the use of casual employees, with more specific focus given to the Hospitality, Construction and Agricultural sectors. Page 3 of 4 Ref: 22 OIA1519 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Use of Tax Alerts Periodically, the Commissioner publishes a Compliance Focus document which aims to give transparency to specific risks where the Commissioner has identified concerns and intends to give greater focus. If the Commissioner has significant concerns about an identified scheme, type of transaction or observed behaviour, she may also publish a formal Tax Alert that sets out her concerns and outlines IR’s intended approach to the issue raised. Non-tax related offending While your question focused on tax related offences, from time-to-time IR may identify activities by individuals or entities that appear to be in breach of other laws or regulations. While these may fall outside of IR’s scope, IR has information sharing agreements in place with many other agencies and is able to refer these to the specific agency including NZ Police where appropriate. Helping people get it right IR recognises that tax can be difficult and sometimes people make mistakes, particularly those who are in the early stages of operating a business. IR’s Community Compliance teams provide a range of front-line services for customers with an emphasis on areas where we know people are more likely to get it wrong. IR’s website also provides a significant amount of information and is structured in a way that is intended to make it easy for individuals and businesses find the guidance they need in line with our Right from the Start approach. Question 2 What is the IRD's approach to educate the public on detecting and reporting such things - e.g., Tax Avoidance, Fraud? IR regularly monitors customer behaviours to identify common errors and uses this analysis to alert tax agents and other intermediaries to prevent future errors. We also then update information, guides and other materials published on our website. IR regularly makes use of targeted campaigns, social media communications and advertising to communicate to customers what is expected, to help them to get it right from the start. Anonymous information We welcome information from members of the public where they see behaviours that may indicate tax evasion, or attempts to inappropriately access entitlements, refunds or claims. IR’s website also provides information about how members of the public can inform us of these. Phishing and refund scams IR is also conscious of phishing scams or call contacts offering assistance in claiming tax refunds. Where we identify these, we issue warning to our customers either directly or via our website. We also encourage our customers to report examples of suspicious call contacts and emails to Inland Revenue. Question 3 What is IRD doing to try and identify those who are avoiding paying taxes? Data and information sharing The use of increased data sharing with other agencies and data collection from third parties is making it easier to detect those who are attempting to evade their tax obligations. Page 4 of 4 Ref: 22 OIA1519 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Where we identify those who may not have reported all of their income, our preferred approach is to work with them to ensure they understand and meet their tax obligations in the future. This may be followed by further investigation activity as required. Significant Enterprises IR maintains close relationships with New Zealand’s largest businesses and overseas tax authorities. This enables us to monitor compliance of these businesses, including those that operate internationally. Publishing of OIA response Finally, please note that Inland Revenue regularly publishes, on its website, responses to requests that may be of interest to the wider public. Your personal details or any information that would identify, you will be removed prior to it being published. Thank you for your request. I trust that the information provided is of assistance to you. Yours sincerely Trev or Jeffries Group Lead (Compliance), Micro Business & Not for Profit
www.ird.govt.nz Ref: 22OIA1528 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 14February 2022 Dear Thank you for your request of 10 January 2021 made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA). You have requested the following: I am writing to request information regarding what information IRD provided to borrowers with existing loans under the Student Loan Scheme Act (1992) about the changes to contractual conditions brought about by the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 and how that information was provided. This Act made significant changes (including redefining them as no longer credit contracts under the Credit Contracts Act 1981 and changing the requirements for providing contact information to be more specific etc). I would like copies of any material, information, communication plans, letter templates etc that were sent to existing borrowers (and specifically if email were sent to borrowers for whom this information was held - and if not why not) Any other relevant material Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance (Student Loan Contract Exemption) Regulations 2010 (CCCFA) The CCCFA Regulations 2010 came into force on 4 November 2010 to oversee the exemption of student loan contracts from the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 (CCCFA). It was later revoked on 30 August 2011 by section 226(1) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 (the Act) due to the regulations being incorporated into the Act. At the time of the change, the student loan product also went through a legislative redesign and communication to customers incorporated all information and not only the changes to the CCCFA (2010). The changes from the CCCFA (and therefore the Act), did not change the obligation of a student loan customer having to provide contact information to the Commissioner. The changes placed certain obligations on the Commissioner around disclosure of information to student loan customers. Information being released We have located the Communication Plan – Student Loan Redesign 22 August 2011. This document provides a detailed breakdown of the planned communication strategy to the student loan customer (borrowers) base between August 2011 and April 2013. The purpose of the communications strategy was to make it easier for borrowers to understand their loans and included changes to website information and correspondence. Please note, some actions may not have been carried out, or in the exact way outlined in the plan. There was emphasis on getting this information out to both New Zealand based and overseas based borrowers. Considering there was a large population of overseas based borrowers that we did not have contact details for, a direct and general approach for our communication and marketing was used. Direct was used where we had contact details (emails, Notify Me newsletter etc.), and where we did not have details, we used wider Ref: 22OIA1528 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] general advertising both overseas and in NZ to publicise the changes (we also used nominated persons to get the information out to borrowers). In addition to the communication plan, we have also located the OBBCI Facebook Ads 27 Sept 2012. This was the proposed plan of advertising the Act changes through Facebook, as a communication channel. Some of the information in the attached documents has been withheld under section 9(2)(a) to protect the privacy of natural persons, specifically non- Inland Revenue employees. No public interest in releasing the withheld information has been identified that would be sufficient to outweigh the reasons for withholding. The enclosed documents contain information that is outside the scope of your request. This information has not been considered for release and has been withheld as “Not in scope”. Your request for all material, information, letter templates and copies of exact advertising material sent to existing borrowers, about the changes to contractual conditions are refused under section 18(e) of the OIA as the information no longer exists. We do not believe any other departments hold this information. As mentioned in our previous responses, under the Public Records Act 2005, Inland Revenue can dispose of templates and documents when they are no longer required, actively used or referred to. This is permitted under General Disposal Authority class 1.6. Right of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz . Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz . Publishing of OIA response Finally, please note that Inland Revenue regularly publishes responses to requests that may be of interest to the wider public on its website. Your personal details or any information that would identify you will be removed prior to it being published. Thank you again for your request.

### Policy report: BEPS Cabinet papers

* * *

1\. This report recommends that you authorise the 3 attached Cabinet papers for lodgement with the Cabinet Office by 10am Thursday 20 July 2017 for the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee (EGI) to consider at its meeting on 26 July 2017.

2\. The three attached papers are:

*   _BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules_. This paper contains measures to limit the ability of multinationals to use interest payments to shift their New Zealand profits offshore.
*   _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_. This paper contains measures to strengthen our transfer pricing rules, counter permanent establishment avoidance and help Inland Revenue deal with uncooperative multinationals.
*   _BEPS – addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements_. This paper proposes measures to remove the tax advantages of hybrid mismatch arrangements.

3\. These 3 papers form a comprehensive package of measures to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). We reported to you on these measures on 22 June 2017 (T2017/1576, IR2017/325; T2017/1577, IR 2017/330; T2017/1578, IR2017/329; T2017/1604, IR2017/353).

4\. We also reported to you on another related Cabinet paper on Thursday 6 July 2017 (T2017/1847, IR2017/410) called Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting. This covering Cabinet paper summarises the background to the 3 attached papers, highlights the most important aspects of the proposed measures, and discusses matters common to all three papers (including application dates, publicity, and financial implications). We recommend that all four Cabinet papers be lodged together with the Cabinet Office.

We’ve had a few additional media queries come through so this could come in handy! Cheers Kieran From: < Sent: Monday, September 9, 2024 9:59 AM To: Kieran Burlace < Cc: Steven Mooney < Christie Weir < Kendl Hambly < Katrina Fowler < Princess Whioke < Subject: Article on RNZ this morning External Email CAUTION: Please take CARE when opening any links or attachments. Hi Kieran, I hope you had a good weekend. I'm just checking in regarding the article that ran on RNZ this morning regarding the IR use of customer list matching with the large digital platforms including Meta and Google and LinkedIn. It seems your team is all over it, but I thought I'd share some information regarding the Google treatment of customer list matches - just in case there are any internal questions. Have a read and let me know if there are any other specific points you need covered. Customer Match Audiences on DV360 Overview Google’s Customer Match feature allows advertisers to upload customer data, such as email addresses, to create custom audiences for targeted advertising in Display & Video 360 (DV360). This document below outlines the privacy and security measures that Google employs to protect customer data and ensure compliance with privacy regulations when using Customer Match audiences on DV360. How it works? 1. Data Encryption Google implements industry-standard encryption protocols to protect all customer data uploaded to DV360. This includes encryption both in transit and at rest to safeguard data at every stage of the process. Encryption ensures that any customer data being transmitted remains secure and inaccessible to unauthorized parties. s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a)s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a)s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a)s 9(2)(a) 2. Hashing Before Upload Customer data, such as email addresses, is hashed using the SHA256 algorithm before it is uploaded to Google. Hashing is a cryptographic process that converts email addresses into a secure, encoded format. This means that raw personally identifiable information (PII) is never exposed to Google, providing an additional layer of privacy. 3. Data Use Restrictions Google applies strict limitations on the use of customer data uploaded for Customer Match: · The data is used exclusively for the purpose of creating and managing the Customer Match audience. · Google does not use this data for any other purpose, including building profiles or enriching their data sets. · After the audience creation process, the uploaded customer data is deleted from Google's systems to further ensure privacy. · Limited data access. We won’t share your data files with other Google teams other than to create your Customer Match audiences and ensure compliance with our policies. We use employee access controls to protect your data files from unauthorized access. 4. Compliance with Privacy Regulations Google adheres to international privacy regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Advertisers are responsible for obtaining explicit consent from their customers before uploading any data. This ensures that the use of Customer Match aligns with legal standards and respects customer privacy. 5. Transparency and User Control Google provides users with the ability to manage their ad preferences through Google’s Ad Settings. This allows customers to control how their data is used in advertising, including the option to opt out of personalized ads. This level of transparency ensures that users are informed and in control of their data. Summary Google’s Customer Match on DV360 is built with robust privacy and security measures. Through encryption, data hashing, strict use restrictions, and compliance with international privacy regulations, Google ensures that advertisers can safely use customer data for targeted advertising while protecting individual privacy. Hope this helps. Sources: https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6334160 -- Ngā mihi, Kia kaha, kia maia, kia mākoha Aotearoa.

Kia ora anō, Pip Yes, it’s a very, very common industry practice. We’re not doing it with any of our other government clients – they don’t have the robust and accessible data that you hold, for a start. We’ve actively used custom audience lists for inclusion and exclusion purposes for commercial and non-profit clients.

Whilst we know that there’s a hashing process in place and our department follows all appropriate data and privacy guidelines, we have been asked to temporarily halt the use of these whilst our IR Security Office work with us to review things. What this means for our advertising (including the current FamilyBoost campaign): We need to stop using any custom audience lists for any campaigns currently in market as soon as possible. This does not mean we need to stop advertising. Please look into alternative targeting strategies for those channels where we are using custom audience lists. I feel comfortable for FamilyBoost, that in-channel targeting techniques will still allow us to get to parents caregivers, albeit a little less directly and with a bit of a broader funnel. Happy to chat through the targeting options for each channel. I understand that this may influence both the effectiveness of campaigns and the $$ required to achieve the targeting we need. Happy to chat through things if we need to pivot $$. FYI, the below has been our response externally: “We use custom audience lists for advertising.

Hi Kendl, Hope you’re well! We can 100% apply similar targeting to below. Meta have made some changes to their audience targeting and have removed some of the options we originally suggested, so this is the new audience we have come up with for the interim: Parents with preschoolers, parents with toddlers, childcare, children’s music, early childhood education, preschool, play, family, fatherhood, motherhood, parenting, and crafts. We’ve also had a further look at Google, and it seems the current targeting capabilities are like that of Meta, where we can use demographic and interest targeting: Baby & children’s products, baby & children’s apparel, toys, child car seats, strollers & baby carriages, childcare & education, children’s apparel, childcare, early childhood education, parents of toddlers, parents of preschoolers, and parents of infants. Let me know your thoughts on these and we will get them applied today. After this, we will do some research and see if there is any better way to target our audience, and if this will have impact on our budget for these channels. s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) Thanks Kendl From: < Sent: Thursday, September 12, 2024 4:33 PM To: Kendl Hambly < < y Subject: Re: Feedback on animated video and te reo translations \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] External Email CAUTION: Please take CARE when opening any links or attachments.

The next steps for media to restructure this part of the campaign will be as follows... 1. Research 2. Build new potential audiences and budget restructuring 3. Present potential audiences to yourself for your feedback 4. Action these changes in Meta and Google Display. The team will be in contact mid-next week with their new research and potential audiences for you to review alongside with how this might change the media budget.

We went through all the campaigns in our ads manager to check if we have used look-a-like audience for any campaign. We couldn’t find any campaign from the system to have a look-a-like audience targeting. Attaching the list of campaigns, we found and targeting used in it. We have come across 1 campaign for sharing economy which did use look-a-like audience, but these were on a programmatic display campaign and targeted a very niche audience so taking the data from this would not be ideal, however, the look-a- like audience performance was at par with the regular custom affinity level targeting in terms click through rate. Impressions and clicks were lower compared to custom affinity level targeting; however, this could be due to the lesser budget allocated to the audience. Attached the final report for sharing economy. We can do Look-a-like audience on Meta and on display campaigns going forward to understand the effectiveness of the campaign compared to custom audience. However, these won’t be as accurate as the custom audience. Let us know if you require any further details to help with the report.

Here's how it works: 1. List Matching: LinkedIn uses the company list you upload to match it against its database of company profiles. This creates a targeted audience for your ads, but the exact companies that matched your list are not shown to you. 2. Anonymized Audience: Once the audience is created, you can only see aggregated audience data, such as the total size of the audience or performance metrics (e.g., impressions, clicks), but not the individual companies within the audience. 3. Data Privacy: LinkedIn ensures privacy by not allowing you to access specific information about the companies or users in the audience, in compliance with data protection laws and their own privacy policies. So, after uploading, you won't be able to see or download the matched companies themselves. Instead, you'll have insights into the audience performance at an aggregated level. So of IRD share that list to another LinkedIn ad account, the receiver of that audience/list cannot see the data on how it was built. https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a424095/ Now the long answer in case it's helpful: 3. Data Privacy: LinkedIn ensures privacy by not allowing you to access specific information about the companies or users in the audience, in compliance with data protection laws and their own privacy policies. So, after uploading, you won't be able to see or download the matched companies themselves. Instead, you'll have insights into the audience performance at an aggregated level. So if IR share that list to another LinkedIn ad account, the receiver of that audience/list cannot see the data on how it was built. https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a424095/ Hope this helps.

Hi Princess. OK - I've received confirmation of the situation - and it's slightly different to what I thought so it's good to have asked: The lists we have are all encrypted and we can’t download them, as you uploaded these lists. However, the encrypted lists aren’t automatically deleted from the platform. As shown below we can add an expiration date to the lists, or you can do this when they upload the list. This will then remove all users from the list on the date of expiration, making it so we can’t target this. s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a)s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a)s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) From:Alana Tapp To: Cc:Kieran Burlace Subject:RE: EightyOne Google account Date:Thursday, 26 September 2024 9:36:00 am Attachments:image001.png Hi I just wanted to follow up regarding the access to your Google Display & Video 360 account?

Hi Steven, I hope you had a great weekend. Thanks again for sorting the CMSO for the 2024/25 Student Loans campaign activity. We've done some number crunching with the budget to find an approach that gives us continuity of activity and maintains decent website visits, but trying to hold some budget back for the new creative platform when it arrives. For the September activity, we’d recommend running with a budget of This is 6% of the overall budget and will allow us to do both display and search. (Presuming you will continue with Meta ads in house). Although the video creatives are great, we noted that in July/August, search and display drove the most traffic to the website. During the July/August campaign search contributed 67% of clicks and display contributed 27% of clicks. Therefore we have focused on these channels for the September campaign. To maximise clicks but keep activity running, we’ve split the budget as highlighted below to run a small volume of display while keeping search activity high. In the proposed breakdown below, we’ve lowered unit costs for both channels based on previous over-delivery. ChannelImpressionsClicksCTRBuy TypeUnit CostTotal Gross Cost Prog Display139,2001,2530.90%CPM Search2,3261,00043.00%CPC If we notice that search volumes drop more than expected (we expect a drop due to budget), then we should consider that video activity was previously driving users to search and look to shift budgets to include video. I hope that all sounds ok to you. Over September, as we learn the timing of the new creative, we'll plan out the budgets for the rest of the campaign through to June. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns with this approach. -- Ngā mihi, Kia kaha, kia maia, kia mākoha Aotearoa.

Hey Steven, Thanks for your time yesterday - good to chat. By the sounds of things, sweets were the winner on the day! As promised, I have attached the revised creative that we have tweaked based on your feedback. It sounds like this is much closer to what you were expecting to see in the second round so I am interested to see what the wider team think too. As for next steps. You mentioned that regardless of internal feedback based on this revised concept, you plan to run the sweets creative. With that said, I will leave it with to plan and book the media to run for this creative direction. On the call I mentioned that the media plan will need to be based off assets that have already been created and run (therefore are exisiting within media files so they can just be re despatched). If there was a recommendation (and approval) to change the channels that we run on and therefore the need to create new assets, there would be additional creative costs involved which I can easily quote up for you. Just on that, reminded me yesterday that part of his new plan was to introduce Duolingo. The specs for Duolingo are yet to be confirmed but should they be different to what we have run previously, we will need to make these. The other point of consideration is that this brief asks us to talk to people who are about to leave (a change from the original brief where we were only talking to people who were already over there). As we know, the sweets creative was created with the audience being overseas student loan customers only. The sweets themselves were designed to resonate with this audience in a nostalgic way, to get them to engage. From a messaging point of view, this is also written with this audience in mind - the ones who have left. There is perhaps a way that this thinking / idea could be tweaked so that you’re ’taking a bit of home with you’ as opposed to only appealing to the audience who are already over there but, this would take some creative thinking time to work how we most effectively say that. Have a think if you would like us to look into what we could say, to this new audience, with the exisiting sweets creative. I know I mentioned it on the phone Steven but just to confirm, I (and EightyOne creative, design and production teams) will not be present in any WIPs / meetings related to the campaign unless requested (i.e. we do decide to tweak the current sweets messaging) and additional budget allows. I was across the media WIPs / meetings last campaign as a portion of the budget was allocated to client service time to cover this. I hope that all makes sense, please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions - happy to chat anything through. if I have missed anything - please feel free to jump in!

This hasn’t hit the mark unfortunately. We will not be going forward with one of the new creative concepts and will continue with the sweets creative. I think there has been a misunderstanding when it comes to the requested changes for the creative. Is there a reason we have stepped away from the Teal Elephant? A pink inflatable does not carry the same weight as the realistic teal elephant. It was a struggle to connect this creative to New Zealand student loans. We thought addressing it on the side of the elephant could have been an option to test with our customers. However, with the new creative, we have lost this all together. I loved the “you know it’s there. We know it’s there” messaging from the original concept. Would have just needed a tweak to the CTA in regard to making a payment. I’ve put some additional notes against my points on the original feedback. Elephant in the room The grey and teal are very cold are we able to warm up the imagery? This can be adding colour or a tint to the black and white background. Talent with their heads down look very depressed. It’d be great if the talent were more alive and less depressed because of their NZ student loan. Especially in the original subway creative, the man on his phone next to the Elephant looks down. Not a feeling we want for our customers overseas with SL debt. Change “Student Loan” to “NZ Student Loan” on the elephant. This was a must have for this creative to work for us along with the student loan amount on the Elephant. Otherwise, the creative is not addressing that is the referencing a New Zealand student loan amount. Could we see this creative in a vertical format? Was this the reason why we’ve changed the elephant creative? Our preferred creative from the Eighty One pitch was the Tidy Kiwi campaign. But as previously mentioned, this is a concept that we cannot use due to trademark restrictions. This is a disappointing result from where we were at the with original pitch. We will continue with Eighty One Media until June as previously agreed. Let’s put our focus back into the sweets creative and how we can generate the best results with that. Happy to talk this through with you if required.

Hey Kendl, Thanks so much for this. All good on the copy change for the digital billboards, however, the printed posters that are also going out have the exact same copy/design. So we’re just wanting to make sure that these are consistent. Let me know if you’d like the printed posters changed as well to match the digital billboards, otherwise we’ll keep them the same We’re just about to have a hui regarding your targeting emails today so will send you a social sheet with the copy after that for approval.

Ngā mihi he/him/ia Upoko Auaha | HEMISPHERE | From: Kendl Hambly < Date: Thursday, 12 September 2024 at 11:57 AM To: < Cc: < < Subject: RE: Feedback on animated video and te reo translations \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Hi Happy Thurs! Sorry about the delayed reply. You might’ve seen some of what has been keeping us really busy in the media this week. I’ll be sending you a separate email relating to this shortly. I’ve asked for the digital billboard copy to be translated by DIA Translation Services (our official translator) by EOP Monday. This is usually the quickest they can turn this around...so I’m moving on this and pushing that as much as I can. I have amended the digital billboard wording slightly. Please see below. The ‘$180k’ reference is just one of the eligibility criteria, so I think the below is better at keeping that statement a bit more high-level (and reduces the copy). I’ve reflected this in the wording I’ve provided to DIA Translation Services. FamilyBoost Is a payment that partially refunds households for early childhood education costs. If you’re eligible, you can register and claim your first payment now. Find out more ird.govt.nz/FamilyBoost Assume in your third bullet point you’re referring to the digital billboard creative? I’m happy with the design/layout. But please note again the copy change I’ve indicated above. If you could send me a final proof with this updated, I’ll approve from there We’ll obviously have to approve the Te Reo version separately once that copy is through. s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a)s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a)s 9(2)(a) The video is looking great thank you! This will be so helpful for customers I’ve sent this to key stakeholders for a final looksie too. I’ve told them the feedback I’m providing and noted that only minor visual tweaks can be made at this stage, so I’m not expecting much, if anything. But I’ll follow-up this email if I do. I have just three minor tweaks: 0.37 – Can we please add ‘Separated caregivers can each claim FamilyBoost’ as a line at the bottom of this slide (as a statement rather than a bullet point)? 0.50 – Agree – lets please add (as a statement rather than a bullet point) ‘You can claim FamilyBoost if you have ECE costs’ at he bottom of the slide 1.37 – When we talk through this list “You'll also need the full name, date of birth and IRD number of each child attending ECE. If you have a partner, their full name, date of birth and IRD number, your New Zealand bank account details.” We awkwardly sit on the myIR laptop transition for ages. Instead of staying on that slide/transition can we please add an additional slide that lists this info with an image of the child perhaps with a caregiver or two (like the one you’ve create for the ECE provider’s info list)? So for example, the copy on the additional slide could be structured as so: You'll need: the full name, date of birth and IRD number of each child attending ECE If you have a partner, their full name, date of birth and IRD number your New Zealand bank account details.

Kia ora Kendl, Hope you're well and had a great weekend! A few things here for you... In Phase One of Family Boost, you provided us with the te reo translations for the digital billboards. I've attached the document that we received from you last time as reference. Are you able to send through the translations for the Phase 2 copy as well please in the same format? The phrases we need translated are... “FamilyBoost ... is a payment that partially refunds early childhood education costs.” “If your household income is below $180,000, you can register and claim your first payment now.” “Find out more ird.govt.nz/FamilyBoost” We have the first cut of the animated video here for you to review. Some questions for you to think about from the team... 0:50 — Wondered whether we add text below the bullet points: ‘You can claim FamilyBoost’ at the same time as the VO says ‘You can claim FamilyBoost’. 2:59 — In this version, we kept the VO stating the quarterly periods as felt it highlighted the s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) claim from for each of the quarters and meant there was interaction between the graphics and the VO. Attached is the final poster design. I know you’ve given sign off on the creative and the rearrangement but if you could give a final sign off on this design (as this will be the design given to all of the asset sizes) before we send it out that would be great!

Hi folks, Thanks again for your time this morning. Just covering off the discussion points and actions I promised: I took you through the new dashboard for the September activity, and compared that to the August activity. Search CTR is holding up, and display CTR is actually better than July/August sitting over 1% currently. Thats impressive. The new dashboard is here . Bookmark that and jump in any time. As you'll see the format is new and note there are 3 tabs: Overview, search and display (More will be added as we add more channels). We discussed the issue with the search activity in Canada. Turns out that the organisation called IRD in Canada (International Road Dynamics - see their site here) is about to change names so that will make our issue go away. The plan from here is that before the end of September I will build a plan that takes us through to the end of June, spending budget (including this month). We agreed that we will continue with just the sweets assets that exist, and keep an eye out for any insights that we might like to act on, or any signs of fatigue. In which case we can discuss new creative opportunities at that time. Until then - stay warm! Let me know if you have any questions. -- Ngā mihi, Kia kaha, kia maia, kia mākoha Aotearoa.

To answer your other points: The music license purchased at the start of the campaign supports all asset use. The talent license is 24 months for advertising use (can be rolled over beyond that) and indefinite use on the IR website. RE: TikTok and Meta use, this has definitely grown as a bigger video than was initially thought! So, our idea for the best approach would be: TikTok: We run a 15sec promo video based on the HTML ads. This would suit the channel as short, sharp and promotional focussed content. Clicking the ad button would then take you to the landing page where you’ll be able find out more information (including hopefully view the explainer video). Meta: We run a 15sec promo video based on the HTML ads. Or, we could run a combination of the 15sec promo video based on the HTML, and run the landscape explainer video as a newsfeed post ad (with copy to say ‘here’s a video to tell you more about FamilyBoost and how to claim’). Let me know if you have any questions, otherwise we’ll wait to hear from you. Thanks Kendl.

Ata mārie Kendl, Hope you're well. We've gone through and made those changes to the animated video for you to review. FamilyBoost\_16x9-V2.mp4 Notes from the feedback: 0:37 — ‘Separated caregivers can each claim FamilyBoost’ added below the bullets. 0:50 — ‘You can claim FamilyBoost if you have ECE costs’ added below the bullets. 1:37 — We have added an additional slide but it wasn’t working very well when we tried bringing the child in at the earlier time. So, instead we interacted with the laptop screen whereby that minimises to the left of screen to allow the new text bullets to appear. This then transitions nicely to the child and then the word ‘ECE’ appearing on the building as ‘ECE’ is spoken by the VO.

We’ve seen an excellent result across this campaign. This CSO campaign has pulled in over 352,000 impressions in total, across all platforms. Along with this, we have seen very good engagement with great Click Through Rates (CTR) in all platforms, meaning that the people seeing your ads have interacted with the content in a positive way. Due to the good performance of this campaign and quality results in candidates, this campaign has been turned off, at request of IR, thus cutting the campaign live time short. Whilst good results were seen for this campaign, due to the short timeframe of this being live, ZEIL did not have enough time to be live to produce effective results. This is why we see low performance with this platform. Seeing as this campaign performed very well, we recommend for future CSO campaigns, to use the same advertising platforms so that good results can be seen again.

Couple of points: - We've scheduled the first two phases against the known sectors and timings - The last two are just placeholders until we get those confirmed by you - We've now got the always-on layer that incorporates the secondary sectors. this will mostly utilise display and search, and will be an excellent opportunity for us to test all sorts of different approaches to see what works and optimise over time. This is what we've done with the Student Loans campaigns with great effect. from our media team has built this, and in the process has come up with a couple of new ideas that weren't in the pitch. One involves Neighbourly and one is with Student Job Search (The details for this are still being finalised so we'll update you as soon as we've locked them down). If you're free as some point we can talk you through these as I think they're novel ways to find our small business owners to deliver the message in a relevant context.

### BEPS – STRENGTHENING OUR INTEREST LIMITATION RULES

### Proposal

1\. This paper seeks Cabinet approval to strengthen New Zealand’s rules that prevent excess interest deductions being taken in New Zealand. This paper is part of a comprehensive package of measures to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS).

### Executive summary

2\. The use of debt is one of the simplest BEPS strategies. Multinationals with excessive levels of debt, or with related-party debt with high interest rates, have large interest deductions leaving little taxable profit in New Zealand. Robust rules limiting the use of debt (and the interest rates of that debt) are important base protection measures.

3\. We recommend that Cabinet agree in principle to two major reforms to our interest limitation rules:

*   a _restricted transfer pricing rule_ for setting the allowable interest rate on related-party loans from a non-resident to a New Zealand borrower; and
*   tightening the rules that set the debt levels allowed in New Zealand for taxpayers with international connections (the thin capitalisation rules) – in particular, setting the allowable debt level with reference to the taxpayer’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities.

4\. We also recommend several minor improvements to the rules to ensure they are robust and fit for purpose.

5\. These changes follow the Government discussion document _BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules (March 2017)_. In general, submitters on the discussion document acknowledged the need to respond to BEPS concerns but most did not agree with the specific proposals put forward.

6\. Some of the proposals have been modified in response to these submissions. In particular, the approach for setting the allowable interest rate on related-party loans is different to that proposed in the discussion document. We anticipate that this new approach will address many, but not all, of submitters’ concerns.

7\. There are some technical elements to these reforms that could benefit from further discussion with stakeholders. We therefore request that authority be delegated to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to finalise the reforms.

8\. The forecast revenue from implementing these changes is $45m in 2018/19 and $90m per annum from 2019/20. Note, however, that one technical detail to be canvassed.

### Background

9\. The use of debt is one of the simplest BEPS strategies. Multinationals with excessive levels of debt, or with related-party debt with high interest rates, are able to take large interest deductions. This results in little taxable profit being left in New Zealand. Robust rules limiting the use of debt (and the interest rates of that debt) are important base protection measures.

10\. Accordingly, in March this year the Government released the discussion document _BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules_. There were two key proposals: one to strengthen how related-party debt is priced, and one tightening the rules governing allowable debt levels.

11\. The discussion document also recommended several minor improvements to New Zealand’s interest limitation rules to ensure they are robust and fit for purpose.

### Comment

12\. The majority of multinationals operating in New Zealand have relatively conservative debt positions, and the Government is committed to making sure New Zealand remains an attractive place for them to do business.

13\. However, there are some multinationals that deliberately attempt to minimise their tax payments in New Zealand by engaging in BEPS strategies, such as by having related-party debt with excessive interest rates. These multinationals should not be allowed to exploit weaknesses in the current rules to achieve a competitive advantage over more compliant multinationals or domestic firms.

14\. Accordingly, we recommend changes to New Zealand’s interest limitation rules, most significantly:

*   a _restricted transfer pricing rule_ for setting the allowable interest rate on related-party loans from a non-resident to a New Zealand borrower; and
*   tightening the thin capitalisation rules, which set the debt levels allowed in New Zealand for taxpayers either with foreign parents (the inbound rules) or foreign subsidiaries (the outbound rules) – in particular, setting the allowable debt level with reference to the taxpayer’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities.

#### Restricted transfer pricing

15\. When borrowing from a third party (such as a bank), commercial pressure will drive the borrower to obtain a low interest rate. The same pressure does not necessarily exist in a related-party context, such as when a New Zealand subsidiary borrows from its foreign parent. A rule to constrain the interest rate of such debt is necessary. Transfer pricing rules provide the current constraint on interest rates.

16\. Broadly speaking, transfer pricing a loan agreement involves determining (hypothetically) the interest rate a third party lender would be willing to lend at, given the terms and conditions of the related-party loan. It is a fact specific and resource intensive exercise and can be manipulated (for example, by adding terms and conditions to the related-party loan that are not frequently seen between unrelated parties). We note that commentators such as Richard Vann, a professor of tax at the University of Sydney, have said that ordinary transfer pricing is unsuited to pricing related-party financing transactions.

17\. For these reasons, the international consensus is moving away from using ordinary transfer pricing as the primary mechanism to limit the interest rates on related-party debt. The OECD, for example, has recommended that countries adopt a simple formulaic approach for limiting interest deductions, which would largely eliminate the advantage of using related-party debt with excessive interest rates (this approach was raised in consultation but was not supported by submitters as it would make a taxpayer’s allowable interest deductions volatile. Instead, as outlined below, we are recommending that the current rules for setting allowable debt levels be buttressed by rules that ensure related-party interest rates are appropriate).

18\. Accordingly, we recommend that the allowable interest rate for inbound related-party loans be determined under a _restricted transfer pricing_ methodology. Inbound related-party loans would be priced following the standard transfer pricing methodology. However, it would contain two additional elements to clarify that:

*   There is a rebuttable presumption that the New Zealand subsidiary would be supported by its foreign parent; and
*   All circumstances, terms, and conditions that could result in an excessive interest rate will be required to be ignored – unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that they have substantial third party debt featuring those terms and conditions.

19\. The combined effect of these additional elements is that the interest rate on related-party debt will generally be in line with the interest rate facing the New Zealand borrower’s foreign parent.

20\. This _restricted transfer pricing rule_ would be coupled with a safe harbour, which would be based on the interest rate cap as initially proposed. This could be provided administratively. A related-party loan with an interest rate that is the same as the interest rate facing the borrower’s foreign parent would automatically be considered acceptable. This safe harbour would be attractive to many companies as it is both simple and provides certainty.

21\. We note that the Australian Taxation Office has recently released administrative guidelines which outline a similar approach for limiting related-party interest rates (albeit Australia is implementing this approach as an operational policy, rather than a law change).

##### Private sector consultation

22\. This _restricted transfer pricing rule_ is different to the proposal suggested in the March discussion document. The original proposal was a hard rule to cap the interest rate a foreign parent could charge its New Zealand subsidiary based on the foreign parent’s credit rating (an “interest rate cap”).

23\. We consider that the _restricted transfer pricing rule_ is a more workable way of achieving essentially the same objective – ensuring the interest rate on related-party debt is in line with what would actually be paid on third party debt. While the methods (restricted transfer pricing and the interest rate cap) are different in approach, the outcome of both will generally be the same – with differences only at the margin. Accordingly, both approaches have the same revenue impact.

24\. Submitters on the March discussion document did not support the original proposal. Many submitters argued that a new approach for pricing related-party debt is unnecessary, noting that the Government proposed to strengthen the transfer pricing rules generally (in the other March discussion document _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_).

25\. Some submissions highlighted the consequences of adopting a blunt rule in the nature of the cap. These include concerns that:

*   the cap is not a good proxy for an arm’s length interest rate in some situations and so could result in double taxation;
*   the cap would deny deductions even when the amount of debt in the subsidiary was low;
*   the cap may increase compliance costs, for example, where a foreign parent has no credit rating (about half of New Zealand’s largest foreign-owned businesses are owned by companies with no credit rating); and
*   the proposal involves different rules for firms owned by a group of non-residents rather than a single foreign parent, which creates perceptions of unfairness.

26\. It should be noted that the _restricted transfer pricing rule_ we are recommending will address many, but not all, of submitters’ concerns because it is still a significant departure from using ordinary transfer pricing. Accordingly, we expect it will be more acceptable compared to the originally proposed interest rate cap because:

*   it allows for some limited flexibility – meaning the allowable interest rate can depart from the cost of funds facing the foreign parent if that is appropriate in the circumstances; and
*   it would be subject to the Mutual Agreement Procedure under New Zealand’s Double Tax Agreements, meaning taxpayers who consider that the new rule is inconsistent with the relevant treaty could seek resolution. This will address double taxation concerns. We do not, however, expect this will occur with any frequency because of the shift in the international consensus on what is acceptable in relation to the pricing of related-party debt.

#### Allowable debt levels in the thin capitalisation rules

27\. New Zealand has rules to prevent the excessive use of debt by foreign-owned entities operating in New Zealand (inbound investment) and New Zealand-owned entities with international operations (outbound investment). Interest deductions are denied to the extent that the entity’s debt level with reference to its assets is determined to be excessive.

28\. The March discussion document proposed changing this, so that a taxpayer’s maximum debt level is set with reference to the taxpayer’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities (that is, its liabilities other than its interest bearing debts). Some common examples of non-debt liabilities are accounts payable, reserves and provisions, and deferred tax liabilities.

29\. The core objectives of the thin capitalisation rules are better served with the non-debt liability adjustment. Under the current rules, where non-debt liabilities are ignored, companies are able to have high levels of debt (and therefore high interest deductions) relative to the capital invested in the company. The current treatment of non-debt liabilities also mean the rules apply unevenly across companies: companies with the same level of profit or loss can have very different thin capitalisation outcomes, depending on their non-debt liabilities.

30\. In addition, one of the objectives of the thin capitalisation rules (ensuring that a taxpayer is limited to a commercial level of debt) is undermined by the current treatment of non-debt liabilities. A third party lender, when assessing the credit worthiness of a borrower, would take into account its non-debt liabilities.

31\. Australia requires this same adjustment for non-debt liabilities.

##### Private sector consultation

32\. This proposal was accepted by some submitters but opposed by others who argued, for example, that the proposal amounts to a substantial reduction in the amount of deductible debt allowable under the thin capitalisation rules. Overall, this proposal was much less contentious than the interest rate cap.

33\. None of the submissions against the core proposal convinced us that the analysis above, suggesting that the non-debt liability adjustment is appropriate, is incorrect. Accordingly, we recommend that the proposed adjustment to the allowable debt level under the thin capitalisation rule proceed. That is, a taxpayer’s allowable debt level under the rules should be set with reference to their assets net of their non-debt liabilities.

34\. A near-universal comment from submitters was that certain non-debt liabilities – most significantly _deferred tax liabilities_ – should be carved out from the proposed non-debt liability adjustment. Deferred tax is an accounting concept. Accounting standards require that companies recognise deferred tax on their balance sheets in certain situations. In principle, a deferred tax liability is supposed to represent future tax payments that a taxpayer will be required to make. Submitters argued that this is often not the case – deferred tax liabilities are frequently technical accounting entries and do not reflect future tax obligations. Submitters also pointed to the rules in Australia, which do include a carve-out for deferred tax liabilities and assets.

35\. We recommend further consultation on whether deferred tax should be carved-out from this non-debt liability adjustment. Many, but not all, deferred tax liabilities represent a genuine requirement that tax on current accounting profits will be payable in the future. Given the concerns raised by submitters, further consultation on this technical detail would be beneficial.

#### Other changes

36\. We recommend five other changes to the thin capitalisation rules:

*   a special rule for infrastructure projects (such as public private partnerships) that are controlled by a single non-resident;
*   a de minimis for the inbound thin capitalisation rules;
*   reducing the ability for companies owned by a group of non-residents to use related-party debt;
*   removing the ability to use asset valuations for the thin capitalisation rules that differ from those reported in a firm’s financial accounts; and
*   removing the ability to measure assets and debts on the final day of a firm’s income year.

37\. These measures were all discussed in the March discussion document. Some were supported by submitters, while others were opposed. Where they were opposed, we are recommending changes to the proposals which will, in general, address submitters’ concerns.

##### Rule for infrastructure projects

38\. We recommend a special rule that allows all of a taxpayer’s third party debt to be deductible even if the debt levels exceed the normal thin capitalisation limits, provided the debt is non-recourse with interest funded solely from project income.

39\. This will allow a wider group of investors to participate in public-private partnerships without interest expense denial than has been possible previously.

40\. This rule was well received by submitters; however, some technical issues have been raised which we will consult further on.

##### De minimis for the inbound rules

41\. The thin capitalisation rules that apply to New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations (the outbound rules) has a de minimis (the rules do not apply if a taxpayer has interest deductions of less than $1 million). The thin capitalisation rules that apply to foreign-owned taxpayers (the inbound rules) do not have a similar de minimis.

42\. We recommend the current de minimis in the outbound rules be extended to taxpayers subject to the inbound rules, provided the taxpayer has only third party debt. This proposal is to reduce compliance costs for small foreign-owned entities that have a low risk of BEPS.

43\. This proposal was generally supported by submitters.

##### Allowable debt levels for companies owned by a group of non-residents

44\. At present, when an entity is controlled by a group of non-residents acting together, its allowable debt level is the greater of:

*   60 percent; and
*   110 percent of its third party debt.

45\. However, this means that a taxpayer with high levels of third party debt can be funded with almost no equity. For example, a project funded 90 percent with third party debt could have 9 percent shareholder debt and only 1 percent equity.

46\. To address this, we recommend changing this test so that, if an entity has a debt level in excess of 60 percent, the interest deductions on its related-party debt should be denied to the extent the entity’s debt level exceeded 60 percent. This proposal was generally accepted by submitters.

47\. The March discussion document proposed that this change be grandparented, as the rules it relates to (for non-residents acting together) have only just taken effect. We recommend that the precise design of this grandparenting be subject to further consultation with stakeholders, with decisions on its final design being delegated to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue.

##### Asset valuations

48\. In general, the thin capitalisation rules are based on the value of a company’s assets as reported in its financial statements. However, a company may use the net current value of an asset as an alternative to its financial statement value, provided that would be allowable under generally accepted accounting principles.

49\. While it is permissible to use an asset’s net current value, the thin capitalisation rules set out what is required if taxpayers utilise this option. Accordingly, we recommend that this new net current valuation option be available only if certain criteria are met – such as if the valuation is from an independent expert valuer.

### Agency consultation

50\. Inland Revenue and Treasury officials have consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment on this Cabinet paper.

### Financial implications, human rights, administrative impacts, legislative implications, and publicity

51\. These are set out in the accompanying covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (_Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting_).

### Impact Analysis Requirements

52\. Cabinet's Impact Analysis Requirements apply to these proposals and a Regulatory Impact Assessment is required. This has been prepared by Inland Revenue and is attached.

53\. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Regulatory Impact Assessment and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria.

### Recommendations

54\. We recommend that the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee:

1\. **Note** that in March this year the Government released a discussion document called _BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules_ which proposed some detailed measures to improve our ability to tax multinationals that operate in New Zealand.

2\. **Note** that in response to submissions we have made the proposed measures better targeted at the BEPS concerns without reducing their overall effectiveness.

3\. **Agree** that the interest rate on inbound related-party loans should be set using a _restricted transfer pricing_ rule, whereby the interest rate is set under transfer pricing but ignoring all surrounding circumstances, terms, and conditions that could result in an excessive interest rate unless similar terms apply to significant amounts of third party debt, and with the rebuttable presumption that the borrower would be supported by its foreign parent.

4\. **Agree** that a taxpayer’s allowable debt level in the thin capitalisation rules should be set with reference to its assets less its non-debt liabilities.

5\. **Agree** that the de minimis in the outbound thin capitalisation rules, which provides an exemption from the rules for groups with interest deductions of $1 million or less, be made available also to foreign-controlled taxpayers provided they have no owner-linked debt.

6\. **Agree** that an exemption should be provided from the thin capitalisation rules for certain infrastructure projects funded entirely with third party limited recourse loans.

7\. **Agree** that, when an entity is controlled by a group of non-residents acting together, interest deductions on any related-party debt should be denied to the extent the entity’s debt level exceeds 60 percent.

8\. **Agree** that clear legislative requirements be developed for when taxpayers choose to value their assets for thin capitalisation purposes on a basis other than that used in their financial accounts.

9\. **Agree** that an anti-avoidance rule should be inserted into the thin capitalisation rules, to apply when a taxpayer substantially repays a loan just before the end of the year.

10\. **Note** that the fiscal consequences of the above measures are set out in the covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (_Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting_).

11\. **Delegate** authority to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to make final decisions on the detailed design of the above measures.

12\. **Authorise** the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue jointly to take final decisions on the extent to which deferred tax liabilities are included in non-debt liabilities, up to a limit of reducing the level of expected revenue increases anticipated by the BEPS measures as set out in recommendation 7 in the accompanying Cabinet paper _Tax Measures To Prevent Base Erosion And Profit Shifting_ by up to $10 million per annum

13\. **Agree** that the results of the decisions in recommendations 3-12 be included in a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced to Parliament before the end of 2017.

www.ird.govt.nz Ref: 22OIA1352 15 November 2021 Dear Thank you for your request received on 15 October 2021 asking for information about the level of tax relief for COVID-impacted businesses. We have treated this as a request under the Official Information Act 1982 (the OIA). Inland Revenue’s approach to compliance The Commissioner of Inland Revenue is tasked with protecting the integrity of the tax system and collecting the highest net revenue over time. Our approach to compliance is multi-layered and based on our commitment to making it as easy as possible for customers to get it right from the start, and hard for them to get it wrong. We know most individuals and businesses want to do the right thing, and we want them to understand that if they get in touch with us when they are struggling, they will get the help they need. We also want the vast majority of New Zealanders who are making the effort to meet their tax obligations to know that we will identify the few who aren’t and take action. Uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in January/February 2020, many businesses have been struggling with the uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Inland Revenue’s statutory powers allow for decisions to consider a long-term approach to revenue collection, to collect the maximum revenue over time. Inland Revenue has relief options available for customers having trouble meeting their tax obligations. Some of these provisions were extended by the Government specifically for businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Relief options include extra time to pay through an instalment arrangement, extra time to file returns, and where appropriate, writing off tax, penalties or interest. Specific web pages to help customers understand what is available to them if impacted by COVID-19 events are available on our website. Some compliance activities were paused while we were in Alert Levels 3 and 4. During this time, we continued to address compliance risks where there is a risk to the integrity of the tax systems. This included dealing with companies that trade whilst insolvent and with little prospect of returning to a viable state. Responses to your specific questions are provided below. Ref: 22OIA1352 1. How many companies applied to IRD for financial relief citing COVID-19 impacts in 2020, and 2. How many companies have applied to IRD for financial relief citing COVID-19 impacts in 2021-to-date. For the purpose of answering your question, we have interpreted “financial relief” to relate to instalment arrangements, remission of late filing penalties, and/or penalty or interest write-off under the provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Our data does not show the reason for seeking relief in every instance and whether COVID was an underlying cause. However, the applications that specifically cited COVID-19 as the cause are as follows: Year Companies applied for more time to pay through an instalment arrangement Companies were granted relief from penalties and interest payments 2020 1,371 40,371 2021 (up to 27 October) 13,209 45,983 The significant increase in instalment arrangements in 2021 in comparison with 2020, is a reflection of Income Tax due dates. 3. How many companies did IRD apply to the courts to liquidate in 2020 due to unpaid tax, and 4. How many companies has IRD applied to the courts to liquidate in 2021-to- date due to unpaid tax. Supporting customers impacted by COVID-19 is a priority for Inland Revenue. During the lockdown periods in 2020, we focused on supporting customers, providing relief where appropriate and, therefore, deferred or delayed some audits, disputes and debt activities. This ultimately helps to maintain people’s voluntary compliance over time. We did progress fraud cases, court proceedings and voluntary disclosures that were important to maintaining the integrity of the tax system. As New Zealand returned to Alert Level 2 in 2020, Inland Revenue recommenced these deferred and delayed debt activities. In addition to the number of liquidation applications, I have also included the number of Liquidation Orders granted (companies liquidated), as many liquidation applications are resolved. Resolved includes where a debt is paid or settled in full or partially paid or written off. Ref: 22OIA1352 Publishing of OIA response Please note that Inland Revenue regularly publishes responses to requests that may be of interest to the wider public on its website. We consider this response is of public interest so will publish this response in due course. Your personal details or any information that would identify you will be removed prior to it being published. Thank you for your request. I trust that the information provided is of assistance to you. Yours sincerely Richard Philp Customer Segment Leader – Micro and not for profit business
Ref: 22OIA1274 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 15 October 2021 Dear Thank you for your request of 17 September 2021, made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA). You requested: 1. How many complaints about abuse of the wage subsidy has the IRD received since March 2020? 2. How many complaints were dealt with by the IRD and how many were assessed and sent to the MSD for investigation and/or prosecution? 3. In addition to the above, how many IRD staff were seconded to the MSD to work on checking wage subsidy payments and during which months? 4. Will those who received payments relating to the August / September 2021 lockdown from the IRD have to provide verifying evidence that they were eligible for the payments? The wage subsidy scheme (WSS) is administered by the Ministry of Social Development (MSD). MSD processes applications for the WSS and makes the payments. Applications for the WSS are verified against information held by Inland Revenue. Question 1: Number of complaints Inland Revenue has received since March 2020 about abuse of the WSS We have received 328 complaints about potential abuse of the WSS. Question 2: Number of complaints dealt with by Inland Revenue, and number of complaints sent to MSD for investigation and/or prosecution For 318 of the WSS complaints, we responded to the customer with an outcome of their complaint. We referred 10 of the complaints to MSD. Inland Revenue does not have information on the outcomes of any referrals made to MSD. We are therefore unable to determine how many of those complaints resulted in investigation or prosecution. This part of your request is refused under section 18(g) of the OIA, as Inland Revenue does not hold the information. Question 3: Number of Inland Revenue staff seconded to MSD to check WSS payments, and during which months Over the three-month period from late June 2021 to September 2021, nine Inland Revenue staff members were seconded to MSD. The seconded staff members assisted MSD in undertaking integrity reviews on a sample of wage subsidy payments from March 2020. This was in response to a recommendation Ref: 22OIA1274 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] by the Controller and Auditor-General’s review of the 2020 WSS. You can read about the review on the Office of the Controller and Auditor-General’s website at: oag.parliament.nz/media/2020/wage-subsidy This work was interrupted as a result of the most recent activation of the WSS. Secondments for four of the staff members ended on 24 September 2021. The secondments of the other five staff members have been extended until the end of November 2021 to continue this work. Question 4: If people who received payments from Inland Revenue regarding the August / September 2021 lockdown have to provide verifying evidence that they were eligible for the payments MSD processes applications for the wage subsidy and determines an applicant’s eligibility. Information on the application is verified against information held by Inland Revenue. This can be confirmation that a person is an employer, confirmation of how many employees an employer has, if a person is self-employed or a shareholder employee. You can find more details on Work and Income (part of MSD)’s website (workandincome.govt.nz) or at the link: What we check before approving a COVID-19 Wage Subsidy August 2021 application - Work and Income The web page above states that business information is validated with Inland Revenue before payments are made. The web page also sets out the serious consequences if an applicant provides false or misleading information, fails to meet any of the obligations for using the subsidy, or receives a subsidy that they are not entitled to. Rights of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz. Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz. Thank you for your request. Yours sincerely Richard Owen Customer Segment Leader
Ref: 22OIA1804 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 16 May 2022 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received 19 April 2022. You requested: The proportion of NZ Citizens and Residents who are net contributors\* vs net recipients\*\* of tax for the years 2000 – 2021. Please also supply this information broken down by age group, gender, income level and ethnicity. \*including GST, fuel, alcohol and other such taxable items – If data is not collected with this level of specificity, please supply the best figures relating to net tax contributors. \*\* including infrastructure, benefits etc. – if data is not collected with this level of specificity please supply the best figures relating to net tax recipients. Information refused Indirect taxes such as GST, fuel and alcohol excise are administered through third parties such as retailers and are not collated in a way that the tax paid is attributable to the person purchasing the item. Therefore, I have decided to refuse this part of your request under section 18(g) of the OIA as the information is not held by Inland Revenue, and we do not believe it is held by another agency. Attributable information on collective expenditures such as infrastructure, and on ethnicity is also not held by Inland Revenue and is also refused under section 18(g) of the OIA. Information released The information you have requested that can be released, is provided in the tables attached to this request. The tables partially respond to the request for the 1999-2000 to 2019-20 income years. Information for the 2020-21 income year is not available as tax returns are still being filed for that year, and the data will be incomparable with the previous year’s information. The released information relates to the net outcomes from personal income tax, taxable transfers, and Working for Families 1 Tax Credits. For the purposes of this release, net taxes and transfers have been defined as follows: Taxable income: Income from all sources taxable to the individual, which does not include amounts taxed in another entity such as a company or trust. Individual taxable income can include taxable transfers such as some welfare benefits 1 Previously Family Assistance Ref: 22OIA1804 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] or New Zealand superannuation. It does not include non-taxable transfers such as the accommodation supplement or the winter energy payment. It does not include any Working for Families received. If taxable income is negative (from a loss, for example), it is replaced with a zero. Tax: Tax on “taxable income” (as above) less rebates such as the donations tax credit, the housekeeper tax credit, the child tax credit, the independent earner tax credit, or the low-income tax credit. The offset from the rebates is capped, i.e., it cannot exceed the tax payable. Net tax: Tax (as above) less gross transfers. Combined transfers can be bigger than the tax, resulting in a negative net result, considered a “gain” from the tax/transfer system. If tax is larger than gross transfers, this counts as a “loss” from the tax/transfer system. Transfers: The transfers included in the above net tax calculation are below. Taxable transfers are marked with an asterisk: • Gross New Zealand superannuation\*. • Gross taxable welfare benefits\* (examples are Jobseeker and sole parent support). • Gross paid parental leave\*. • Gross student allowances\*. • Working for Families – previously Family Assistance. The entire family entitlement is attributed to the family’s nominated “principal caregiver”. Non-transfer income: For the requested income level distributions, we have supplied two sets of income tables; one using taxable income which includes taxable transfers, and one using “non-transfer income” which excludes these transfers. Denominator for the percentages The released tables all contain percentages, specifically the percentage of the measured population who “gain” from the taxes and benefits as described above. The measured population is defined as anybody who filed a tax return (even if this was a nil return), or received a tax square-up, or who had PAYE income (a wage/salary job or a taxable welfare benefit). This population numbers 2.9 million people in 1999-2000 and this gradually grew to 3.9 million people by 2017-18. The likelihood of receiving a tax square-up has changed over time, and from 2018-19 onwards included square-ups of tax on interest earned in bank accounts. This brought a large number of additional people – many of them children and net taxpayers on their small amount of interest earnings – into the measured population. The 2018-19 year hence represents a structural break in the requested series, and this is highlighted in the released tables. The volumes in that year were 4.3 million people. The measured population does not include people with no income unless they filed a tax return. It does include part-year cases. Further information on the released tables Table 1: Proportion by gender with a net gain from income tax and transfer system Inland Revenue does not collect information on gender, but inferences can be made from each person’s title (Mr, Mrs etc). Where a title is not gender-specific, the person has been randomly allocated. Table 2: Proportion of age group with a net gain from income tax and transfer system

### SUMMARY: PROBLEM AND PROPOSED APPROACH

### Problem Definition

#### What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required?

The problem the proposals discussed in this impact statement seek to address is the use of debt financing by taxpayers to reduce their New Zealand income tax liability significantly.

### Proposed Approach

#### How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option?

The adoption of a restricted transfer pricing rule for determining the allowable interest rate (for tax purposes) on related-party loans from a non-resident to a New Zealand borrower will help ensure interest rates on such loans cannot be excessive.

In addition, changing the way deductible debt levels are calculated under the thin capitalisation rules will ensure that taxpayers with little equity are unable to have large amounts of deductible debt.

These changes will provide a solution that is sustainable, efficient and equitable, while minimising impacts on compliance and administration costs.

### SECTION B: SUMMARY IMPACTS: BENEFITS AND COSTS

#### Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit?

The Government will benefit in that the new interest limitation rules are forecast to produce approximately $80–90 million per year on an ongoing basis.

There are also efficiency and fairness benefits to these proposals which cannot be assigned to particular beneficiaries.

#### Where do the costs fall?

The costs primarily fall on foreign-owned taxpayers operating in New Zealand (though there may be some minor impacts on New Zealand-owned taxpayers with international operations). Tax payments for affected parties are forecast to increase by approximately  
$80–90 million per year on an ongoing basis.

#### What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated?

As with all tax rules, there is some risk of taxpayer non-compliance. However, this is mitigated as the rules predominately apply to large companies – and the tax affairs of large companies are closely monitored by Inland Revenue.

#### Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’.

There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’.

### SECTION C: EVIDENCE CERTAINTY AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

#### Agency rating of evidence certainty?

There is moderate evidence in relation to the problem of excessive interest rates on related-party debt, and good evidence in relation to allowable debt levels. Inland Revenue has some data on interest rates paid on related-party debts, as well as examples of structures that appear to have the effect of increasing the interest rate on such debt. However, this data is not comprehensive.

Inland Revenue has data on the debt, asset and equity levels of significant foreign-owned enterprises, which allows an accurate estimation of the impact of the non-debt liability adjustment for those firms.

### IMPACT STATEMENT: BEPS – STRENGTHENING OUR INTEREST LIMITATION RULES

* * *

### SECTION 1: GENERAL INFORMATION

* * *

### Purpose

Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with policy changes to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet.

### Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis

#### Evidence of the problem

While good evidence of base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) is generally difficult to come by, there is an exception for BEPS in relation to interest payments. Fairly good data on interest deductions (especially for large firms) is available for analysis through Inland Revenue’s International Questionnaire. This dataset includes debt levels, related-party debt levels, and related-party interest payments of large foreign-owned firms.

However, there are still limitations to that data – for example, data on interest rates on related-party debt (and the interest rates facing a New Zealand subsidiary’s parent company) is not captured in the Questionnaire. Where possible, this information was obtained from other sources (such as credit ratings of parent companies and disclosed related-party interest rates in financial statements) or estimated (for example, estimating interest rates based on related-party interest payments and related-party debt amounts). However, this other data is less comprehensive and accurate.

#### Consultation

The preferred option in relation to limiting interest rates on related-party interest rates has not been subject to consultation. This was because it was developed in response to submissions on the original proposals. However, it is similar in many respects to the original proposal, which was subject to consultation. In addition, to ensure the rule operates effectively and to mitigate the risk of unintended outcomes, it will be subject to consultation with submitters on the technical detail.

### SECTION 2: PROBLEM DEFINITION AND OBJECTIVES

* * *

### 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed?

#### BEPS

BEPS refers to tax planning strategies used by some multinational enterprises (MNEs) to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This outcome is achieved by exploiting gaps and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules to avoid tax. BEPS strategies distort investment decisions, allow multinationals to benefit from unintended competitive advantages over MNEs not engaged in BEPS and domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens’ trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole.

In October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its final package of 15 recommended tax measures for countries to implement to counter BEPS.

#### BEPS using interest deductions

The use of debt financing is one of the simplest ways of shifting taxable profits from one jurisdiction to another. For example, because interest payments are deductible, a related- party cross-border loan from a parent to a subsidiary can be used to reduce taxes payable in the jurisdiction that the subsidiary is located.

#### New Zealand’s BEPS work

The New Zealand Government has signalled a willingness to address BEPS issues and has taken tangible action in this regard. New Zealand is a supporter of the OECD/G20 BEPS project to address international tax avoidance and is advancing a number of measures that are OECD/G20 BEPS recommendations. This includes developing best-practice rules to limit BEPS using interest deductions (BEPS Action 4).

If no further action is taken, MNEs that currently have high levels of debt in New Zealand, or highly-priced related-party debt, will be able to continue paying little tax in New Zealand. There is also a risk that additional MNEs would adopt similar structures.

### 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place?

#### New Zealand’s tax system

New Zealand has a broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) taxation framework. This means that tax bases are broad and tax rates are kept as low as possible while remaining consistent with the Government’s distributional objectives. The BBLR framework also means that the tax system is not generally used to deliver incentives or encourage particular behaviours.

New Zealand’s tax system has been the subject of numerous broad-based reviews – most recently the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group in 2010. It is well regarded and generally functions well.

No other government agencies have a direct interest in the tax system. However, a good tax system is important for a well-functioning economy – many government agencies therefore have an indirect interest in the tax system.

Foreign investment in New Zealand is generally taxed under our company tax at 28 percent. New Zealand’s tax system has rules that limit the deductible debt levels and interest rates for taxpayers with foreign connections. These rules affect only foreign-owned New Zealand taxpayers, and New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations. The impacted population is therefore predominately large companies.

#### Thin capitalisation rules

New Zealand has “thin capitalisation” rules to limit tax deductions for interests that non- residents are allowed. These rules generally require an investment owned by a non-resident to have a debt-to-asset ratio of no more than 60 percent (interest deductions are denied to the extent the allowable debt-to-asset ratio is exceeded).

Thin capitalisation rules also apply to New Zealand-owned firms (frequently referred to as the “outbound thin capitalisation rules”). These rules generally require a debt-to-asset ratio of no more than 75 percent. They are designed to prevent a disproportionate portion of a New Zealand company’s debt being placed in New Zealand.

Like the tax system as a whole, we consider that the thin capitalisation rules are serving us well. The rules are well understood and taxpayers subject to the rules generally have conservative debt levels and, for those with related-party debt, the debt is at conservative interest rates – as evidenced by the significant amount of tax paid by foreign-owned firms operating in New Zealand (foreign controlled firms paid 39 percent of company tax in the 2015 tax year).

#### Transfer pricing rules

It is important to limit not just the quantum of debt in New Zealand, but also the interest rate on that debt. For third-party debt, commercial pressures will drive the borrower to obtain as low an interest rate as possible. However, these pressures do not necessarily exist in a related-party context. A rule to constrain the interest rate of such debt is necessary. Transfer pricing rules provide the current constraint on interest rates. Broadly speaking (and as they apply to related-party debt), these rules seek to ensure that the interest rate on a given loan contract is in line with what would have been agreed between unrelated parties.

#### NRWT

While payments of interest to related parties are deductible, they are subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). NRWT applies at either 15 percent or 10 percent, depending on whether New Zealand has a Double Taxation Treaty with the interest recipient’s home jurisdiction. This means that, while the use of debt can reduce tax payable in New Zealand, it does not completely eliminate it.

### 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity?

A simple way that non-residents can reduce their New Zealand tax liability significantly is by capitalising a New Zealand investment with debt instead of equity, because they can then take interest deductions in New Zealand. This is shown in the example below.

_**Example**_

_Australian investor A puts $100m of capital in a New Zealand company as equity. Company earns $10m from sales and pays $2.8m New Zealand tax. Company pays a net dividend (not tax deductible) of $7.2m to A. Total New Zealand tax is $2.8m._

_Australian investor B puts $100m of capital into a New Zealand company as debt, with an interest rate of 10%. Company earns $10m from sales but has to pay $10m of tax-deductible interest to B, reducing taxable income to $0. No tax is paid by the company, but a 10% tax on interest is imposed on B (non-resident withholding tax). Total New Zealand tax is $1m._

Having a generally well regarded tax system does not mean that tax changes are unnecessary. An on-going policy challenge is to ensure that our tax rules are up to date and ensure that MNEs are paying a fair amount of tax in New Zealand. Base protection measures – such as rules for limiting the amount of debt allowable in New Zealand, and the interest rate on that debt – are therefore important.

At the same time, it is important that New Zealand continues to be a good place to base a business and that tax does not get in the way of this happening. New Zealand relies heavily on foreign direct investment to fund domestic investment and, as such, the Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand remains an attractive place for non-residents to invest.

This impact statement considers two related policy opportunities:

*   ensuring the rules for setting the allowable interest rates on related-party debt are sufficiently robust; and
*   ensuring the basis for setting the allowable debt level in the thin capitalisation rules is appropriate.

#### Scale of the problem

The OECD’s _Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting_ (BEPS Action Plan) included developing best-practice rules to limit BEPS using interest deductions (BEPS Action 4). We consider the fact that the OECD has included profit shifting using interest in its BEPS Action Plan as evidence that this is a significant policy issue internationally.

As mentioned above, most MNEs operating here have relatively low levels of debt and do not have interest rates considered to be excessive. However, there are a small number of taxpayers with either debt levels that are too high, or interest rates that are excessive. While small in number, the fiscal impact of these arrangements is significant – we estimate the tax revenue lost is $80–90 million per year.

### 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making?

There are no constraints on scope.

### 2.5 What do stakeholders think?

#### Stakeholders

The stakeholders are primarily taxpayers (in particular, MNEs) and tax advisors. The proposed rules will be applied to taxpayers’ affairs, while tax advisors will assist (taxpayer) clients as to the application of the proposed rules.

#### Consultation already undertaken

In March 2017, the Government released the discussion document _BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules_. The discussion document consulted on two key proposals which are considered in this impact statement – new interest limitation rules and a non-debt liabilities adjustment to the thin capitalisation rules.

The Government received 27 submissions on the discussion document. Most submitters were stakeholder groups, tax advisors, and foreign-owned firms that would be affected by the proposals.

In general, submitters acknowledged the need to respond to BEPS risks facing New Zealand, and that part of this would involve strengthening New Zealand’s rules for limiting interest deductions for firms with cross-border related-party debt. However, many submitters did not support the specific proposals put forward.

The Treasury has been heavily involved with the policy development process in their joint role with Inland Revenue as tax policy advisors for the Government.

##### Interest limitation

The discussion document proposed moving away from a transfer pricing approach for pricing inbound related-party loans. Instead, the allowable interest rate for such a loan would – in most instances – be set with reference to the New Zealand borrower’s parent’s borrowing costs (referred to as an “interest rate cap”).

General reaction

Most submitters argued that the interest rate cap proposal was not necessary and should not proceed. They noted that the Government, in the discussion document _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_, proposed to strengthen the transfer pricing rules generally. Submitters wrote that these strengthened rules should be sufficient to address any concerns about interest rates.

Submitters expressed concern about the proposed interest rate cap for a number of reasons, including that it:

*   is inconsistent with the arm’s length standard, so would result in double taxation;
*   will increase compliance costs;
*   will apply to firms with a low BEPS risk; and
*   has no international precedent.

Only two submitters wrote in favour of the proposed cap. However, the proposal did attract positive comments from knowledgeable parties that did not put in a formal submission. Michael Littlewood, a professor of tax at Auckland University, has said that the Government is right to seek to limit interest rates on related-party debts.

Richard Vann, a professor of tax at the University of Sydney, has made similar remarks – “transfer pricing has not proved up to the task of dealing with interest rates, so it is necessary to come up with clearer and simpler rules”.

##### Allowable debt levels

The thin capitalisation rules limit the amount of debt a taxpayer can claim interest deductions on in New Zealand (“deductible debt”). Currently, the maximum amount of deductible debt is set with reference to the value of the taxpayer’s assets (generally, debt up to 60 percent of the taxpayer’s assets is allowable).

The discussion document proposed changing this, so that a taxpayer’s maximum debt level is set with reference to the taxpayer’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities (that is, its liabilities other than its interest-bearing debts (a “non-debt liability adjustment”). Some common examples of non-debt liabilities are accounts payable, reserves and provisions, and deferred tax liabilities.

General reaction

Several submitters indicated they supported the proposal in principle and understood the need for this change, raising only technical design issues (particularly relating to deferred tax).

A number of other submitters argued that the proposal should not go ahead. They submitted that the proposed change would introduce volatility to taxpayers’ thin capitalisation calculations and is not relevant to BEPS. They also wrote that the proposed exclusion of non-debt liabilities from assets would amount to a material reduction in the existing 60 percent safe harbour threshold.

Stakeholders’ views displayed no clear pattern. Two big accounting firms agreed with the proposal while two others disagreed. Similarly, of the three major stakeholder groups who submitted on the proposal, one supported and two opposed the change.

Deferred tax

To remove the mismatch between income tax calculated on taxable profits and income tax calculated on profits recognised for accounting purposes, deferred tax balances are recognised in financial statements. As such, a taxpayer’s non-debt liabilities could include “deferred tax liabilities”, which arise when accounting profits are greater than profits for tax purposes. Similarly, a taxpayer’s assets could include “deferred tax assets” which arise when profit for tax purposes is greater than accounting profit.

All submitters that commented on this proposal were of the view that, for the purposes of the non-debt liability adjustment, deferred tax liabilities should be ignored. Submitters also wrote that deferred tax assets should be excluded from assets. That is, a taxpayer’s assets for thin capitalisation purposes would be: (assets – deferred tax assets) – (non-debt liabilities – deferred tax liabilities).

Submitters noted that Australia’s thin capitalisation rules feature this adjustment for deferred tax. They argued that our rules should feature a similar adjustment because:

*   often deferred tax does not represent a real cash liability the company has to pay in the future;
*   deferred tax balances are ignored when third-parties (including third-party lenders) are assessing the financial position of an entity; and
*   deferred tax balances can be volatile – taxpayer thin capitalisation levels could become volatile without excluding them.

#### Further consultation

Following Cabinet decisions in July 2017, officials are planning to undertake further public consultation on outstanding policy issues, technical design details and an exposure draft of selected parts of the planned BEPS bill.

### SECTION 3: OPTIONS IDENTIFICATION

* * *

### 3.1 What options are available to address the problem?

#### Related-party interest rates

We have identified five mutually exclusive options to the address the problem of excessive interest rates on related-party debts.

Option 4 (administrative guidance) is a non-regulatory option. The other options for change involve changing New Zealand’s tax legislation.

##### Option 1: Interest rate cap (discussion document proposal)

As described in section 2.5.

##### Option 2: Restricted transfer pricing

Under a restricted transfer pricing approach, inbound related-party loans would be priced following the standard transfer pricing methodology. However, it would contain two additional elements to clarify that:

*   There is a rebuttable presumption that the New Zealand subsidiary would be supported by its foreign parent; and
*   All circumstances, terms, and conditions that could result in an excessive interest rate will be required to be ignored – unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that they have third-party debt featuring those terms and conditions. The types of modifications to the terms, conditions and surrounding circumstances we would seek to make under this approach are:
    *   That the loan has no exotic terms that are generally not seen with third-party lending
    *   That the loan is not subordinated
    *   That the loan duration is not excessive
    *   That the debt level of the borrower is not excessive.

The combined effect of these additional elements is that the interest rate on related-party debt will generally be in line with the interest rate facing the New Zealand borrower’s foreign parent.

This restricted transfer pricing rule would be coupled with a safe harbour, which would be based on the interest rate cap as initially proposed. This could be provided administratively. A related-party loan with an interest rate consistent with the interest rate cap would automatically be considered acceptable.

This option was developed following consultation to address some of the concerns raised by submitters; however, it has not itself been subject to consultation.

##### Option 3: Adopt EBITDA-based rule (OECD recommended approach)

This option would involve limiting the amount of interest deductions a taxpayer is allowed with reference to their earnings (specifically, their profits before deductions for interest, depreciation and amortisation are taken into account, also known as their EBITDA). This new approach would completely replace the thin capitalisation rules, becoming the new method for limiting interest deductions for taxpayers with international connections.

This approach would constrain the tax effectiveness of highly priced debt, since it directly limits interest deductions rather than limiting the amount of debt; a taxpayer with highly priced debt would be more likely to exceed their EBITDA limit and face interest denial.

Almost all submitters did not support the adoption of an EBITDA-based rule.

##### Option 4: Administrative guidance

This option would involve Inland Revenue issuing administrative guidance on how it will assess the risk of related-party lending transactions – similar to what has recently been released by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) (discussed below).

Under this option, related-party loans with certain features (such as having an interest rate in line with the interest rate facing the borrower’s foreign parent) would be given a low risk rating and be unlikely to be challenged by Inland Revenue. Taxpayers with higher interest rates would be more likely to have their related-party loan investigated.

Several submitters suggested this option be adopted in place of the interest rate cap. They argued that it would provide certainty for taxpayers who desired it, but taxpayers who value certainty less would be free to breach the guidelines.

##### Option 5: Status quo (ordinary transfer pricing)

This option would involve continuing to price related-party debt under the transfer pricing rules. As discussed above, the Government proposed strengthening these rules in the discussion document _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_. Many submitters argued that this should be sufficient to address any concerns over related- party interest rates.

##### Relevant experience from other countries

The ATO has released draft guidelines regarding the interest rates of cross-border related- party loans.[\[1\]](#footnote1)
 These guidelines are designed to encourage Australian subsidiaries of multinational companies to restructure their related-party loans into ordinary “vanilla” loans. Overall, the guidelines have a clear expectation that the interest rate on related-party loans should be in line with the foreign parent’s cost of funds:

> “Generally, the ATO expects any pricing of a related-party debt to be in line with the commercial incentive of achieving the lowest possible ‘all-in’ cost to the borrower. The ATO expects, in most cases, the cost of the financing to align with the costs that could be achieved, on an arm’s length basis, by the parent of the global group to which the borrower and lender both belong.”

#### Allowable debt levels

We have identified three mutually exclusive options relating to setting the allowable debt level under the thin capitalisation rules.

The options (other than the status quo) involve changing New Zealand’s tax legislation.

##### Option 1: Proceed with non-debt liabilities adjustment (as proposed in the discussion document)

As described in section 2.5.

##### Option 2: Proceed with non-debt liabilities proposal excluding deferred tax

Under this option, a taxpayer’s deferred tax would be ignored for the purposes of the non- debt liability adjustment. That is, a taxpayer’s allowable debt level would be set with reference to the result of the formula: (assets – deferred tax assets) – (non-debt liabilities – deferred tax liabilities).

Of submitters who supported the proposed non-debt liability adjustment in principle, this was the preferred option.

##### Option 3: Status quo (do not proceed with non-debt liabilities adjustment)

Under this option, maximum deductible debt levels would continue to be calculated under the thin capitalisation rules with reference to assets, ignoring non-debt liabilities.

As mentioned in section 2.5, this was the preferred option of some submitters.

##### Relevant experience from other countries

Australia has thin capitalisation rules that are broadly similar to New Zealand’s. Australia’s rules currently require a non-debt liability adjustment, but deferred tax is carved-out. That is, Australia’s rules are consistent with option 2.

### 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration?

The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals. This framework is consistent with the Government’s vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria:

*   _Efficiency and neutrality_ – the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible;
*   _Fairness and equity_ – similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way;
*   _Efficiency of compliance_ – compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible;
*   _Efficiency of administration_ – administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible; and
*   _Sustainability_ – the potential for tax evasion and avoidance should be minimised while keeping counteracting measures proportionate to risks involved

Efficiency, fairness and sustainability are the most important criteria. It is generally worth trading-off increased compliance costs or administration costs for gains in these three criteria.

### 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why?

No options were ruled out of scope.

### SECTION 5: CONCLUSIONS

* * *

### 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits?

#### Interest limitation

We consider that option 2 – developing a restricted transfer pricing approach – is the best option to limit interest expenses in relation to inbound related-party debt.

Following consultation and further analysis, we consider that if the Government pursued the interest rate cap (option 1), adjustments would be needed to the original discussion document proposal which would make it more complex. For example, to address some of the concerns expressed by submitters, a different or modified rule may need to be applied to firms with low levels of debt. The result of these adjustments would be that different rules would apply to taxpayers in different situations (more so than originally proposed). Such differences create perceptions of unfairness, and give rise to boundaries that can be difficult to formulate, administer and comply with. At the margins they may give rise to behaviours that are inefficient – especially as taxpayers try to arrange their circumstances to fall within certain boundaries.

The difficulty is, however, that simply relying on transfer pricing, as suggested by some submitters, will not achieve the desired policy outcomes. It is clear that the international consensus (as reflected in the OECD recommendation for countries to adopt an arbitrary formulaic approach (EBITDA)) is to move away from using ordinary transfer pricing to limit the interest rates on related-party debt. In addition, as noted in section 2.5, commentators have said that ordinary transfer pricing is unsuited to pricing related-party financing transactions.

Accordingly, we consider that the restricted transfer pricing rule is the best approach. Like the interest rate cap, it will ensure the policy objective – ensuring there is a robust mechanism for determining the interest rates for inbound related-party debt; however, since the restricted transfer pricing rule has more flexibility (compared to the interest rate cap – the other option that would most effectively achieve the policy objective) it is both more efficient and fairer.

Owing to the time available (and since it was developed subsequent to the initial consultation), this option has not been subject to consultation with stakeholders. This modification will address many, but not all of, submitters’ concerns – it is still a departure from using ordinary transfer pricing. Nevertheless, we expect that it will be more acceptable compared to the originally proposed interest rate cap because:

*   it allows for some limited flexibility – meaning the allowable interest rate can depart from the cost of funds facing the foreign parent if that is appropriate in the circumstances; and
*   it would be subject to the Mutual Agreement Procedure under New Zealand’s Double Tax Agreements, meaning taxpayers who consider that the new rule is inconsistent with the relevant treaty could seek resolution. This will address double taxation concerns. We do not, however, expect this will occur frequently because of the shift in the international consensus on what is acceptable in relation to the pricing of related party debt.

#### Allowable debt levels

At this stage, we do not have a preference between option 1 (non-debt liability adjustment as originally proposed) and option 2 (non-debt liability adjustment with deferred tax carve- out). Option 3 (status quo) is not preferred.

Both options 1 and 2 have similar impacts in terms of efficiency and fairness (and have no significant impacts in terms of compliance and administration costs). The non-debt liability adjustment in option 1 is potentially too extensive because of the inclusion of all types of deferred tax, but, on the other hand, the adjustment in option 2 is too narrow because of the exclusion of all deferred tax.

We consider that the best approach is to recommend neither options 1 or 2 at this stage, but instead consult further with stakeholders on whether there is another feasible option (since this is a minor technical detail, more consultation on this matter is feasible). For example, it might be possible to identify deferred tax liabilities that are the least likely to result in a future tax payment, and restrict the carve-out of deferred tax to just that identified group.

### 5.3 What other impacts is this approach likely to have?

As discussed above, allowing BEPS through interest deductions is inefficient and unfair, as it results in uneven tax burdens across different businesses. This is an issue in itself, but it may also weaken taxpayer morale. The perception of unfairness that comes from the reported low corporate taxes paid by taxpayers who can take use interest deductions to reduce their New Zealand (and possibly worldwide) tax liability is an important issue. This perception of unfairness undermines public confidence in the tax system and therefore the willingness of taxpayers to voluntarily comply with their own tax obligations. This integrity factor is difficult to assign to a particular set of stakeholders. It is something that is fundamental to the tax system itself, which all of the stakeholders already discussed have an interest in preserving.

### 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’?

Yes.

* * *

### SECTION 6: IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION

* * *

### 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice?

Implementation of both reforms (relating to related-party interest rates and allowable debt level) will be given effect through a combination of legislation and Inland Revenue administrative guidance. The legislative changes proposed will be progressed (subject to Cabinet approval) as part of a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced in late 2017. The bill, when introduced, will be accompanied by commentary in order to provide stakeholders with guidance as to the intended application of the provisions. Inland Revenue will also produce guidance on the enacted legislation in its Tax Information Bulletin.

In relation to the allowable debt level proposal, we will consult further with stakeholders on whether a preferred option can be identified. The Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue will make the final decision on which option should be progressed (option 1, option 2, or a potential new option) following this consultation.

These reforms are expected to apply from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018, subject to legislation progressing to enactment before this date.

Some submitters on the discussion document argued that transitional relief or grandparenting should be provided to give taxpayers sufficient lead-in time to restructure their affairs if necessary. We consider that the planned application date of 1 July 2018 is sufficiently prospective because:

*   the interest rate proposal applies only to related-party transactions (which are more easily altered compared to transactions with third-parties); and
*   in relation to the allowable debt level proposal, debt and asset levels under the thin capitalisation rules can be measured as at the end of the relevant income year, meaning taxpayers would have until at least 30 June 2019 to rearrange their affairs.

In addition, in response to consultation, we propose that advanced pricing agreements

(APAs) existing prior to the application date of these changes will be grandparented.

Once the proposals are implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for the ongoing operation and enforcement of the new rules. Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement these reforms.

### 6.2 What are the implementation risks?

There is the risk that the relevant transfer pricing legislation could contain unintended errors or have unintended consequences. However, this risk can be efficiently managed by way of remedial amendments.

* * *

### SECTION 7: MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW

* * *

### 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored?

In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of tax changes would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995.

Existing investigations functions for monitoring the behaviour of taxpayers will continue to be used for the proposed rules of this regulatory proposal. Inland Revenue closely monitors the tax affairs of New Zealand’s largest companies (which are, in general, the affected population of these proposals). For example, Inland Revenue currently collects data from these firms on their debt levels (including levels of related-party debt) through its International Questionnaire. This will allow how the proposals have impacted debt levels and related-party interest payments to be analysed.

More generally, Inland Revenue is considering the appropriate level of information that should be collected to support the proposed rules for all the BEPS measures being implemented. Any additional information may be collected via a disclosure statement that must be provided to Inland Revenue or it may be collected using existing information gathering tools.

### 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed?

The final step in the GTTP involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. In practice, following enactment, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect could either be included as remedial amendments in future tax bills, or if they involve more complex issues could be added to the tax policy work programme. Further consultation would be implicit in this approach.

If it became apparent that an aspect of the proposed rules is unworkable, or if the rules have created unintended consequences whether tax-related or otherwise, this would justify a review of all or part of the legislation.

Our Enterprise Strategy is central to shaping the approach to AI. This strategy revolves around four key elements: our people, the driving force behind our operations; our customers, who guide our operational focus; supporting the Crown to be a better Treaty partner, promoting equitable services across Aotearoa New Zealand; and maintaining the integrity of the tax and social policy system, our underlying cornerstone. AI holds the potential to strengthen these pillars by streamlining processes, anticipating risks, and optimising public service delivery. However, as AI innovations and data flow escalate, stewardship becomes more critical. Falling behind in this rapidly evolving field could jeopardise our ability to effectively maintain our services. It's also crucial that te ao Māori principles are deeply woven into our strategy. By aligning AI with our objectives, we can strive towards promoting ‘Oranga' via cross- government cooperation, robust social policy, and revenue generation. This combined strategic precision and deepened operational understanding could significantly elevate our performance. •We have leveraged technology for outcome improvement and efficiency gains throughout our history. While AI technologies are emerging and advancing quickly, they are simply the next tool for us to leverage to empower our people to further the interests and improve the delivery to our customers and New Zealanders as a whole. •Combining Artificial Intelligence (AI) with our service delivery can optimise resource utilisation and streamline operations. This would enhance result-oriented decision-making in Aotearoa New Zealand by leveraging machine learning models for accurate tax prediction and ensuring effective resource allocation. AI can also facilitate continuous innovative solutions that improve service delivery. •Fostering an AI-enabled ecosystem can promote stewardship by improving adaptability and safeguarding existing systems. Predictive analytics offer the ability to proactively adjust to future customer trends. Coupled with AI-enhanced cybersecurity, this would bolster legislative, asset, and resource integrity. Additionally, implementing AI-oriented training programs would ensure the workforce evolves in line with technological advancements. •Embracing shared AI platforms amongst public services can heighten the broader contribution of IR to New Zealand. Through rapid processing of cross-departmental data, AI can enable generation of holistic insights and innovative solutions. Moreover, the automation capabilities of AI can foster partnerships with other agencies to improve the efficiency and quality of public services.

This involves emphasising strategic alignment and innovation while observing a cautious approach towards risks. AI technology has a critical role in propelling the development of enterprise and refining various strategies rather than functioning on its own, with notable impacts on managing brand reputation and enhancing customer communication quality.

Indeed, any related regulatory failures could jeopardise the integrity of the tax system. To avoid undermining public confidence and operational stability, careful planning of AI initiatives is key to ensure they enhance, rather than detract from, our efficiency and capability \[1\]. •With a potential for AI initiatives to become costly diversions, there's a clear risk of straining our resources without delivering the promised benefits. Thorough planning, strategic allocation of resources, and prudent execution can help manage this risk and ensure meaningful return on investment. •To navigate societal implications, it's pivotal for us to anticipate possible disruptions, continually assess societal responses, and create an inclusive communication strategy to engender trust and promote understanding among stakeholders. Our Customers •Value Drivers: We aim to leverage AI to enhance efficiency, decision-making, and service delivery, refocusing our resources on higher-value innovations for improved customer outcomes. •Te Ao Māori: We seek to ensure that data sovereignty principles underpin all AI initiatives, recognising Tangata whenua as kaitiaki (guardians) of their own data and fostering oranga (health and well-being) through equitable tax processes. •Inclusivity & Diversity: Ensuring our AI strategy at Inland Revenue prioritises accessibility and inclusiveness for all our customers and workforce is key in delivering a diverse, equitable, and representative service that aligns with the principle of manaakitanga in Te Pou o Te Tangata.

We c ould explore opportunities to inc orporate mātauranga Māori in AI systems through sustained community engagement. •Many AI applications require data to be stored in overseas data centers, which may conflict with principles of indigenous data sovereignty whereby Māori have the intrinsic right to control over their own data. Similarly, many Māori communities have expressed concern over the use of their language data to train Large Language Models for generative tasks without their consent, when they should be active decision-makers in the process \[1\]. •Potential for AI initiatives to perpetuate further harm, if insufficient consideration is given to te ao Māori. Particularly, care is needed to ensure that further bias is not encoded in AI models through the use of imbalanced datasets, and that generative AI tools do not misrepresent reo and tikanga in its outputs. Preventative steps should be communicated to the public.

This will avoid any adoption pains and optimise the efficiency gains of implementing AI within IR. •If organisational culture is neglected as we pivot towards higher use of AI, staff may become disillusioned with the power of AI to enhance their day-to-day work, or we may not see sufficient adoption in the first place. This risk of employee dissatisfaction can be mitigated by a well-thought-out change management plan. •The adoption of AI may cause concern for our staff and associated unions, as role descriptions have the potential to change. Entry level roles are poised to change the most, with internal training pathways also shifting in focus. We will need to carefully consider this risk as the organisation continues on its journey with AI. Te Tiriti S T R A T E G I C C O N T E X T Ensuring we support the Crown to deliver on our commitments to Māori under te Tiriti o Waitangi. In the context of AI, this aligns with commitments made as a signatory to the Algorithm Charter. We aim to move c los er to our as pirations of improving oranga by bec oming te T iriti- bas ed, es tablishing this c ons ideration as a c ruc ial foundation for our approac h to A I . •The key principles of te tiriti are highly relevant when implementing AI initiatives. The protection of Māori interests and prevention of future harm should be front of mind, alongside the incorporation of mātauranga Māori in all initiatives. This is supported by strong partnership with Māori, and a willingness to prioritise participation and engagement with tangata whenua. Many Māori researchers are already involved in determining how AI can be made mana- enhancing and beneficial for Māori, and several academic workshops have been held across the country \[1\]. These efforts have been supported by Te Hiku Media, among others. These organisations are partnering to implement AI-enabled linguistic resources for te reo Māori, in collaboration with local iwi \[2\]. This ongoing initiative has received government funding \[3\] and provides a practical example of how effective partnership, underpinned by te Tiriti, can provide beneficial outcomes for Māori. •When planning an AI initiative, the three voices framework can help with the synthesis of information from different knowledge sources across complex systems. Specifically, the voice of intent (legislation), voice of expertise (research) and voice of experience (community perspective) all come together to form a holistic view of how collective benefit can be derived for all involved \[4\].

There is an opportunity to engage with iwi Māori to raise awareness on the potential benefits of using AI for tax purposes, as well as to foster collaborative co-design, agreeing on system parameters of relevant AI tools and creating space in which mātauranga Māori can be shared. •Potential for tangata whenua to have a low appetite to engage with customer-facing AI solutions, due to a perception that AI will impact their right to control how services are delivered to them and how their information is utilised. This highlights the importance of transparency of AI tools and accountability, ensuring the AI tools are seen as trustworthy by both the organisation and the community. •There is a risk that, if partnership with Māori is seen as a one-time engagement process, the full benefit of our AI initiatives may not be derived for Māori communities. Instead, collaboration with tangata whenua should be seen as a foundational element of our AI framework that will enable its broader success. As AI tools continue to evolve, the connections to Te Tiriti will also change and need to be considered on an ongoing basis. Specifically, fairness and transparency should be prioritised to foster equitable outcomes and align with the associated equity principle of te Tiriti. Training & Fluency S T R A T E G I C C O N T E X T Cement AI fluency within our organisation to prepare for the future of work. We are committed to ensuring that the organisation has access to the right capabilities and personnel as work in the tax sector evolves.

This involves effective risk management against malicious actors and bias, maintaining the integrity of the tax system, and ensuring rigorous testing and explainability of AI models. The credibility and trustworthiness of the AI system is crucial, hence, security, anonymity regarding Personal Identifiable Information (PII), and an absence of bias in practice are paramount. Also, engaging experts and improving knowledge, especially among decision-makers, on ethics and data governance is essential to avoid potential public relations issues related to AI use. Interviewees: James, Cate, Anil, Tina, Lisa. •We have the opportunity to introduce guardrails embedding Trustworthy AI principles early in AI journey, ensuring AI systems are responsible, reliable, fair and transparent. •Responsible: Create and operate the technology in a socially responsible manner, with clear accountability of who is responsible for decisions made using AI systems. •Robust & Reliable: Confirm that AI functions properly beyond pilot stage, producing consistently accurate, relevant outputs. •Fair: Guard against illegal and unethical discrimination, ensuring equitable treatment of all. •Transparent: Help users (IR employees / the public) understand how their data can be used and how AI systems make decisions. Most organisations are still grappling with the risks associated with traditional AI, and Generative AI brings renewed attention to these. We should seek a balanced view of value creation opportunities with risks involved. Examples include: ▪Generation of misleading or false content, potentially causing confusion or harm to users who blindly rely on the generated output – e.g. our employees using Generative AI knowledge tools without proper training. ▪Users may not be aware that specific IR content was machine-generated. We must communicate how the system works and build transparency and trust. ▪Bias in the underlying data is a risk that can be amplified when AI models are trained on them – e.g. public-facing AI assistant less able to answer questions from certain socio-economic groups due to lack of past examples, perpetuating barriers to use. Secure & Confidential S T R A T E G I C C O N T E X T To maintain trust and confidence, it is paramount in today's data-driven landscape to ensure the security and confidentiality of AI. It is important to implement robust measures to safeguard sensitive information and protect against risks, including data breaches, that may cause physical and/or digital harm. Privacy must also be respected, and consumer and employee data should not be used beyond its intended and stated use. This is also consistent with our Effective and Efficient role – as set out in the Enterprise Strategy, we have a responsibility to use our knowledge, resources and capabilities wisely. •There is increased guidance from the Privacy C ommissioner on Artificial Intelligence and the Information Privacy Principles \[1\]. These may provide a useful starting place in understanding our security and confidentiality needs. •Additionally, global frameworks may be leveraged. Most notably, the NIST AI Risk Management Framework which has been adopted by other agencies in the New Zealand public sector \[2\].The recently published ISO42001:2023 AIMS can be leveraged alongside NIST to develop a robust AI risk and controls library in the near term, and work towards compliance in the longer term \[3\]. •To ensure effective and efficient leadership, an IR specific approach should be taken to ensure confidentiality and integrity is maintained. This could be achieved through tools such as the AI Impact Assessment (tailored to our needs), and MLOps (tailored to the development systems in play at IR).

Ensuring model explainability, stringent testing and maintaining the anonymity and security of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is crucial. Developing deep expertise and building capability relating to ethics and data governance are important points. It is vital to accommodate the evolving advances yet ensuring sensitive data is securely held for the credibility of both the tax system and the organisation. Interviewees: James, Anil, Tina, Lisa. •We have the opportunity to introduce guardrails embedding Trustworthy AI principles early in our AI journey, ensuring AI systems are secure and confidential. •Preserving Privacy: Train AI models on representative data without compromising sensitive sources of training data. •Safe & Secure: Ensure that the technology, and the data that feeds into it, is protected from risks that may cause individual and/or collective physical, emotional environmental, and/or digital harm. Most organisations are still grappling with the risks associated with traditional AI, and Generative AI brings renewed attention to these. We should seek a balanced view of value creation opportunities with risks involved. Examples include: •The risk of individual and / or collective physical, emotional and/or digital harm – e.g. prompt injection attack leading to data leakage and/or inaccurate tax advice (due to prompt/data poisoning). •Where employing cloud architecture to host or run AI systems, this is subject to the same security risks as all cloud technology. Most notably, the risk of data breach, which results in a loss of customer trust, reputational impact, as well as regulatory fines & penalties. •The risk of re-identification of data subjects in an anonymised dataset, using AI technology, by external players or employees (insider threat). •AI technology is data hungry, and it can be tempting to use data for purposes beyond its initial intended use – resulting in data being used in ways notunderstood by customers and employees, or not permitted by agreements with them. 1.AI-and-the-Information-Privacy-Principles.pdf 2.AI Risk Management Framework | NIST 3.ISO 42001:2023 AIMS Standard International Best Practice S T R A T E G I C C O N T E X T Using global context to inform our navigation of AI-related risks as New Zealand’s tax authority.

The EU currently relies on existing legislation (GDPR, Digital Services and Digital Markets Act) to govern algorithms, but the AI Act with its associated standards of quality and safety is expected to be passed into law over the next few months . The US, on the other hand, does not currently have any legislation on AI usage at the federal level, and instead has guidelines outlined in the AI Bill of Rights and President Biden’s recent Executive Order on the topic \[2\]. These different approaches create a complex environment to navigate when seeking to identify best practices internationally. Data & Digital Whatisthe capabilitiyframework for AI Strategy? Digital Ecosystem Data & Information Foundations Architecture •Architecture:It is imperative that we continue to ensure a robustandadaptable technology infrastructure that can not only handle increasedAIworkloads, but also be flexible enough to leverage multi- cloudtechnologiesand manage potential risks associated with outdated systems, to support IR's journey towards being an AI-empoweredorganisation. •Data/Information Foundations: We recognise that establishing robust data foundations directly underpins our ability to effectively deploy AI, enhancing decision-making, processes and cybersecurity, within the wider context of our Data & Digital segment. These include considerations for not just transactional data but information and knowledge as well. •Digital Ecosystem:To successfully implement our AI strategy, weneedrecognise the importance of establishing a diverse and well- manageddigitalecosystem, harnessing relationships within it for actionable insights,whilemitigating risks of overdependence on specific vendors.

Furthermore, realis ing a metadata- informed analytics techniques nec essitates c areful preparation of exis ting and future data through rigorous c leansing proc esses. •Before implementing AI systems, we must comprehensively assess our current technology architecture. This not only includes technical compatibility but also whether the existing setup can handle expected AI workloads, especially when transitioning from a pilot phase to a production solution. These preparatory measures are crucial to avoid overburdening the system and ensure seamless integration of AI applications. •Prior to deploying AI solutions, we must test and adapt our technology architecture. This ensures it can handle the demands of such advanced technologies. Testing and modifying the architecture prior to rolling out solutions are crucial steps to guarantee a successful implementation of AI across IR \[2\]. •Successful AI integration heavily depends on high bandwidth, low- latency, and flexible technical architecture such as multi cloud. Beyond merely scaling up a proof of concept, this includes implementing robust systems capable of handling increased AI workloads and assuring data quality \[3\]. •Tax systems are forever evolving due to changing policy mandates. It is key that we adopt a modular and flexible approach to system architecture, allowing for rapid adaptations and improvements as and when necessary. This can help future-proof our AI capabilities and ensure they can harness emerging technologies as they evolve.

Furthermore, the preference from some team members is towards AI solutions as a service, with an expectation for vendors to add significant value. Interviewees: James, Mary, Cate, Mike, Malcolm. •The use of outdated or poorly documented systems within the technical architecture of IR can be a hindrance, as these constraints could limit our ability to manage risks and adapt to the required capabilities for successful AI implementation.\[1\] •The effective deployment of AI may require a heavy redesign or improvement of technical architecture, this could be an opportunity to consider high bandwidth, low-latency, and flexible architectures to allow for efficient AI application deployment.\[3\] •The implementation of AI at scale requires a different array of organisational capabilities compared to smaller scale projects or proofs of concept. It would therefore be challenging to translate the success of small pilots to a larger scale without also evolving the supporting architecture. •If current architecture is significantly based on outdated machine languages, it may pose challenges as these systems could potentially be incompatible with emerging technologies like artificial intelligence. If not addressed, these technical impediments could potentially lead to financial burdens and create unfavourable outcomes for citizen services in the long-term. •Scaling from pilot projects to production level AI applications is a major shift that would require us to have infrastructure capable of handling the increased workload. If existing capacities cannot meet the required infrastructure demands, both in terms of processing power and bandwidth, we may face significant performance issues. •Dependence on a single vendor for AI technologies can lead to limitations in flexibility and adaptability. This could inhibit the ability to incorporate new advancements in technology or switch to better solutions, thereby posing a risk to the long-term success of our AI initiatives. Data (& Information)Foundations S T R A T E G I C C O N T E X T High performance AI requires high quality, accurate and accessible data, information and knowledge. Data and information foundations are a critical strategic consideration as they support the accessibility, quality and security of the vast amounts of data necessary for AI solutions to function optimally. This directly ties into the larger Data & Digital pillar, as effective data foundations work in harmony with our architecture and digital ecosystem, underpinning our ability to harness AI’s potential to enhance key processes, enable insightful decision-making and guard against cyber threats. •We must approach data/information as both our most significant advantage and challenge \[1\]. It's vital to deploy resources to convert these vast data inflows into actionable insights. We must understand how to unlock the potential of new types of data while ensuring citizens' privacy and serving the public good. •A concrete data/information strategy and governance model are imperative \[2\]. It involves outlining clear roles and accountabilities for business and system owners and stewards. This model also provides guidelines for dealing with security, privacy and compliance issues, ensuring the data’s integrity, consistency and reliability. •Data/Information is a crucial ingredient for successful AI implementation \[3\]. Agencies need to distinguish and gain access to the crucial datasets for their operations. It is particularly important to develop platforms to access the identified data effectively.

Furthermore, channel content data consistency is highlighted to support corresponding use cases. Interviewees: Mary, Cate, Mike, Tina, James, Dan. •With the right data and information strategy, there exists a significant opportunity to unlock the hidden power of data. By identifying relevant datasets and creating platforms for data accessibility, the quality and effectiveness of AI can be vastly improved \[1\]\[2\]\[3\]. •Revenue agencies have a unique opportunity to treat data and information as an asset. By investing in data quality and governance, agencies can ensure AI enhanced taxation and compliance processes, thereby facilitating better decision making and more accurate tax collection \[1\]\[2\]. •The sheer volume and variety of data/information can pose a serious challenge to revenue agencies. Overcoming this challenge requires an investment in processes that validate and enhance data quality. Inaccurate or poor-quality data can undermine AI effectiveness and lead to incorrect tax outcomes. \[1\] •There's an inherent risk of being overloaded by the vast volume of data generated by digital transactions. By not being equipped to handle these data flows, the effectiveness of AI outcomes could be compromised \[1\] •Inadequate data/info governance and unclear roles or accountability could lead to security vulnerabilities or compliance issues. Mismanagement of data can lead to unauthorised access or data misuse, posing significant risks to the operation and reputation of the agency \[2\] •Failing to identify relevant datasets or provide platforms for their access poses a risk for AI implementation at IR. Inadequate access to vital data could limit the potential of AI initiatives or lead to subpar results. Moreover, if data is used to answer basic questions rather than develop deep insights, there is a risk of under-utilising the sources present \[3\] Digital Ecosystem S T R A T E G I C C O N T E X T We will need to utilise wider digital partners and technologies to ensure successful implementation of AI. For a robust approach to AI implementation, considering the digital ecosystem is essential as it not only provides the necessary breadth and diversity but also safeguards the organisation against overdependence and limits on innovation. Under the Data & Digital pillar, this aspect recognises the significance of having a healthy mix of partners, technologies, and data sources for continuous growth and competitiveness in the evolving AI landscape. •A well-orchestrated data ecosystem can offer the opportunity to unlock the next level of actionable insights. Interoperability, enabled by a well-thought-out ecosystem, can provide richer insights and more effective service to citizens. Our approach to AI should therefore focus on harnessing the potential of the relationships within this ecosystem to leverage data for faster, better decision- making \[1\]. •Trust forms a key ingredient for a sustainable digital ecosystem, especially when it revolves around data. All participants need to assure that data is protected as if it were their own. Our culture could also play a vital role in its willingness to adopt new technologies and adapt to changes in its operating system \[1\]. •To harness the full potential of AI, it's paramount to establish a diverse digital ecosystem. This ecosystem could range from existing technical solutions to partners across various sectors, including academia, industry, and governmental bodies. Such diversity provides technological agility to access a broad spectrum of AI-based solutions and helps avoid the risks associated with vendor lock or overdependence on a single entity. This, in turn, can expedite progress towards AI implementation at scale and enhance organisational readiness to adapt to any changes in the operating ecosystem \[2\]\[3\]. •The implementation of Tax Admin 3.0, through integration with taxpayers' natural systems using AI, promises a revolutionary shift towards real-time taxation. This approach enhances compliance, reduces administrative burdens, and addresses current structural limitations in tax governance, ultimately creating a more efficient, inclusive, and streamlined tax administration.

A key consensus is the necessity for clean, useful data as a primary foundation before layering any AI applications on top. Both the use of external partners for technology development and managing applications handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII) internally were emphasised. The potential role of third parties is acknowledged, with the understanding that these partners could help consolidate data from different sources as well as assist in employing AI technology. Interviewees: Dan, James, Anil, Tina, Lisa. •Leveraging data ecosystems can offer the opportunity to unlock the next level of actionable insights, serving citizens more effectively and enabling richer decision making. This calls for an emphasis on not only developing internal capabilities, but also on building robust technology, ecosystems that capitalise on diverse external entities with distinct strengths \[1\]\[2\]\[3\]. •Balancing the risk and reward of data sharing is a common challenge in the public sector and requires considerable trust amongstall participants to ensure sustained data sharing. The continuous advancement and adoption of new technologies, standards and ethics for data use can help ease these challenges and accelerate sharing, but maintaining trust will be a persisting consideration \[1\]. •When interacting with the broader digital ecosystem during procurement, we should aim to clearly articulate business needs to vendors and establish suitable frameworks so that desired outcomes can be met while ensuring integrity and control. •By embedding compliance into business transactions with Tax Admin 3.0 and integrating tax processes with Natural Systems, efficiency is amplified, and tax gaps are minimised. These improvements encourage timely tax fulfilment, directly curbing uncollected debts and revolutionising the taxation framework. •Trust is key to the health of the digital ecosystem, however it can also be a risk if not properly managed. Trust can be established through good governance models and clear rule agreement among all ecosystem members \[1\]. •Relying heavily on a few vendors or partners can lead to overdependence or ‘vendor lock’, stifling innovation and causing difficulties in transition to new vendors in the future, which could trigger substantial disruption. A diverse ecosystem and integrating with a variety of vendors, including those emerging or niche, could mitigate this risk \[3\]. •The management of the relationships within the digital ecosystem is an essential element, posing a risk if not executed effectively. Deciding how to leverage each relationship is just as important as deciding who and how many to have within the ecosystem. Properly managed, these relationships can enhance operation \[3\].

These might be subject to international regulations surrounding AI and privacy, particularly if their service uses international data sharing. As such, procurement processes should be strengthened to ensure provider use of AI is compliant with all applicable standards \[3\]. We should seek transparency and control over how providers are implementing AI, to ensure that any exposure of personal information or associated harm is prevented. •Any deviation from applicable standards for AI use could result in severe reputational damage for our organisation due to its wide-ranging role as steward of New Zealand’s tax system. Strong transparency and human oversight are especially critical for us, as inaccurate AI output could jeopardise public trust. Political & Public Sector Landscape S T R A T E G I C C O N T E X T Ensuring our approach to AI will align with expectations placed on ourorganisation by the government and taxpayer base alike. As a public sector organisation, we are accountable to both the current government and the people of Aotearoa New Zealand, hence our strategic foundation to build and maintain strong and trustful relationships (Whanaungatanga). C onsidering how this context ties in with our AI aspirations will be essential to ensuring theircontinued success. AI can also support efficiency by automating routine tasks, streamlining processes, and enhancing data- driven decision-making. •The fact that an AI solution is legally and financially feasible doesn’t necessary translate into moral and ethical acceptance from the target population, even if they stand to personally benefit. To provide a tax case study, the Australian government faced backlash after implementing Robodebt, an automated system that used income averaging to identify those in welfare debt and demand recovery of funds. The tool was highly inaccurate and lacked transparency, and many individuals experienced negative impacts to their finances and mental health because of the scheme. It incurred nearly $2B in lawsuit fees, with taxpayers footing the bill \[1\]. Although Robodebt didn’t directly use AI methods, it was perceived to have done so and thus caused public trust to be undermined \[2\]. Similarly, a Michigan government agency lacked the social license to implement MiDAS, an AI tool used to detect unemployment fraud and automatically require repayment from offenders. A retrospective study identified that 93% of the charges were incorrect, leading to the agency facing class-action lawsuits and losing its customers’ trust \[3\]. In both cases, stronger ethical design principles and public engagement could have ensured these organisations had the social license to operate the AI tool responsibly and derive associated efficiency gains. Ideally, the level of public acceptance will be re- assessed periodically throughout the lifecycle of the AI solution in question. •As we move through the current period of uncertainty, we may find it helpful to prioritise agile decision-making, informed by diverse voices \[4\]. Implementing AI in a trustworthy manner that balances the opportunities with the risks will be a crucial part of weathering this change.

The key is to transition gradually while ensuring informed customer consent and a build-up of public trust, thus earning a 'social license'. However, despite an internal push towards being 'more brave', navigating between the increasing expectations of efficient data usage and the absolute adherence to security and risk profiles is a challenging task. Interviewees: Mary, Cate, Anil, Phil, Lisa. •We have the opportunity to run targeted public engagement to gauge appetite for the incorporation of AI in tax processes. In doing so, we will aim to establish a social license, or ongoing public acceptance, for the initiatives we have planned. This process will differentiate initiatives that could be delivered from those that should be delivered based on public appetite and opinions. •Due to political shifts, and particularly the current period of government transition, the authorising environment in which we carry out our work may change. Therefore, flexibility of AI initiatives in adapting to changing government priorities will be a key factor in their ability to come to fruition in the current climate. We may need to be prepared to pause certain initiatives pending more certainty around thegovernment's demands of the public sector.

### BEPS – TRANSFER PRICING AND PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT AVOIDANCE

### Proposal

1\. This paper seeks Cabinet approval to introduce new tax rules to prevent permanent establishment avoidance, strengthen our transfer pricing rules, and help Inland Revenue investigate uncooperative multinationals. This paper is part of a comprehensive package of measures to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS).

### Executive summary

2\. Some large multinationals are currently using tax arrangements which allow them to report low taxable profits in New Zealand despite carrying on significant economic activity here.

3\. In March this year, the Government released a discussion document called _BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_ to consult on proposals to combat these arrangements. Many of these proposals are similar to tax reforms that Australia has introduced in recent years. They are also broadly consistent with the OECD’s _Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting_ (BEPS Action Plan).

4\. Submissions and workshops with the private sector were used to refine the proposals and better target them at the BEPS activities we are concerned about, whilst reducing the compliance costs and other unintended impacts on taxpayers engaging in ordinary, commercial dealings.

5\. We recommend that nearly all of the proposals in the discussion document proceed, subject to some changes following consultation. The most significant changes made to the original proposals as a result of consultation were:

*   The proposed permanent establishment (PE) avoidance rule should be more narrowly targeted at avoidance arrangements. We would like to consult further as to how best to achieve this.
*   Clarification of the circumstances in which Inland Revenue would be able to reconstruct a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position. We recommend clarifying that the test for reconstructing an arrangement would be based on the corresponding test in the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines.
*   The proposal to require disputed tax to be paid earlier should not proceed. This is because we consider it to be unnecessary in light of the current “use of money” interest rate regime.

6\. These changes are likely to be welcomed by submitters and do not reduce the overall effectiveness of the proposed reforms.

7\. We recommend Cabinet delegate authority to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue to make final decisions on the detailed design of the proposed rules. As we continue to design the detail of the proposals there will be further targeted consultation with interested parties.

8\. The forecast tax revenue from implementing the transfer pricing and PE avoidance measures is $25m in 2018/19 and $50m per annum from 2019/20. Some of this revenue has already been included in the Budget 2017 forecasts.

### Background

9\. In February this year, Cabinet agreed to release the Government discussion document _BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_ (CAB-17-MIN-0041 refers).

10\. The discussion document, which was released in March 2017, consulted on proposals to combat aggressive tax strategies which allow some multinationals to report low taxable profits in New Zealand despite carrying on significant economic activity here. These strategies involve:

*   **_Tax structuring:_** In order for New Zealand to tax a non-resident on its sales here, the non-resident must have a taxable presence (a permanent establishment or “PE”) in New Zealand. However, non-residents can structure their affairs to avoid such a taxable presence, even when they are involved in significant economic activity here (PE avoidance). Non-residents can also enter into arrangements with related parties that reduce their taxable profits in New Zealand, but lack economic substance (transfer pricing avoidance).
*   **_Creating enforcement barriers:_** It is difficult and resource intensive to assess and engage in disputes with multinationals in practice. This is due to the highly factual nature of the issues and the difficulties Inland Revenue faces in obtaining the relevant information.

11\. The OECD and the G20 are also concerned about these kinds of BEPS strategies, and have recommended measures to address them in their 15 point BEPS Action Plan. These include:

*   a widened definition of “permanent establishment” for double tax agreements (DTAs), to counter PE avoidance (however this will only be included in a DTA if both countries agree); and
*   updated transfer pricing guidelines, to counter profit shifting.

### Comment

12\. We have developed a package of proposed tax law changes to combat transfer pricing and PE avoidance. The main elements of the proposed reform package are:

*   The introduction of a new PE avoidance rule that will prevent multinationals from structuring their operations to avoid having a PE in New Zealand where one exists in substance.
*   Stronger “source rules” so New Zealand has a greater ability to tax New Zealand-sourced income.
*   Stronger transfer pricing rules which will adjust related party transactions if they do not align with the actual substance of the multinational’s economic activities. We also propose shifting the burden of proof onto the taxpayer (rather than Inland Revenue) for proving that their related party dealings are consistent with those that would be agreed by third parties operating at arm’s length, and extending the time bar (the period of time which Inland Revenue has to reassess a taxpayer) from four years to seven years for transfer pricing.
*   A range of administrative measures that will strengthen Inland Revenue’s powers to investigate large multinationals (with at least EUR €750m of global revenues). These are similar to some of the administrative powers provided under the UK and Australia’s Diverted Profit Taxes but New Zealand’s administrative measures are more targeted at the practical barriers faced by tax investigators as they will only apply when a multinational does not cooperate with a tax investigation.

13\. Many of these proposals are similar to tax reforms that Australia has introduced in recent years. They are also broadly consistent with the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan, although the specific proposals are tailored for the New Zealand environment to address issues that Inland Revenue has identified when investigating multinationals.

### Private sector consultation

14\. 15 submitters provided written submissions on the discussion document. The Treasury and Inland Revenue also met with six of these submitters to discuss their submissions.

#### General reaction

15\. Overall, most submitters accepted in principle the need for measures to address the transfer pricing and PE avoidance issues identified in the discussion document. However, they did raise issues with certain features of the proposed measures and made suggestions to make them more certain and better targeted.

16\. Two of the 15 submitters welcomed the proposals as a positive step by the Government to ensure that all large multinationals are paying their fair share of tax.

17\. The other 13 submitters were tax advisors or represent multinationals that could be negatively affected by the proposals. Their submissions were critical of some of the measures.

18\. Some submitters argued that the proposals could have a detrimental effect on New Zealand being an attractive investment destination and should not be implemented. As noted in the accompanying covering Cabinet Paper (_Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting_), there will be additional tax and compliance costs for some investors but these additional costs will mostly be borne by taxpayers engaging in BEPS activities and the overall benefits to New Zealand of addressing BEPS outweigh these costs.

19\. As expected, most of the submitters opposed the administrative proposals to increase Inland Revenue's powers to investigate multinationals. However, we consider these new powers are necessary to ensure Inland Revenue can effectively enforce the new rules. These new powers include:

*   Expanding Inland Revenue's ability to request information that is held by a related group member offshore. Submitters considered this proposal could unfairly penalise a New Zealand entity that may not be able to get the information from their multinational group members. However, we consider it is unacceptable for Inland Revenue’s investigations to be frustrated because a multinational group fails to provide information that is under its control.
*   Shifting the burden of proof for transfer pricing onto the taxpayer (rather than Inland Revenue) for proving that their related party dealings are consistent with those that would be agreed by third parties operating at arm’s length. Submitters considered Inland Revenue had information regarding comparable transactions and should bear the burden of proof. However, shifting the burden of proof is consistent with the fact that the taxpayer holds the relevant information on their own transfer pricing practices. The burden of proof is already on the taxpayer for other tax matters and is also on the taxpayer for transfer pricing matters in most other OECD and G20 countries, including Australia. Because most multinationals already prepare transfer pricing documentation that satisfies the burden of proof for other countries, the additional compliance costs from this change are not expected to be substantial.
*   Extending the time bar (the period of time which Inland Revenue has to adjust a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position) from four years to seven years for transfer pricing. Submitters opposed this extension on the basis that it increased uncertainty and was out of step with the general time bar, which applies to other areas of tax. However, we are continuing to recommend the seven year rule. Having a longer time bar for transfer pricing cases is consistent with both Australia and Canada (who also have a special seven year time bar for transfer pricing) and reflects the information asymmetry that exists in transfer pricing cases (especially where taxpayers may hold relevant information offshore).

#### Changes made as a result of consultation

20\. In response to submissions, we have updated the proposals to address many of the submitters’ concerns while ensuring the measures are just as effective at combatting BEPS.

21\. Many submissions focused on when the PE avoidance rule would apply. Submitters considered the proposal outlined in the discussion document applied too broadly and could have unintended impacts on compliant taxpayers engaging in ordinary, commercial dealings.

22\. We consider the PE avoidance rule should be more narrowly targeted at avoidance arrangements. We would like to consult further as to how best to achieve this.

23\. Submitters also pointed out that the OECD has updated their model DTA to address PE avoidance and New Zealand is currently in the process of adopting this into some of our tax treaties by signing the OECD’s _Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting_ and through negotiating new tax treaties. We agree that the domestic law PE avoidance rule will only be necessary when the relevant tax treaty does not yet include the OECD’s new recommendation and propose narrowing the application of rule accordingly.

24\. The PE avoidance rule would apply notwithstanding the relevant DTAs (that don’t yet include the OECD’s new model PE rule). We consider that this is acceptable for two reasons:

*   The OECD’s commentary to their model DTA contemplates that countries can adopt anti-avoidance rules and states that, as a general rule, there will be no conflict between such anti-avoidance provisions and the provisions of a DTA. An existing example of this is New Zealand’s General Anti-Avoidance Rule which explicitly overrides our DTAs to allow New Zealand to combat tax avoidance arrangements. The PE avoidance rule would be a specific anti-avoidance rule, which would also be consistent with the principle in the OECD’s commentary.
*   The UK and Australia have already implemented similar PE avoidance rules in their domestic laws which override their DTAs and their treaty partners have not challenged this.

25\. Another major point raised by submitters was the need to clarify the circumstances in which Inland Revenue would be able to reconstruct a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position. We recommend clarifying that the test for reconstructing an arrangement would be based on the corresponding test in the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines.

26\. Other significant changes made as a result of consultation were:

*   The anti-avoidance source rule will be more narrowly targeted at the existing issues Inland Revenue has identified with the source rules.
*   We have decided not to proceed with the proposal to require multinationals to pay disputed tax upfront as we agree with submitters that the existing “use of money” interest rates that Inland Revenue charges on unpaid tax provide a sufficient incentive to pay tax that is in dispute.

27\. The above changes will make the rules more certain and better targeted and are likely to be welcomed by submitters.

28\. We also recommend widening the scope of the original proposal to deem an amount of income to have a New Zealand source under our domestic legislation if we have a right to tax the income under a DTA. The rule proposed in the discussion document was limited to income covered by the PE and royalty articles of our DTAs. We should extend the rule to all types of income that we can tax under a DTA – as Australia does. This ensures we can exercise a taxing right that we have negotiated under a DTA. We will consult further on this wider proposal in the next round of consultation.

29\. These recommended changes will not affect the originally forecast revenue from implementing the transfer pricing and PE avoidance measures, which is $25m in 2018/19 and $50m per annum from 2019/20 (some of this revenue has already been included in the Budget 2017 forecasts).

30\. We recommend Cabinet delegate authority to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue to make final decisions on the detailed design of the proposed rules. As we continue to design the detail of the proposals there will be further targeted consultation with interested parties.

### Agency consultation

31\. Inland Revenue and Treasury officials have consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment on this Cabinet paper.

### Financial implications, human rights, administrative impacts, legislative implications, publicity

32\. These are set out in the accompanying covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (_Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting_).

### Impact Analysis Requirements

33\. Cabinet's Impact Analysis Requirements apply to these proposals and a Regulatory Impact Assessment is required. This has been prepared by Inland Revenue and is attached.

34\. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Regulatory Impact Assessment and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria.

### Recommendations

35\. We recommend that the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee:

1. **Note** that in March this year the Government released a discussion document called _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_ which proposed some detailed measures to improve our ability to tax multinationals that operate in New Zealand.

 2. **Note** that in response to submissions we have made the proposed measures better targeted at the BEPS concerns without reducing the overall effectiveness of the proposed reforms.

3\. **Agree** to introduce a new PE avoidance rule that will apply to large multinationals that structure their businesses to avoid having a PE (taxable presence) in New Zealand.

4\. **Agree** to expand and strengthen the rules for taxing New Zealand-sourced income by:

*   deeming certain amounts of income to have a source in New Zealand if New Zealand has a right to tax that income under any applicable DTA;
*   introducing an anti-avoidance source rule which will broadly provide that, where another group member carries on a non-resident’s business in New Zealand, the non-resident will be deemed to carry on that business itself for the purpose of determining whether its income from New Zealand customers has a New Zealand source; and
*   addressing a potential weakness of the life insurance source rules by ensuring that no deductions are available for the reinsurance of life policies if the premium income on that policy is not taxable in New Zealand, including where the income is not subject to New Zealand tax by operation of a DTA.

5\. **Agree** to strengthen the transfer pricing rules so they align with the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines and Australia’s transfer pricing rules. This involves amending New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules so that:

*   they disregard legal form if it does not align with the actual economic substance of the transaction;
*   they provide Inland Revenue with a power to reconstruct transfer pricing arrangements which are not commercially rational because they include unrealistic terms that third parties would not be willing to agree to;
*   the legislation specifically refers to arm’s length conditions;
*   they refer to the latest OECD transfer pricing guidelines as guidance for how the rules are applied;
*   the new legislation codifies the requirement for large multinationals to provide Inland Revenue with the information required to comply with the OECD’s country-by-country reporting initiative;
*   the time bar that limits Inland Revenue’s ability to adjust a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position is increased to seven years (in line with Australia);
*   the burden of proof for demonstrating that a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position aligns with arm’s length conditions is shifted from Inland Revenue to the taxpayer (consistent with the burden of proof being on the taxpayer for other tax matters); and
*   in addition to applying to transactions between related parties, the transfer pricing rules will also apply when non-resident investors “act in concert” to effectively control a New Zealand entity, such as through a private equity manager.

6\. **Agree** to strengthen Inland Revenue’s powers to investigate large multinationals (with at least EUR €750m of global revenues) that do not cooperate with a tax investigation by amending the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow Inland Revenue to:

*   more readily assess the multinational’s tax position based on the information available to Inland Revenue at the time;
*   collect any tax owed by a member of a large multinational group from any wholly-owned group member, provided the non-resident fails to pay the tax itself;
*   use section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to request information that is held offshore by another group member of the large multinational group;
*   use section 21 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to deem an amount of income to be allocated to a New Zealand group member or PE of a large multinational group in cases where they have failed to adequately respond to an information request in relation to New Zealand sourced income (currently the existing power only applies in respect of deductible payments); and
*   impose a new civil penalty of up to $100,000 for large multinational groups which fail to provide requested information (which replaces the current $12,000 maximum criminal penalty).

7\. **Note** that the fiscal consequences of the above measures are set out in the covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (_Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting_).

8\. **Delegate** authority to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to make final decisions on the detailed design of the above measures.

9\. **Agree** that the results of the decisions in recommendations 3-6 and 8 be included in a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced to Parliament before the end of 2017.

### SUMMARY: PROBLEM AND PROPOSED APPROACH

### Problem Definition

#### What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required?

There are international concerns about multinationals not paying their fair share of tax. This is because some multinationals use base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) strategies to report low taxable profits in New Zealand and other countries in which they operate. These BEPS strategies include arrangements between related parties which shift profits out of New Zealand (usually into a lower taxed jurisdiction). They also include arrangements which are designed to ensure New Zealand is not able to tax any income from sales here despite there being a physical presence in New Zealand in relation to the sales. These particular BEPS strategies are known as transfer pricing and permanent establishment (PE) avoidance. Finally, Inland Revenue faces administrative difficulties in investigating large multinationals.

### Proposed Approach

#### How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option?

The proposed approach is to adopt the package of measures outlined in the Government discussion document _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_ (March 2017), with some changes resulting from consultation, as the measures will:

*   ensure that multinationals cannot structure their affairs for the purpose of avoiding a taxable presence in New Zealand;
*   stop companies from shifting profits out of the New Zealand tax base through artificial arrangements; and
*   make it easier for Inland Revenue to investigate such multinationals.

### SECTION B: SUMMARY IMPACTS: BENEFITS AND COSTS

#### Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit?

The Government will benefit by receiving an additional $50 million of revenue per annum. Compliant businesses will benefit because the multinationals involved in transfer pricing and PE avoidance activities will no longer be able to achieve a competitive advantage. Also, the measures will support voluntary compliance by protecting the integrity of the tax system.

#### Where do the costs fall?

Multinationals which currently engage in BEPS activities will face a medium level of compliance costs. These taxpayers may choose to transition into more tax compliant agreements which will require restructuring costs; or they may apply for advance pricing agreements (APAs). However, the majority of multinationals are compliant and should not be materially affected by the proposals.

#### What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated?

There is a risk that foreign companies investing in New Zealand will view the proposals as complex and onerous, incentivising them to remove their existing personnel from New Zealand or to cease operating in New Zealand altogether. However, most of the affected foreign companies are dependent on having personnel in New Zealand to arrange their sales. Without personnel on the ground, they would not be able to service their New Zealand market. It is also unlikely that they would cease to operate in New Zealand altogether.

#### Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’.

There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’.

### SECTION C: EVIDENCE CERTAINTY AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

#### Agency rating of evidence certainty?

There is limited certainty of evidence in relation to the problem of transfer pricing and PE avoidance arrangements. This is because such activities are often not directly observable in the absence of specific audit activity. However, Inland Revenue is aware of about 16 cases involved in these types of BEPS arrangements which are currently under audit. While there are only 20 New Zealand-owned multinationals that earn over the threshold for some of the main proposals (over EUR €750 million of consolidated global revenue), the European Union (EU) has estimated that there may be up to 6,000 multinationals globally that do. However, we do not know how many of these global multinationals operate in New Zealand.

### IMPACT STATEMENT: BEPS – TRANSFER PRICING AND PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT AVOIDANCE RULES

* * *

### SECTION 1: GENERAL INFORMATION

* * *

### Purpose

_Inland Revenue_ is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final tax policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet.

### Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis

#### Evidence of the problem

Our analysis has been limited somewhat by our inability to assess the exact size of the transfer pricing and PE avoidance structures in New Zealand. In common with BEPS activities generally, transfer pricing and PE avoidance is difficult to quantify as tax avoidance is often not directly observable. We consider that, while most multinationals are compliant, there is a minority that engage in transfer pricing and PE avoidance. Inland Revenue is aware of about 16 cases of transfer pricing and PE avoidance currently under audit that collectively involve about $100 million per year of disputed tax. These cases show our existing rules are vulnerable and Inland Revenue considers that the use of avoidance arrangements will increase if the weaknesses in the current rules are not addressed. Furthermore, as New Zealand endorses the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) _Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting_ (BEPS Action Plan), there is an expectation that we will take action against BEPS and implement a number of the OECD’s recommendations.

#### Range of options considered

Our analysis of options has been primarily constrained by New Zealand’s double tax agreements (DTAs). Under its DTAs, New Zealand can only tax non-residents on business profits if they have a PE in New Zealand. We have also been somewhat constrained by the fact that New Zealand endorses the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines.

#### Assumptions underpinning impact analysis

The estimated impact of the options is dependent on the behavioural response of taxpayers to the introduction of some form of transfer pricing and PE avoidance arrangement rules. Taxpayers may rearrange their affairs to fall outside the scope of any proposed rules, which will have flow-on effects as to efficiency, compliance costs, and revenue implications. Beyond anecdotal information learned through consultation, it is difficult to assess the extent and nature of the behavioural response.

### SECTION 2: PROBLEM DEFINITION AND OBJECTIVES

* * *

### 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed?

#### BEPS

BEPS refers to the aggressive tax planning strategies used by some multinationals to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This outcome is achieved when multinationals exploit gaps and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules to avoid tax. BEPS strategies distort investment decisions, allow multinationals to benefit from unintended competitive advantages over more compliant or domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens’ trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole.

In 2013, the OECD published its BEPS Action Plan which identified actions needed to address BEPS (including transfer pricing and PE avoidance), set deadlines to implement these actions, and identified the resources needed and the methodology to implement these actions. In 2015, the OECD released its final package of recommended actions for countries to implement to counter BEPS.

If no action is taken to counter transfer pricing and PE avoidance arrangements, multinationals that are currently engaging in these types of arrangements will be able to continue, and the number of these types of avoidance cases will continue to increase.

#### New Zealand’s BEPS work

New Zealand is a supporter of the OECD/G20 BEPS project to address international avoidance and is advancing a number of the OECD/G20 BEPS recommendations.

In September 2016, the Government released the BEPS discussion document _Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements_. In March 2017, the Government released two further discussion documents: _BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules_; and _BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_; along with the officials’ issues paper _New Zealand’s implementation of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS_.

The _BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_ discussion document consulted on the Government’s proposal to introduce a new set of tax rules to counter BEPS activities involving transfer pricing and PE avoidance. Many of the proposals follow the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan recommendations (such as updating our transfer pricing legislation to align with the OECD’s new transfer pricing guidelines).

### 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place?

#### New Zealand’s tax system

New Zealand has a broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) taxation framework. This means that tax bases are broad and tax rates are kept as low as possible while remaining consistent with the Government’s distributional objectives. The BBLR framework ensures the tax system is not generally used to deliver incentives or encourage particular behaviours.

Having a consistent tax framework such as BBLR does not mean that tax changes are unnecessary. An ongoing policy challenge is to ensure that our tax rules are up to date and result in multinational firms paying a fair and efficient amount of tax in New Zealand. Base protection measures, such as transfer pricing and PE rules, are important to protect the tax base and ensure that New Zealand collects an appropriate amount of tax on non-resident investment.

At the same time, it is important that New Zealand continues to be a good place to base a business and that tax does not get in the way of this happening. New Zealand relies heavily on foreign direct investment to fund domestic investment and, as such, the Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand remains an attractive place for non-residents to invest.

#### New Zealand’s PE rules

New Zealand’s ability to tax non-residents on their New Zealand sales income is determined by our domestic tax rules in conjunction with our DTAs. Under our DTAs, New Zealand is generally prevented from taxing a non-resident’s business income unless the non-resident has a PE in New Zealand. This is the case even if that income has a source in New Zealand under our domestic legislation.

In general, New Zealand can only tax a non-resident multinational group on its sales here if both of the following conditions are met:

*   The multinational group has a sufficient taxable presence in New Zealand. This means the group must operate in New Zealand either through a New Zealand-resident subsidiary (in which case the subsidiary is taxable on its income) or through a PE of a non-resident group member. A PE is basically a place of business of the non-resident, but it also includes an agent acting for the non-resident.
*   Where a multinational operates in New Zealand through a PE of a non-resident group member, some of the non-resident’s net profits from its sales can be attributed to its taxable presence here. This involves determining:
    *   The amount of the non-resident’s gross sales income which can be attributed to its PE here; and
    *   The amount of the expenses which can be deducted from that income to determine the net taxable profits in New Zealand.

The non-resident must also have a sufficient taxable presence in New Zealand (if a DTA applies) for New Zealand to charge non-resident withholding tax on certain payments by the non-resident (such as a royalty) to other parties in connection with the New Zealand sales income.

#### New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules

“Transfer pricing” refers to the use of cross-border payments between associated entities such as a parent and a subsidiary. Transfer pricing rules are therefore concerned with determining the conditions, including the price (and therefore the tax liability), for transactions within a multinational group resulting in the allocation of profits to group companies in different jurisdictions.

New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation was first introduced in 1995 and is largely focused on the legal form of the transaction and adjusting the consideration that is paid to an arm’s length amount (which can be zero). Due to the increased complexity and tax planning of cross-border intra-group trade over the last 22 years, New Zealand’s existing transfer pricing rules are unable to adequately address some types of profit shifting.

#### General anti-avoidance rule (GAAR)

New Zealand also has a general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) which effectively overrides other provisions of the tax legislation to deny the tax benefits of an arrangement when a more than incidental purpose of the arrangement is to obtain a tax benefit. However, the GAAR is unlikely to be effective at addressing all transfer pricing and PE avoidance structures on its own.

### 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity?

#### The problem of transfer pricing and PE avoidance

Some multinational companies operating in New Zealand exploit deficiencies in the current international tax system (both in New Zealand and abroad) by using transfer pricing and PE avoidance strategies to report low taxable profits in New Zealand despite carrying out significant economic activity here. Transfer pricing and PE avoidance can lead to unfairness and the substitution of low-taxed investors for tax-paying investors. This has the potential to reduce national income while doing little or nothing to reduce the overall pre-tax cost of capital to New Zealand or increase the overall level of investment. It also distorts the allocation of investment by favouring foreign investors who set out to game the system.

##### Transfer pricing avoidance

One of the major strategies used by multinationals to shift profits out of New Zealand and reduce their worldwide tax bills is transfer pricing. Related parties may agree to pay an artificially high or low price for goods, services, funding, or intangibles compared to the “arm’s length” price or conditions that an unrelated third party would be willing to pay or accept under a similar transaction. By manipulating these transfer prices or conditions, profits can be shifted out of New Zealand and into a lower-taxed country or entity.

##### PE avoidance

Some multinationals reduce their New Zealand tax liability by structuring their affairs to avoid a PE arising, despite carrying on significant activity here.

#### Impacted population

These rules affect only taxpayers with foreign connections – that is, foreign-owned New Zealand taxpayers, and New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations. The impacted population is therefore predominately large companies.

Many of the proposed measures will apply only to multinational groups with over EUR €750 million of consolidated global revenue. While there are only 20 New Zealand-owned multinationals that earn this much, the EU has estimated that there may be up to 6,000 multinationals globally that do. However, we do not know how many of these global multinationals operate in New Zealand.

#### Transfer pricing and PE arrangements in New Zealand

Inland Revenue is aware of about 16 cases of transfer pricing and PE avoidance currently under audit that collectively involve about $100 million per year of disputed tax. These cases show our existing rules are vulnerable and Inland Revenue considers that the use of avoidance arrangements will increase if the weaknesses in the current rules are not strengthened. Furthermore, as New Zealand endorses the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan, there is an expectation that we will take action against BEPS and implement a number of the OECD’s recommendations.

Inland Revenue’s judgement is that the transfer pricing and PE proposals can expect to add $50 million a year of revenue to the forecasts. This $50 million per year estimate relates to the fact that the proposals will make it more difficult to avoid tax under the transfer pricing and PE rules and easier to find and assess any remaining avoidance cases. This should reduce future avoidance arrangements and free up investigator resources. The changes will also result in more revenue being able to be assessed from any multinationals which continue to use transfer pricing or PE avoidance arrangements.

### 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making?

Our analysis of options has been primarily constrained by New Zealand’s DTAs. Under our DTAs, New Zealand can only tax non-residents on business profits if they have a PE in New Zealand. The OECD guidance permits departure from this only in respect of tax avoidance. We have also been somewhat constrained by the fact that New Zealand endorses the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines.

### 2.5 What do stakeholders think?

#### Submissions on the discussion document

The Government received 16 submissions on the discussion document from key stakeholders.[\[1\]](#footnote1)
 We also met with six of the main submitters to discuss their submissions in more detail.

Many submitters strongly opposed the proposals that increased Inland Revenue’s power to investigate large multinationals. Others argued that the proposals could have a detrimental effect on New Zealand being an attractive investment destination and should not be implemented.

However, most submitters accepted the need for measures to address the transfer pricing and PE avoidance issues identified in the discussion document. Some submitters even welcomed the proposals as a positive step by the Government to ensure multinationals pay their fair share of tax.

#### Further consultation

Following Cabinet decisions in July 2017, we are planning to undertake further public consultation on outstanding policy issues, technical design details, and an exposure draft of selected parts of the planned BEPS bill.

* * *

### SECTION 3: OPTIONS IDENTIFICATION

* * *

### 3.1 What options are available to address the problem?

Officials have identified four mutually exclusive options to address the problem:

*   Option 1 – Status quo
*   Option 2 – MLI and the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines
*   Option 3 – Diverted profit tax
*   Option 4 – Discussion document proposals (as amended through consultation)

Option 1 is the only non-regulatory option. The other options involve implementing an international agreement or changing New Zealand tax legislation.

#### Option 1: Status quo

This option would retain the existing tax rules for multinationals (as described in the sections above). Under this option, Inland Revenue would continue trying to enforce the existing rules and/or apply the GAAR to challenge tax avoidance arrangements.

#### Option 2: MLI and the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines

Option 2 is to rely on the combination of the _Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting_ (MLI)[\[2\]](#footnote2)
 and the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines without amending our domestic law. Under this option, any PE avoidance issues would be addressed under the OECD’s new PE definition in the MLI, and any transfer pricing issues would be addressed by applying the OECD’s new transfer pricing guidelines.

#### Option 3: Diverted profits tax

Option 3 is to adopt a diverted profits tax (DPT). A DPT is a separate tax on the “diverted profits” that arise from transfer pricing and PE avoidance. It is levied at a penal rate, compared with income tax, and has greatly enhanced assessment and collection powers. Both the UK and Australia have already implemented a DPT to target multinationals engaging in BEPS strategies. DPTs are intended to incentivise taxpayers to pay the correct amount of income tax under the normal rules rather than to raise revenue by themselves.

#### Option 4: Discussion document proposals (as amended through consultation)

This option involves adopting the package of measures proposed in the discussion document, with some changes resulting from consultation. The discussion document proposals have taken certain features of a DPT and combined them with the OECD’s BEPS measures and some domestic law amendments to produce a package of measures that is tailored for the New Zealand environment. The intention is that this approach would be as effective as a DPT in addressing transfer pricing and PE avoidance in New Zealand, but it would do so within our current frameworks and with fewer drawbacks. Under this option, we would introduce:

*   an anti-avoidance rule that will prevent multinationals from structuring their operations to avoid having a PE (a taxable presence) in New Zealand where one exists in substance;
*   stronger transfer pricing rules which will adjust related party transactions if they do not align with the actual substance of the multinational’s economic activities; shift the burden of proof onto the taxpayer (rather than Inland Revenue) for proving that their related party dealings are consistent with those that would be agreed by third parties operating at arm’s length; and extend the time bar for transfer pricing from four years to seven years;
*   stronger “source rules” so New Zealand has a greater ability to tax New Zealand-sourced income; and
*   a range of administrative measures that will strengthen Inland Revenue’s powers to investigate large multinationals (with at least EUR €750m of global revenues) that do not cooperate with a tax investigation (such as allowing Inland Revenue to request information that is held by an offshore group member).

#### Consultation

These four options were identified prior to consultation. The discussion document proposed the adoption of a package of reforms combining elements of a DPT with the OECD’s recommendations and some domestic law amendments (option 4). The discussion document discussed the status quo (option 1) and the DPT (option 3). Some submitters proposed that the better approach would be to sign the MLI and apply the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines without amending our domestic law (option 2).

In response to consultation we have refined the proposals so they are better targeted at BEPS arrangements with less compliance costs and fewer unintended impacts on compliant taxpayers engaging in ordinary, commercial dealings.

Significant changes made as a result of consultation were:

*   More narrowly targeting the PE avoidance rule at avoidance arrangements (we will consult further on how best to achieve this).
*   Clarifying that the test for reconstructing an arrangement would be based on the corresponding test in the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines.
*   The PE avoidance rule will only apply where an applicable DTA does not include the OECD’s widened PE definition (as in cases where the OECD’s new PE definition is included, the proposed PE avoidance rule will be unnecessary).
*   The anti-avoidance source rule will be more narrowly targeted at the existing issues Inland Revenue has identified with the source rules.
*   We have decided not to proceed with the proposal to require multinationals to pay disputed tax upfront as we agree with submitters that the existing “use of money interest” rates that Inland Revenue charges on unpaid tax provide a sufficient incentive to pay any tax which has been assessed.

The above changes are likely to be welcomed by submitters.

#### Evidence from Australia’s reforms

Australia’s recent experience updating their transfer pricing laws (in 2013) and introducing a new Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL) demonstrates the effectiveness of tax reforms to address PE avoidance and transfer pricing issues.

Australia’s MAAL came into effect on 11 December 2015 and prevents multinationals from structuring their affairs to avoid having a PE in Australia. It is very similar to our proposed PE avoidance rule.

As of 4 June 2017, the Australian Tax Office (ATO) had identified 221 taxpayers they believed to be shifting profits to a non-resident group member resident in a low-tax jurisdiction. Of these 221 taxpayers, the ATO has cleared 102. Furthermore, since the MAAL was introduced, 18 companies with PE avoidance structures have restructured their affairs to bring their sales onshore – and a further 11 are currently working with the ATO to restructure.

According to the ATO, as a result of the introduction of the MAAL, an additional AUS$6.4 billion worth of assessable income will now be reported in Australia. This translates into $100 million a year in additional tax revenue for Australia.

### 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration?

The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals. This framework is consistent with the Government’s vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria:

*   Efficiency of compliance – compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible;
*   Efficiency of administration – administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible;
*   Neutrality – the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible;
*   Fairness and equity – similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way; and
*   Sustainability – the potential for tax evasion and avoidance should be minimised while keeping counteracting measures proportionate to risks involved.

In relation to this regulatory proposal, it would be difficult to achieve positive sustainability, neutrality, and fairness impacts without some increase in compliance costs and so there are some trade-offs that were, and continue to be, considered. Through our consultation we have worked with stakeholders to minimise compliance costs as much as possible without sacrificing the benefits of the proposal.

### 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why?

Two options were ruled out of scope due to their radical nature, namely:

*   cancel New Zealand’s DTAs; and
*   prevent multinationals from selling products in New Zealand if they were suspected of involvement in BEPS activities.

The former would harm New Zealand exporters and outbound investors. The latter would not only harm New Zealand consumers (as they would no longer be able to import certain goods), but it would also violate New Zealand’s trade agreements.

#### Option 2 (MLI and the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines)

*   **Neutrality**: The effect of this option will be limited as the MLI will not cover many of our DTAs and New Zealand’s current transfer pricing legislation does not allow us to apply some of the new transfer pricing guidelines.
*   **Fairness and equity**: While option 2 has some fairness benefits, it will not prevent all taxpayers from using such arrangements.

#### Option 3 (Diverted profits tax)

*   **Fairness and equity**: While option 2 has some fairness benefits, it also has some significant fairness detriments owing to its penal tax rate, reduced taxpayer rights, and wide scope. Further, a DPT could also impact on the perception of the fairness of New Zealand’s tax system for multinationals investing into New Zealand.
*   **Sustainability**: Compared to the other options it would provide less certainty for, and impose more compliance costs on, taxpayers.

#### Option 4 (Discussion document proposals (as amended through consultation))

*   **Efficiency of compliance**: It is also highly likely that a number of taxpayers will choose to restructure their affairs and/or apply APAs.
*   **Efficiency of administration**: The proposals may place a higher demand on Inland Revenue’s transfer pricing team and more transfer pricing specialists may be required to deal with this.
*   **Neutrality**: This option will ensure multinationals engaged in BEPS activities are not tax-advantaged over more compliant domestic and non-resident businesses. This will provide some efficiency gains.

### SECTION 5: CONCLUSIONS

* * *

### 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits?

We consider that option 4 (discussion document proposals (as amended through consultation)) is the best option to combat transfer pricing and PE avoidance.

Option 4 will improve the neutrality of New Zealand’s tax system by eliminating the ability for multinationals to engage in aggressive transfer pricing and PE avoidance schemes to receive tax benefits. Option 4 will:

*   ensure that multinationals cannot structure their affairs for the purpose of avoiding a taxable presence in New Zealand;
*   stop companies from shifting profits out of the New Zealand tax base through artificial arrangements; and
*   make it easier for Inland Revenue to investigate such multinationals.

Option 4 will also improve the equity and fairness of New Zealand’s tax system. Multinationals engaging in BEPS activities are currently able to structure their affairs to receive unintended tax benefits placing them at a competitive advantage over more compliant multinationals or domestic companies. As a result, these more compliant multinationals and domestic companies end up suffering a greater tax burden. Option 4 will therefore ensure that the tax burden is shared more equally among taxpayers.

While option 4 will impose additional tax and compliance costs on some taxpayers, it is important to note that some of the measures will only apply to large multinational groups with over EUR €750 million of consolidated group turnover. Submitters on the discussion document argued that the imposition of higher tax payments may make New Zealand a less attractive investment location for multinationals engaged in BEPS arrangements. However, as a number of like-minded countries throughout the OECD are undertaking similar BEPS measures, we believe that any impacts on foreign direct investment into New Zealand will not be material and that implementing the proposals in option 4 remains in New Zealand’s best economic interests (see further discussion in section 5.3 below).

Option 1 (status quo) was preferred by a number of submitters to the discussion document. However, retaining the current rules would mean that those multinationals engaging in aggressive transfer pricing and PE avoidance structures would be able to continue, and the number of these types of avoidance cases would continue to increase. While New Zealand has a GAAR (see above in section 2.2), it is unlikely to be effective at addressing all transfer pricing and PE avoidance structures on its own. This is because applying the GAAR often leads to resource-intensive court cases and it may be difficult to show that certain avoidance structures fail the Parliamentary contemplation component of the GAAR.

Option 2 (MLI and the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines) was the option suggested by many submitters. However, we consider that adopting the OECD’s recommendations on their own (without corresponding domestic amendments) would not effectively address the issue of transfer pricing and PE avoidance. First, New Zealand’s existing transfer pricing legislation does not contemplate an ability to apply some important aspects of the new OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines. This means that Inland Revenue would only be able to apply the guidelines to the extent that our current domestic rules allow. Domestic law changes would likely be needed to adequately address the issue. Second, while option 2 has some fairness benefits, it will not prevent all taxpayers from using such arrangements. This is because the MLI will only apply where both countries choose to adopt it – and many of New Zealand’s trading partners do not intend to adopt it. It is therefore important that New Zealand adopt its own PE avoidance measure to supplement the MLI, otherwise there would still be a gap for multinationals to exploit. Third, the OECD’s BEPS measures do not address issues specific to New Zealand, such as issues with our current source rules and the practical difficulties of taxing multinationals (such as information asymmetry and the administrative costs of taxpayer disputes).

Option 3 (diverted profits tax) is not recommended. This option would provide less certainty for, and impose significant compliance costs on, taxpayers. This is because a DPT is a separate tax at a much higher rate than the standard company tax rate and includes stringent enforcement mechanisms. This means an investor may find themselves being charged a much higher rate of tax (plus interest and penalties) that can be difficult to challenge or credit against prior year losses or taxes charged by other countries. This increased risk and uncertainty may reduce their willingness to invest in New Zealand (compared to more certain investments elsewhere).

### 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Affected parties**  <br>_(identify)_ | **Comment**: _nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks_ | **Impact**:  <br>_$m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non-monetised impacts_ | **Evidence certainty**  <br>_(High, medium or low)_ |
| **Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action** |     |     |     |
| Regulated parties | _Compliance costs:_ increased costs understanding the rules and applying them to transactions and structures for multinationals which currently engage in BEPS activities. Such taxpayers may choose to restructure which will involve compliance costs and the demand for APAs may increase. | Medium. However, they should only affect multinationals currently engaged in BEPS activities. | Medium |
| _Revenue_ | **$50 million per year** | Low\* |
| Regulators | _Administrative costs:_ Inland Revenue staff, particularly investigators and transfer pricing specialists, need to develop their knowledge of the proposals. | Low | High |
| Wider government |     |     |     |
| Other parties |     |     |     |
| **Total Monetised Cost** | _Revenue_ | **$50 million per year** | Low\* |
| **Non-monetised costs** | _Compliance costs_ | Medium | Medium |
| _Administrative costs_ | Low | High |
| **Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action** |     |     |     |
| Regulated parties |     |     |     |
| Regulators | _Tax payable:_ we are confident of collecting a significant amount of revenue from the proposals. | **$50 million per year** | Low\* |
| _Reduced administrative costs:_ More powers to both request multinationals’ offshore information and to investigate uncooperative multinationals should make investigating these types of BEPS arrangements easier. | Low | High |
| Wider government |     |     |     |
| Other parties |     |     |     |
| **Total Monetised Benefit** | _Revenue_ | **$50 million per year** | Low\* |
| **Non-monetised benefits** | _Reduced administrative costs_ | Low | Low |
| _Improved voluntary compliance_ by supporting the integrity of the tax system in a high profile area. | Low | Low |

\*Note that the evidence for the $50 million figure is a conservative estimate made in light of the behavioural uncertainty associated with introducing transfer pricing and PE avoidance rules together with the fact that the full extent of these types of avoidance arrangements affecting New Zealand is unknown. The actual revenue generated from these reforms may therefore be significantly higher, but this cannot be estimated with confidence.

### 5.3 What other impacts is this approach likely to have?

During consultation on the discussion document, some submitters raised concerns that adopting the proposed measures would have a detrimental impact on New Zealand being an attractive investment destination. In particular, these submitters were concerned that the proposed measures introduce complex and onerous rules which may incentivise foreign companies to remove their existing personnel from New Zealand, thereby reducing GDP and lowering employment levels.

The higher tax payments and compliance obligations resulting from these measures will inevitably make New Zealand a less attractive investment location for multinationals engaged in BEPS arrangements. However, at the same time, these multinationals should not be allowed to exploit weaknesses in our tax rules to achieve a competitive advantage over more compliant multinationals or domestic firms. Furthermore, arbitrary reductions in tax, depending upon the opportunism of taxpayers, are likely to distort the allocation of investment into New Zealand. New Zealand is also undertaking these BEPS measures in line with a number of like-minded countries throughout the OECD. Given this, we believe any impacts on foreign direct investment into New Zealand will not be material and implementing these measures remains in New Zealand’s best economic interests. It is also highly unlikely that foreign companies will remove their existing personnel from New Zealand as a result of these proposals. Most of the affected foreign companies are dependent on having personnel in New Zealand to arrange their sales. Without personnel on the ground, they would not be able to service their New Zealand market. It is also unlikely that they would cease to operate in New Zealand altogether.

### 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’?

Yes, option 4 (to adopt the package of measures in the discussion document) conforms to Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’.

* * *

### SECTION 6: IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION

* * *

### 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice?

The preferred option will be given effect through amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The bill, when introduced, will be accompanied by commentary in order to provide stakeholders with guidance as to the intended application of the provisions. Inland Revenue will also produce guidance on the enacted legislation in its _Tax Information Bulletin_ (TIB).

Once implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for ongoing operation and enforcement of the new rules. Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement these reforms.

The intended application date for most aspects of the regulatory proposal is for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018.

One exception is a grandparenting rule that exempts from application of the rules all advance pricing agreements (APAs) existing prior to the application date.

Some submitters on the discussion document argued that there needs to be sufficient lead-in time for these reforms to allow taxpayers to restructure their affairs if necessary. We consider the planned application date of 1 July 2018 (for most of the measures) to be sufficiently prospective when compared with the date of the discussion document release, which is when taxpayers should be regarded to be have been notified of the Government’s intention in this area, and the scheduled date of introduction of the relevant tax bill.

### 6.2 What are the implementation risks?

We do not consider there to be many implementation risks for Inland Revenue. As with any legislative proposal, there is the risk of technical drafting errors and unintended consequences. If and when these arise, they will be dealt with by remedial amendment.

In practice, these reforms will mostly involve changes for taxpayers rather than Inland Revenue. There is a risk that some taxpayers may not be able to restructure their arrangements or understand the rules in time to comply with their new obligations. To manage this risk, we plan on meeting with taxpayers and preparing detailed guidance materials.

* * *

### SECTION 7: MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW

* * *

### 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored?

In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation, and review of tax changes would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995.

Existing investigations functions for monitoring the behaviour of taxpayers will continue to be used for the proposed rules of this regulatory proposal.

When the MAAL was introduced in Australia, 18 companies restructured their affairs to bring their sales onshore (and a further 11 are currently working with the ATO to restructure). We envisage a similar response to our proposals whereby a number of taxpayers will restructure their affairs to report their sales in New Zealand. We also expect more taxpayers to apply for APAs as a result of the new transfer pricing rules. However, it will be difficult to assess the true impact of the transfer pricing proposals.

Inland Revenue are currently considering the appropriate level of information that should be collected to support the proposed rules for this regulatory proposal and for other BEPS proposals. This may be in the form of a disclosure statement made to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or it may form part of existing information gathering tools.

### 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed?

The final step in the GTPP process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. For example, a post-implementation workshop with stakeholders that participated in policy consultation sessions may be appropriate for these rules. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP.

If it became apparent that an aspect of the proposed rules is significantly unworkable, or if the rules have created unintended consequences whether tax-related or otherwise, this would justify a review of all or part of the legislation.

1 Most of the submitters were stakeholder groups, tax advisors, and foreign-owned firms that would be affected by the proposals.

2 The MLI allows countries to quickly and efficiently implement a number of the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan measures that can only be implemented through changes to DTAs, without having to bilaterally renegotiate their existing DTAs.

### BEPS – ADDRESSING HYBRID MISMATCH ARRANGEMENTS

### Proposal

1\. This paper seeks Cabinet approval to introduce new tax rules to address the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements. This paper is part of a comprehensive package of measures to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS).

### Executive summary

2\. Hybrid mismatch arrangements are, broadly speaking, cross-border arrangements that exploit differences in the tax treatment of an entity or instrument under the laws of two or more countries. The result of hybrid mismatch arrangements is less aggregate tax revenue collected in the jurisdictions to which the arrangement relates.

3\. The OECD, as part of its base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) Action Plan, published in late 2015 its final report on hybrid mismatch arrangements. This report recommended that countries enact a comprehensive set of rules to neutralise the benefit of hybrid mismatch arrangements affecting their tax base.

4\. The UK has legislated the OECD recommendations into their domestic law and Australia is committed to do the same. The EU has also issued a directive requiring its 28 member states (including the UK) to introduce anti-hybrid rules. We are not aware of any other countries intending to adopt a comprehensive set of rules, although many countries have more targeted anti-hybrid rules.

5\. The OECD recommendations will not apply to the vast majority of taxpayers. They will not apply to purely domestic firms. They apply mainly to related parties of multinational groups and planned arrangements. The expected outcome of the OECD recommendations is that the tax benefit of hybrid mismatch arrangements is eliminated, in most cases influencing taxpayers to switch to more straightforward cross-border financing instruments and structures.

6\. The Government released a discussion document in September 2016 called _Addressing Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements_ which proposed that the OECD recommendations be adopted in New Zealand and asked for feedback on how that should best be done. Since receiving submissions to this document, officials have engaged stakeholders in targeted consultation on specific design issues relating to the proposal. Consultation has resulted in some of the proposals being modified, such as a proposed exclusion from the rules for New Zealand businesses that operate offshore only through a simple branch structure. Nevertheless, many taxpayers affected by these proposals will still oppose them. Some would prefer to see a targeted approach, which would only tackle hybrids that have already been observed in New Zealand.

7\. However, in order to send the clear message that using hybrid mismatch arrangements should not produce a tax advantage, we are recommending that Cabinet agree to a comprehensive adoption of the OECD recommendations on hybrid mismatch arrangements with suitable modifications for the New Zealand context. To do otherwise may simply encourage the ongoing use of hybrids not covered by any targeted proposal. Other issues raised through the consultation process, and which are likely to attract the most comment (such as the application of the rules to foreign trusts) are set out in paragraphs 24-38 of this paper.

8\. We are further recommending that hybrids rules be included in a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced to Parliament before the end of 2017.

### Background

#### BEPS

9\. New Zealand’s BEPS work programme has largely been driven by a wider momentum that has developed since 2012, when the OECD/G20 began work on their BEPS Action Plan,. Its final package of reports was released in October 2015. The Action Plan is a multifaceted approach intending to encourage countries to close many (but not all) of the avenues multinational companies currently use to reduce their worldwide tax liability, and to improve the information available to governments when they deal with multinational companies, without changing the fundamental principles for the taxation of international trade and investment.

10\. As a member of the OECD Council, New Zealand approved the 2015 BEPS final package and has supported the BEPS Action Plan since the OECD’s first declaration on BEPS in 2013.

#### Hybrid mismatch arrangements

11\. Hybrid mismatch arrangements are a significant base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) strategy used by some multinational companies to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world on some or all of their income. They are, broadly speaking, cross-border arrangements that exploit differences in the tax treatment of an entity or instrument under the laws of two or more countries to achieve double non-taxation.

12\. One way in which this double non-taxation can arise is through a payment being deductible for a payer in one country but not included as taxable income for the payee in the other country. Another way double non-taxation can arise is by way of a single payment being deducted against different income streams in two countries.

13\. Double non-taxation of this kind is difficult to deal with, because it can be achieved even though both countries’ tax rules are being complied with. However, it clearly reduces fairness, causes harmful distortions in investment patterns, and results in an unintended reduction in aggregate tax revenues. It is often difficult to determine which of the countries involved has lost tax revenue through the use of a hybrid mismatch arrangement, but there is undoubtedly a reduction of worldwide tax paid.

#### The OECD’s response

14\. The OECD has made a number of recommendations as to how countries can improve their domestic rules to prevent mismatches arising and neutralise their effect when they do arise. These recommendations relate to Action 2 of the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan: Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements.

15\. The OECD recommends two kinds of rules. The first are rules specifically designed to reduce the likelihood of hybrid mismatches arising. The second are “linking rules”, which apply to payments that give rise to a deduction in more than one country, or which give rise to a deduction in one country but are not taxed as income in another country due to a hybrid mismatch. These generally only apply to:

*   arrangements between related parties (25% or more commonly owned) or control groups (50% or more commonly owned); or
*   structured arrangements - generally, arrangements between non-associated parties which intentionally exploit such mismatches.

16\. These linking rules are divided into “primary” and “secondary” responses. Primary responses have precedence, with secondary responses being used if the country that has the primary right does not have hybrid rules. This primary/secondary structure is important for ensuring that all hybrids with a connection to New Zealand are effectively countered irrespective of where the counterparty is based.

17\. The OECD has also developed an additional BEPS Action 2 report that makes a number of recommendations as to how countries can deal with the problem of branch mismatch arrangements which is closely related to the hybrid mismatches issue.

#### Other countries

18\. The UK has introduced into its domestic law rules that reflect a broad adoption of the OECD recommendations. Australia has proposed to do the same and, as part of its 2017 Budget, committed to introduce rules that are effective by 1 January 2018 or six months following Royal assent.[\[1\]](#footnote1)
 The EU has issued a directive requiring its 28 member states (including the UK) to introduce anti-hybrid rules by 1 January 2020. We are not aware of any other countries intending to adopt a comprehensive set of rules, although many countries have more targeted anti-hybrid rules.

#### Hybrids discussion document

19\. On 6 September 2016, the Government released a discussion document entitled “Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements” seeking feedback on proposals to address hybrid mismatch arrangements in line with the OECD recommendations \[CAB-16-MIN-0442\].

20\. 20 submissions were received on the discussion document. Most submitters accepted the need for some hybrid rules, with some submitters expressing support for New Zealand to take action in line with the OECD hybrids package, subject to various provisos, including that it was done in a co-ordinated fashion with other jurisdictions and/or that there should be concessions for hybrid regulatory capital. The majority of submissions argued that we should only implement rules to counter hybrid mismatches actually observed in New Zealand, rather than the full suite of OECD recommendations.

### Comment

#### Implementing the full OECD hybrids package

21\. As set out in the cover Cabinet paper (_Tax measures to counter base erosion and profit shifting_), we are recommending that Cabinet agree to a comprehensive implementation of the OECD’s proposed solutions to the hybrid and branch mismatch problem, , even though there was limited evidence of some of the structures being used in New Zealand. We are of the view that the OECD proposals are in New Zealand’s best interests, as enacting these recommendations will improve fairness, reduce harmful distortions in investment patterns, increase tax revenue, and will also address the risk of taxpayers using new hybrid mismatch opportunities if only the more common techniques are addressed initially.

22\. In making this recommendation, we recognise that these proposals involve considerable complexity, which will not generally be welcomed by those taxpayers affected. However, we are comfortable that there are a number of factors that outweigh these concerns:

*   We are proposing to modify the OECD recommendations when it is appropriate to do so for the New Zealand context. Examples are ensuring New Zealand companies with simple foreign branch structures are not caught by the rules (see “application of hybrids rules to foreign branches” below), not applying the rules to purely domestic firms, and not introducing rules when an adequate New Zealand provision already exists.
*   We are recommending that officials continue to consult on a few particular issues that have the potential to ease the compliance costs of the proposals before we make a final decision on them under Cabinet delegated authority. These consist of elective options which would in effect allow existing hybrids to be treated as simple equity investments.
*   Despite the necessary complexity, the underlying principle is clear – using hybrid mismatches as a tax-efficient means of inbound, outbound or conduit investment is not appropriate.
*   We are recommending that relevant parties be consulted on exposure drafts of key aspects of the legislation. This is intended to facilitate workable legislation that is understandable to those applying it.
*   In almost all cases, the complexity will be optional. Taxpayers can avoid having to deal with these rules by undertaking simple debt or equity funding.

23\. Some of the other more significant issues relating to this proposal are set out below. Those are followed by a brief explanation of each of the OECD recommendations and the principles behind them. The appendix contains a series of detailed aspects of the proposals that we are also seeking Cabinet’s agreement to. These details have been consulted on with interested parties, and are consistent with the general recommendations set out below.

### Significant issues

##### Foreign trusts

24\. As set out in the cover Cabinet paper, we are recommending that foreign trusts be included within the scope of these rules in circumstances where their treatment outside of New Zealand means income of the trust is not included in a tax calculation anywhere in the world. This is not because they are foreign trusts, but because in those circumstances they are “reverse hybrids” according to the OECD recommendations (see the discussion on OECD Recommendation 5.2, below). The same rule would equally impose tax on New Zealand limited partnerships that fit within the reverse hybrids definition.

25\. We are aware that foreign trusts have recently had a new set of disclosure rules apply to them following the 2016 Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules. In this respect, adding another regulatory regime to the industry now is unfortunate timing. To reflect the fact that these trusts have recently undergone significant compliance costs, and to give the foreign trust and limited partnership industries more time to understand the implications of the proposed rules, we are recommending a delayed effective date for New Zealand reverse hybrids of 1 April 2019.

##### Application of hybrid rules to foreign branches

26\. The way in which the OECD recommendations are written would in some circumstances deny a New Zealand company the ability to offset a loss from its foreign branch against its New Zealand income. This is an issue that some submitters have been very concerned about.

27\. We have made various modifications to the OECD recommendations to address this issue, including clarifying that taxpayers who have simple offshore branch structures do not present a hybrid mismatch problem and so are not covered by the rules.

##### Imported mismatches

28\. OECD recommendation 8 suggests countries include an “imported mismatch” rule when implementing hybrid and branch mismatch rules. Imported mismatch rules apply when the New Zealand resident is not directly involved in the hybrid mismatch, but the benefit of a mismatch is “imported”. Some submitters on the discussion document viewed this particular recommendation as over-reach, highly complex and impractical.

29\. To address these concerns, we recommend that the introduction of the imported mismatch rule be different for “structured” and “unstructured” arrangements. Structured arrangements are deliberately entered into to obtain a tax advantage, so should be implemented at the same time as the rest of the hybrid rules. By contrast, unstructured arrangements are ones where the New Zealand benefit is not the primary reason for entering into the arrangement. We recommend that the unstructured rule has a delayed implementation date of 1 January 2020. By this date, we expect that the EU countries, the UK, and Australia will all have hybrid rules. Delaying the implementation of the unstructured rule until those countries have similar rules will reduce the costs involved in complying with the rule in New Zealand because, by that time, multinationals that are also operating in those countries should already be complying with their equivalent rules, and also because payments to those countries will not be subject to the imported mismatch rule at all. More details regarding the imported mismatch rule are contained later in this paper.

##### Over-taxation by reason of the imposition of NRWT

30\. The OECD recommends that countries apply the hybrid rules without regard to any withholding tax collected on the relevant payments. In situations where New Zealand imposes non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on an interest payment that is also denied a deduction under the hybrid rules, there may be over-taxation.

31\. As far as our officials are aware, Australia is not planning on departing from the OECD approach. An argument for this approach is that in the majority of cases taxpayers can simply switch to simpler structures and arrangements and be subject to only single taxation. The OECD approach is also less complicated. Nevertheless, there has been an argument from some submitters that the hybrid rules should be modified in New Zealand so as to remove this potential over-taxation for taxpayers that choose to remain in hybrid structures.

32\. We recommend that in the case of a hybrid financial instrument, there needs to be further consideration of the possibility of letting taxpayers treat the payment as a dividend. This would allow them to eliminate NRWT by attaching imputation credits to the payment. We recommend that Cabinet delegate the authority to determine the appropriateness of such an approach to us to decide after receiving further advice. For hybrid arrangements other than financial instruments, we are less concerned about the imposition of NRWT. Although there may be some over-taxation, in many cases this will simply be a timing issue.

##### Grandparenting for certain instruments issued by banks to the public

33\. We recommend that there be an exception to the rules for certain hybrid instruments (“hybrid regulatory capital”) issued by banks and insurance companies either directly or indirectly to third party investors, in partial satisfaction of the capital requirements imposed on those companies by regulators (such as the Reserve Bank and its Australian equivalent, APRA). We recommend that such instruments issued before the date of the discussion document release (6 September 2016) should not be subject to the hybrid rules until the first date on which the issuer has an unconditional right to call or otherwise cancel the instruments without penalty.

34\. This grandparenting date is different to the date proposed in Australia, which is 8 May 2017 (the day before their Federal Budget). We consider differing from Australia is justified in this case. The Australian Government had made public the fact that it was considering how such instruments should be taxed, and did not make an announcement until its 2017 Budget. In New Zealand the hybrids discussion document released on 6 September stated that such instruments would be subject to the hybrid rules. To grandparent instruments issued after the New Zealand discussion document may be seen as encouraging taxpayers to enter into aggressive structures after the government has stated an intention to change the rules but before that change is enacted. We are wary of creating an expectation that such arrangements will be grandparented.

##### Opaque election for foreign hybrid entities

35\. The private sector has proposed that a New Zealand investor in a foreign hybrid entity be entitled to elect to treat the entity as tax opaque (like a company) in New Zealand to remove the hybridity and put that entity outside the scope of the rules. Our initial view is that excluding simple branch structures from the rules, and the ability of hybrid participants to restructure their arrangements, may make such an election redundant. Nevertheless, we have asked officials to continue their consideration of how such an election may work in practice, including whether the costs of administering it for what may be a relatively small group are justified. We recommend that Cabinet delegate to us the authority to decide on the appropriateness of an opaque election.

##### Application of rules to branch mismatch arrangements

36\. Consultation on branch mismatches has taken place but has not been as comprehensive as that for the remainder of the hybrid proposals. In part this is because such mismatches are less significant for New Zealand, and in part because the OECD draft report on branches was released at around the same time as the New Zealand discussion document, and the proposal was therefore less well developed. Nevertheless, we recommend that New Zealand implement rules that are consistent with the OECD recommendations on branch mismatches (this is also consistent with the approach that has been taken by the UK and which we understand will be taken by Australia). Branch mismatches arising from foreign branch losses are a double non-taxation risk and to leave them out of these proposals would expose the tax base to future risk. The remainder of the branch mismatch concerns addressed are very unlikely to arise in a New Zealand context. They will apply mostly to deny a deduction for a payment made by a New Zealand taxpayer to a foreign member of the same control group, if that payment is not taxed to the foreign member due to conflicts in branch tax rules between two countries other than New Zealand.

##### De minimis rule

37\. We recommend that there be no general de minimis for the hybrid rules. We believe that a de minimis may cause additional complexity given that other countries are not proposing a de minimis in their hybrid mismatch rules. This means that any de minimis would likely be ineffective in practice because the other country would still counter the hybrid mismatch using their secondary response right. Also, our proposals will ensure that simple branch structures (the most likely beneficiaries of a de minimis) are not within the scope of the rules.

38\. We do however recommend that there should be specific de minimis rules for reverse hybrid entities established in New Zealand (see paragraphs 55-57).

### OECD recommendations

#### Hybrid financial instrument rules (Recommendations 1 and 2)

39\. The following diagram illustrates a typical hybrid financial instrument issued between related parties A Co and B Co.

![A typical hybrid financial instrument issued between related parties A Co and B Co](-/media/8478fa9f7fcf4773bd706c7aa4f30e36.ashx)

40\. Double non-taxation arises in this situation because the payment on the hybrid financial instrument is deductible (as interest) in Country B but not taxable (because it is treated as an exempt dividend) in Country A.

41\. OECD recommendation 2 is a specific recommendation that countries should amend their domestic law so that dividend payments that are deductible to the payer (B Co) should be treated as ordinary income for the payee (A Co).

42\. New Zealand already has a rule that switches off the general exemption for dividends received by a New Zealand company from a foreign company, if the dividend is deductible to the payer. We recommend that this rule be expanded to also apply if the foreign payer receives tax benefits similar in nature to a deduction.

43\. We also recommend introducing rules in line with the general principles of OECD recommendation 1. This means that, in relation to hybrid financial instruments that are structured or between related parties, we should deny a New Zealand payer a deduction for the payment (when New Zealand is Country B) to the extent it is not taxed to a non-resident payee. It is in respect of this aspect of recommendation 1 that we are considering the election to treat interest payments as dividends. In addition, when New Zealand is Country A and Country B does not have hybrid rules, we should tax the New Zealand payee on the payment as ordinary income, with no entitlement to a tax credit.

44\. We also recommend that when there is a timing mismatch that allows a deduction to be claimed in one country in a period that is significantly earlier than the period in which income is included in the other country, the rules above should also apply.

#### Disregarded hybrid payments rule (Recommendation 3)

45\. A hybrid entity is an entity which is transparent for tax purposes in the country of an investor (Country A) but opaque for tax purposes in another country, generally where it is established (Country B). In the following diagram, B Co is the hybrid entity.

![An example of a hybrid entity](-/media/4e6dd71b84d346269204bdf026f1aaf0.ashx)

46\. The interest payment by B Co is deductible in the hybrid entity country (Country B) but disregarded in the investor country (Country A) because Country A sees B Co as being part of A Co and therefore not capable of making a payment to itself. However, as the interest payment by B Co is deductible in Country B, if B Co has no other income, the payment produces a tax loss, which can be grouped with the income of B Sub 1. The payment can therefore reduce taxable income in Country B without giving rise to any income in Country A, because of the different treatment of B Co in each country. This is a deductible/non-includible mismatch.

47\. We recommend introducing rules in line with the general principles of OECD recommendation 3 in order to prevent double non-taxation arising from a payment by a hybrid entity. We recommend that, when New Zealand is Country B and payments are deductible here but are disregarded for tax purposes in Country A (and the payments are part of a structured arrangement or made to a person in the same control group), we should deny a deduction for the payment. Similarly, if New Zealand is Country A and the non-resident payer in Country B has not been denied a deduction for the payment under similar rules, we should tax the receipt by the New Zealand payee as ordinary income.

48\. We recommend that deductions denied and income included by the above rules should be reversible to the extent that the hybrid entity has earned “dual inclusion income”, being income taxed in both Country A and Country B. This is because this dual inclusion income is included as income in both countries so the corresponding deduction should also be allowed in both countries. The dual inclusion income can be earned in the same period as the payment is made, in an earlier period, or in a later period.

#### Reverse hybrid rules (Recommendations 4 and 5)

49\. A reverse hybrid entity is an entity which is opaque for tax purposes in the country of an investor (Country A) but transparent for tax purposes in another country, generally where it is established (Country B). In the following diagram, B Co is the reverse hybrid.

![An example of a reverse hybrid](-/media/8543630d30ba4e42a24cb1b8347beead.ashx)

50\. If B Co (the payee) is a reverse hybrid, double non-taxation arises because the interest payment is deductible to C Co (the payer) and not taxable to either B Co or A Co (the investor). Even on distribution by B Co to A Co it may not be taxable, if protected by an exemption for cross border intra-group dividends. The double non-taxation is due to a hybrid mismatch if the payment would have been taxable had it been made directly from C Co to A Co.

51\. We recommend introducing rules in line with the general principles of OECD recommendation 4 to prevent double non-taxation arising from a payment to a reverse hybrid. We recommend that, when New Zealand is Country C, the New Zealand payer be denied a deduction for a payment to a reverse hybrid if the payment would have been taxed if paid directly to the investor (A Co). This rule would only apply when the payer, payee and investor are all in a control group or the payment is part of a structured arrangement.

52\. OECD recommendation 5.1 is that countries should change their domestic law so that they tax residents on income not taxed in another country due to its being earned by a reverse hybrid. In other words, when New Zealand is Country A, we should tax A Co on the income of B Co if Country B does not tax it (because it treats B Co as transparent for tax purposes).

53\. We recommend that New Zealand should have rules that are in line with the general principles of recommendation 5.1 and other international tax principles. New Zealand already has controlled foreign companies (CFC) rules that in most cases would prevent a reverse hybrid entity mismatch outcome from occurring when a New Zealand resident is the investor (A Co). We recommend that Cabinet delegate authority to us to determine whether our current CFC rules should be enhanced to deal with any forms of reverse hybrid income not currently dealt with, in line with the general principles of recommendation 5.1.

54\. OECD recommendation 5.2 is that countries should change their domestic law so that they tax income which is earned by a reverse hybrid entity established in their country. So, when New Zealand is Country B, we recommend introducing rules in line with the general principles of this recommendation. As set out in the cover Cabinet paper and in paragraphs 24-25, this will require amendments to existing law regarding New Zealand limited partnerships and foreign trusts, which can be reverse hybrid entities depending on the tax treatment in the investor country.

55\. In regards to limited partnerships, we recommend taxing the partnership income of a non-resident partner if they are in a control group with the partnership and not taxed on their share of the partnership income because their jurisdiction views the income as earned by the partnership as a separate taxpayer from the partner. This rule will only apply if the limited partnership has total foreign-sourced income of greater than $10,000 or 20% of its total income. This de minimis rule, and the corresponding one for foreign trusts in the following paragraphs, is consistent with the recently-enacted de minimis rule for foreign sourced income of look-through companies.

56\. In regards to foreign trusts, we recommend taxing the foreign-source trustee income of the trust, provided that the non-resident settlor and trust are all in a control group. Many family trusts would meet this requirement. Foreign source trustee income will only be taxed if the non-resident settlor is not taxed on the trustee income in their residence country simply because the income is earned by the New Zealand trustee rather than the settlor directly. This rule will only apply if the trust has total foreign-sourced income of greater than $10,000 or 20% of its total income.

57\. We also recommend taxing the foreign-source beneficiary income of a non-resident beneficiary of a foreign trust if they are not taxed on the income in their residence country because that country views the income as earned by the trustee and not the beneficiary. This rule will only apply if the trust has total foreign-sourced income of greater than $10,000 or 20% of its total income, and the non-resident beneficiary is part of a control group with the trust/trustee. In relation to both beneficiary and trustee income, tax would only be imposed if there was no-one else in the same control group required to include that income in their taxable income.

58\. OECD recommendation 5.3 is that countries should consider improvements to record keeping and disclosure rules for tax transparent entities established in their country. Following the 2016 Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules, the disclosure rules for foreign trusts have been enhanced. New Zealand is regularly reviewed by the OECD to ensure that we are meeting international standards in this area. The Government will continue to work with the OECD and make improvements to disclosure rules as necessary to ensure compliance with best practice.

59\. We note that Australia has indicated that it is unlikely to implement any of recommendation 5 at this point – this is largely because they see their existing rules as adequate. However, they have reserved the right to do so in the future if integrity concerns arise. We are not as confident that our existing rules in relation to reverse hybrids are adequate to prevent mismatches from occurring. As set out above, we are concerned that leaving ‘gaps’ in our rules exposes our tax base to risks that can be mitigated by following all of the OECD’s recommendations.

#### Hybrid entities – double deductions (Recommendation 6)

60\. In addition to being capable of generating a deductible/non-inclusion hybrid mismatch, a hybrid entity can also be used to generate a double deduction mismatch. A diagram illustrating this possibility follows, where B Co is the hybrid entity.

![An example of a hybrid entity used to generate a double deduction mismatch](-/media/8f159a30e4bd496db9ce7bec7cf1ba3d.ashx)

61\. Because A Co treats B Co as fiscally transparent, in Country A the interest paid by B Co is deductible against A Co’s other income. In Country B the interest payment can offset income earned by B Sub 1, which is in a tax consolidated group with B Co. This is a double non-taxation outcome because a single payment has been deducted against different income in two countries.

62\. In Budget 2017 Cabinet agreed to restrict the ability of New Zealand businesses to use double deductions of foreign hybrid entities to reduce their tax liabilities in New Zealand \[CAB-17-MIN-0164\]. This means that, when New Zealand is Country A, the deductions in B Co would not flow back to New Zealand if it is possible for that deduction to also offset Country B income that does not flow back to A Co (in this case, the income of B Sub 1).

63\. Nothing in this paper is inconsistent with that specific decision. However, as mentioned in paragraph 26-27, we are recommending a slightly narrowed approach to the OECD recommendation 6, whereby simple structures involving a New Zealand company with only an offshore branch would not fall within the scope of the rules.

64\. We also recommend implementing a rule that would, when New Zealand is Country B, disallow the losses of a foreign-owned New Zealand hybrid entity or branch when the country of the owner (Country A) has not denied the loss.

65\. As with the recommendation 3 rule, denial of a deduction under the recommendation 6 rule should be reversed to the extent that the hybrid entity has dual inclusion income, whether in the current period, an earlier period, or a later period.

#### Dual resident entities (Recommendation 7)

66\. OECD recommendation 7 is that countries should deny a deduction to dual resident companies except to the extent of dual inclusion income. Expenditure incurred by a company that is a resident of two different countries can potentially be used in each country to offset non-dual inclusion income, which is income taxed only in that country. This would achieve the same double deduction outcomes that hybrid entities can produce under recommendation 6 (above).

67\. New Zealand tax law already prevents a dual resident company from grouping its losses or forming a tax consolidated group. However, it does not prevent them offsetting expenditure against non-dual inclusion income earned through a reverse hybrid, such as (potentially) a New Zealand limited liability partnership. We recommend that New Zealand amend its existing rules relating to losses incurred by dual resident companies, to ensure they are fully effective to prevent deductions being taken against non-dual inclusion income.

#### Imported mismatches (Recommendation 8)

68\. As set out in paragraphs 28-29, we recommend that New Zealand introduce rules in line with OECD recommendation 8 to deny a deduction for a payment that funds another payment under a hybrid mismatch, including a branch mismatch. This is referred to as an imported mismatch rule. An example follows.

![A hybrid mismatch, including a branch mismatch](-/media/12f72b9a7f594741aaa253990ccb3144.ashx)

69\. In this example, New Zealand is Country C. The loan between A Co and B Co generates a deduction in Country B, with no corresponding income inclusion in Country A. This is a double non-taxation outcome. However, this tax mismatch is not counteracted because neither Country A nor Country B has hybrid rules. The tax benefit of the A/B mismatch helps fund the seemingly benign arrangement between B Co and the New Zealand entity (Borrower Co).

70\. The imported mismatch rule would require New Zealand, as Country C, to deny a deduction for interest payments from Borrower Co to B Co to the extend they do not exceed the payments under the hybrid financial instrument between B Co and A Co. This is an integrity measure that prevents New Zealand’s other hybrid rules from being circumvented. Without this rule, businesses in Country A can simply avoid our proposed rules by going from A to C via B.

71\. We recommend that the imported mismatch rule applies to both structured arrangements that are designed to produce an imported mismatch outcome, and unstructured arrangements within a control group. However, because unstructured arrangements may not be deliberately contemplated, we are recommending a delayed implementation for those arrangements until more countries, the EU countries in particular, have hybrids rules in place.

### Agency consultation

72\. The consultation on this project has been explained in the cover Cabinet paper. Briefly, there have been two rounds of consultation: one on the proposals in the discussion document; and a further round with selected submitters on branch mismatches and some of the detailed aspects set out in this paper.

### Financial implications

73\. The proposed hybrid rule denying double deductions for foreign hybrid entities is estimated to increase tax revenue by $50 million per year from the 2019-20 year onwards. These amounts are already included in the forecasts as per Budget 2017 (CAB-17-MIN-0164).

74\. In addition, the proposed approach to grandparenting certain hybrid instruments as discussed at paragraphs 33-34 is expected to generate a total of $71 million over four years which is not currently included in the forecasts. This revenue is contingent on taxpayer behaviour after the implementation of the hybrid rules.

75\. The combined revenue impact of all proposals is estimated as:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |$ million – increase / (decrease)

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Foreign hybrid entity double deductions (already included in forecast) | 0   | 0   | 25  | 50  | 50  | 50  | 50  |

| **Total revenue effect** | **0** | **0** | **44** | **69** | **69** | **64** | **50** |

### Human rights, administrative impacts, legislative implications, publicity

76\. These are set out in the accompanying covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (_Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting_).

### Impact Analysis Requirements

77\. Cabinet's Impact Analysis Requirements apply to these proposals and a Regulatory Impact Assessment is required. This has been prepared by Inland Revenue and is attached.

78\. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Regulatory Impact Assessment and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria.

### Recommendations

79\. We recommend that Cabinet:

1\. **Agree** that for payments under a financial instrument between related parties or that is a structured arrangement, and that results in a hybrid mismatch:

a. to deny a New Zealand payer a deduction for the payment to the extent it is not taxed to a non-resident payee (OECD recommendation 1 primary rule); and

b. if a non-resident payer has not been denied a deduction for the payment under similar rules, to tax a New Zealand payee on the payment as ordinary income, with no entitlement to a tax credit (OECD recommendation 1 defensive rule).

2\. **Agree** to expand New Zealand’s current rule which denies a dividend exemption to a deductible dividend paid by a foreign company to a New Zealand company so that it also applies if the foreign payer receives tax benefits similar in nature to a deduction (OECD recommendation 2).

3\. **Agree** that for payments made to a person in the same control group as the payee or pursuant to a structured transaction, where the payment is deductible to the payer but not recognised under the tax law in the payee country because the payment is disregarded under that law:

a. to deny a deduction for the payment if made by a New Zealand payer (OECD recommendation 3 primary rule);

b. if the payment is made by a non-resident, who is not denied a deduction under similar rules, to a New Zealand resident, to include the payment in ordinary income of the New Zealand resident (OECD recommendation 3 defensive rule);

c. to allow any such deduction or income inclusion to be reversed to the extent that the deduction to the payer is set off against income that is included as income in both relevant countries (“dual inclusion income”).

4\. **Agree** to deny a New Zealand payer a deduction in relation to payments made to a reverse hybrid entity in the same control group as the payer or pursuant to a structured transaction, where the payment is deductible to the payer but not included as income under the tax law in the reverse hybrid establishment country or in the country of the entity or person investing in the reverse hybrid entity (OECD recommendation 4).

5\. **Agree** that New Zealand should tax the income of a reverse hybrid established in New Zealand (such as a foreign trust or a limited partnership) to the extent that:

a. the reverse hybrid income is not subject to tax in another jurisdiction (OECD recommendation 5.2); and

b. the total foreign sourced income of the reverse hybrid exceeds the greater of $10,000 or 20% of the total income of the reverse hybrid.

6\. **Agree** to the following in relation to double deduction outcomes produced by branches and hybrid entity structures:

a. disallow the losses of a New Zealand-owned foreign hybrid entity or foreign branch if there is another entity in that foreign country whose income is capable of being offset against the losses of the hybrid entity or branch and that income is not taxable in New Zealand (modified OECD recommendation 6 primary);

b. disallow the losses of a foreign-owned New Zealand hybrid entity or branch if the owner of the branch is not denied the loss under recommendation 6 primary rule in another country (OECD recommendation 6 defensive); and

c. do not disallow losses (or reverse any previous disallowance) to the extent that the hybrid entity or branch earns dual inclusion income.

7\. **Agree** to deny a deduction claimed in New Zealand by a dual resident company except to the extent that the dual resident company earns dual inclusion income (OECD recommendation 7).

8\. **Agree** to deny a deduction in New Zealand for any payment that imports an offshore hybrid or branch mismatch arrangement into New Zealand, except to the extent that the payment is made to a country that has hybrid mismatch rules (OECD recommendation 8).

9\. **Note** that, consistent with the Budget 2017 Cabinet paper (CAB-17-MIN-0164 refers), the hybrid rules should generally apply from 1 July 2018.

10\. **Agree** that the effective date of the rule relating to unstructured imported mismatches (part of recommendation 8 above) should be delayed until 1 January 2020.

11\. **Agree** that the application of the rule relating to New Zealand reverse hybrids (recommendation 5 above) should be for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2019.

12\. **Agree** that there will be no general grandparenting of hybrid instruments or entities from the application of the hybrid mismatch rules, with the exception of hybrid financial instruments which are entitled to grandparented tax treatment until their next call date provided that they are:

a. issued to satisfy the regulatory capital requirements imposed by New Zealand or Australian law;

b. directly to, or are traceable to, issues to the public; and

c. issued before the release of the Government’s _Addressing Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements_ discussion document on 6 September 2016.

13\. **Note** that the fiscal consequences of agreeing to recommendation 12 above is set out in the covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (_Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting_).

14\. **Agree** to the detailed design proposals set out in the appendix to this paper.

15\. **Agree** that the Ministers of Finance and Revenue be authorised to make decisions on further detail of these proposals, or to amend the detail in the appendix, provided any such decisions are not contradictory with the principles set out in recommendations 1 to 12, without further reference to Cabinet.

16\. **Agree** to delegate authority to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to make final policy decisions on the following policy issues without further reference to Cabinet:

a. whether New Zealand’s controlled foreign company (CFC) rules should be modified to include as attributable foreign income all income of a reverse hybrid entity which would have been taxed to the New Zealand investor had it derived the income directly but which is not taxed by the country of the entity because the entity is treated as fiscally transparent in that country (OECD recommendation 5.1);

b. whether New Zealand can and should include a tightly targeted and simple optional regime whereby foreign hybrid entities can elect to be treated as opaque entities for New Zealand tax purposes; and

c. whether, the payer under a hybrid financial arrangement for which a deduction is denied, should be allowed to treat the payment as a dividend for purposes of both (but not only one of) the non-resident withholding tax and the imputation credit rules.

17\. **Agree** that the results of the decisions in recommendations 1-16 be included in a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced to Parliament before the end of 2017.

Authorised for lodgement

### Appendix - List of detailed design decisions

|     | OECD Recommendations 1 and 2 |
| --- | --- |
| 1.  | A person who receives a payment which is deductible to the payer in another country will not be entitled to the benefit of any imputation credit attached to the payment. |
| 2.  | When the hybrid rules apply to a hybrid financial instrument issued by a New Zealand taxpayer and denominated in a foreign currency, the deduction denied will take into account any foreign currency fluctuations on the instrument which would otherwise be taken into account for tax purposes, and any net income from the instrument including any foreign currency fluctuations will be non-taxable. |
| 3.  | When the hybrid rules apply to a hybrid financial instrument held by a New Zealand taxpayer and denominated in a foreign currency, the taxpayer will not take into account any foreign currency fluctuations on the instrument, unless the instrument is an interest in a FIF which is subject to the comparative value method. |
| 4.  | To the extent that a payment on a hybrid financial instrument can be proven to give rise to taxation of an investor in the payee entity under another country’s controlled foreign company (CFC) regime, the payer will be allowed a deduction for the payment. |
| 5.  | If a person holds a FIF interest as part of a share repo arrangement, that person will be required to use the comparative value or attributed foreign income method to determine their income from the FIF interest. |
| 6.  | If a person holds New Zealand shares as part of a share repo arrangement, where the borrower is a non-resident, the person is not entitled to the benefit of an imputation credit attached to any dividends on the shares. |
| 7.  | OECD recommendation 1 will only apply to timing mismatches if:<br><br>*   the mismatch arises on an instrument with a term of 3 years or more or on an instrument that has been extended to beyond 3 years; and<br>*   the lender is not accounting for the payment, for tax purposes, on a reasonable accrual basis; and<br>*   it is not reasonable, having regard to the terms of the instrument and the payments made to date, to believe that the expenditure will be included in income in the payee’s accounting period beginning within 24 months of the end of the period in which the expenditure is incurred. |
| 8.  | Amendments be made to the non-resident withholding tax rules so that in determining whether the rules require tax to be withheld on an accrual (rather than payments) basis, amounts for which a deduction is denied or deferred under OECD recommendation 1 are not taken into account unless and until they are deducted. |
| 9.  | Interest that is permanently denied a deduction under recommendation 1 and the debt under which that interest paid is disregarded for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules. |
| 10. | There will be no exclusion for regulatory capital issued by banks and insurance companies except for some issues made before the release of the discussion document (6 September 2016). |

|     | OECD Recommendation 3 |
| --- | --- |
| 11. | Any foreign currency fluctuations recognised for tax purposes in relation to a financial arrangement denominated in a foreign currency will be taken into account when denying a deduction to a New Zealand payer. |
| 12. | Dual inclusion income will be calculated in accordance with New Zealand tax principles on the income of the hybrid payer from activities that are taxed in New Zealand, except that it will not include income which is protected from New Zealand tax by a foreign tax credit. |
| 13. | For the purposes of denying a deduction for a New Zealand payer, full taxation of income under a CFC regime will prevent income being treated as not taxable to a payee and will qualify income as dual inclusion income where it is not otherwise taxed to the payee and is not sheltered from tax by a foreign tax credit. |
| 14. | When an amount of deemed hybrid income is reversed in a later year because it is offset against dual inclusion income, that will be taken into account in determining the limit on the amount of foreign tax credit for which a New Zealand taxpayer applying the defensive rule is eligible. |
| 15. | The ability to claim a deduction in relation to a later year due to future dual inclusion income will be lost if there is a more than 51% change in a company’s ownership since the time the relevant deduction was incurred or deemed expenditure arose. |
| 16. | Amendments be made to the non-resident withholding tax rules so that in determining whether the rules require tax to be withheld on an accrual (rather than payments) basis, amounts for which a deduction is deferred under OECD recommendation 3 are not taken into account unless and until they are deducted. |
| 17. | Denial of a deduction for interest under recommendation 3 will not affect the amount of recognised interest or amount of debt for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules. |
| 18. | A deduction would be denied where a branch is treated in the branch country as making a deductible payment to its head office which is not a simple allocation of third party costs. |
| 19. | Where a New Zealand taxpayer has recognized income as a result of receiving a disregarded payment from a foreign hybrid entity, that income will be reversed in a later year when there is dual inclusion income earned through the hybrid entity. |

|     | OECD Recommendation 4 |
| --- | --- |
| 20. | Diverted branch payments and payments made to a disregarded branch are included within the scope of recommendation 4. |
| 21. | Recommendation 4 deduction denial in respect of a payment under a foreign currency loan includes foreign currency gains or losses. |
| 22. | To the extent a payment to a reverse hybrid can be proven to be taxed under the CFC regime of an investor country, a deduction will be allowed. |
| 23. | Non-resident withholding tax will continue to be applied to payments, despite the denial of the deduction |
| 24. | Interest that is denied a deduction under recommendation 4 and the debt under which that interest paid is disregarded for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules. |

|     | OECD Recommendation 5.2 |
| --- | --- |
| 25. | Tax the partnership income of a non-resident partner of a New Zealand limited partnership if the non-resident partner is in a control group with the partnership and the non-resident partner is not taxed on their share of the income of the partnership because their jurisdiction views the income as earned by the partnership and not by the partner. |
| 26. | Tax a New Zealand resident trustee on foreign-sourced beneficiary income allocated to a non-resident beneficiary as if the trustee were a New Zealand resident individual taxpayer to the extent that:<br><br>*   the beneficiary is in the same control group as the trustee; and<br>*   the beneficiary would be taxed on income from the assets giving rise to the beneficiary income if it held the assets directly; and<br>*   the income is not subject to tax as the income of any person other than the trustee (such as the beneficiary or settlor). |
| 27. | Tax a New Zealand trustee of a foreign trust on foreign-sourced trustee income to the extent that:<br><br>*   the settlor is in the same control group as the trustee;<br>*   the settlor would be taxed on the trustee income if it held the trust assets directly; and<br>*   the income is not subject to tax as the income of any person other than the trustee. |
| 28. | Include a de minimis so that none of the above recommendation 5.2 rules apply if the total foreign sourced income of the trustee does not exceed the greater of $10,000 and 20% of the total income of the trust. |

|     | OECD Recommendation 6 |
| --- | --- |
| 29. | There will be a transitional rule such that a New Zealand-owned foreign hybrid entity or foreign branch’s accumulated loss is recaptured where that entity or branch’s control group acquires an interest in an entity in the foreign country except in cases where the accumulated loss cannot be offset against current and future income of the newly acquired entity. |
| 30. | A deduction will be allowed in New Zealand for losses of New Zealand-owned foreign hybrid entities or foreign branches if those losses cannot ever be used in the foreign country |
| 31. | Income which can be shown to be taxable in the foreign country and in New Zealand under New Zealand’s CFC rules can be regarded as dual inclusion income except to the extent that the income is sheltered by a foreign tax credit. |

Consultative Document on International Tax Reform DECEMBER 1987 PREFACE BY THE MINISTER OF FINANCE Introduction In my Budget of 18 June 1987, I announced that the Government would be introducing an ti-tax haven measures. This move is necessary to strengthen the tax system and fa c ilita te further tax reform. The resulting measures are set out in th is consultative document. Reasons for the Measures New Zealand residents are subject to tax on th e ir worldwide income. However, some residents, notably larger companies and wealthy individuals, are avoiding tax on th e ir foreign income, some of which is income that is diverted from New Zealand. This places an unfair tax burden on others and undermines the in te g rity of the tax system. The Government is determined to prevent the erosion of the income tax base by cross-border transactions which enable the deferral or complete avoidance of tax properly payable in New Zealand. The use of tax havens in particular has become widespread and has been a drain on government revenue. This concern to protect the tax base and to preserve the in teg rity of the tax system underpins the measures. Another objective is to remove a r tif ic ia l incentives for taxpayers to invest offshore. Offshore investment is generally to be welcomed, but i t should not be subsidised by ordinary taxpayers. Existing tax provisions are encouraging greater offshore investment than is economically and socially desirable. Hence, the measures attempt to ensure th at investment and other decisions are based on commercial merit rather than tax avoidance. Evolution of the Measures An overview of the proposed reforms was sketched in Annex 4 of the 1987 Budget. I t was stated then that the outline of the proposed regime was not d efin itiv e or complete. There were good reasons for th is. 11 F i r s t , a n t i - t a x haven p ro v is io n s a re among th e most complex in i n t e r n a t i o n a l ta x law and a re t y p i c a l l y s u b je c t to c o n tin u a l l e g i s l a t i v e and a d m in is tr a tiv e re fin e m e n t. The m easures o u tlin e d in Annex 4 o f th e Budget have been m o d ified to b e t t e r m eet th e G overnm ent's reform o b je c tiv e s and to en su re t h a t , a s f a r a s p o s s ib le , th e m easures th em selv es w i l l n o t be v u ln e ra b le to ab u se. Secondly, I in d ic a te d in th e Budget t h a t th e a n t i - t a x haven m easures would be th e f i r s t s te p tow ards a com prehensive ta x regime d e sig n e d to combat i n t e r n a t i o n a l ta x av o id an ce. Given th e p ro g re s s which has been made in d e v e lo p in g f u r th e r a s p e c ts o f t h a t regim e, t h i s f i r s t s te p w i l l now be la r g e r th a n e a r l i e r e n v isa g e d . Thus, th e com plexion o f th e o r ig i n a l p ro p o s a ls has been a l t e r e d s i g n i f i c a n t l y .

T his ' c o m p a ra tiv e -v a lu e ' b a s is i s a proxy fo r ta x in g th e u n d e rly in g income. i i i Control There are now no detailed rules relating to the control of a company. However, control can affect the amount of information a taxpayer can provide about the income of a company and may therefore affect whether a taxpayer w ill be able to report income on a branch-equivalent or a comparative-value basis. Nature of Income The d istin ctio n between tainted and non-tainted income has been eliminated. There are three related reasons for th is: f i r s t , the Government has decided th at i t wishes to prevent as much tax avoidance and tax d eferral as i t reasonably can, not ju st the worst and most v isib le forms; secondly, the d istin ctio n would produce uncertainty, and possibly unintended consequences, as a resu lt of inevitably arb itrary definitions; and th ird ly , a fte r further detailed consideration, the Government has decided that such a d istin ctio n , which has no economic basis, would be extremely d iffic u lt, i f not impossible, to enforce adequately. Sources of Income The d istin ctio n between low-tax and high-tax countries has been eliminated. The new measures w ill apply to foreign income earned through any non-resident en tity . Statutory rates of tax are an unreliable indicator of the real i mpact of taxes given the myriad of possible tax rules and the degree of enforcement in other countries. This new approach removes the need to make piecemeal and often inaccurate d istin ctio n s between high-tax and low-tax countries. Exemption from Measures A de minimis rule has been introduced. This rule w ill exempt from the measures natural persons with small shareholdings in non-resident companies. Such a rule balances the need for reducing the avoidance and d eferral of tax against the need for effective compliance and administration.

Trusts V Role of the Measures in the Government's Tax Reform Programme In proposing these measures, I would stress that the purpose is not to increase the to ta l tax burden on the community. I t is to spread the tax burden more evenly and more fa irly . To the extent that the tax base is broadened and more people pay th eir fa ir share of tax, rates of taxation can be lowered. The changes are an integral part of the Government's continuing programme to improve the efficiency and equity of the tax system. I t is overwhelmingly clear th at the New Zealand tax base must be protected from international tax avoidance; without a broader base, further tax reform w ill be prejudiced i f not precluded. I am confident that the proposed changes to New Zealand's international tax regime w ill provide a solid platform for further tax reform. In p articu lar, the expected gains from the new international tax regime have helped make possible the further major reform of the tax and benefit system which I have recently announced. Reductions in tax avoidance and lower rates of tax go hand in hand. Consultative Process This is the fourth time the Government has in itia te d a consultative process on a major taxation change. With the assistance of the business sector and members of the public, the previous consultations resulted in sig n ifican t improvements to the reform proposals. The Government has appreciated th is participation and hopes that i t w ill again be forthcoming in the current consultative process. In p articu lar, the Government is grateful to those who have agreed to serve on the Consultative Committee. I t can be expected to complete i t s task in a thorough and professional manner. The timetable for implementation is tig h t. The period allowed for consultation and review reflects the need to give adequate time for in terested p arties to make submissions and the need for timely decisions in order to v i reduce u n c e r ta in t y . The Government i n v i t e s p u b lic c o n s id e ra tio n o f th e p ro p o s a ls and welcomes comment on ways t h a t may improve th e im p lem en tatio n , o p e ra tio n and a d m in is tr a tio n o f th e new m easures.

The purpose of th is consultative document is to se t out the d e ta ils of the structure and operation of the proposed new measures so th at in terested p a rtie s have an opportunity to consider them and to submit th e ir views and suggestions before fin al decisions are made. The document focuses on the taxation of income earned by New Zealand residents through offshore e n titie s . The taxation of income earned in New Zealand by non-residents is not addressed. 1.2 Reasons for the Measures The measures are part of a major upgrading of New Zealand's international tax regime. They reinforce the Government's drive to create a fa ire r and more e ffic ie n t tax system. They seek to ensure th a t a ll residents of New Zealand pay th e ir proper share of tax. Moreover, the measures w ill make possible other desirable reforms. In p artic u lar, they w ill fa c ilita te a reduction in income tax rates. They w ill also stimulate e ffic ie n t investment in New Zealand. In th is way, the measures w ill contribute to a b etter use of resources and have a positive influence on savings, investment and the creation of more productive and permanent jobs for New Zealanders. In summary, the measures are designed to: a protect the domestic tax base from arrangements which seek to avoid or defer New Zealand tax by the accumulation of income in offshore e n titie s ; and 2 b reduce the extent to which the tax system encourages offshore investment relativ e to investment in New Zealand and biases the form in which offshore investment is made. 1.3 Consultative Committee The Government in v ites the public to make submissions on the matters se t out in th is document. A Consultative Committee has been appointed to receive and consider submissions and to advise the Government on implementation. The Committee comprises: Mr Arthur Valabh (Chairman), a tax partner and partner in charge of D eloitte, Haskins and S ells, Auckland; Dr Robin Congreve, a tax consultant with Russell, McVeagh, McKenzie, B artleet and Company, Auckland; Mr Stuart Hutchinson, a tax partner with Simpson Grierson Butler White, Auckland; Dr Susan Lojkine, a tax partner with McLeod Lojkine Associates, Auckland; Professor John Prebble, a Wellington tax b arrister and Dean of the Law Faculty a t the Victoria University of Wellington; and Mr Tim Robinson, an economist with Jarden and Company Limited, Wellington. 1.4 Terms of Reference The Committee's terms of reference are: a to receive and hear public submissions on matters concerning the implementation and operation of the measures proposed in th is consultative document; 3 b to report to the Minister of Finance on: i matters covered in th is document, or raised in submissions, on the introduction of measures to protect the New Zealand tax base, and i i such amendment to the d eta il of the proposed measures as the Committee may consider necessary for th e ir effective implementation and operation having regard to the Government's firm objective of eliminating the avoidance and deferral of New Zealand tax on foreign income as a means of broadening the tax base and fa c ilita tin g a reduction in income tax rate s; c to prepare d raft leg islatio n to give effect to the proposed measures referred to in th is document. The Committee is to report to the Minister of Finance by 31 March 1988. 1.5 Submissions Submissions should contain a b rief summary of th eir main points and recommendations. They should be typed in double space and be lodged by 12 February 1988 with: The Chairman Consultative Committee on Full Imputation and International Tax Reform c /– The Treasury PO Box 3724 WELLINGTON Submissions received by the due date w ill be acknowledged. 4 1.6 Outline of the Document This Consultative Document comprises eight chapters, as follows: Chapter 1: This introductory chapter describes b riefly the purpose of the document and the reasons for the proposed reforms. Members of the Consultative Committee, i t s terms of reference and submission procedures are detailed. Chapter 2: This chapter summarises the main elements of the measures set out in th is document for the reform of New Zealand's international tax provisions. Chapter 3: This chapter discusses the importance of preventing international tax avoidance and strengthening international tax provisions. Existing problems and the consequences are highlighted. The objectives of tax reform, which have guided the measures proposed in th is document, are presented. Chapter 4: This chapter outlines the scope of the proposed measures. I t indicates that taxpayers resident in New Zealand must include in th e ir assessable income foreign income earned through non-resident companies or tru sts on either a branch-equivalent or a comparative-value basis. Chapter 5: This chapter discusses the branch-equivalent basis for the taxation of income subject to the measures. The determination of assessable income and how i t w ill be attrib u ted to resident taxpayers are described. Chapter 6: This chapter discusses the comparative-value basis for the taxation of income subject to the measures. The annual change in value of a taxpayer's in te re st in a non-resident e n tity w ill be taxed as a proxy for tax on the underlying income. 5 Chapter 7: This chapter addresses the taxation of dividends from non-resident companies and distrib u tio n s from non-resident tru s ts . Provisions for double-tax re lie f are described. Chapter 8: This fin al chapter discusses disclosure and adm inistrative issues. 1.7 Meaning of Terms Used A glossary of the technical terms used is provided a t the end of th is document. 6 CHAPTER 2 – SUMMARY 2.1 Income Subject to the Measures The reform s d e s c rib e d in t h i s c o n s u lta tiv e document a p p ly to fo r e ig n income d e riv e d by r e s id e n ts o f New Zealand from i n t e r e s t s in n o n -r e s id e n t companies and t r u s t s .

The m arket v a lu e o f Inset 3 8 an in te re st in a non-resident company must be determined by reference to the trading price of the in te re st i f the price is available and reliab le. I f not, the market value must be determined in accordance with appropriate valuation methods based on shareholders' funds or net (after-tax) earnings. In certain circumstances, taxpayers w ill be required to compute the change in value of an in te re st by reference to an imputed rate of return of five percent in excess of the rate on five-year Government stock. Where the proceeds of disposition or the market value of an in te re st in a non-resident company exceed the la s t reported value of the in te re st by more than 30 percent and the in te re st has not been valued by reference to trading prices, a post facto adjustment w ill be made to the taxpayer's tax lia b ili ty for the preceding years to recoup any tax-deferral benefits resulting from the undervaluation, unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that e a rlie r market values were accurate. The market value of an in te re st in a non-resident tru s t w ill be the portion of the market value of the net assets of the tru s t represented by the s e ttlo r 's percentage in te re st in the tr u s t. I f , however, the market value of the assets of the tru s t cannot be determined, the imputed return method must be used to value the in te re st. 2.4 Distributions from Non-Resident Companies and Trusts Foreign portfolio dividends received by resident companies (ie dividends from a non-resident company in which a resident has less than 10 percent of the paid-up share capital) w ill be included in assessable income. A cre d it w ill be allowed for any foreign withholding taxes. Other dividends received by resident companies from non-resident companies w ill continue to be exempt from company tax. However, recipient companies w ill be required to c o lle c t a withholding payment on behalf of th eir shareholders. The withholding payment w ill be creditable to th e ir resident shareholders (and refundable to 9 tax-exempt and non-resident shareholders) when dividends are paid by the resident company. Similarly, any New Zealand tax paid by resident companies under the branch-equivalent basis w ill be creditable to resident shareholders under the imputation scheme outlined in the accompanying consultative document. Dividends received by individuals resident in New Zealand w ill remain assessable, with a cred it allowed for any foreign withholding tax. D istributions received by resident beneficiaries from non-resident tru s ts w ill be included in assessable income except to the extent that the d istrib u tio n is made out of the corpus of the tru s t. A cred it w ill be allowed for any foreign withholding taxes on the d istrib u tio n s. 2.5 Effective Dates The various aspects of the reform proposals set out in th is consultative document w ill come into effect as follows: - for taxpayers electing to use the branch-equivalent basis, from 1 April 1988. Where a non-resident e n tity 's accounting year straddles 1 April 1988, only the proportion of i t s income for the year attrib u tab le to the period a fte r 1 April 1988 w ill be subject to tax under these measures; - for taxpayers using the comparative-value basis, from 1 April 1988. Such taxpayers w ill be required to establish the market value on 1 April 1988 of th eir in te re st in non-resident companies and tru s ts . Thus, only increases and decreases in market value occurring afte r 1 April 1988 w ill be taken into account under these measures; - for portfolio dividends received from non-resident companies, such dividends declared afte r the time of the Minister of Finance's statement on 17 December 1987. A dividend w ill be deemed to be received when i t is declared by the payer company; and 10 - for d istrib u tio n s by non-resident tru sts to resident beneficiaries, such d istrib u tio n s th at become indefeasibly vested in a resident beneficiary a fte r the time of the Minister of Finance's statement on 17 December 1987. 2.6 Disclosure and Administration Taxpayers w ill be required to disclose th eir in te re sts in non-resident companies and tru sts and to provide a ll information necessary to compute foreign income in accordance with these measures. Taxpayers with in te re sts in non-resident companies or tru sts w ill be required to f ile a separate schedule for each such company or tru st with th eir annual return. Schedules w ill deal with the calculation of the income from such in te re sts. Penalties w ill apply for failu re to disclose the necessary information. A special u n it of the Inland Revenue Department w ill be established to ensure the e ffic ie n t and fa ir administration of the measures proposed in th is document. 11 CHAPTER 3 – OBJECTIVES OF THE REFORM MEASURES 3.1 Introduction The purpose of th is chapter is to b riefly outline the deficiencies in New Zealand's existing international tax provisions and th eir consequences; the objectives for the reform of those provisions; why the reform proposals set out in th is consultative document have been adopted and why they are more comprehensive than those proposed in the June 1987 Budget; and to address issues relatin g to the lik e ly impact of the reforms. 3.2 The Issues at a Glance The taxation of income earned by residents through offshore e n titie s is manifestly in need of reform. New Zealand's existing international tax provisions are unable to counter the deferral or outright avoidance of New Zealand tax. The following observations sum up the problems. There is blatant erosion of the tax base. Many large companies and wealthy individuals resident in New Zealand are avoiding and deferring New Zealand tax through a variety of offshore transactions. Such practices have become easy and routine. The cost to New Zealand of tax abuse is high and growing. As the level of deferral and avoidance has become more widespread and the techniques more sophisticated, the New Zealand tax base has been seriously eroded. Such erosion amounts annually to hundreds of millions of dollars in forgone tax revenue - which must be raised from other sources. Offshore investment is taxed more favourably than domestic investment. The exploitation of opportunities to defer or avoid New Zealand tax has resulted in investment being directed offshore rather than to more productive uses in New Zealand. Tax considerations are driving investment decisions. Consequently, the best use is not being made of New Zealand's scarce resources. 12 The cost is pervasive and ultimately borne by other New Zealanders. The fisc a l and economic cost of the deferral and avoidance of New Zealand tax reduces the economic and social well-being of the nation. In th is sense, the tax system i mposes a greater burden on the community than is necessary. The i mpact is adverse for jobs, growth and living standards. International tax avoidance is unfair. The a b ility of some taxpayers to defer or avoid New Zealand tax undermines perceptions about fairness and puts a t risk the voluntary compliance of taxpayers on which the in teg rity of the tax system re sts. Desirable domestic reform is obstructed. A tax system that is vulnerable to international tax deferral and avoidance reduces the prospects for domestic tax reform. In p articu lar, lower and more uniform rates of income tax a r e possible only i f a ll taxpayers bear th eir fa ir share of tax. 3.3 Deficiencies in Existing Law The fundamental deficiency in the tax system, which is a t the heart of the issues identified above, is the lack of n eu tra lity . In principle, residents are subject to New Zealand tax on th eir income derived from a ll sources - th a t is , th eir worldwide income. In practice, however, foreign income derived by residents is often not subject to New Zealand tax. Whether i t is depends on whether the income is realised d irectly or realised indirectly through the use of interposed e n titie s such as companies or tru sts, and on whether i t is earned in a country that levies high or low income taxes. For example, residents of New Zealand may conduct business outside New Zealand through branches or separately incorporated subsidiaries. Branches are not considered to be separate e n titie s and income derived by a foreign branch is included in the resident taxpayer's assessable income as i t is realised by the branch. However, because a company is considered to be a legal and taxable en tity separate from i t s shareholders, income derived by a non-resident company does not constitute income of the New Zealand shareholders u n til they receive dividends. Thus, New Zealand resident individuals and companies can 13 defer New Zealand tax on foreign income simply by earning such income through a non-resident company. Moreover, resident companies may avoid New Zealand tax en tirely because the dividends they receive from non-resident companies are exempt. I f the foreign taxes are lower than those in New Zealand, taxpayers can enjoy tax deferral advantages by realising income through a non-resident company or tru s t instead of d irectly . The income w ill not be taxed in New Zealand u n til repatriated and w ill not be taxed even then in the case of dividends received by a resident company. The deferral or avoidance of New Zealand tax on foreign income earned through non-resident companies and tru sts is unacceptable. I t constitutes an incentive for foreign investment by New Zealand residents in countries with tax rates lower than those of New Zealand. I t encourages the diversion of New Zealand income to non-resident companies and tru sts. I t benefits mainly large companies and wealthy individuals. More generally, i t undermines the in te g rity of the tax system by permitting the New Zealand tax base to be easily eroded. 3.4 Objectives of Reform The two major objectives guiding the Government's reform of the tax system are efficiency and equity. The best way to improve the efficiency and equity of New Zealand's tax system is to broaden the tax base and lower income tax rates. A comprehensive base with lower and more uniform rates w ill encourage investment decisions to be based on commercial rather than tax considerations. I t w ill remove a r tif ic ia l incentives for taxpayers to invest offshore. Lower rates w ill serve to encourage a ll types of investment, business and income-earning ac tiv ity . Lower tax rates are possible only i f the tax base is broadened and avoidance is curtailed. 14 New Zealand's international tax regime should generally re fle c t the same principles of efficiency and equity embodied in the domestic tax system. In p artic u lar, the taxation of foreign income should reinforce the taxation of domestic-source income and prevent the erosion of the domestic tax base by international tax avoidance. Reform of New Zealand's international tax regime therefore requires measures which w ill ensure th at a ll New Zealand residents are subject to tax on th e ir worldwide income as i t is earned. More p articu larly , the objectives of the reform proposals contained in th is consultative document are to ensure, as far as possible, that: a foreign income derived by New Zealand residents is subject to New Zealand tax as i t is earned, whether earned d irec tly or indirectly through a non-resident company or tru s t; b the bias in the existing tax system, which encourages foreign investment by New Zealand residents in countries with lower tax rates than those of New Zealand, is removed; c opportunities for international tax avoidance, which erode the New Zealand tax base and undermine the New Zealand tax system, are eliminated; d appropriate re lie f is provided for foreign taxes on foreign income earned by New Zealand residents; e the complexity of the tax law and the attendant compliance and adm inistrative costs are kept to the minimum necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the measures; and f the reform proposals are compatible with the existing domestic tax system and with the th ru st of future domestic reforms. 15 3.5 Context of Reform The th ru st of the reform proposals in th is consultative document is the elimination of the avoidance and deferral of New Zealand tax on a ll foreign income derived by residents of New Zealand through non-resident companies and tru sts. Consequently, these reforms d iffe r in some important respects from those orig in ally proposed. The proposals outlined in the 18 June 1987 Budget were essen tially anti-avoidance rules. They were directed primarily a t the use of tru sts and companies established in tax havens to earn passive investment income and lim ited types of business income. They applied only to non-resident companies controlled by, and tru sts settled by, residents of New Zealand. The proposals were modelled on an ti-tax haven measures currently in effect in several capital-exporting countries. Such measures may be effective in lim iting the use of tax haven companies and tru sts to defer and avoid domestic tax, but they are narrow in scope, arb itrary and complex. They deal only with the worst forms of tax avoidance. They do not deal with the fundamental problem of the deferral of domestic tax on foreign income earned through non-resident companies and tru sts. The Government has decided a broadening of the tax base with respect to foreign income is required to permit cuts in the rates of income tax applicable to both individuals and companies. Accordingly, the task is to eliminate the avoidance and deferral of New Zealand tax on foreign income earned by residents of New Zealand through non-resident companies or tr u s ts . Where a New Zealand resident has an in te re st in a non-resident company and can provide su fficien t information about the company, the resid en t's share of the foreign income w ill be taxed as if i t were derived from a foreign branch. Where the resident is unable to provide su fficien t information, New Zealand tax w ill be levied annually on the change in value of the in te re st. A sim ilar approach w ill be adopted with respect to non-resident tru sts to which New 16 Zealand residents contribute property. Further, there w ill be several consequential changes to the tax treatment of dividends received by New Zealand residents from non-resident companies and distributions received by New Zealand resident beneficiaries from non-resident tru sts. This approach has several advantages over the more lim ited anti-avoidance approach adopted by some countries. For example, under the measures proposed in th is document i t w ill be unnecessary to determine when a non-resident company is controlled by New Zealand residents; to distinguish between tainted and other income; or to determine whether a non-resident company is resident in a tax haven. The new approach w ill significantly lim it opportunities for international tax avoidance and protect the domestic tax base. Since the foreign income of non-resident companies w ill be subject to New Zealand tax currently, there w ill be l i t t l e reason for New Zealand residents to div ert income (whether in the form of transfer pricing, fees for services, royalties or in te re st) from New Zealand to a non-resident company. Under the reform proposals, if a New Zealand resident has an in te re st in a non-resident company or tru s t, in many cases that in te re st w ill be trea ted , in effect, as i f i t were a foreign branch. Since the tax treatment of foreign branches is relativ ely straightforward, the reform proposals are simple in concept and should not involve undue leg islativ e complexity. The a ltern ativ e basis for taxing foreign income, the comparative-value basis, w ill require such in te re sts to be valued each year. The Government recognises that no other country has to date eliminated the deferral of domestic tax on foreign income earned through non-resident companies and tru sts as completely as these measures propose. Nevertheless, they are fu lly ju stifia b le as part of the Government's broad tax reform in itia tiv e s to expand the tax base and lower income tax rates. 17 3.6 Impact of the Measures In developing the proposed reforms, the Government has considered th e ir effect on new investment, on New Zealand firms operating offshore, on foreign countries, and on the existing investment of residents. 3.6.1 New Investment The key impact of the proposed measures on new investment w ill be to remove a r tif ic ia l incentives for taxpayers to invest in low-tax ju risd ictio n s, and to restore incentives for investment to flow to areas where i t w ill provide the greatest returns for the nation as a whole. This is consistent with directing New Zealand's resources to th eir most profitable uses. At present, however, some offshore investment by residents has a lower pre-tax return than alternative investment in New Zealand. Such investment is made because i t has a higher post-tax return as a resu lt of the avoidance or deferral of New Zealand tax. This is clearly an undesirable effect of the current law which the proposed measures w ill remedy. A lik ely consequence is more productive investment by New Zealand residents, both domestically and offshore, and a relative increase in domestic investment by residents. 3.6.2 New Zealand Business Offshore I t is sometimes contended th at New Zealand businesses offshore should not be required to pay as much tax as they would in New Zealand to enable them to compete more readily in foreign markets. This contention carries l i t t l e weight. A resident taxpayer should not pay less New Zealand tax simply as a resu lt of investing offshore in a particular legal form (ie a non-resident company or t r u s t ). The im plicit subsidy in the existing tax system for foreign investment in countries with tax rates lower than those of New Zealand is in e ffic ie n t and inequitable. The proposed reforms w ill eliminate th is aspect of our tax system. 18 Much offshore investment is not primarily tax-motivated. New Zealand companies are attracted to invest offshore for such reasons as proximity to markets, av a ila b ility of natural resources, access to p articular goods and services, and the lik e . The proposed measures w ill have l i t t l e i mpact on these investments where they yield high pre-tax returns. The measures w ill, however, adversely affect offshore investments th at have been made prim arily for tax reasons. 3.6.3 Other Countries Some countries may be adversely affected by New Zealand's moves to counter the avoidance and deferral of domestic tax by i t s residents. For example, i f a foreign country provides significant corporate tax concessions in order to a ttra c t investment, those concessions may be less effective in e lic itin g investment from New Zealand as a resu lt of the proposed reforms. Where foreign taxes are very low, reductions in the foreign tax of a company owned by New Zealand residents w ill simply be replaced by the domestic tax payable on such income according to the rules proposed in th is document. However, there w ill be some benefits for foreign countries arisin g from New Zealand's tax reforms. For example, the lowering of the New Zealand company tax rate w ill mean that the return which non-residents can obtain from investment in New Zealand w ill increase. The anti-avoidance measures w ill also make i t more d iffic u lt for non-residents to enter into tax avoidance arrangements via New Zealand to exploit the tax systems of th eir own or other foreign countries. 3.6.4 Existing Investment The effective date of the reform proposals for undistributed income is 1 April 1988, which provides taxpayers with a reasonable opportunity to reorganise th e ir a ffa irs i f necessary. Although there may be costs for some investors who have entered into arrangements which cannot be altered, the Government has decided that no special re lie f can be ju s tifie d . All tax policy changes 19 create winners and losers, as do economic policy changes in general. New Zealand is currently undergoing a period of substantial and necessary economic adjustment. The long-term benefits of economic reform w ill be shared by a ll New Zealanders. 3 .7 C o n clu sio n Significant reform of New Zealand's international tax provisions is urgently required. Such reform is a key element in the Government's overall programme of tax reform. In p articu lar, the a b ility of the tax system to afford lower rates of income tax depends in large measure on a comprehensive tax base, and international tax reform is essential to ensure that a ll New Zealand residents pay tax on th eir worldwide income. The measures proposed in th is consultative document w ill strengthen New Zealand's international tax regime against widespread tax avoidance techniques and a rre st the erosion of the domestic tax base. At the same time, the new measures w ill reduce the bias in the tax system in favour of foreign investment by New Zealand residents. The nature of the problems involved suggests, however, that results w ill not be achieved through any single se t of in itia tiv e s . Rather, results w ill depend on a continuing reform of tax provisions on a broad front. The overriding concern must be to ensure th at New Zealand's tax system adjusts as necessary, so that the nation secures the maximum benefit possible from international investment and income flows. The measures proposed in th is document are compatible with th is longer-term direction. Inset 4 2 0 CHAPTER 4 – INCOME SUBJECT TO THE REFORM MEASURES 4.1 Scope of Reform The purpose of these reforms is to tax New Zealand residents on income as i t accrues to th eir benefit through th eir d irect in terest in a non-resident company or tru s t and through th eir in te re st held indirectly through th at non-resident e n tity in other non-resident e n titie s . Two requirements must therefore be met before income w ill be subject to the rules: a the income must be earned through a company or tru s t resident outside New Zealand; and b a New Zealand resident must have an in te re st in the company or tr u s t. Once these requirements have been met, a New Zealand resident w ill be required to include in assessable income his or her percentage in te re st in the income of the non-resident company or tru s t. Whether a person is a New Zealand resident for the purposes of these measures w ill be determined according to the normal tax residence provisions in section 241 of the Income Tax Act. However, there w ill be one special rule. An individual who has been resident in New Zealand for a cumulative period of less than 24 months in the immediately preceding 15 years w ill not be a resident for the purposes of these measures. Thus, individuals who work in New Zealand on a temporary basis w ill not be taxed on th e ir in terest in non-resident companies or tru s ts . The new regime w ill apply only to income earned through non-resident companies or tru s ts . These are separate taxable e n titie s under New Zealand law and may be used to avoid or defer New Zealand tax. Income derived by New Zealand 21 residents through foreign branches or partnerships, which are not separate taxable e n titie s under New Zealand tax law, w ill not be affected since such income is already subject to current taxation in New Zealand. Income derived d irec tly by New Zealand residents from foreign property, whether tangible (such as land) or intangible (such as debt instruments), is also excluded since i t is already subject to taxation in New Zealand as i t is earned. This chapter elaborates on the types of non-resident e n titie s that w ill be subject to the rules. I t deals f i r s t with companies and then with tru s ts . 4.2 Non-Resident Companies The forthcoming leg islatio n w ill apply to income earned through the following "non-resident companies": a a non-resident en tity which is comparable to a company under New Zealand law or to an en tity which is deemed to be a company under New Zealand tax law (eg a u n it tru s t); and b a company or deemed company which is a resident of New Zealand and any other country and which is not subject to tax in New Zealand on i t s foreign income. The existing residence rules in the Income Tax Act w ill apply to determine the residence of companies. For the guidance of taxpayers, a l i s t of common non-resident e n titie s that w ill be treated as companies for the purpose of th is leg islatio n w ill be issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 4.2.1 Percentage Interest in a Non-Resident Company This regime w ill require the measurement of a New Zealand resid en t's true economic stake in a non-resident company. This is best measured by the a b ility of a resident to extract income from the company. As proposed in the consultative document on fu ll imputation, the definition of dividends for 2 2 income tax purposes is to be widened to include a ll types of d istrib u tio n s, with the exception of certain returns of paid-up share cap ital. Thus, a New Zealand resid en t's in te re st in a non-resident company w ill be defined in terms of his or her expected return of dividends from the company. I t is clearly not feasible to give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue a discretion to decide what is a resid en t's a b ility to extract dividends from a non-resident company on a case by case basis. The rule should ideally be clear and objective so th a t taxpayers know in advance the tax consequences of investing in non-resident companies. Furthermore, i t is not su fficien t to define an in te re st in a non-resident company only in terms of current rig h ts, or future entitlem ents, to dividends. In order to prevent avoidance, i t is also necessary to measure a resid en t's current and future entitlement to voting rights in relation to the d istrib u tio n policy of the non-resident company. Therefore, a taxpayer's "percentage in terest" in a non-resident company w ill be defined as the greatest of: a the proportion of rights to dividends to which the resident is e n title d ; b the proportion of rights to dividends which the resident is e n title d to acquire; c the proportion of voting rights, in relation to distributions and changes to the company's constitutional rules, to which the resident is e n title d ; d the proportion of voting rights, in relation to distributions and changes to the company's constitutional rules, which the resident is e n title d to acquire. A taxpayer's percentage in terest w ill be determined a t the end of the non-resident company's accounting year. 23 An interest in a non-resident co m p an y w ill include an in te re st held in d irectly through interests in other non-resident companies or tru sts. A taxpayer's percentage interest in a lower-tier non-resident company w ill be determined by multiplying the taxpayer's in te re st in the f i r s t - t i e r non-resident company by that company's percentage in te re st in the low er-tier company. This determination must be made for a ll levels in a chain of ownership of non-resident companies (see sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 and Appendices 5.1 and 5.2 for further d etails). Many capital structures are designed to take advantage of tax provisions. I t is not unreasonable to expect that these structures w ill be altered to re fle c t the new tax provisions. However, the adoption of the rule outlined above may cause difficulties for some taxpayers who currently hold certain classes of shares in non-resident companies. A period of adjustment w ill therefore be provided before the regime comes into effect. In th is period, taxpayers may wish to reconsider their in terests in companies with complicated cap ital structures or, if they control the non-resident company, to adjust the way in which they invest in the company so that they obtain the desired level of risk, return and control, taking into account the definition of "percentage interest" in this regime. The following are examples of instruments to which the rights taken into account in determining a taxpayer's percentage in te re st in a non-resident company may attach: a shares in a non-resident company; b units in a non-resident unit tru s t; c debentures of a non-resident company without a fixed in te re st rate and debentures issued in substitution for shares of a non-resident company as defined in sections 192 and 195 of the Income Tax Act; 24 d options, or other rights to acquire, in te re sts in a non-resident company or a non-resident unit tru s t that can be exercised directly or indirectly by the holder of the option, and put options which are in substance callable options; e convertible debt of a non-resident company, including instruments similar in nature to convertible notes defined in section 196 of the Income Tax Act; and f any in te re st in non-resident companies owned by a non-resident company or tru s t in which the taxpayer has an in te re st as described in (a) to (e) above, including any in te re st in non-resident companies and trusts held through a chain of ownership. Convertible debt in a non-resident company is debt which converts automatically, or a t the option of the holder or issuer of the debt, into equity in the company. Convertible debt instruments have the characteristics of both equity and debt. Any change in the market value of convertible debt reflec ts changes in market yields on debt and changes in the market value of the potential equity rights represented by the instrument. The debt portion of such instruments is currently taxable under the provisions of section 64B to 64M of the Income Tax Act. The forthcoming leg islatio n w ill ensure that a taxpayer is not taxed twice on income derived from convertible debt instruments. Where a nominee of a resident holds an in te re st in a non-resident company, the in te re st shall be deemed to be held by the resident. The existing definitions of "nominee" in the Income Tax Act w ill be reviewed to ensure that they are satisfacto ry for the purposes of th is regime. 25 4.2.2 De Minimis Rule Where the market value of an individual's aggregate d irect in te re sts in non-resident companies, a t a ll times in the individual's income year, does not exceed $10,000, the individual w ill be exempt from reporting his or her income from those non-resident companies under the branch-equivalent or comparative-value basis. Market value w ill be determined according to the valuation rules set out in section 6.1.2. 4.3 Non-Resident Trusts The measures w ill also apply to non-resident tru s ts . To eliminate any possible ambiguity in the present law, a tru st w ill be deemed to be resident in New Zealand for tax purposes i f any trustee of the tru s t is resident in New Zealand a t the end of the accounting year of the tru st. The existing residence rules in section 241 of the Income Tax Act w ill apply to determine the residence of a tru stee. A non-resident tru s t w ill thus be a tr u s t th at does not have any trustee resident in New Zealand a t the end of the accounting year of the tru s t. The measures w ill apply to in ter vivos and testamentary tru sts, irrespective of whether they are specified or non-specified tru s ts pursuant to the Income Tax Act. 4.3.1 Interest in a Non-Resident Trust Non-resident tru sts may be used to avoid New Zealand tax where the non-resident tru stee or trustees accumulate trustee income and i t is not also derived by New Zealand resident beneficiaries e n title d , or deemed to be entitled, in possession to the receipt of i t (th is is the d efin itio n of beneficiaries' income in section 227 of the Income Tax Act). In many cases i t will not be possible to ascertain, a t the end of a tr u s t's accounting year, whether there are any resident beneficiaries, or, i f there are, th e ir respective shares of the tru s t income. Consequently, i t is often not feasible to tax resident beneficiaries on th eir share of the tru st income of non-resident tru s ts . 26 In order to achieve the objectives of these reform measures with regard to non-resident tru s ts , any person resident in New Zealand (referred to as a "resident se ttlo r" ) who has contributed property by way of g if t, including a transfer of property for inadequate consideration, to a non-resident tru s t w ill be considered to have an in te re st in the non-resident tru s t u n til such time as: a a resident s e ttlo r who is a natural person dies and his or her e state is wound up; or b a resident s e ttlo r which is a company or another tru st is wound up. The value of a contribution to a non-resident tru s t w ill be the difference between the market value of the property transferred to the tru s t and the market value of any consideration given by the tru s t. Special rules w ill be necessary in relation to any financial assistance given to non-resident tru s ts , whether given d irectly or indirectly, and whether by means of a loan, guarantee, the provision of security or otherwise. The d efin itio n of a "resident se ttlo r" w ill include residents who make indirect contributions to non-resident tru s ts through resident or non-resident interposed e n titie s such as tru s ts , companies or financial in stitu tio n s, or through non-resident individuals. A resident w ill also be considered to have an in te re st in any non-resident tr u s t to which a non-resident tru s t or a non-resident company in which the taxpayer has an in te re st contributes property. This determination must be made for a l l levels of e n titie s in a chain of ownership irrespective of whether the income of the h ig h er-tier e n tity is being reported on a branch-equivalent or comparative-value basis. A resident s e ttlo r with an in te re st in a non-resident tru st w ill also be deemed to have an in te re st in any non-resident company in which th at tru s t has an in te re st. 4 .3 .2 Percentage In te r e st in a Non-Resident Trust The rules for determining a resident s e ttlo r 's percentage in te re st in a non-resident tr u s t are set out in section 5.3.2. 27 4 .3 .3 De Minimis Rule An individual w ill be exempt from the proposed resident s e ttlo r rules i f the market value of a ll contributions made by him or her to non-resident tru s ts a t any time is less than $500. For th is purpose, the market value of each contribution must be determined a t the time of the contribution. 4 .3 .4 B e n e fic ia r ie s New Zealand-resident beneficiaries of non-resident tru s ts must include in th eir assessable income tru s t income distributed to them or which becomes vested indefeasibly in them in accordance with the rules set out in section 7.3.1. New Zealand residents who purchase a beneficial in te re st in a discretionary non-resident tru s t w ill be taxed on such an in te re st on the comparative-value basis (see section 6.3). 4.4 Bases for Reporting Income Once i t is determined that a New Zealand resident has an in te re st in a non-resident company or tru s t, then the amount of the e n tity 's income th a t has accrued to the benefit of the New Zealand resident must be calculated in accordance with the "branch-equivalent" basis or the "comparative-value" basis. The next two chapters explain in more d etail the branch-equivalent and the comparative-value bases of determining income to which the reform measures outlined in th is document apply. 28 CHAPTER 5 – REPORTING INCOME ON A BRANCH-EQUIVALENT BASIS 5 .1 O verview New Zealand residents who elect to have the income they derive through a non-resident company or tru s t taxed on a branch-equivalent basis w ill be taxed on th e ir percentage in te re st in the e n tity a t the end of the e n tity 's accounting year m ultiplied by the income of the e n tity . The branch-equivalent basis operates in almost the same manner as the present treatment of foreign branches. I t commences with a calculation of the non-resident e n tity 's income as measured by New Zealand tax rules. The New Zealand resid en t's percentage in te re st in such income is then included in the resid en t's assessable income. A non-resident company's losses attrib u ted to a New Zealand taxpayer may be o ffse t only against the taxpayer's branch-equivalent or comparative-value income from other non-resident companies. Losses attrib u tab le to a s e ttlo r 's in te re st in a non-resident tru s t must be carried forward to be o ffse t against future income from the s e ttlo r 's in te re st in th at tru s t. The tax lia b ility resulting from the taxation of branch-equivalent basis income is reduced by the taxpayer's percentage in te re st in foreign taxes paid by the non-resident en tity deriving the income. Where d istrib u tio n s to New Zealand residents from the non-resident en tity are taxable in New Zealand, re lie f for previous New Zealand taxes paid is provided by permitting such d istrib u tio n s to be deducted from branch-equivalent income to the extent of the branch-equivalent income reported in the year of d istrib u tio n . The New Zealand tax lia b ility w ill be reduced by any foreign withholding taxes levied on the distributed income. Branch-equivalent income w ill be reported in New Zealand dollars using a close-of-trading spot exchange rate on the la s t day of the relevant accounting year of the non-resident en tity . 29 5 .2 Non-Resident Companies 5 .2 .1 Measurement o f Branch-Equivalent B asis Income New Zealand taxpayers reporting income from a non-resident company on a branch-equivalent basis w ill include in assessable income th eir percentage in the company's income a t the end of the company's accounting year. This applies to non-resident companies in which a New Zealand taxpayer has a d ire c t or an indirect in te re st. The income of each such company w ill be calculated according to New Zealand tax rules with one exception. Where dividends are paid by a non-resident company whose income is being reported by the taxpayer on a comparative-value basis to another non-resident company, they sh all be included in the assessable income of the recipient company. I t is necessary to include the la tte r dividends in the net income of the recipient company because th e ir payment w ill reduce the market value of the taxpayer's in te re st in the dividend-paying company (for an illu s tra tio n of th is point, see Appendix 5.2 where the income of Company E is reported on a comparative-value b asis). When computing his or her share of branch-equivalent income, a taxpayer may deduct dividends received (gross of foreign withholding taxes) from the non-resident company. Such dividends are deductible against the income of the non-resident company in the accounting year in which they are paid, to the extent of the branch-equivalent income earned in th a t year. This ensures th a t income from which dividends are paid is not subject to New Zealand tax twice. Should the deduction of dividends resu lt in a branch-equivalent loss being computed, such a loss may be o ffset against branch-equivalent or comparative-value income earned through other non-resident companies, whether in a current or future income year of a taxpayer. 30 5.2.2 Calculating a Taxpayer's Percentage Interest in the Income of a Non-Resident Company The portion of a non-resident company's income included in the income of a resident New Zealand taxpayer w ill be the amount of such income m ultiplied by the taxpayer's percentage in terest in the non-resident company a t the end of company's accounting year (see section 4.2.1 for a description of how to calculate a percentage in terest in a company). Similarly, where a taxpayer elects to report on a branch-equivalent basis the income of a non-resident company in which he or she has an indirect in te re st, the portion of th at company's income to be included in the taxpayer's income is the company's income multiplied by the taxpayer's percentage in te re st in the company. In th is situ atio n , the taxpayer's percentage in te re st w ill be determined by multiplying the taxpayer's percentage in te re st in the f i r s t - t i e r non-resident company by that company's percentage in te re st in the low er-tier non-resident en tity , and so on. There is an exception to the income allocation rules, however, where a taxpayer can establish that 100 percent of the income of a non-resident company is included in the income of New Zealand taxpayers. ( I t should be noted that tax-exempt e n titie s are not taxpayers.) The purpose of th is exception is to prevent more than 100 percent of the branch-equivalent basis income of a non-resident company being taxed where there is no prospect of avoidance or d eferral. I t is possible for more than 100 percent of the income of a non-resident company to be taxable under these rules because the determination of a taxpayer's percentage in te re st is based on the g reatest of the taxpayer's entitlem ent, or entitlement to acquire, rights to dividends and voting rights in relation to distributions and changes to the company's constitutional rules. To qualify for the exception, any one New Zealand resident with an in te re st in the non-resident company must provide the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) with the following information: the branch-equivalent basis income of the non-resident company, the names and IRD tax numbers of a l l of the resident taxpayers with in te re sts in the company, and the allocation of 31 100 percent of the branch-equivalent income. I f th is exception applies, the resident shareholders may allocate the branch-equivalent income among themselves on any reasonable basis. Taxpayers who acquire an in te re st in a non-resident company during the company's accounting year w ill be required to include in th eir assessable income th e ir percentage in te re st in the pro-rata portion of the company's income attrib u tab le to the period a fte r acquisition. Taxpayers who dispose of th e ir in te re sts during the company's accounting year w ill be required to include in th eir assessable income the pro-rata portion of the company's income attrib u tab le to the period before disposition. If the taxpayer lacks su fficien t information to pro-rate the company's income in th is way, tax w ill be levied on a comparative-value basis for the part-year from the beginning of the company's accounting year to the time of disposition. The valuation rules set out in chapter 6 w ill be used to determine the comparative-value income to be taxed. A New Zealand resid en t's share of the income of a non-resident company for a p articu lar year w ill be included in the resid en t's assessable income for his or her income year in which the non-resident company's accounting year ends. For example, i f a company has a balance date of 30 September and a New Zealand resident a balance date of 31 March, the New Zealand resident w ill report his or her share of the non-resident company's income for the year ended 30 September on his or her return for the year ended 31 March of the following year. A non-resident company's losses attributed to a New Zealand taxpayer may be used to o ffset the taxpayer's branch-equivalent or comparative-value income from other non-resident companies. Where the taxpayer is a company within a group of companies (as defined in section 191 of the Income Tax Act), these losses may be transferred to other companies in the group for o ffse t against comparative-value or branch-equivalent income. 32 5.2.3 Credit for Foreign Taxes A taxpayer's tax lia b ility arising from income reported on a branch-equivalent basis w ill be reduced by his or her percentage in te re st in the foreign taxes paid by the non-resident company deriving the income. A taxpayer's percentage in te re st in foreign taxes paid by a non-resident company w ill be the foreign taxes paid by the company multiplied by the taxpayer's percentage in te re st in the company. This calculation is subject to the exception described in section 5.2.2 where 100 percent of the income of a non-resident company is included in the income of New Zealand taxpayers. If a taxpayer's percentage in te re st in the branch-equivalent income of a non-resident company is reduced pursuant to th at exception, then the taxpayer's percentage in te re st of the foreign taxes paid by the company must be reduced correspondingly. The conditions and lim itations that apply to foreign tax credits in Part VIII of the Income Tax Act w ill be amended to ensure that they are appropriate for these measures. Foreign tax credits w ill be limited to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on the income of each non-resident en tity . Foreign tax credits w ill also be lim ited to the amount of New Zealand tax which would have been payable on the income sourced in each ju risd ictio n . Carry-back and carry-forward for foreign taxes th at cannot be used in the current year w ill be allowed to the extent permitted under current law to deal with timing differences between foreign and New Zealand tax law. Foreign taxes which w ill qualify for the foreign tax cred it regime are income and company taxes which are of substantially the same nature as New Zealand income tax whether levied by the federal, sta te or provincial government in any foreign ju risd ic tio n on the income of the non-resident e n tity . A cred it w ill also be permitted for New Zealand taxes paid by a non-resident company on New Zealand-source income. Foreign withholding taxes levied on distributed income w ill also be cred itab le. Taxes paid by non-resident companies in which a New Zealand resident has an in d irect in te re st w ill also be creditable. The same formula used to determine a taxpayer's percentage in te re st in an e n tity 's income w ill be used to calculate the taxpayer's percentage in te re st in the foreign taxes paid by the en tity . 33 The operation of the rules for calculating a taxpayer's entitlement to foreign taxes paid by non-resident companies is illu stra te d in Appendix 5.2. 5 .3 Non-Resident T rusts As explained in section 4.3, a resident se ttlo r w ill be assessed on income attrib u tab le to his or her in te re st in a non-resident tr u s t. The branch-equivalent reporting system applies to se ttlo rs with in te re sts in non-resident tru sts in much the same manner as i t applies to resident shareholders with in terests in non-resident companies. 5 .3 .1 Measurement o f Branch-Equivalent B asis Income On the branch-equivalent basis, the income of a non-resident tru s t must be measured in accordance with New Zealand tax rules, in the same way as the income of a non-resident company (see section 5.2.1). Where, however, a non-resident tru st receives dividends from a non-resident company whose income is reported on a branch-equivalent basis by the resident se ttlo r of the tr u s t, such dividends w ill be excluded from the tr u s t's income. Where a non-resident tru s t receives dividends from a non-resident company whose income is reported on a comparative-value basis by the resident se ttlo r of the tr u s t, the dividends w ill be included in the tr u s t's income in accordance with New Zealand law. Trustee income of a non-resident tru st w ill be defined as the net assessable income of the tru s t, computed in accordance with New Zealand tax law as modified above, less distributions to the extent of the branch-equivalent income reported in the year of distrib u tio n , and less amounts that have vested indefeasibly in beneficiaries (except beneficiaries which are non-resident tru sts and companies). Under current law, trustee income excludes only income th at is also derived by a beneficiary en titled , or deemed to be 34 e n title d , in possession to the receipt thereof. That defin itio n w ill be amended in relatio n to non-resident tru sts to make i t clear th at income in which a beneficiary has an indefeasibly vested in te re st w ill be deducted from the net assessable trustee income, whether or not the beneficiary is e n title d to enforce immediate payment of the income. Whether trustee income vests indefeasibly in a beneficiary w ill be determined in accordance with New Zealand law. For example, i f , under foreign law, income is deemed to vest in the reg istra r of tru sts or some other government o ffic ia l u n til i t is d istributed by tru stees, the income w ill nevertheless be considered tru stee income for New Zealand income tax purposes. 5.3.2 Calculating a Taxpayer's Percentage Interest in the Income of a Non-Resident Trust Resident se ttlo rs w ill include in th eir assessable income the portion of the trustee income of a non-resident tru st equal to the trustee income m ultiplied by th e ir percentage in te re st in the tru s t. The percentage in te re st of a resident s e ttlo r in a non-resident tru st w ill be calculated as the percentage th at the market value of the property contributed to the tru s t by the s e ttlo r, determined a t the time of the contribution, is of the market value of the t r u s t's net assets, also determined a t the time of the s e ttlo r 's contribution. Once the in te re st is established, i t w ill remain constant u n til another contribution is made to the tru s t. Thus, for example, i f A and B each contribute $100 to a tru s t each w ill have a 50 percent in te re st in the tr u s t. I f the tru s t assets double in value from $200 to $400, a t which time C contributes $400 to the tru s t, A and B w ill each have a 25 percent in te re s t in the tru s t while C w ill have a 50 percent in te re st in the tr u s t. The recalculation of s e ttlo r s ' respective in terests in a tru s t w ill be made only a t the end of a tr u s t's accounting year and w ill apply to a ttrib u te income to se ttlo rs for the next tru st accounting year. Where a non-resident tru s t in which a New Zealand taxpayer has an in te re st contributes property to another non-resident tru s t, the taxpayer's percentage in te re st in the second tru st w ill be determined by multiplying his or her 35 percentage in te re st in the f i r s t tru st by that tr u s t's percentage in te re st in the other non-resident tru s t, and so on. Resident se ttlo rs w ill be taxed on th e ir share of the income of each non-resident tru s t separately from th e ir other New Zealand income. This is consistent with the way tru stee income is taxed in the hands of New Zealand resident trustees. Trust losses attrib u tab le to a s e ttlo r 's in te re st in a non-resident tr u s t must be carried forward to be o ffset against future income from the s e ttlo r 's in te re st in that tru s t. Since beneficiaries w ill never have an in te re st in tru s t losses, the entire amount of a loss w ill, in effect, be treated as a trustee loss. Without a carry-forward rule, the attrib u tio n system would be open to abuse, since trustees could ensure that beneficiaries had indefeasibly vested in te re sts in any tru s t income while passing losses on to the s e ttlo r for tax purposes. 5 .3 .3 C redit for Foreign and New Zealand Taxes If a non-resident trustee provides a resident s e ttlo r with information about foreign taxes paid on trustee income (or New Zealand taxes on New Zealand-source income), the se ttlo r w ill be e n title d to claim a tax cred it equal to the taxes paid on trustee income multiplied by the s e ttlo r 's percentage in te re st in the tru s t. The calculation and attrib u tio n of tax credits available to resident se ttlo rs who report income attrib u ted to th e ir in te re sts in non-resident tru sts on a branch-equivalent basis is made by reference to the same rules applicable to shareholders in non-resident companies who report income on a branch-equivalent basis. 5.4 E lectio n to Report on Branch-Equivalent B asis Taxpayers who qualify to report income from a non-resident e n tity on a branch-equivalent basis must f ile an election with the IRD office to which they send th eir annual tax returns. A copy w ill be sent by IRD to the special IRD tax u n it. A separate election must be made in respect of each 36 non-resident e n tity which the taxpayer wishes to report on a branch-equivalent basis. Thus, the taxpayer may choose to report the income of one non-resident e n tity on a branch-equivalent basis and another on a comparative-value basis. The taxpayer w ill be required to inform the Commissioner of Inland Revenue of the accounting year used by the non-resident en tity . Any subsequent change in the e n tity 's balance date must be communicated to the Commissioner and approved by him as a basis for continuing to use the branch-equivalent method. I f the Commissioner does not give his consent, the taxpayer w ill be required to report income from the e n tity using the comparative-value basis. The mechanics of changing the basis of reporting income are described in section 5.5. Elections to use the branch-equivalent basis reporting system file d before 1 April 1988 w ill be effective from 1 April 1988. Elections file d a fte r 1 April 1988 w ill be effective from the f i r s t accounting year of the non-resident en tity commencing a fte r the date on which the election is file d . Branch-equivalent taxpayers must be able to provide the Commissioner with information sim ilar to th at which taxpayers reporting on an actual branch basis are required to provide. The Inland Revenue Department w ill make available d e ta ils of the information required for filin g and auditing purposes. A special requirement for taxpayers reporting income on a branch-equivalent basis w ill be th at they must be able to provide the Commissioner, on request, with a copy of the financial accounts of the non-resident company or tru st and a copy of it s foreign tax returns. Any information in a foreign language must be accompanied by an English tran slatio n (see the discussion of the disclosure requirements in chapter 8). 5 .5 C hanging fro m B ra n c h -E q u iv a le n t t o C o m p a rativ e -V alu e B a s is Taxpayers may change the basis of reporting income from a non-resident e n tity if they notify the Commissioner of Inland Revenue a t le a st one month before the beginning of the next accounting year of the e n tity . The change in the 37 basis of reporting w ill become effective from the beginning of the next accounting year of the en tity . A taxpayer changing from branch-equivalent to comparative-value reporting w ill be required to compute the value of his or her in te re st in the e n tity on the date the change becomes effective (referred to as the "effective date"). The value of an in te re st w ill be computed on th is date in accordance with the rules set out in chapter 6. The value of the in te re st computed on the effective date w ill be deemed as the opening value of the in te re st a t the beginning of the taxpayer's income year. This value w ill be compared with the value of the in te re st a t the end of the taxpayer's income year for the purposes of computing income using the comparative-value basis. The taxpayer w ill be required to report income from the e n tity for the accounting year up to the effective date on a branch-equivalent basis. Where a taxpayer has elected to report income on a branch-equivalent basis and i t is not possible for whatever reason to compute branch-equivalent income up to the effective date, income from the beginning to the end of the e n tity 's accounting year must be calculated using an imputed return method. For the purposes of applying an imputed return method, the value of the in te re st on the f i r s t day of the non-resident e n tity 's accounting year w ill be computed as the market value of the taxpayer's in te re st on the la s t day of the e n tity 's accounting year discounted by the annual imputed return rate on a straig h t-lin e basis. This rule w ill apply where taxpayers cannot compute branch-equivalent income in any accounting year of a non-resident company and where they have not given prior notice of th eir intention to compute income on a comparative-value basis. 38 APPENDIX 5.1 SCHEMATIC OUTLINE OF THE INCOME ATTRIBUTION ROLES 39 APPENDIX 5.2 EXAMPLE OF ATTRIBUTION RULES IN OPERATION Resident Non-Resident Companies Company Income (1) Foreign Taxes NZCo' s In terest (2) Attributed to NZCo Income (3) Tax Credit (4) ($) ($)(%)($) ($) A300 50 80240 40 B−400 NIL 56 −224 (5) NIL C 500 (6)100 34170 34 D60020017 102 31 (7) E700 (8) 1501391 N/A (9) F N/A (10)N/AN/AN/A N/A (Figures rounded; amounts in New Zealand dollars) Notes 1 A, B, C and D's income, measured according to New Zealand tax rules, is reported on a branch-equivalent basis. 2 Each in te re st is m ultiplicative, eg NZCo's in te re st in C = .8 x .7 x .6. 3 Income attrib u ted to NZCo is i t s in te re st in each company's income. 4 Tax cred it attrib u ted to NZCo is i t s in te re st in foreign taxes paid. 5 Loss may be o ffset (or carried forward for offset) only against other branch-equivalent of comparative-value income. 6 Includes dividend received from E since E's income is reported on a comparative-value basis. 7 Foreign taxes paid by D exceed the New Zealand tax (say, 30%) on such income.

The change in value w ill be calculated by comparing the market value of the taxpayer's in te re st in a company a t the end of the taxpayer's income year and the value of that in te re st a t the beginning of the year. Where market values cannot be determined by reference to the traded price of an in te re st, the market value of a taxpayer's in te re st in a non-resident company w ill be determined a t the end of the company's accounting year. Subject to provisions to prevent avoidance, where an in te re st in a non-resident company is acquired during a year, the amount included in assessable income w ill be the difference between the cost of the in te re st and it s market value a t the end of the year. Similarly, where an in te re s t is disposed of during a year, the amount included in assessable income w ill be the difference between the market value a t the beginning of the year and the proceeds of disposition. In general, taxpayers w ill be required to value in terests in non-resident companies by reference to the traded prices of the in te re sts, i f such prices are available and provide a reliab le indication of market value. Otherwise, taxpayers w ill be required to compute the market value of th eir in te re sts in accordance with appropriate valuation techniques. Where the traded price of an in te re st is unavailable or unreliable and the compliance costs of establishing market values by any other methods are excessive, the taxpayer 41 may use an imputed rate of return method of valuation to determine the value of the in te re st. Where the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is not sa tisfie d that the values reported by a taxpayer accurately re fle c t market values, he may use the imputed-return method to determine the market value of the taxpayer's in te re st. Where the market value of an in te re st has not been determined by reference to the traded price of the in te re st, and the market value of an in te re st a t the end of a taxpayer's income year or the proceeds of disposition exceed the last-reported value by more than 30 percent, a post facto adjustment w ill be made to recoup any tax-deferral benefits which the taxpayer has enjoyed, unless the taxpayer is able to demonstrate the accuracy of the previously reported market value. The method for computing foreign income under the comparative-value basis is summarised in the following formula: Y = (E + S) − (B + P) where: Y = annual accrued gain or loss in respect of an in te re st in a non-resident company. E = market value of the in terest a t the end of the taxpayer's income year. S = proceeds from the disposition of a ll or part of the in te re st in the non-resident company during the taxpayer's income year. B = market value of the in terest a t the beginning of the taxpayer's income year (th is w ill be the market value of the in te re st a t the end of the immediately preceding year). P = the cost of any in terest acquired by the taxpayer in the non-resident company during the income year. 42 All amounts must be calculated in New Zealand dollars in accordance with the rules for converting foreign currency denominated values contained in section 6.1.2. The annual accrued gain or loss from in terests in non-resident companies must be calculated separately for each non-resident company in which a taxpayer has an in te re st. Any losses so calculated may be used to o ffse t branch-equivalent or comparative-value income in respect of in te re sts in other non-resident companies in the current year or may be carried forward to o ffse t such income in future years. Such losses may not be used to o ffse t a taxpayer's other assessable income. However, where the taxpayer is a company within a group of companies (as defined in section 191 of the Income Tax Act), these losses may be transferred to other companies in the group for o ffse t against branch-equivalent or comparative-value income. 6.1.2 Market Value of an Interest in a Non-Resident Company The market value of an in te re st in a non-resident company is the highest price obtainable for the in te re st in a transaction between non-associated persons who are under no compulsion to buy or se ll and who have fu ll knowledge of a ll the relevant facts. Methods that may be used to determine the market value of an in te re st in a non-resident company are outlined below. a Valuation by Reference to Traded Price The best indication of the market value of an in te re st in a non-resident company w ill be the observable traded price of the in te re st. Where an in te re st is traded on a public exchange, it s market value w ill be determined by reference to the reported traded price of the in terest computed on the following basis: 43 - where buy and se ll offers are recorded on the exchange for the five working days prior to the end of the taxpayer's income year (referred to as the taxpayer's balance date), market value is the average of the close-of-trading prices recorded during that period; - where for any day within the five day period no transactions in the in te re st are recorded, the market value shall be the mid-point of the close-of-trading buy and se ll offers reported; and - where neither buy nor se ll offers are recorded during the la s t five trading days prior to the taxpayer's balance date, market value is the average of the mid-point of buy and se ll offers reported in the most recent three days of the 30 working days immediately preceding the taxpayer's balance date. In terests in unit tru sts that are not traded but are redeemable a t c a ll or upon notice by the unit holder a t prices set by the tru s t fund managers may be valued by reference to the most recently quoted redemption price in the 30 days immediately preceding a taxpayer's balance date. The redemption price may be a daily, weekly, or monthly price quoted in accordance with procedures adopted by the managers of the unit tru s t. The market value of an in te re st in a non-resident company determined on the basis of i t s traded price or redemption price must be computed in New Zealand dollars using the close-of-trading spot exchange rate on the balance date of the taxpayer. Taxpayers w ill be required to disclose the name of the public exchange and the dates of the traded prices used to establish the market value of th eir in te re st (disclosure requirements are discussed further in Chapter 8). b Other Valuation Methods Where traded prices are not available, or do not provide a reliable indication of the market value of a taxpayer's in terest in a non-resident company, the market value of the in te re st must be determined in accordance with other valuation methods provided that they conform to commercially acceptable valuation methods. 44 Under these valuation methods, the market value of an in te re s t in a non-resident company w ill reflec t: i the shareholders' funds of the non-resident company, provided th a t a ll assets and lia b ilitie s of the company are included in the company's balance sheet a t th eir market values; and/or i i the net (after-tax) earnings of the non-resident company. One common method used to determine market value is based on the present value of future cash flows of a company. A lternatively, a value may be obtained by multiplying current or projected annual earnings by a price/earnings ra tio . The discount rate or the price/earnings ratio should take account of the risk and returns typical of the industry in which the non-resident company operates. Other valuation methods or variants of the above methods may be employed provided th at they conform with commercially acceptable valuation methods. Where in terests in a non-resident company are not traded on a public exchange, but that company's assets can be valued by reference to traded p rices, the market value of an in te re st in the f i r s t company should be determined by reference to the traded prices of i t s assets. If the market value of an in te re st can be determined by reference to traded prices, i t w ill be valued a t the end of the taxpayer's income year. I f the market value of an in te re st is determined on some basis other than the traded price of the in te re st, i t w ill be computed a t the end of the non-resident company's accounting year. The market value of the in te re st a t the end of the taxpayer's income year w ill be considered to be the value computed on the la s t day of the non-resident company's previous accounting year. However, i f the la s t day of the non-resident company's accounting year is before 1 April 1988, taxpayers w ill be required to value th eir in te re st as a t 1 April 1988. 45 The market value of an in te re st in a non-resident company determined a t the end of the company's accounting year must be converted to New Zealand dollars using the close-of-trading spot exchange rate on the la s t day of the company's accounting year. c Valuation by Reference to an Imputed Return Where the traded price of an in te re st is unavailable or unreliable and the compliance costs of establishing market values by any other methods are excessive, the taxpayer may compute the value of the in terest at the end of an income year by an imputed return method. This w ill be based on a rate of return equal to a yield of 5 percent above the yield on five-year New Zealand Government stock. The annual imputed rate applicable to th is method w ill be published each year by the Inland Revenue Department. A taxpayer w ill compute the value of an end-of-year in te re st on an imputed-return basis by multiplying the opening value of the in te re st by the appropriate imputed rate and adding the resu lt to the opening value. The same calculation is done for in terests acquired during the taxpayer's income year except that the imputed return is pro-rated to reflec t the portion of the taxpayer's income year during which the asset is owned. When a taxpayer uses the imputed return method for calculating comparative-value income, he or she may deduct from the value of the in te re st at the end of the income year any dividend received from the non-resident company during the income year. This provision for dividends paid is only necessary where an end-of-year value is determined using the imputed-return method. The market value of an in te re st computed on any other basis w ill re fle c t any dividends paid by a non-resident company. Once taxpayers have an end-of-year in te re st in a non-resident company computed on an imputed-return basis they w ill not be able to a lte r the basis upon which the in te re st can be valued for a further period of four income years. This 46 provision is necessary so that taxpayers cannot choose the method of valuation each year depending on whether income computed by reference to the actual market value of the in te re st or the imputed-return method resu lts in lower assessable income. At the end of a five-year period, i f the taxpayer wishes to continue to use the imputed return method, he or she w ill be required to compute the market value of his or her in te re st on the basis of the rules set out in section 6.1.2(a) or (b) above. When a taxpayer changes a t the end of a five-year period from the imputed-return method to any other method of valuing an in te re st, the market value of the in te re st a t the beginning of the year must be equal to it s market value under the imputed-return method a t the end of the previous income year. Where a taxpayer changes from another method of valuation to an imputed-return method, the imputed-return method w ill be applied to the market value of the in te re st a t the beginning of the taxpayer's income year. In the case of valuations which are not based on traded p rices, the value of an in te re st a t the beginning of a taxpayer's income year is deemed to be the market value a t the end of the la s t accounting year of the non-resident company. The imputed return w ill be pro-rated to re fle c t the portion of the taxpayer's income year represented by the period between the end of the non-resident company's accounting year and the taxpayer's balance date. d Market Value of an In terest on the Date of Commencement of these Rules The date of the implementation of these rules is 1 April 1988. The market value of an in te re st in a non-resident company a t the beginning of the f i r s t income year th is regime applies w ill be the market value of the in te re s t on that date. This ensures th at only accrued gains and losses derived a fte r 1 April 1988 w ill be included in the assessable income of a taxpayer. 47 6.1.3 Proceeds of Disposition of an Interest in a Non-Resident Company When a taxpayer disposes of an in terest in a non-resident company, the taxpayer must include in his or her assessable income the difference between the market value of the in te re st a t the beginning of the year and the proceeds of disposition. The determination of the time of disposition of an in te re st is dealt with in section 6.1.6. A special rule is necessary where a taxpayer has valued his or her in te re st a t the end of a non-resident company's accounting year pursuant to the rules set out in section 6.1.2(b) and the in te re st is disposed of a fte r the end of the non-resident company's accounting year. The amount included in the taxpayer's income w ill be the difference between the proceeds of disposition and the deemed market value of the in te re st a t the beginning of the taxpayer's income year. a Arm's-Length Dispositions Proceeds of disposition w ill be defined to include a l l amounts received or receivable in consideration for the in te re st. Proceeds w ill be valued in New Zealand dollars using the close-of-trading spot exchange rate applicable on the date of disposition of the in te re st. b Dispositions Not a t Market Value A taxpayer who disposes of an in te re st in a non-resident company by way of testamentary or in ter vivos g if t, or for less than i t s market value, w ill be deemed to have received proceeds of disposition equal to the market value of the in te re st a t the time of the disposition. As a result of th is deemed disposition a t market value, the taxpayer w ill be required to include in assessable income any change in the market value of the in te re st from the la s t time i t was valued for the purposes of these rules. 48 6.1.4 Acquisition of an Interest in a Non-Resident Company When a taxpayer acquires an in te re st in a non-resident company, the market value of the in te re st is added to the market value of the taxpayer's in te re st in th at company, i f any, a t the beginning of the income year for purposes of computing his or her annual accrued gain or loss pursuant to the formula set out in section 6.1.1 above. An in te re st acquired during a taxpayer's income year may be taken into account in th is manner provided i t is acquired on or before the actual date when the value of the in te re st a t the end of the taxpayer's income year is determined. For example, i f the market value of the taxpayer's in terest a t the end of the year is determined by reference to the traded price of the in te re s t, any in te re sts acquired during the taxpayer's income year w ill be taken into account (the value of an in te re st computed by reference to traded prices being determined at the end of the taxpayer's income year). This includes in te re sts acquired during an income year when the taxpayer switches from a method of valuation based on the accounting year of the non-resident company to a method based on the traded price of the in te re st. If the market value is determined a t the end of the non-resident company's accounting year, only those in te re sts acquired by the taxpayer prior to the end of the non-resident company's accounting year (on which date the in terest is valued) may be taken into account. In terests acquired after the end of the non-resident company's accounting year w ill be taken into account in determining the value of the in te re st in the taxpayer's next income year. a Arm's Length Acquisitions The market value of an in te re st acquired by a taxpayer in an arm's length transaction w ill be the cost of the in terest to the taxpayer. b Acquisitions Not at Market Value Taxpayers who acquire an in terest in a non-resident company by way of 49 testamentary or in ter vivos g if t or for more than market value, w ill be deemed to have acquired the in te re st a t a cost equal to i t s market value a t the time of the acquisition. This provision w ill ensure that the value of a g if t is not subject to income tax under these rules. However, any subsequent increase in the market value of the in te re st w ill be taxable. This deeming provision complements a sim ilar provision described in section 6.1.3(b) which deems the donor of an in te re st in a non-resident company to have disposed of the in te re st for i t s market value a t the time of the g if t. The rules for computing the market value of in te re sts in non-resident companies acquired by g if t or for excessive consideration w ill be identical to those set out in section 6.1.2. The determination of the time of acquisition of an in te re st is dealt with in section 6.1.6. The cost of acquisitions in a non-resident company w ill also be defined to include disguised acquisitions. For example, property transferred to , or services performed for a company d irec tly or indirectly by a taxpayer or an associated person of the taxpayer w ill be deemed to be an acquisition of an in terest in the company by the taxpayer. The cost of the in terest acquired would be the difference between the market value of the property transferred or service performed and the market value of the consideration received in respect of the service or property. 6.1.5 The Post Facto Adjustment The post facto adjustment is an adjustment to a taxpayer's tax lia b ility on income computed on a comparative-value basis where the annual accrued gain for the preceding year has been significantly under-estimated. The adjustment is designed to counteract taxpayers gaining an advantage from the deferral of New Zealand tax by under-reporting the market value of an in te re st. By removing the advantage of deferral, th is adjustment w ill also encourage taxpayers to value in te re sts in non-resident companies as accurately as possible. 50 A post facto adjustment w ill be required when the proceeds of disposition of an in te re st in a non-resident company or the market value of the in te re st a t the end of the taxpayer's income year plus any dividends received exceeds the market value of the in te re st a t the end of the immediately-preceding income year by more than 30 percent. However, such an adjustment w ill not be required i f the taxpayer has valued his or her in te re st a t the end of the immediately-preceding income year by reference to traded prices, or can demonstrate the accuracy of the previously reported value, or can demonstrate the accuracy of the previously reported value. The taxpayer (or the Inland Revenue Department where i t has undertaken a revaluation of a taxpayer's in terest) w ill determine an adjusted tax l i a b ili ty in accordance with the following steps: Step 1: compute the amount which determines whether the post facto adjustment is triggered: a + b − c − d where: a = proceeds of disposition and/or on the market value a t the end of the taxpayer's income year; and b = dividends paid by the non-resident company in the income year in respect of which the post facto adjustment applies and received by the taxpayer or by a non-resident company or tr u s t in respect of which the taxpayer reports income on a branch-equivalent basis; c = reported market value a t the end of the immediately preceding income year; and d = the cost of an in te re st acquired by the taxpayer during the income year. 51 Step 2: i f the amount computed in step 1 is greater than 30 percent of the reported market value a t the end of the immediately preceding income year, the post facto adjustment must be undertaken. The amount subject to adjustment is that computed in step 1, less an amount equal to 30 percent of the reported market value a t the end of the immediately preceding income year. This amount is referred to as the post facto adjustment balance (PFAB). Step 3: if the taxpayer is a resident individual or a company p o rtfo lio investor with less than 10 percent of the paid up capital of the non-resident company, the dividends and gains in the value of the in te re st are both assessable. A single post facto adjustment calculation w ill suffice. I f , on the other hand, the taxpayer is a resident company which is not a portfolio investor, the dividends are exempt but the company w ill be required to collect a withholding payment a t a rate equal to the personal tax rate . The taxpayer w ill therefore need to apportion the PFAB between th at part a ttrib u tab le to the gain in the value of the in te re st and th at part a ttrib u tab le to dividends. The portion of the PFAB attrib u tab le to the gain in the value of the in te re st is referred to as the income adjustment balance (IAB) and the remainder is referred to as the dividend adjustment balance (DAB). The PFAB w ill be allocated f i r s t to the IAB with any remainder being allocated to the DAB. A separate post facto adjustment w ill be required for each balance. The adjustment to the IAB w ill be taxed a t the company tax rate. The adjustment to the DAB w ill be subject to a withholding payment at the personal tax rate. Step 4: spread the amount subject to the post facto adjustment computed in step 3 evenly across the lesser of: - the period over which the in te re st was held subsequent to 1 April 1988; or 52 - the period since the market value of the in te re st was la s t valued by reference to traded prices. The sh o rtfall w ill be spread on the basis of each complete month of the relevant period. Step 5: calculate the increased annual tax lia b ility (or the adjusted withholding payment) for each income year the in te re st was held during the relevant period described in step 4; Step 6: determine the to ta l adjusted tax lia b ility or withholding payment amount. This w ill be the cumulative amount of increased tax or withholding payment recomputed for previous income years calculated on a year-on-year compounding basis using in te re st rates for each year published by the Inland Revenue Department applicable to tax in dispute. The in te re st levied to adjust tax payable or withholding payments to current values w ill not be deductible. Step 7: where the post facto adjustment applies to the income adjustment balance (the IAB) compute net tax to pay on to ta l assessable income by adding the tax payable on income th at has been subject to the post facto adjustment to tax payable on other income (th at is , tax on other assessable income excluding the amount subject to the post facto adjustment). Where the post facto adjustment applies to the dividend adjustment balance (DAB), compute the withholding payment due by adding the withholding payment on dividends th a t have been subject to the post facto adjustment to withholding payments due on other dividends received (that is , payments due on dividends received excluding the dividends subject to the post facto adjustment). 53 EXAMPLE: A corporate taxpayer X s e lls a 20 percent in te re st in non-resident company Y for $435,000 on 30 September 1990. The reported value of the in te re st a t the end of the taxpayer's previous income year (31 March 1990) was $360,000. During the income year to 31 March 1991, the taxpayer received $73,000 in dividends from company Y. The taxpayer originally purchased the in te re st in company Y on 1 June 1985. Step 1: Compute the amount which determines whether the post facto adjustment is triggered: = proceeds of disposition + dividends received − reported value a t end of previous year. = $435,000 + $73,000 − $360,000 = $148,000 Step 2: Compare the amount computed in step 1 to the reported market value a t the end of the previous income year: = $148,000 = 41% $360,000 Therefore post facto adjustment is activated. Compute the amount subject to the post facto adjustment: = $148,000 minus an amount equal to 30 percent of reported market value a t end of previous income year. = $148,000 − $108,000 = $40,000 In th is example, the PFAB (ie $40,000) is less than the gain in the value of the in te re st in the company, $75,000 (ie $435,000 minus $360,000). Thus, the PFAB is only allocated to the IAB. The DAB is zero. If, on the other hand, the PFAB were $85,000 which exceeded the gain in the value of the in te re st in the company (viz $75,000), the remainder (ie $10,000) would be allocated to the DAB. Step 4: Spread the IAB subject to the post facto adjustment across the period the in te re st was held from 1 April 1988. 54 Complete Months 2 complete income years 1988–89 to 1989–90 24 6 months in 1990-91 income year 6 Total 30 Shortfall per month = $40,000 30 = $1,333,33 Step 5: Recomputation of tax lia b ility Year End 31/3 Adjusted Annual Income Adjusted Annual Tax @ 30% (say) Annual Tax Int.

Similarly, a taxpayer w ill be considered to have disposed of an in te re st in a non-resident company when t i t l e in the in terest passes to the purchaser. 6 .2 N on -R esid en t T ru sts 6.2.1 O verview The comparative-value basis of reporting foreign income w ill apply to resident se ttlo rs who are deemed to hold an in te re st in a non-resident tru s t pursuant to the rules set out in section 4.3.1 and who do not qualify for, or choose not to use, the branch-equivalent basis (see section 5.3). The measurement of the annual accrued gain or loss in an in te re st in a non-resident tru st w ill be similar to the measurement of the annual accrued gain or loss in an in te re st in a non-resident company. The annual accrued gain or loss in respect of a taxpayer's in te re st in a non-resident tr u s t is the difference between the market value of the in te re st a t the end of the taxpayer's income year and it s market value a t the beginning of the income year. 56 The method for computing annual accrued gains or losses is summarised in the following formula: Y = E − (B + P) where: Y = annual accrued gain or loss in respect of an in te re st held by a New Zealand resident se ttlo r in a non-resident tru s t. E = market value of a s e ttlo r 's in te re st in a non-resident tr u s t a t the end of the s e ttlo r 's income year. This w ill be deemed to be the market value a t the end of the non-resident tr u s t's accounting year. B = market value of a s e ttlo r 's in te re st in a non-resident tr u s t a t the beginning of the s e ttlo r 's income year. P = market value of contributions to the non-resident tru s t by the s e ttlo r during the tr u s t's accounting year. All amounts must be calculated in New Zealand dollars in accordance with the procedures set out in section 6.2.2(b). Losses from an in te re st in a non-resident tru s t must be carried forward and w ill o ffset only comparative-value or branch-equivalent income from the tr u s t in future years. 6 .2 .2 V aluation o f a S e ttlo r 's In te r e st in a Non-Resident Trust a Market Value of an In terest a t the End of a Taxpayer's Income Year The m a rk e t v a lu e o f a n i n t e r e s t i n a n o n - r e s id e n t t r u s t w i l l be d e te r m in e d a t th e en d o f th e t r u s t ' s a c c o u n tin g y e a r and t h a t am ount w i l l b e t h e m a rk e t 57 value of the in te re st a t the end of the taxpayer's income year (the taxpayer's balance date). The market value of an in te re st at the beginning of any income year w ill be the market value of the in te re st reported on the la s t day of the taxpayer's immediately preceding income year. The market value of an in te re st in a non-resident tru s t w ill be computed by multiplying the market value of the net assets of the tru st (being assets of the tru s t th at are not indefeasibly vested in beneficiaries, less the t r u s t 's lia b ilitie s ) as a t the end of the tr u s t's accounting year by the s e ttlo r 's in te re st in the tru s t, determined in accordance with the rules in section 5.3.2. The market value of an in te re st must be reported in New Zealand dollars converted a t the close-of-trading spot exchange rate on the la s t day of the non-resident tr u s t's accounting year. b Valuing an In terest Using the Imputed Return Method If a resident s e ttlo r has insufficient access to the financial information of a non-resident tru st to compute the market value of an in terest in the tru s t by reference to the net assets of the tru s t, the market value w ill be the market value of the in te re st at the beginning of the s e ttlo r 's income year in New Zealand dollars adjusted by an imputed return. As for valuing in te re sts in non-resident companies, the imputed rate of return w ill be equal to a rate 5 percent above the yield on five-year New Zealand Government stock. The annual imputed rate applicable w ill be the same as that applying to the valuation of in terests in non-resident companies. The same calculation w ill be made for contributions to a non-resident tru s t during the taxpayer's income year except that the imputed return w ill be pro-rated. Once the market value of a s e ttlo r 's in te re st in a non-resident tru s t has been determined on an imputed-return basis, i t must continue to be valued on th at basis for a further period of four income years. When taxpayers move from the imputed-return method to the net assets method of valuing an in te re st, the market value of th eir in te re st a t the beginning of the year must be equal to its market value under the imputed-return method. When taxpayers move from the net assets method of valuation to the imputed return method, the imputed-return method w ill be applied to the market value of the in te re st a t the end of the la s t accounting year of the non-resident tru st. 58 c Market Value of an In terest in a Non-Resident Trust on the Date of Commencement of These Rules S ettlo rs of non-resident tru sts who adopt the comparative-value method of reporting income w ill be required to value th eir in te re sts as a t 1 April 1988, the date of implementation of the regime. Where a taxpayer is unable to compute the market value of an in te re st in a non-resident tru s t by reference to the market value of the net assets of the tru s t, the market value of the in te re st w ill be computed as the market value, a t the time of the contribution, of a ll property contributed to the tr u s t to 31 March 1988 adjusted on a year-on-year compounding basis by the annual in te re st rate published for each income year by the Inland Revenue Department. 6.2.3 Valuation of Property Contributed to a Non-Resident Trust Property contributed to a non-resident tru st by a resident s e ttlo r during an income year must be valued a t market value. Procedures for valuing g if ts and transfers for inadequate consideration w ill be the same as those se t out in section 6.1.4(b). Whenever additional property is contributed to a tr u s t, i t w ill be necessary to recompute the s e ttlo r 's in te re st in the tru s t pursuant to the rules se t out in section 5.3.2. Where the value of a s e ttlo r 's in te re st at the end of his or her income year is computed by reference to the net assets of the non-resident tr u s t, only contributions made prior to the end of the tr u s t's accounting year (on which date the in te re st is valued) may be taken into account. Otherwise, g ifted property contributed during a taxpayer's income year may be taken into account in determining the market value of an in te re st a t the beginning and end of the taxpayer's income year. 59 6 .2 .4 P ost Facto Adjustment A post facto adjustment to a s e ttlo r 's tax lia b ility for prior income years w ill be triggered where the market value of a s e ttlo r 's in te re st in a non-resident tru s t a t the end of any income year exceeds the reported value of the in te re st a t the end of the immediately preceding income year by more than 30 percent. A post facto adjustment may be triggered by the taxpayer or as a result of a revaluation of the s e ttlo r 's in te re st by the Inland Revenue Department. The post facto adjustment w ill be identical to that in respect of in te re st in non-resident companies. The post facto adjustment is described in greater d etail in section 6.1.5. 6.3 B e n e fic ia l In te r e sts in D iscretion ary Non-Resident Trusts Taxpayers who acquire through purchase a beneficial in te re st in a discretionary non-resident tru s t w ill be taxed on such an in te re st on the same basis as any in te re st held by resident se ttlo rs described in section 6.2. The opening value of an in te re st in the non-resident tru s t w ill be the cost of the interest or market value i f th is is greater. 6.4 Changing from Comparative-Value to Branch-Equivalent B asis R eporting. A taxpayer may only change the basis of reporting income earned through a non-resident company or tru s t from the comparative-value basis to the branch-equivalent basis from the beginning of a non-resident e n tity 's accounting year. The taxpayer must notify the Commissioner of Inland Revenue of the change before the beginning of the accounting year in respect of which the change is to be effective. The Commissioner may require taxpayers to continue to use the comparative-value basis where th eir access to the financial information of the foreign en tity is insufficient to permit branch-equivalent basis reporting. 60 CHAPTER 7 – THE TAXATION OF DISTRIBUTIONS 7.1 Introduction To th is point, th is consultative document has outlined the treatment of foreign income earned by residents through non-resident companies and tru s ts th at w ill be taxable on a current basis in New Zealand. This chapter outlines the proposed treatment of distributed income in residents' hands, whether in the form of dividends from non-resident companies or d istrib u tio n s from non-resident tru sts. 7.2 Foreign Dividends 7.2.1 Dividends Received by Companies All foreign dividends received by resident companies w ill continue to be exempt from tax with the exception of portfolio dividends. However, companies receiving non-portfolio dividends w ill be required to collect a withholding payment on behalf of shareholders. Foreign portfolio dividends received by companies resident in New Zealand a fte r the time of the Minister of Finance's Statement on 17 December 1987 w ill be included in assessable income. A cred it w ill be allowed for foreign withholding taxes paid in respect of such dividends. Portfolio dividends w ill be defined as dividends received from a non-resident company in which the recipient company owns less than 10 percent of the paid-up share cap ital a t the time th at the dividends are received. A dividend w ill be deemed to be received when i t is declared by the payer company. 61 7.2.2 Dividends Received by Individuals Foreign dividends received by individuals who are residents of New Zealand will continue to be included in assessable income. Foreign withholding taxes levied on such dividends w ill continue to be creditable against a re sid e n t's New Zealand tax lia b ility . 7.3 Assessable Distributions from Trusts It is necessary to amend existing income tax rules with respect to distributions by non-resident tru sts to beneficiaries who are residents of New Zealand. These amendments w ill make i t clear th a t a ll distrib u tio n s w ill be taxable in the hands of beneficiaries resident in New Zealand with the exception of distributions made from the capital of the tru s t. 7.3.1 Definition of a Distribution In order to minimise opportunities for deferral of New Zealand tax, beneficiaries' income in respect of distrib u tio n s received from non-resident trusts w ill be defined to include any amount which vests indefeasibly in a beneficiary, whether or not the beneficiary is e n title d to enforce immediate payment of the amount. This definition of b eneficiaries' income is consistent with the definition of trustee income of a non-resident tru st set out in section 5.3.2 which excludes any income that vests indefeasibly in beneficiaries of the tru s t. This definition w ill be restric te d to distributions from non-resident tru sts. However, the extension of the definition to distrib u tio n s from resident tru sts w ill be considered in due course. Distributions out of the capital of the tru st w ill not be included in assessable income. For the purpose of these rules, distributions w ill be deemed to be made out of tru s t income unless the beneficiary can show th a t i t represents distrib u tio n s of the capital of the tru st. 62 These rules w ill apply to distrib u tio n s received and amounts th at vest indefeasibly in beneficiaries a fte r the time of the Minister of Finance's Statement on 17 December 1987. 7 .3 .2 Non-Resident T rusts That Became R esident T rusts An opportunity to avoid New Zealand tax on distributions ex ists when a non-resident tru s t with accumulated funds appoints a resident tru ste e , thereby becoming a resident tru s t. D istributions from the accumulated funds of the tr u s t to beneficiaries in New Zealand would not be subject to New Zealand tax. Therefore, when a non-resident tru s t becomes a resident tr u s t, the resident tru stee w ill be assessable on the market value of the tru s t assets reduced by the value of the capital of the tru s t, being the original cap ital and any subsequent contributions, a t h isto ric al cost. 7 .4 R e lie f fo r Branch-Equivalent Taxes As noted in section 5.2.1, re lie f for New Zealand tax is available for dividends or distributions paid from income th at has been reported by a taxpayer on a branch-equivalent basis. This is provided by perm itting a deduction for dividends or distributions to the extent that branch-equivalent income is earned in the year of d istrib u tio n . There w ill be no provision for re lie f from New Zealand tax for dividends or d istrib u tio n s from income that has been reported by a taxpayer on a comparative-value basis. This is because the payment of such dividends or d istrib u tio n s w ill reduce the value of a resid en t's in te re st in the non-resident company, thereby reducing the resid en t's income measured on a comparative-value basis. 63 7.5 Foreign Tax C redit 7 .5 .1 D ividends from Non-Resident Companies Tax cred its w ill be provided for foreign withholding taxes paid on p o rtfo lio dividends received by resident companies and dividends received by resident individuals in accordance with the provisions in Part VIII of the Income Tax Act. Foreign non-portfolio dividends, while exempt in the hands of resident companies, w ill be assessable when distributed to individual shareholders. Certain foreign withholding taxes on dividends received by a resident company will be added to the company's imputation credit account and thereby flow through to individual shareholders. This is explained in greater d e ta il in the consultative document on fu ll imputation. 7 .5 .2 D istrib u tio n s from Non-Resident T rusts Foreign withholding taxes paid on assessable distributions received by resident beneficiaries from non-resident tru sts w ill be creditable against New Zealand tax payable on such distributions. Section 293 of the Income Tax Act currently permits a credit to be claimed against New Zealand tax payable by a beneficiary for foreign income taxes and withholding taxes paid in respect of the beneficiaries' income. This section will be amended to provide a tax credit for foreign withholding taxes only. The credit for foreign withholding taxes paid on distrib u tio n s to resident beneficiaries w ill be subject to conditions and lim itations sim ilar to those under the provisions of Part VIII of the Income Tax Act. Where both exempt and assessable distributions are received, foreign withholding tax must be apportioned between them on a pro-rata basis. 64 7 .6 D isguised D istrib u tio n s Dividends from non-resident companies or distributions from non-resident tru s ts received by a resident w ill be broadly defined to include benefits received d irec tly or in d irectly by the resident.

Examples of benefits considered to be distrib u tio n s or dividends include those enjoyed pursuant to loans to a resident shareholder or beneficiary a t non-market in te re st rates, or property transferred or services performed for consideration th at d iffe rs from market value. The value of the benefit in such circumstances w ill be the difference between market value of the arrangement and the actual value of any consideration paid or received by the resident shareholder or beneficiary to or from the non-resident e n tity . 65 CHAPTER 8 – DISCLOSURE AND ADMINISTRATION 8.1 Introduction Taxpayers w ill be required to disclose th e ir in te re sts in non-resident companies and tru sts and to provide a ll information necessary to compute foreign income in accordance with these measures.
