The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to binding rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications free from our website at www.ird.govt.nz FISHING QUOTA AND SECONDHAND GOODS INPUT TAX CREDITS PUBLIC RULING ñ BR PUB 03/07 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 20(3) and the definitions of ìgoodsî and ìsecondhand goodsî in section 2, and the definition of ìinput taxî in section 3A of the Act. Definitions For the purposes of this ruling ìFishing quotaî means: (a) Individual Transferable Quota which has been granted under the Fisheries Act 1983; or (b) Individual Transferable Quota which has been granted under the Fisheries Act 1996. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the supply of fishing quota. The supply of the fishing quota must satisfy the following conditions: 1.The supply by the vendor is a supply made by way of sale. 2.The supply is not a taxable supply. 3.The supply is made to the purchaser, who is a registered person. 4.The fishing quota is situated in New Zealand at the time of supply. 5.The fishing quota is acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: ïFishing quota is not ìgoodsî in accordance with the definition of that term in section 2 of the Act. As a result, fishing quota will not constitute ìsecondhand goodsî for the purposes of the Act. ïThe purchaser of such fishing quota will not be entitled under section 20(3) to deduct from the amount of output tax payable in a taxable period any amount of input tax in respect of the supply of the fishing quota. Note (not part of the rulings): These rulings deal with the ability of a registered person to claim a GST input tax credit on the purchase of fishing quota or a marine farming authorisation from an unregistered person. It was considered appropriate to issue four separate rulings given the different nature of the different marine farming authorisations and fishing quota. However, a single commentary applies to all four of the rulings. 5 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to a supply of fishing quota where the time of the supply occurs within three years from the date on which this Ruling is signed. This Ruling is signed by me on the 12 th day of November 2002.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 9 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) Background The question being considered is whether a GST input tax credit is available to registered persons who acquire fishing quota or marine farming authorisations from unregistered persons. While this commentary considers both fishing quota and marine farming authorisations, they need to be dealt with separately as there are different statutory requirements for each of them. Before looking at the relevant GST legislation, the nature of both fishing quota and the various types of marine farming authorisations needs to be considered in more detail. Fishing quota The fishing quota being considered is individual transferable quota as defined in section 2 of the Fisheries Act 1996. The Fisheries Act 1996 is almost fully in force. Prior to this, the operative legislation was the Fisheries Act 1983. It seems that the majority of fishing quota was allocated under the 1983 Act. The provisions in the 1996 Act relating to the allocation of quota came into force on 1 October 1997, and the registration provisions under the 1996 Act came into effect on 1 October 2001. The background to the allocation of fishing quota is that it was initially established and allocated in 1986 pursuant to the Fisheries (Quota Management Areas, Total Allowable Catches, And Catch Histories) Notice 1986, which was made under the Fisheries Act 1983. The fishing quota appears to have been allocated based on a personís commercial fishing history and no charge was made for the quota initially allocated. The quota does not provide a ìfreeî right, however, as an annual levy needs to be paid. These levies are typically significant amounts. While the majority of the fishing quota is held by large organisations, individual fishermen hold some small parcels of fishing quota. Some of these persons may not make supplies in excess of $40,000 in a 12-month period and thus are not required to register for GST under section 51 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. One of these persons may sell their fishing quota to another person who is registered for GST. The question arises for the purchaser as to whether a GST input tax credit can be claimed. The nature of fishing quota There is no definitive statement in any of the fisheries legislation as to the nature of fishing quota. ìIndividual transferable quotaî was not defined in the Fisheries Act 1983. While the term is defined in the Fisheries Act COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR PUB 03/07 TO BR PUB 03/10 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Rulings BR Pub 03/07 to BR Pub 03/10 (ìthe Rulingsî). 1996, the definition appears to have been added as a means of ensuring that all of the quota allocated under the different Acts and sections of the Acts is regarded as fishing quota for the purposes of the Fisheries Act 1996. This change in legislation appears to have affected the characteristics that could be ascribed to fishing quota. Under the Fisheries Act 1983, the fundamental rights acquired by the holder of fishing quota (as determined from the legislation) were that the holder of the fishing quota had the right to catch and take away for their own purposes: ïa specified quantity ïof a particular fish species ïfrom a particular area (the quota management area), and ïin a specific period (in a year, although the quota is issued in perpetuity). These rights were able to be dealt with in ordinary commercial dealings in that they could be bought and sold, used as security, and it was possible to register interests against the rights. The nature of fishing quota granted under the Fisheries Act 1983 has been alluded to in a number of court decisions. The Court of Appeal considered the nature of fishing quota in the case of New Zealand Fishing Industry Association (Inc) v Minister of Fisheries (unreported, CA 82/97, 22 July 1997, Wellington). The case involved the judicial review of a decision made by the Minister of Fisheries to reduce the total allowable commercial catch (TACC) for snapper in quota management area 1. The Court of Appeal made various comments regarding the nature of fishing quota. At page 16 of the Courtís judgment, Justice Tipping stated: While quota are undoubtedly a species of property and a valuable one at that, the rights inherent in that property are not absolute. They are subject to the provisions of the legislation establishing them. That legislation contains the capacity for quota to be reduced. If such reduction is otherwise lawfully made, the fact that quota are a ìproperty rightî, to use the appellantsí expression, cannot save them from reduction. That would be to deny an incident integral to the property concerned. The Court of Appeal confirmed that fishing quota is property, although it provides little in the way of further guidance on its precise nature except to state that its characteristics must be determined from the legislation. Further clarification was provided by Justice Baragwanath in Antons Trawling Co Ltd v Smith \[2003\] 2 NZLR 23. In dealing with a contractual dispute, he stated that fishing quota is a statutory chose in action (at paragraph 5 of the judgment): 10 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) The root of title is the issue under the quota management system (the QMS) of individual transferable quota (ITQ) which is a statutory chose in action comprising a fraction of the total of exclusive rights to fish commercially a particular species of fish within one of the ten quota management areas into which the exclusive economic zone is divided. Rights to ITQ are codified by the relevant legislation, especially the Fisheries Amendment Act 1986 and the Fisheries Act 1996. This dicta, while useful, does not fully explain the rights and obligations that arise in relation to fishing quota, particularly in relation to change in the nature of the entitlement under the Fisheries Act 1996. The position under the Fisheries Act 1996 is different to the previous position under the Fisheries Act 1983. One of the major differences in relation to the rights derived by holding fishing quota is the introduction of the concept of an ìannual catch entitlementî. Instead of the fishing quota providing a right to catch a specified amount of fish, the fishing quota now ìgeneratesî an annual catch entitlement on the first day of the fishing year. Fish are now generally caught under the authority of a fishing permit and an annual catch entitlement (there is also a deemed value payment procedure set out in the legislation). For fishing quota holders, the annual catch entitlement is separately tradable, so that for a particular year a quota owner can sell their annual catch entitlement while retaining the fishing quota that will generate another annual catch entitlement the following year. These developments add a further dimension to the nature of fishing quota. The lack of any in-depth analysis of the nature of fishing quota means that it is necessary to examine the characteristics and rights granted under the fisheries legislation. These can then be compared to recognised categories of property. If they are sufficiently similar, it may be appropriate to conclude that the fishing quota should be regarded as belonging to that particular category. Alternatively, it may be that the most appropriate conclusion is that fishing quota is not sufficiently similar to anything else and must be regarded as a separate category of property. There have been a number of suggestions as to the nature of fishing quota. The terms ìusufruct rightî and ìprofit ‡ prendreî have been suggested as perhaps describing the fishing quota. A further possibility is that the fishing quota might be regarded as the sale of goods coupled with a licence to retrieve the goods. This commentary will consider these possible classifications in the following order: ïIs fishing quota a ìusufruct rightî? ïIs fishing quota the sale of goods coupled with a licence to remove the goods? ïIs fishing quota a ìprofit ‡ prendreî? Usufruct right The term ìusufruct rightî is a civil law rather than common law term. As New Zealandís jurisprudence is based on the common law and doctrine of precedent, the term ìusufruct rightî is largely unknown to New Zealand law. The basis of this term in the civil law as opposed to common law is confirmed by the definition of the word ìusufructî in the Concise Oxford Dictionary (9 th ed, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995) which provides: usufruct n. (in Roman and Scots law) the right of enjoying the use and advantages of anotherís property short of the destruction or waste of its substance. A more expansive definition of the term ìusufructî is found in Blackís Law Dictionary (6th ed, West Publishing Co, 1990): In the civil law, a real right of limited duration on the property of another. The features of the right vary with the nature of the things subject to it as consumables or nonconsumables. Ö The right of using and enjoying and receiving the profits of property that belongs to another, and a ìusufructuaryî is a person who has the usufruct or right of enjoying anything in which he has no property interest. Ö There are three types of ìusufructsî: natural profits produced by the subject of the usufruct, industrial profits produced by cultivation, and civil profits, which are rents, freights, and revenues from annuities and from other effects or rights. The South African case of Geldenhuys v CIR (1947) 14 SATC 419 provided a very full judicial consideration of the nature of a usufruct right. The case concerned the assessability of an amount of income that arose from the sale of a flock of sheep. The taxpayerís husband died leaving the taxpayer with a ìlife interestî in her husbandís estate, with their children as the ultimate beneficiaries. The flock of sheep was valued at £1,451 at the date of the husbandís death. The flock declined in number after the husbandís death due to drought, and a lesser number of sheep were sold for £4,941 some years later. The taxpayer used the proceeds from the sale to invest, purportedly for her own benefit. The Commissioner sought to include the difference in the taxpayerís assessable income. The taxpayer argued that she was unable to be assessed on this amount as she was only a usufructuary in relation to the sheep. This meant that she only had a right to use the sheep, with no liability for waste due to circumstances beyond her control. She accepted that this also meant that the investment did not belong to her. Justice Steyn (with whom Herbstein and Ogilvie Thompson AJJ agreed) delivered the leading judgment. In considering the nature of a usufruct right, Justice Steyn made the following observations at page 424: 11 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) According to some authorities, Ö movables which are consumed or impaired (consumuntur et minuuntur) by use cannot be subject to a full and complete usufruct, but they can be made the subject of an incomplete usufruct, a quasi-usufruct. In this class of movables cattle and animals are, according to the authorities, included. After referring to further texts and commentaries, Steyn J reached the following conclusions at page 428: The passages from Domat and Huber which I have set out above, however, make it clear in my judgment, that with regard to the cattle and other animals to which they refer these authorities hold that the dominium remains with the remainderman; the usufructuary, according to the passage from Huber cited above having no right to sell or kill them and being obliged to restore them. Ö The authorities appear to be agreed that the usufructuary is only entitled to the young or progeny over and above the full complement of the flock. The full number of the flock must be maintained, the young replacing the old as they die, but the flock as an entity must be returned Ö. Application to fishing quota It seems difficult to apply this concept to fish except perhaps in a fish farming situation. The nature of a usufruct right, even if it did apply in a New Zealand context, does not appear to be consistent with the characteristics of fishing quota identified above. A usufruct right is a right to use property without liability for waste. However, under the fishing quota, a person obtains the right to take the relevant fish from the sea and provide these for consumption. The quota owner is under no obligation in relation to all the other fish in the sea. Further, the quota holder does not have to give a school of fish back at the end of the period, although it will obviously be in the quota holderís best interests to manage the fisheries resources to ensure sustainability in accordance with the principles in the Fisheries Act 1996. It is also noted that a usufruct right is typically granted for a finite period, while the fishing quota is granted in perpetuity. The effect of this is that the characteristics of a usufruct right are not sufficiently similar to the characteristics of fishing quota for there to be any serious possibility that the fishing quota could be a usufruct right. Sale of goods with a licence The concept of a sale of goods with a licence refers to a contract for the sale of goods, where a licence is granted to the purchaser to go onto (typically the vendorís) land to get the goods. For instance, an agreement for the right to take trees from a property could be the sale of goods coupled with a licence to enter onto the land and remove the trees. Alternatively, the agreement might constitute a profit ‡ prendre, which will be discussed in more detail below. The distinction between an agreement for the sale of goods with a licence and a profit ‡ prendre appears to turn on whether the purchaser is obliged to take the trees, or simply may take the trees. This follows from the definition of ìgoodsî in the Sale of Goods Act 1908. The definition provides that goods ìincludes emblements, growing crops, and things attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of saleî. Thus, unless the agreement between the parties requires that the trees shall be severed, the trees will not be goods under the Sale of Goods Act. If the purchaser is obliged to take the trees, then the agreement is more likely a contract for the sale of goods coupled with a licence to retrieve the trees, but if the purchaser may take the trees, then it is more likely to be a profit ‡ prendre. This issue was addressed by Justice Young in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Ellison v Vukicevic (1986) 7 NSWLR 104. The case concerned the nature of an agreement between a landowner and a quarrying company where in return for the payment of a royalty, the quarrying company was entitled to quarry for sand and sandstone on the landownerís property. In distinguishing between a profit ‡ prendre and a contract for the sale of goods, Justice Young states at page 116: Taking all these factors together it seems to me that the document looks more like a profit ‡ prendre than a licence, but I must also look at the distinction between profits and sale of goods. After a considerable search, it seems to me that the most accurate statement of the law in this connection is provided by Hinde McMorland Sim (op cit at 715), where the authors say: ìÖ profits ‡ prendre and contracts for the sale of goods are seen as mutually exclusive, the former consist only of contracts relating to fructus naturales or other parts of the realty where the purchaser has merely a right or option to sever, while the latter consist of: (1) All sales of fructus industriales regardless of who is to sever them (2) All sales of fructus naturales or other parts of the realty which are to be severed by the vendor before property passes to the purchaser, and (3) All sales of fructus naturales or other parts of the realty which the purchaser is under a contractual obligation to sever.î Thus if the document puts on the purchaser an obligation to sever there is a contract for the sale of goods including a licence to go onto the land for the purpose of carrying out the contract, but if the purchaser merely has the option to sever then there is a profit ‡ prendre. In dealing with this issue, Justice Young referred to a statement in Hinde McMorland & Sim on Land Law (1978-79). That statement still represents the view of the authors as it is also included in the latest edition of the book Land Law in New Zealand, Hinde McMorland & Sim (1997, Butterworths, Wellington). On the basis of this, the key distinguishing feature between a profit ‡ 12 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) prendre and a sale of goods coupled with a licence to retrieve the goods is that a profit ‡ prendre only gives rise to an option to sever and take the goods, while there will be an obligation to take the goods under a contract for sale. This is consistent with the New Zealand Supreme Court decision in Egmont Box Company Limited v Registrar General of Lands \[1920\] NZLR 741. Application to fishing quota In determining whether fishing quota could be regarded as the sale of goods coupled with a licence to remove the fish, assistance can be derived from the Fisheries Act 1983. The fishing quota itself was originally allocated without cost to fishermen based on prior catch histories. In order to exercise the rights under the fishing quota and associated annual catch entitlement, an annual levy is payable. In determining whether fishing quota is the sale of goods coupled with a licence to remove the fish, the key distinction is whether there is an obligation to take the fish, or whether there is merely an option to take the fish. This question appears to be answered by section 28ZC(3) of the Fisheries Act 1983, and the more recent version contained in regulation 4(3) of the Fisheries (Cost Recovery Levies) Order 2000. It provides that the levy is payable by quota holders irrespective of whether or not the fish, aquatic life, or seaweed to which the quota relates is taken. Given that the levy is payable regardless of whether the fish are caught in relation to the quota, fishing quota should not be regarded as a sale of the fish as there is no obligation to take the fish. It is also noted that the levy charged is for administering the quota management system rather than necessarily being a ìpriceî payable for the fish. Further, the fish are not ìmade availableî eitheróthe quota owner still has to catch the fish. Thus, situations might exist where the quota owner is unable to catch the amount of the particular species for which they have quota, despite having paid the full levy and desiring to catch the fish. The characteristics of fishing quota are more consistent with the quota holder having only a right to catch the fish. Therefore, the terms of the ownership of the fishing quota are inconsistent with it being an agreement for the sale of goods. Profit ‡ prendre It is noted at the outset that the concept of profit ‡ prendre has been referred to in relation to fishing quota in other contexts. The Law Commission in its Preliminary Paper No. 9 ìThe Treaty of Waitangi and Maori Fisheriesî (1989, Wellington) referred to fishing quota as being in the nature of a profit ‡ prendre. At paragraph 4.20 of the Preliminary Paper it states: In economic terms the ITQ scheme has created a new limited monopoly akin to those arising from other restrictive licensing schemes, such as liquor licences and taxi licences. In legal terms it has converted a public right to fish commercially (subject, of course, to regulation) into a series of private rights. It has created a new property right in the nature of a profit ‡ prendre ñ broadly an ongoing right to take something tangible that is present on another personís land ñ and allocated that right to those who held, or had recently held, commercial fishing licences at the time of its commencement. What is a profit ‡ prendre? The nature of a profit ‡ prendre can be gained from the definition in Halsburyís Laws of England (4th ed, Butterworths, London, 1980) Vol 14, ìEasements and Profits ‡ Prendreî para 240, page 115: A profit ‡ prendre is a right to take something off another personís land. It may be more fully defined as a right to enter anotherís land and to take some profit of the soil, or a portion of the soil itself, for the use of the owner of the right. Profits ‡ prendre are often contrasted with easements or licences. All three items, profits ‡ prendre, easements and licences, confer a right to enter onto land for a particular purpose. However, the distinguishing feature of a profit ‡ prendre is that it confers an additional right to remove something from the land. While this concept has been used in relation to rights to take trees, turf and various minerals, it has also been applied to the taking of fish and other game from land. One of the earlier cases on point is that of Wickham v Hawker \[1835-42\] All ER 1. The case was concerned with the nature of the right provided to an individual providing the ìliberty of hawking, hunting, fishing, and fowlingî. The issue was whether this was a personal licence in which case it could only be exercised by the individual himself, or whether it was a right in the nature of a profit ‡ prendre that could be exercised by servants. Parke B made the following observation at page 5: This being the rule of law on the subject, the point to be decided here is whether the liberty granted is a mere personal licence of pleasure, or a grant of a licence of profit ñ a profit ‡ prendre. The liberty of fowling has been decided, in one case, to be a profit ‡ prendre, and may be prescribed for as such (Daviesí Case (1688) 3 Mod Rep 246). The liberty to hawk is one species of ancupium Ö, the taking of birds by hawks, and seems to follow the same rule. The liberty of fishing appears to be of the same nature; it implies that the person who takes the fish, takes for his own benefit: it is common of fishing. The conclusion of the court was that this grant of the liberty of hawking, hunting, fishing, and fowling was a profit ‡ prendre. This case was followed by the English Court of Appeal decision in Fitzgerald v Firbank \[1895- 9\] All ER 445. This case concerned the nature of a grant of exclusive fishing rights in respect of a section of a river. The reason that the nature of the fishing rights was being considered was that the river had been polluted by the defendant discharging waste products from a gravel works into the river which had a significant detrimental effect on the fish in the river. The plaintiff brought an action for an injunction to stop further pollution and for damages for the pollution to date. 13 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) The Court of Appeal decided the case in favour of the plaintiff. The comments of the various members of the Court are useful in terms of identifying the nature of the fishing rights. Lindley LJ made the following comments at page 448: The right of fishing includes the right to take away fish unless the contrary is expressly stipulated. I have not the slightest doubt about that. Therefore, the plaintiffs have got a right of some sort as distinguished from a mere revocable licence. What is that? It is a good deal more than an easement; it is what is commonly called a profit ‡ prendre. It is of such a nature that a person who enjoys that right has possessory rights that he can bring an action for trespass at common law for the infringement of those rights.Ö Rigby LJ, in agreeing with Lindley LJ, went on to state at page 450: I hold that, on the incorporeal hereditament, there is a right of action against any person who disturbs them, either by trespass, or by nuisance, or in any other substantial manner. This decision was followed by Farwell J in Nicholls v Ely Beet Sugar Factory Ltd \[1931\] All ER 154. That case concerned the ability of the plaintiff to bring an action of nuisance seeking an injunction to stop the defendant polluting a river in which the plaintiff held two fishing rights. The defendant sought to defend the action by arguing that the plaintiffís title was not sufficient title to maintain the action in nuisance. The Court held that the plaintiffís title, which was a profit ‡ prendre, was sufficient to enable the plaintiff to bring an action in trespass or nuisance to protect that right. The above cases demonstrate that a feature of a profit ‡ prendre is the right to remove something from the land. The cases also show that the courts have applied this concept to fishing rights. Therefore, on the basis that the fishing quota is a ìfishing rightî, it is possible that the fishing quota is a profit ‡ prendre. An interest in land So far, the cases have concluded that the grant of fishing rights is generally a profit ‡ prendre as it includes the right not only to catch the fish but also to take them away. Another important feature of a profit ‡ prendre is identified in the Nicholls case. This feature is that a profit ‡ prendre is considered to be an interest in land. While not explicitly stated in the Nicholls case, the parties necessarily assume it, as the plaintiff was bringing an action of nuisance. A nuisance, according to the definition accepted by Goddard CJ in the English case of Howard v Walker \[1947\] 2 All ER 197 at page 199 is: Nuisance is the unlawful interference with a personís use or enjoyment of land, or of some right over, or in connection with it. That a profit ‡ prendre is an interest in land was addressed more directly in Webber v Lee (1882) 9 QBD 315. The case concerned the nature of a right that had been granted over certain land to shoot game and to take it away. The plaintiff was arguing that what had been granted was a mere licence, the defendant that the right was a profit ‡ prendre. The English Court of Appeal unanimously decided that the interest was a profit ‡ prendre and an interest in land. While all three judges delivered separate judgments, they all made statements similar to that delivered by Jessel MR at page 318: The right to shoot game and to take it away when shot has been decided to be an interest in land and a profit ‡ prendre. One of the consequences of a profit ‡ prendre being an interest in land is that a profit ‡ prendre can only be created or granted by the owner of a sufficient estate or interest in the land. Hinde McMorland & Simís Land Law in New Zealand (1997, Butterworths, Wellington) states at page 655: It is also necessary to ensure that the proposed grantor both has title to the product involved and has capacity as grantor if he or she owns an estate less than the fee simple. Therefore, a profit ‡ prendre is a right to take something off someone elseís land. It has been held in a number of cases to describe certain fishing rights. Further, it is an interest in land. As it is an interest in land, the fishing rights if they were to constitute a profit ‡ prendre would need to be granted by a person with a legal estate in the land concerned. However, the cases considered so far have only dealt with fishing rights granted over inland waterways, being lakes, rivers and streams. While some fishing quota is granted in respect of freshwater species, the majority of the fishing quota is granted in respect of species that live in the sea. It needs to be considered whether this makes any difference. Can a profit ‡ prendre exist in relation to the sea? The principles identified in the cases considered regarding fishing rights and profits ‡ prendre have been applied to inland waterways. The current situation also involves fishing quota granted over the open seas. There is an issue as to whether the same principles involving profits ‡ prendre can be applied in this instance. Some assistance on this issue can be found in the Privy Council decision in Attorney General for the Province of British Columbia v Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada \[1914\] AC 153. The case concerned the ability of the Government of British Columbia to grant various fishing rights. The Government of the Dominion had exclusive authority over the sea coast and inland fisheries, but the Government of British Columbia had exclusive authority over property and civil rights in the province. The case concerned an area known as the ìrailway beltî, which included both non-tidal and tidal waters. The question was whether the granting of fishing rights over this area was in the domain of the Government of the Dominion or whether such rights were property rights properly in the domain of the Government of British Columbia. 14 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) The Privy Council acknowledged the distinction between tidal and non-tidal waters. Non-tidal waters are those such as lakes, rivers and other inland waterways, excluding those parts of rivers and other waterways that meet the sea and as such are tidal. Tidal waters include these areas where non-tidal waters meet tidal waters, at the mouths of streams and in estuaries, as well as the sea coast. The open seas appear to fall into a separate category. The Privy Council held that in respect of non-tidal waters, the right to grant fishing rights is a property right and as such exists with the owner of the underlying land. It is a private property right. In the case of rivers this may well exist with private individuals, but in the case of lakes, the title to the underlying land is typically reserved to the Crown. On the facts of the case, this should have meant that the Government of British Columbia had exclusive authority to grant fishing rights. However, the Government of British Columbia had specifically granted ownership of the particular land in question back to the Government of the Dominion. The railway belt also included tidal waters. The issue was whether the principles that applied to non-tidal waters could have equal application to tidal waters. The Privy Council concluded that the same principles did not apply. In respect of the tidal waters, there was an overriding public right of fishing in tidal waters, which was only subject to regulation by the Government of the Dominion. Viscount Haldane stated at pages 167 and 168: The general principle is that fisheries are in their nature mere profits of the soil over which the water flows, and that title to a fishery arises from the right to the solum. A fishery may of course be severed from the solum, and then it becomes a profit ‡ prendre in alieno solo and an incorporeal hereditament. The severance may be effected by grant or by prescription, but it cannot be brought about by custom, for the origin of such a custom would be an unlawful act. But apart from the existence of such severance by grant or prescription the fishing rights go with the property in the solum. The authorities treat this broad principle as being of general application. They do not regard it as restricted to inland or non-tidal waters. They recognise it as giving to the owners of land on the foreshore or within an estuary or elsewhere where the tide flows and reflows a title to fish in the waters over such lands, and this is equally the case whether the owner be the Crown or a private individual. But in the case of tidal waters (whether on the foreshore or in estuaries or tidal rivers) the exclusive character of the title is qualified by another and paramount title which is prima facie in the public. From these passages, it can be seen that the Privy Council accepted the general principle that fishing rights attach to the land under the water. These rights can be severed, at which point they become profits ‡ prendre. The Privy Council noted that the authorities have treated this general principle as applying to both inland waterways as well as tidal waters. However, Viscount Haldane noted a further factor that could impact on the application of the principle to tidal waters. The factor is that there is an overriding public right to fish in tidal waters. The Privy Council noted that the nature of the public right was ìnot easy to defineî. However, the public right was regarded as paramount, which led Viscount Haldane to conclude at page 173: So far as the waters are tidal the right of fishing in them is a public right subject only to regulation by the Dominion Parliament. Therefore, while the general principle is accepted in respect of non-tidal or inland waterways, the Privy Council concluded that it does not apply in respect of tidal waters. The reason for this is that there is an overriding public right to fish in tidal waters. The Privy Council also reached the same conclusion in relation to the open seas. In specifically addressing fishing rights in waters below the mean low water mark and in the open seas, Viscount Haldane stated at page 173: Their Lordships have already expressed their opinion that the right of fishing in the sea is a right of the public in general which does not depend on any proprietary title, and that the Dominion has the exclusive right of legislating with regard to it. The effect of this is that the Privy Council rejected the application of the profit ‡ prendre concept in respect of fishing rights relating to tidal waters and the open seas. The basis for the rejection of the profit ‡ prendre concept in relation to fishing rights in respect of tidal waters and the open seas is the existence of an overriding public right to fish in the sea. According to the Privy Council, this title is ìparamountî and subject only to regulation by Parliament. The existence of the overriding public right to fish in the sea was a sufficient basis for the Privy Council to decide the matter in the British Columbia case. However, it is noted that even if the public right had not existed, the Privy Council would not automatically have concluded that the fishing rights were profits ‡ prendre. As a profit ‡ prendre is an interest in land, the person granting the fishing rights needs to have a sufficient interest in the land before the fishing right can be a profit ‡ prendre. Therefore, before the Privy Council could have concluded that the fishing rights were profits ‡ prendre (in absence of the public right to fish), it would need to be established that the Crown owned the land under sea in respect of which the fishing rights were granted. The Privy Council regarded the issue as a difficult one, and one which they considered they did not need to answer. Viscount Haldane stated at page 174: But their Lordships feel themselves relieved from expressing any opinion on the question whether the Crown has a right of property in the bed of the sea below low water mark to what is known as the three-mile limit 15 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) because they are of the opinion that the right of the public to fish in the sea has been well established in English law for many centuries and does not depend on the assertion or maintenance of any title in the Crown to the subjacent land. Therefore, the particular issue of whether the Crown owns the seabed appears to be a complex issue in English law. While the Privy Council did not reach a conclusion in respect of this matter, it seems clear that they considered it would have been relevant to a positive finding that the fishing rights were profits ‡ prendre (although the Privy Council concluded that it was not a profit ‡ prendre because of the overriding public right). Application to fishing quota In determining whether fishing quota might be in the nature of a profit ‡ prendre, it is necessary to consider the factors established by the cases and then compare these with the fishing quota. The first characteristic of a profit ‡ prendre is that it is a right to take something from land. The cases have held that this extends to taking fish from water that flows over land. Under the Fisheries Act 1983, fishing quota might have been argued to satisfy this requirement as being a right to take fish from water that flows over land. Under the Fisheries Act 1996, the position is less arguable. The introduction of the concept of an annual catch entitlement that is severable from the fishing quota perhaps indicates that the right to fish is one step removed from the fishing quota. However, given that the annual catch entitlement is generated by the fishing quota it is considered that fishing quota can still be regarded as ultimately giving rise to a right to take fish from water that flows over land. The second point to note is that fishing quota is granted in relation to a number of different species. These include both freshwater species (found in internal waterways) as well as the deep sea species. It is considered that there is no express differentiation in the Fisheries Acts of the rights provided in relation to the different species. Accordingly, it is considered that any determination of the nature of the property rights obtained in relation to fishing quota has to apply equally to all quota across the various species. Against this background, the Privy Council decision in the British Columbia case that an overriding public right to fish in the sea was inconsistent with the existence of a fishing right in the nature of a profit ‡ prendre in relation to the seas poses a potential problem for the characterisation of fishing quota as a profit ‡ prendre. The Privy Council considered that the public right was ìparamountî and subject only to regulation by Parliament. The acknowledgement that this public right is subject to regulation by Parliament is important in the New Zealand context. It appears that Parliament in New Zealand has regulated the right to fish in the sea through the Fisheries Acts and associated legislation. While a public right to fish in the sea still appears to exist (with the right being limited as to the size and number of fish that can be caught), it seems clear that this is no longer an overriding public right to fish. The rights created under the quota management system now appear to be the paramount rights. The effect of this is that it is considered that primary concern of the Privy Council in the British Columbia case does not appear to be as relevant in a New Zealand context. The final characteristic of a profit ‡ prendre is that it is an interest in land. This means that the profit ‡ prendre needs to have been created by a person with a legal interest in the land. In this regard, problems may exist for fishing quota granted in respect of freshwater species. In relation to inland waterways, the owner of the adjacent land generally owns the land lying under the waterway where the waterway is contained on the land owned by the person, and to the midpoint where the waterway forms a border of the property. This principle is subject to certain exceptions where the Crown has asserted ownership of the underlying landóas may have occurred in the case of lakes and navigable rivers. Thus, the case for fishing quota being regarded as a profit ‡ prendre encounters some difficulties in relation to fishing quota allocated in respect of freshwater species as it not clear whether the Crown would own all of the underlying land in question, from which it could grant an interest in land in the nature of a profit ‡ prendre. The situation is fraught with even more uncertainty in relation to the seabed and foreshore. There is some argument that section 7 of the Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, And Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1977 provides some assistance as to the ownership of the seabed. However, this only applies in respect of the ìterritorial seaî which extends 12 nautical miles from the coast of New Zealand. Fishing quota is granted in respect of quota management areas, which extend 200 nautical miles from the mean high water mark along the coast of New Zealand. Further, the effectiveness of this section against customary title was unanimously rejected by the Court of Appeal in Ngati Apa and Others v Attorney-General and Others \[2003\] NZCA 117 (19 June 2003). It is considered that the position is not improved by the ìsovereign rightsî conferred on New Zealand through Article 56 of the United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Sea. New Zealand did not become a signatory to the Convention until 19 July 1996, meaning that any fishing quota allocated between 1986 and 1996 could not have been granted by the Crown relying on the rights conferred under the Convention. Accordingly, the issue of whether the Crown owns a sufficient interest in the land from which it could grant an interest in the nature of a profit ‡ prendre is unclear. From this perspective, the approach of the Privy Council in the British Columbia case to leave the issue concerning the Crown ownership of the foreshore and seabed as unresolved has considerable merit. 16 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) There are further factors from which guidance can be obtained as to whether fishing quota can be regarded as a profit ‡ prendre. When the Fisheries legislation is considered as a whole and in a wider statutory setting, it is considered that there are some other factors that support a conclusion that Parliament did not intend fishing quota to be a profit ‡ prendre. An example is the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983, where Parliament specifically refers to a forestry right being a profit ‡ prendre. The absence of a similar provision in relation to fishing quota perhaps becomes more significant. A further example is the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 where fishing quota is specifically excluded from the ambit of that Act. While excluding fishing quota from an Act dealing with personal property might tend to support a conclusion that fishing quota is perhaps a profit ‡ prendre, an interest in land, and not personal property, the method of exclusion suggests that Parliament did not exclude fishing quota on this basis. The exclusion provisions in section 23(e) of that Act contain general exclusions for interests in land, and a specific exclusion for fishing quota. If fishing quota was regarded as a profit ‡ prendre and an interest in land, there would have been no need for the specific exclusion. The end result is that there are a number of difficulties with fishing quota being regarded as a profit ‡ prendre. While there are a number of similarities between the characteristics of fishing quota and the characteristics of a profit ‡ prendre, there are also a number of fundamental inconsistencies in the characteristics that indicate that fishing quota is not a profit ‡ prendre. The effect of these conclusions on the nature of fishing quota leads to the further other possibility that fishing quota is a unique property right, with the rights and obligations in respect of the property determined from the statute creating the right (as alluded to earlier). A unique property right The decision in the British Columbia case was cited with approval by the Full High Court of Australia in the case of Harper v Minister for Sea Fisheries (1989) 168 CLR 314. While the case concerned whether payments made by commercial fishermen for fishing licences were a ìtaxî, the High Court made some useful observations regarding the nature of the Australian fishing licence system. The Court noted the similarities between the rights obtained under a commercial licence and the rights obtained under a profit ‡ prendre. However, the Court ultimately concluded that the fishing rights were not profits ‡ prendre, but instead were statutory rights created under the particular statutory regime. Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ stated at page 325: The right of commercial exploitation of a public resource for personal profit has become a privilege confined to those who hold commercial licences. This privilege can be compared to a profit ‡ prendre. In truth, however, it is an entitlement of a new kind created as part of a system for preserving a limited public natural resource in a society which is coming to recognize that, in so far as such resources are concerned, to fail to protect may destroy and to preserve the right of everyone to take what he or she will may eventually deprive that right of all context. Conclusion on the nature of fishing quota From the above analysis, it is concluded that fishing quota is not a usufruct right nor is it the sale of goods coupled with a licence. It is noted, however, that the rights granted under the fishing quota are similar to the rights that arise under a profit ‡ prendre. The fishing quota generates an annual catch entitlement which provides the right to take a certain amount of a certain item (being the species of fish) from a certain area. These are the basic characteristics of a profit ‡ prendre. While the rights seem similar, the courts have held that a profit ‡ prendre cannot exist in respect of tidal waters and the open seas, and further that only the owner of an interest in land can create a profit ‡ prendre. As the Crown ownership of the land under the water in respect of which fishing quota is granted is not clear and for the various other reasons considered above, it is concluded that fishing quota is not a profit ‡ prendre. The effect of this is that it is concluded that fishing quota cannot be categorised as a usufruct right, the sale of goods coupled with a licence, or a profit ‡ prendre. Fishing quota has to be regarded as a unique property right, with its characteristics determined from the provisions of the fishing legislation as set out by Justice Tipping in the New Zealand Fishing Industry Association decision referred to above. This is consistent with the Australian decision in Harper. It could also be seen to be consistent with the position set out by the Law Commission referred to above, where the rights are ìakinî to a profit ‡ prendre, but not entirely the same. It also reflects the statement made by Justice Baragwanath in Antons Trawling Co Ltd. It is noted that the general characteristics of individual transferable quota were set out in section 27 of the Fisheries Act 1996, but that section 27 has since been repealed. It is considered that section 27 was repealed as being redundant, in that it merely summarised the characteristics that are found in other sections of the Fisheries Act 1996. Marine farming authorisations There are three different statutory bases on which a marine farming authorisation may have been granted. Prior to 1 October 1991, the relevant legislation was the Marine Farming Act 1971. Under this Act, the Ministry of Fisheries was able to grant marine farm leases and marine farming licences. On 1 October 1991, the Resource Management Act 1991 came into effect. This Act set out a new procedure for obtaining a marine farming authorisation. The Resource Management Act also repealed the sections of the Marine Farming Act 1971, which enabled marine farm leases and licences to be granted. The new process under the Resource Management Act 1991 involves two stages. 17 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) The first stage involves obtaining a resource consent in the form of a coastal permit, or, if the proposed farming activity is already permitted by the relevant Regional Plan, a certificate of compliance. Once one of these documents has been obtained, an application can then be made to the Ministry of Fisheries for a marine farming permit. These are issued under section 67J of the Fisheries Act 1983. The effect of these different statutory regimes is that there are three different types of statutory approval that might be involved in the sale of a marine farming authorisation. These are: ïa marine farming lease granted under the Marine Farming Act 1971 ïa marine farming licence granted under the Marine Farming Act 1971, or ïa marine farming permit granted under the Fisheries Act 1983 in conjunction with a resource consent in the form of a coastal permit or a certificate of compliance granted under the Resource Management Act 1991. Marine farming leases The characteristics of marine farming leases are set out in section 11 of the Marine Farming Act. On the basis of section 11(1)(a) of that Act, it appears that a lease granted under this section would constitute a leasehold estate and thus be an interest in land. However, as the actual terms of any lease as set out in a marine farming lease agreement would govern the nature of the rights acquired under the lease, these terms of the marine farming lease agreement would need to be considered to ensure that they were consistent with the grant of a leasehold estate. For instance, the lease would need to define a particular area of the seabed. Additionally, the terms of the lease would need to be consistent with the lessee obtaining rights in respect of the seabed. While it is likely that most leases would specify a particular area, as it appears that there is no ìstandard formî lease agreement it is possible that some of the leases granted might exclude rights in respect of the seabed. Such leases may not constitute real property. In order to ensure that the correct position is provided in the ruling, it only applies to marine farming leases that satisfy the following conditions: ïthe marine farming lease defines the area subject to the lease by means of a legal description giving an area in hectares (or equivalent) and its position on a survey plan, and ïthe legal effect of the marine farming lease is that the seabed is not excluded from the area leased. Marine farming licences Similar concerns arise in respect of marine farming licences as with marine farming leases. Section 11(3) refers to a property right that can be passed onto a personís estate and is able to be assigned. While the provision is consistent with a licence being in the nature of a contractual right in accordance with the general law concept of a licence, it is also possible that the terms of a licence granted under this provision might give rise to exclusive rights over a defined area of land and so constitute an interest in landópossibly a leasehold interest. Once again, this appears to be a matter that can only be determined by considering the specific terms of the particular marine farming licence in question. In order to ensure that the correct position is provided in the ruling, it only applies to marine farming licences that satisfy the following conditions: ïthe marine farming licence defines the area subject to the licence by means of a legal description giving an area in hectares (or equivalent) and its position on a survey plan, and ïthe legal effect of the marine farming licence is that the seabed is not excluded from the area licensed. Transition to the Resource Management Act Section 11 of the Marine Farming Act was repealed as from 1 October 1991 by section 362 of the Resource Management Act 1991. However, a savings provision is contained in section 426 of the Resource Management Act. The effect of this provision is to preserve the pre-existing rights relating to both marine farming leases and marine farming licences despite the repeal of section 11 of the Marine Farming Act by the Resource Management Act. Therefore, both marine farming leases and marine farming licences granted under the Marine Farming Act continue in force under the Resource Management Act with no alteration of the rights and obligations under which they were granted. New marine farming authorisations New marine farming authorisations are granted under the Resource Management Act and the Fisheries Act 1983. The first step in the process is to apply for a resource consent from the Local or Regional Council. Section 87 of the Resource Management Act defines a resource consent granted in relation to a coastal marine area to be a ìcoastal permitî. Both these terms are relevant as some provisions of the Resource Management Act relate to coastal permits and some relate to the more general resource consent. If the Council has already approved the proposed marine farming activity in the area, the applicant will likely only require a Certificate of Compliance rather than a resource consent. Once a person has obtained either a 18 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) coastal permit or a certificate of compliance, the person also requires a marine farming permit, which is issued under section 67J of the Fisheries Act 1983. The treatment for GST purposes The new marine farming authorisations need to be considered as to how they will be treated under the GST Act because they involve two separate itemsóa resource consent or certificate of compliance, and a marine farming permit. This matter needs to be considered as it needs to be determined whether there is a single supply of a ìmarine farming authorisationî or whether there are two separate supplies, one of the resource consent or certificate of compliance and another of the marine farming permit. This general issue is a difficult one, and has not been fully dealt with by the courts. However, there have been a number of cases both in New Zealand and overseas which have provided some guidance. Some of the New Zealand cases to consider the issue of single versus multiple supplies are the High Court decision in CIR v Smiths City Group Ltd (1992) 14 NZTC 9,140; the High Court decision in Coveney v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,328; and the Court of Appeal decision in CIR v Coveney (1995) 17 NZTC 12,193. There have been a number of UK decisions on this issue as well, including British Airways plc v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[1990\] STC 643; Customs and Excise Commissioners v United Biscuits (UK) Ltd \[1992\] STC 325; Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[1995\] STC 341; and Customs & Excise Commissioners v British Telecommunications \[1998\] STC 544. From these cases a number of factors has emerged as being relevant to determining whether there is a single supply or multiple supplies. These factors can be summarised as follows: ïThe degree to which the services alleged to constitute a single supply are inter-connected, the extent of the interdependence and intertwining, and whether each is an integral part or component of a composite whole. ïThe mere separate itemisation of things in a contract does not make them separable if they are necessary components of the entire transaction. ïWhether the services are rendered under a single contract, or for a single undivided consideration, are matters to be considered, but they are not conclusive. ïIf it would not be possible to purchase each of the various elements separately and still end up with a useful article or service, the supply is a compound supply that cannot be split up for tax purposes. Application to the facts In determining the degree of interdependence between the resource consent and the marine farming permit, section 67J(2) of the Fisheries Act 1983 provides some assistance. It states that a marine farming permit shall only be issued to a person who holds a coastal permit for the relevant area, or to a person who holds a certificate of compliance in respect of the relevant area. Therefore, this section illustrates that there is a high level of interdependence between the resource consent and the marine farming permit. This relationship is also reflected in section 67M of the Fisheries Act 1983, the section relating to the transfer of the marine farming permit. This section implies that it is only possible to transfer a marine farming permit in conjunction with the resource consent or certificate of compliance to which it relates. It is understood that as a matter of practice, both the coastal permit and the marine farming permit would be transferred when a marine farm is transferred. In terms of the case law discussed above, this relationship between the marine farming permit and the resource consent should be sufficient to conclude that they are sufficiently interconnected to be regarded as a single supply rather than as separate supplies. This is on the basis that one of the permits without the other is essentially useless. Therefore, it appears that most transfers of marine farming activities will involve the supply of both the marine farming permit and the coastal permit or certificate of compliance. It is concluded that when these items are supplied together as part of the same supply, they should be treated as a single supply for GST purposes. The Ruling only applies to supplies of this nature. Legislation Having established the nature of both fishing quota and the various types of marine farming authorisations, the next issue involves determining the relevant GST legislation. The section for obtaining an input tax credit is section 20. Section 20(2) outlines the documentary evidence that needs to be held in order to obtain an input tax credit, and section 20(3) provides the circumstances in which a claim will be available depending on the basis of GST registration. 20(1)In respect of each taxable period every registered person shall calculate the amount of tax payable by that registered person in accordance with the provisions of this section. 20(2)Notwithstanding any other provision in this Act, no deduction of input tax shall be made in respect of a supply, unless - (a) A tax invoice or debit note or credit note, in relation to that supply, has been provided in accordance with sections 24 and 25 of this Act and is held by the registered person making that deduction at the time that any return in respect of that supply is furnished; or 19 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) (b) A tax invoice is not required to be issued pursuant to section 24(5) or section 24(6) of this Act, or a debit note or credit note is not required to be issued pursuant to section 25 of this Act; or (c) Sufficient records are maintained as required pursuant to section 24(7) of this Act where the supply is a supply of secondhand goods to which that section relates: Provided that where a tax invoice or debit note or credit note in relation to that supply has been provided in accordance with this Act, the Commissioner may determine that no deduction for input tax in relation to that supply shall be made unless that tax invoice or debit note or credit note is retained in accordance with the provisions of section 75 of this Act. 20(3)Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period - (a) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax - (i)In relation to the supply of goods and services (not being a supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies), made to that registered person during that taxable period: (ia) In relation to the supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during that taxable period: (ii)Invoiced or paid, whichever is the earlier, pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period: (iii)Calculated in accordance with section 25(2)(b) or section 25(5) or section 26 of this Act; and (b) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on a payments basis or a hybrid basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax - (i)In relation to the supply of goods and services made to that registered person, being a supply of goods and services which is deemed to take place pursuant to section 9(1) or section 9(3)(a) or section 9(3)(aa) or section 9(6) of this Act, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period: (ii)Paid pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period: (iii) In relation to the supply of goods and services made during that taxable period to that registered person, not being a supply of goods and services to which subparagraph (i) of this paragraph applies: (iv) Calculated in accordance with section 25(2)(b) or section 25(5) of this Act, to the extent that a payment has been made in respect of that amount, or section 26 of this Act; and Under section 20(3), a registered person may deduct from the amount of output tax payable, an amount of ìinput taxî in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b). ìInput taxî is defined in section 3A of the Act. It provides: 3A(1)Input tax, in relation to a registered person, means - (a) tax charged under section 8(1) on the supply of goods and services made to that person, being goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: (b) tax levied under section 12(1) of this Act on goods entered for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 by that person, being goods applied or acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: (c) an amount determined under subsection (3) after applying subsection (2). 3A(2)In the case of a supply by way of sale to a registered person of secondhand goods situated in New Zealand, the amount of input tax is determined under subsection (3) if - (a) the supply is not a taxable supply; and (b) the goods are not supplied by a supplier who - (i)is not resident in New Zealand; and (ii)has previously supplied the goods to a registered person who has entered them for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996; and (c) the goods are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. 3A(3)The amount of input tax is - (a) if the supplier and the recipient are associated persons, the lesser of - (i)the tax included in the original cost of the goods to the supplier; and (ii)the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii)the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (b) if the supplier and the recipient are associated persons and the supplier is deemed to have made a supply of the goods under section 5(3) that has been valued under section 10(7A), the lesser of - (i)the tax fraction of the open market value of the deemed supply under section 5(3); and (ii)the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii)the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or 20 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) (c) if the supplier and the recipient are associated persons and the supplier is deemed to have made a supply of the goods under section 5(3) that has been valued under section 10(8), the lesser of - (i)the tax fraction of the valuation under section 10(8) of the deemed supply under section 5(3); and (ii)the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii)the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (d) if the supplier and the recipient are not associated persons and the supply is not the only matter to which the consideration relates, the lesser of - (i)the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (ii)the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (e) in all other cases, the tax fraction of the consideration in money for the supply. 3A(4)For the purpose of subsection (1)(b), applied does not include - (a) the delivery or the arranging of the delivery of the goods to a person in New Zealand; or (b) the making of the delivery of the goods to a person in New Zealand more easily achieved. 3A(5)For the purpose of subsection (3), tax fraction means the tax fraction that applies at the time of supply. Section 3A(1)(c) of the definition of ìinput taxî is the relevant provision. It refers to the calculation of input tax through subsections (2) and (3) when the supply is one of ìsecondhand goodsî. ìSecondhand goodsî is defined in section 2: ìSecondhand goodsî does not include - (a) Secondhand goods consisting of any fine metal; or (b) Secondhand goods which are, or to the extent to which they are, manufactured or made from gold, silver, platinum, or any other substance which, if it were of the required fineness, would be fine metal: or (c) Livestock: Section 2 also provides a definition of the term ìgoodsî: ìGoodsî means all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action or money: Application of the legislation The starting place in order to determine whether a GST input tax credit is available to a registered person is section 20(3). The section provides different options depending on the method of registration adopted by the registered person. For a person registered on an invoice basis, the relevant paragraph is (a)(ia), and for a person using the payments or hybrid basis of registration the relevant paragraph is (b)(i). However, irrespective of the basis of registration, the Act provides very similar tests for claiming an input tax credit in respect of supplies of secondhand goods. The claim is limited to the amount of ìinput taxî in relation to a supply of goods or services to that registered person, ìto the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable periodî. The relevant definition of ìinput taxî is contained in section 3A(1)(c) of the Act. In determining the input tax under paragraph (c) it is necessary to consider subsections (2) and (3). Leaving aside the associated persons provisions (which are not relevant to the current rulings), there are a number of requirements that need to be satisfied under the two provisions. These are that: (i)there be a supply by way of sale (ii)the supply not be a taxable supply (iii)the supply be made to a registered person (iv) the supply be of secondhand goods (v) the secondhand goods be situated in New Zealand at the time of supply, and (vi) the secondhand goods are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Most of these requirements are specified in the rulings to ensure that they will be satisfied in every instance in which the ruling applies. However, requirement 4, that the supply be of secondhand goods, is something that needs to be considered in detail as it cannot be specified in the rulings. Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether or not the fishing quota and mussel licences can be secondhand goods. ìSecondhand goodsî The definition of ìsecondhand goodsî does not attempt to define the term, but instead prescribes a list of things that are not included in the meaning of ìsecondhand goodsî. Fishing quota and marine farming authorisations are not excluded under the definition. As the definition gives little indication as to what is included in the term, regard needs to be had to the ordinary meaning of ìsecondhand goodsî. The first observation that can be made is that ìsecondhand goodsî is a composite term. It relates to items that are first of all ìgoodsî, and then the subset of those goods that can be described as ìsecondhandî. ìGoodsî In considering the first question as to what is comprised in the term ìgoodsî, assistance can be found in section 2. Goods ìmeans all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action or moneyî. ìGoodsî is defined very widely in the initial part of the definition, 21 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) and then subjected to two specific exclusions. It includes all kinds of real and personal property, but excludes choses in action and money. Therefore, it is necessary to establish whether fishing quota and marine farming authorisations are real or personal property and then secondly, whether they are money or choses in action. ìPropertyî Before considering the ìrealî or ìpersonalî aspects of property, the nature of ìpropertyî should first be established. The term ìpropertyî is not defined in the Act. Halsburyís Laws of England (4th ed, Butterworths, London, 1991) Volume 44, ìStamp Dutyî, para 1,032, provides the following description of ìpropertyî: Property is that which belongs to a person exclusively of others, and can be the subject of bargain and sale. It includes goodwill, trademarks, licence to use a patent, book debts, options to purchase and other rights under a contract. A revocable licence is not property. An owner of unworked minerals who gives an undertaking to the service owner not to work them does not thereby convey property, and a grant of a purported exclusive right to carry on a certain business in an area when the grantor has no such right is not a conveyance of property. A similar view is taken in Grayís Law of Personal Property (5th ed, Butterworths, 1968) at page 1: The term ìpropertyî as used in the law of New Zealand and other common-law countries has a dual meaning. It may signify the title to or rights to ownership in goods or other property; and when s. 20 of the Sale of Goods Act 1908 provides by rule 1 that in a contract for the sale of ascertained goods in a deliverable state the ìpropertyî in the goods passes at the time the contract is made, ìpropertyî here means the title to or ownership of the goods in question. The word ìpropertyî may in addition signify the thing owned, that over which title is exercised; in this sense, of course, it includes tangible goods such as a book or a table, but the word covers also incorporeal forms of property such as estates in land (an estate being an aggregate of rights exercisable over or in respect of land) or the contractual rights embodied in a cheque or an insurance policy. From this it can be seen that the term ìpropertyî is used to describe a wide range of things, both tangible and intangible. Its fundamental characteristics seem to be that it is capable of being owned, and that the rights of ownership are capable of being transferred (see, for instance the House of Lords decision in National Provincial Bank Ltd v Ainsworth \[1965\] 2 All ER 472). ìPropertyî needs to be able to be defined and identified, and have a degree of permanence or stability. Further, it needs to able to be transferred. ìRealî and ìpersonalî property It is a well-established principle of English law that all ìpropertyî can be categorised as either real property or personal property. As Gray explains at page 1: ìThe distinction between real property (or realty) and personal property (personalty) is procedural in origin and is derived from the ancient forms of action in English law. In the twelfth century, the possession of freehold land was recoverable by certain actions which were called ìrealî actions; at this date the remedy for dispossession of all other kinds of property was, effectively, damages only, and actions for damages in these circumstances were called ìpersonalî actions. The existence of only two classes of property has its origin in these two types of action. The acknowledgement that property is either real or personal is contained in the first sentence of the following quote from Gray (at page 2): It is not sufficient, however, to say simply without qualification that land is realty and all other property is personalty. Real property includes, besides the freehold estates and interests in land, things which are said to ìsavour of the realtyî. The effect of there only being two classes of property, one being real and the other personal, is that a finding that something is property necessarily means that it will be either real or personal property. There is no third category. Therefore, in terms of the definition of ìgoodsî, if the item is ìpropertyî, then it will be either real or personal property. A question arises as to whether it is necessary to determine whether the fishing quota is real or personal property. The section includes both types of property and as long as it is either one or the other there should be no need to make a final determination. While this is true, attempting to classify the property as either real or personal assists in determining whether or not the item is a chose in action. The reason for this is that the chose in actionóchose in possession distinction appears to be limited to personal property. The exclusion for ìchoses in actionî The term ìchose in actionî is used to describe various types of personal property. It is not a term that is applied to real property. This observation was made in the English case of Torkington v Magee \[1900-3\] All ER 991 where Channell J defined the term at page 994: Chose in action is a known legal expression used to describe all personal rights of property which can only be claimed or enforced by action, and not by taking physical possession (emphasis added). Therefore, a finding that an item is real property means that the exclusion for choses in action will not be relevant. However, a finding that the item is personal property means that the exclusion for choses in action could be relevant. In determining the characteristics of a chose in action, the above quote from Torkington v Magee is referred to by a number of commentators as providing a useful working definition. In a New Zealand context, the Court of Appeal considered the issue in the case of Re Marshall (Deceased), CIR v Public Trustee \[1965\] NZLR 851. The case considered a situation involving a right to demand interest on a loan, and whether this was a chose 22 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) in action for the purposes of the Death Duties Act 1921. In considering the issue of ìchose in actionî, McCarthy J stated at page 860: The right was property, for property in its wider sense includes all things of value. It was personal property and ìall personal things are either in possession or in action. The law knows no tertium quid between the twoî. This celebrated statement of Fry LJ in Colonial Bank v Whinney (1885) 30 Ch D 261 at p 285, is familiar to every lawyer. It received, I think the express, but certainly the implied approval of the House of Lords on appeal ((1886) 11 AC 426). Justice McCarthy provides further guidance on the characteristics of choses in action at page 861: That is so because if the right to give the notice and the corresponding duty to accept it had been denied, there was no possible method of enforcement other than going to law and thereby securing not the physical possession of the thing but the advantages of its ownership. This, says Mr Cyprian Williams in his article in (1895) 11 LQR 223, is the true test, and I agree. Ö The characteristics that one cannot take the right into physical possession (even after judgment in oneís favour) and that it can only be vindicated by Court action, are the qualifying features of a chose in action and have become the bases of most modern definitions (emphasis added). The fundamental characteristic of a chose in action is the same in both authorities. Both authorities refer to the fact that in respect of a chose in action, one cannot take the right into physical possession. Being able to take the thing into possession is a characteristic of a chose in possession. Even if court action is taken to enforce the chose in action, the result may well be that the advantages of ownership are secured rather than actual physical possession of the thing. ìSecondhandî There have been few cases on the meaning of the term ìsecondhand goodsî in the GST context. Case N16 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,142 was a decision of Barber DJ where he had to consider whether deer velvet purchased direct from producers by means of commission agents were secondhand goods when they were purchased by a distributor and exporter of deer velvet. His Honour concluded that they were not secondhand goods. Judge Barber accepted that the two key concepts underlying whether something is secondhand are previous ownership and previous use. He stated at page 3,148: I agree with counsel that the concept of secondhand relates to pre-ownership or pre-use. I agree Ö that the emphasis is on pre-use. I consider that there is quite some commonsense flexibility in ascertaining whether a good is still new or has become secondhand. I do not regard second ownership as necessarily rendering an item secondhand. Many goods pass from manufacturer to wholesaler or retailer to customer or consumer (with other levels of distributors sometimes also involved), and yet are not regarded as secondhand at the consumer purchaser level, even though the item has been used as stock-in-trade at the various distribution levels. The good is not usually regarded as secondhand until it has been used for its intrinsic purpose. The TRA felt that previous ownership of goods is not in itself necessarily sufficient to meet the test of secondhand in the Act. Usually a previous owner must have also used the goods for their intrinsic purpose. Subsequently the Court of Appeal considered the meaning of secondhand in LR McLean & Co Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,211. McKay J expressly referred to and agreed with Judge Barberís comments in Case N16 as to the ordinary meaning of the term ìsecondhandî. Justice Richardson (as he then was) stated at page 11,213: The short point of the appeal is whether wool purchased by registered persons from unregistered persons is secondhand goods for the purposes of the 1985 Act. If the expression secondhand goods is given its ordinary and natural meaning it is common ground that it is not within that description. In ordinary usage the expression refers to goods which have been used, although depending on the context it may apply to goods which are no longer new or even in some contexts goods which have simply been previously owned. Mr Harley for the appellants did not seek to draw any distinction based on ìuseî of the wool by the sellers. The argument for the appellants is that to accord with the scheme and purpose of the legislation the expression has to be given the meaning of any goods which have been purchased by a registered person. The judgments of the Court of Appeal state that the term ìsecondhandî should be given its ordinary or normal meaning. While ìsecondhandî can mean either pre- owned or pre-used, the Court concluded that it is not sufficient that the goods were previously owned. If an item were ìsecondhandî simply through being previously owned, the term ìsecondhandî would be deprived of any practical meaning according to Justice Richardson. Therefore, the Court of Appeal concluded that the more relevant factor is whether the goods have been previously used. The effect of this is that the courts have not extended the meaning of the term ìsecondhand goodsî to goods that have been previously owned but not previously used for their intrinsic purpose. Application to fishing quota Is fishing quota ìpropertyî? When these concepts are applied to fishing quota, it seems that fishing quota would constitute property. Fishing quota is definable and identifiable through being granted under a statutory regime. It is permanent or stable in nature as it is issued in perpetuity. Fishing quota is capable of being owned and there are specific 23 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) legislative provisions in the Fisheries Act 1996 dealing with the ability of the fishing quota to be transferred. On this basis, it can be accepted that fishing quota is ìpropertyî. Is fishing quota real or personal property? The next issue is whether fishing quota is real or personal property. The characteristics of fishing quota are determined from considering the legislation under which it is created. Under section 66 of the Fisheries Act 1996 (previously section 28O of the Fisheries Act 1983) the holders of individual transferable quota obtain a right to receive an annual catch entitlement for the species that is the subject of the quota. While the annual catch entitlement is defined by reference to a ìquota management areaî, there is nothing in either of the Fisheries Acts to suggest that it was intended that fishing quota gives rise to an interest in land. Therefore, based on this and the earlier conclusion that fishing quota is not a profit ‡ prendre, it is considered that fishing quota is neither an interest in land nor real property. As fishing quota is ìpropertyî and property is either ìrealî or ìpersonalî, the conclusion that fishing quota is not real property leads also to the conclusion that it must be personal property. As fishing quota is personal property, it will fall within the words ìall kinds of real and personal propertyî in the definition of ìgoodsî in the Act. Therefore, it is considered that this first part of the definition is satisfied. The next question is whether either of the two exclusions to the definition applies. Is fishing quota a ìchose in actionî? On the issue of whether fishing quota is a chose in action, it is established by the cases that the fundamental characteristic of a chose in action is that one cannot take the right into physical possession. Fishing quota appears to possess this characteristic. The right to catch fish cannot be taken into possession. While an argument could be made that a person could simply catch the fish under the quota, this seems to confuse the fish (which could be taken into possession) with the right to catch those fish (which, it is considered, cannot be taken into possession). The end result is that it is concluded that fishing quota is a chose in action. While fishing quota is capable of satisfying the first part of the definition of ìgoodsî, being a form of personal property, it is then excluded from the definition of ìgoodsî by reason that it is a chose in action. The effect of this is that fishing quota cannot be regarded as being ìgoodsî for the purposes of the GST Act. Given that it is concluded that fishing quota is not ìgoodsî, there is no need to consider the further issue of whether the fishing quota could be regarded as being ìsecondhandî. Therefore, as it is concluded that fishing quota is not ìgoodsî, it is also concluded that fishing quota cannot be ìsecondhand goodsî. Application to marine farming authorisations Are marine farming authorisations ìgoodsî? This question needs to be addressed in respect of the three types of marine farming authorisations: ïthe old marine farming leases ïthe old marine farming licences, and ïthe new combination resource consent and marine farming permit. Marine farming leases It is accepted that marine farming leases are property. The marine farming lease is definable, has a degree of permanence (being the term of the lease) and is capable of being transferred. This means that marine farming leases are property for the first part of the definition. However, in terms of whether marine farming leases are real or personal property, it is not certain that all marine farming leases would give rise to a leasehold estate. To the extent that a marine farming lease is a leasehold estate, it will be real property. If the particular marine farming lease does not give rise to a leasehold estate, it will then constitute personal property. An issue exists as to whether marine farming leases might be excluded from being goods on the basis that they are choses in action. As noted above in relation to fishing quota, because choses in action are a subset of personal property, this will only be relevant if it is determined that the particular marine farming lease is not a leasehold estate (and thus not real property). If the marine farming lease is real property, then it will be ìgoodsî for the purposes of the GST Act. For those marine farming leases that are not real property and are thus personal property, it needs to be determined whether they would be choses in action. The key distinguishing characteristic between choses in action and choses in possession, is the ability of the item to be ìtaken into possessionî. Marine farming leases are like fishing quota in this regard in that they do not have a physical aspect to their nature. They encompass a number of rights, but these rights cannot be taken into possession. The only way to enforce these rights is to sue to enforce them. The effect of this is the conclusion that those marine farming leases that are not real property would be choses in action. This means that if a marine farming lease does not give rise to a leasehold estate it will be a chose in action and excluded from the definition of ìgoodsî for the purposes of the GST Act. For those marine farming leases that constitute real property and are ìgoodsî, the further issue of whether they are ìsecondhandî so as to be ìsecondhand goodsî needs to be considered. The marine farming leases being 24 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) considered are interests in land, and it is settled on the basis of the Court of Appeal decision in Coveney that land can be secondhand goods. The only other issue to consider is the ìuseî issue from cases LR McLean and Case N16. The intrinsic purpose of a marine farming lease is to farm the particular species specified in the lease. If a farming operation has been carried out pursuant to the lease, then the conclusion appears inescapable that the lease has been used for its intrinsic purpose. However, situations could arise in respect of marine farming leases where a person never actually exercises the rights under the lease and simply sells it without ever having attempted to farm the particular aquatic life in question. In such a case, an issue exists as to whether the lease has been used for its intrinsic purpose. On the basis of the case law, it appears that it has not been used for its intrinsic purpose. As this is a question of fact to be determined on a case by case basis, the Ruling only applies to marine farming leases that have been used for their intrinsic purposes, namely used to farm the species of fish or marine vegetation specified in the lease. Marine farming licences Under section 11(3) of the Marine Farming Act, it seems clear that marine farming licences are property. The licences are defined in that Act, they have a degree of permanence (being the term of the licence) and are capable of being transferred. Therefore, it is concluded that marine farming licences are property. The next issue is whether marine farming licences are real or personal property. The nature of a marine farming licence is not entirely clear from the Marine Farming Act. Section 11(3) of the Marine Farming Act provides that the right received under a marine farming licence is ìthe exclusive right during the currency of the licence to farm within the licensed area the species of fish or marine vegetation specified in the licenceî. It seems possible that the rights created under this provision could constitute an interest in land depending on the particular terms of any given licence. If the licence is defined by reference to a particular area of land and the licence provides the exclusive right to farm this area, it is possible that an interest in land (being a leasehold interest) would have been created despite the use of the term ìlicenceî. On this basis, it is concluded that some marine farming licences may constitute an interest in land and will thus be real property. As it has been concluded that marine farming licences are ìpropertyî, those licences that are not real property will be personal property. The next matter to be considered is whether the exclusion for choses in action in the definition of ìgoodsî applies. This issue will only be relevant to those licences that are personal property. The key characteristic of a chose in action is that it cannot be taken into possession. It is a right that can only be enforced through court action. In respect of those marine farming licences that are personal property, it does not seem possible to take the bundle of rights that constitute the marine farming licences into possession. If the rights are not real property, the licence will not provide an exclusive right to ìpossessî the particular area. The marine farming licence will provide for the exclusive right of being able to farm in the particular area, but it does not appear to provide the right to exclude others from the area. Therefore, it seems that the only way to enforce the right would be to commence legal proceedings. On this basis, it appears as if the marine farming licences that are personal property would more properly be regarded as choses in action rather than choses in possession. The result of this is that these marine farming licences are excluded from the definition of ìgoodsî for GST purposes. However, the marine farming licences that are real property are not subject to the exclusion for choses in action, and thus will constitute ìgoodsî for the purposes of the Act. For those marine farming licences that are real property, the next question is whether these ìgoodsî are ìsecondhandî so as to qualify for the secondhand goods input tax credit under the GST Act. The marine farming licences being considered are interests in land, and it is settled on the basis of the Court of Appeal decision in Coveney that land can be secondhand goods. In terms of the ìuseî issue from cases LR McLean and Case N16, the same conclusion that applied to marine farming leases applies to marine farming licences. Whether the marine farming licence has been used for its intrinsic purpose is a question of fact to be determined on a case by case basis. For this reason, the Ruling only applies to marine farming licences that have been used for their intrinsic purposes, namely used to farm the species of fish or marine vegetation specified in the licence. Resource consents and marine farming permits The definition of ìgoodsî requires that the item concerned be either real or personal property. It has been concluded that the GST Act will regard the supply of a resource consent or certificate of compliance in conjunction with a marine farming permit as a single supply. The nature of the property comprised in this supply needs to be considered. The nature of a resource consent and certificate of compliance Section 139(6) deems a certificate of compliance to be a resource consent with the result that the provisions of the Resource Management Act are to apply accordingly. Being a ìresource consentî means that the rights attaching to the resource consent are governed by section 25 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) 122 of the Resource Management Act. Section 122 states that ìa resource consent is neither real nor personal propertyî. This statement is interesting. It is well established that all property is either real or personal property. On this basis, the only sensible interpretation which can be placed on this provision is that Parliament did not want all of the common law and other rights which would automatically attach to property of this nature to attach to resource consents. Parliament must have wanted to regulate the rights that attach to a resource consent. This is consistent with the rest of the section, which goes on to deal with the characteristics of resource consents for the purposes of other legislation. Unfortunately, there is no statement regarding the revenue Acts. The issue, therefore, is whether the statement in section 122 of the Resource Management Act applies to the GST Act. Not real nor personal property In determining whether or not the statement in the Resource Management Act 1991 impacts on the classification of a resource consent under the GST Act, there are a number of observations which can be made. The first observation is that the statement in section 122 is not a standard definition. It is not contained in section 2 of the Resource Management Act along with all the other definitions that are prefaced with the words ìfor the purposes of this Actî. Therefore, Parliament may well have intended section 122 to have wider application than simply the Resource Management Act. A second point can be derived from the wording of section 122 itself. After making the initial statement, the section goes on to address a number of specific Acts and circumstances where the resource consents are to be regarded as having the characteristics of personal property. The GST Act is not one of those situations. This seems a clear indication from Parliament that the opening statement was intended to apply to the Acts that are dealt with in the section. To take the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 as an example, it seems from the plain wording of the section that Parliament intended that the opening words of the section would have meant that resource consents were not real or personal for the purposes of that Act. This was why Parliament inserted subsection (4) to make it clear that for the purposes of that Act, it was appropriate for a resource consent to be regarded as goods within the meaning of that Act. This does not make a resource consent goods or personal property for other purposes though. On this basis, it seems that the statement in section 122 would apply for the purposes of the GST Act also. By not making a specific exception for the GST Act, it is only possible to assume that Parliament were content with the initial statement applying to the GST Act. The third observation, which follows from the second, is the intention of the section that is apparent from the words used. By making the statement that a resource consent is neither real nor personal property, Parliament has created a legal fiction. A resource consent has the general characteristics of property, and the law only knows two categorisations of that propertyóreal and personal. Therefore, in discerning the intention of Parliament in making this statement, the most logical intention is that Parliament did not want the natural common law rights to attach to a resource consent which would attach as a matter of course if the resource consent were either real or personal property. The consequences of section 122 of the Resource Management Act then need to be applied to the definition of ìgoodsî in the GST Act. ìGoodsî means ìall kinds of personal or real property Öî. It has been established that resource consents and certificates of compliance are deemed not to be ìpersonal or real propertyî, and that the deeming provision operates for purposes outside the Resource Management Act and so affects the GST Act as well. This means that resource consents and certificates of compliance do not constitute ìgoodsî for the purposes of the GST Act as they are not personal or real property. Effect of the marine farming permit There is one further matter to consider, and that is the effect that the marine farming permit might have on any ultimate conclusion regarding the combined property right, being the resource consent or certificate of compliance and a marine farming permit. It has already been concluded that for GST purposes, the supply of these items should be treated as a single supply. It has also been noted that the issuing of a marine farming permit is dependent on having a resource consent or certificate of compliance. Based on these conclusions, it is possible to conclude that the marine farming permit would have no effect on the issue of whether the combined property right is goods. However, if the marine farming permit were considered in its own right, it seems that the same conclusion would be reached. It appears that a marine farming permit would constitute property. Marine farming permits are capable of being owned, and the rights of ownership are capable of being transferred under section 67M of the Fisheries Act 1983. There is nothing in any of the relevant legislation to suggest that a marine farming permit is real property. While a marine farming permit provides a right to farm within the permit area, it does not typically provide any right to occupy the seabed. It is considered that without such a right, the marine farming permit is unlikely to be an interest in land and thus real property. That a marine farming permit does not provide any right to occupy the seabed seems reflected in section 67L(3), which provides that the marine farming permit does not authorise the permit holder to take any naturally occurring aquatic life in the area subject to the permit. 26 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) Thus, it is considered that marine farming permits do not give rise to an interest in land and are accordingly concluded to be personal property. As the marine farming permits are not ìmoneyî the only other exclusion to be considered is that for choses in action. From the earlier analysis, the key characteristic of a chose in action is that it cannot be taken into possession. In respect of marine farming permits, it does not seem possible to take the bundle of rights that comprise a marine farming permit into possession. It seems that the only way to enforce the right would be to commence legal proceedings. On this basis, it appears that marine farming permits would more properly be regarded as choses in action rather than choses in possession. The result of this is that marine farming permits are excluded from the definition of ìgoodsî for GST purposes. Therefore, it is concluded that the existence of a marine farming permit as part of a supply of a resource consent or certificate of compliance in conjunction with a marine farming permit will not affect the status of the supply for GST purposes. Regardless of whether the resource consent or certificate of compliance and the marine farming permit are considered together or separately, it is concluded that a supply of such items will not be a supply of ìgoodsî as defined in the GST Act. Summary for marine farming authorisations Some marine farming leases and some marine farming licences may constitute ìgoodsî for the purposes of the GST Act. These will be leases and licences that are defined with reference to a particular area of land, and that provide for exclusive rights in respect of that land. Such marine farming leases and licences are likely to be interests in land and thus real property. As real property, neither of the exclusions relating to ìmoneyî and ìchoses in actionî will apply so that they will not be excluded from the definition of ìgoodsî. The marine farming leases and licences that are not real property and so are personal property will not constitute ìgoodsî for the purposes of the GST Act. The reason for this is that they are choses in action. Because the rights under these marine farming leases and licences cannot be taken into possession, the leases and licences that are personal property will constitute choses in action rather than choses in possession and so will be excluded from the definition of ìgoodsî. In relation to resource consents and marine farming permits, it appears as if the declaration in section 122 of the Resource Management Act that resource consents are neither real nor personal property is intended to apply outside the Resource Management Act. As there is no legislative modification of the statement in respect of the GST Act, the resource consents and marine farming permits will not qualify as being ìgoodsî because they do not satisfy the opening words of the definition of being real or personal property. Therefore, there is no need to consider the further issue of whether they are ìsecondhandî. One further matter Before concluding in respect of marine farming authorisations, it needs to be noted that there is presently a Bill before Parliament that, if enacted in its present form, would affect the three different statutory permissions set out above. The Bill is the Resource Management (Marine Farming and Heritage Provisions) Amendment Bill. This Bill has been reviewed by the Transport and Environment Committee (which reported back on 30 April 1999), and there are a number of useful comments in the Committeeís report as to the existing situation and the proposed legislation. The Bill is currently awaiting its second reading. Under the proposals, marine farming leases and licences will be incorporated into the Resource Management Act and deemed to be resource consents. According to the Committee there will be no diminution of rights for the holders of leases under the Marine Farming Act and the rights of marine farming licence holders may well increase. It certainly appears that the nature of the rights held by marine farmers under the Marine Farming Act will be affected. Instead of a marine farming lease or licence potentially being an interest in land as discussed above, marine farming leases and licences will be deemed to be resource consents. If the Bill is enacted in this form, this will mean that, based on the previous analysis, the marine farming leases and licences will be neither real nor personal property under section 122(1) of the Resource Management Act. Such a conclusion will mean that all of the various types of ìmarine farming authorisationsî will be treated in the same manner for GST purposes, namely that no secondhand goods input tax credit will be available. 27 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) PRODUCT RULING - BR PRD 03/15 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Persons who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by: (a) Perpetual Trust Limited (ìPerpetual New Zealandî), in its capacity as trustee of each Asset Trust (as described in the Arrangement). (b) Perpetual Trustee Company Limited (ìPerpetual Australiaî), in its capacity as trustee of the Titan NZ Funding Trust (as described in the Arrangement). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BG 1, NG 1(2) and the definition of ìnon-resident withholding incomeî in section OB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies Parties to the Arrangement BNZBank of New Zealand NABNational Australia Bank Limited NAMLNational Australia Managers Limited PerpetualPerpetual Trust Limited New Zealand PerpetualPerpetual Trustee Company Limited Australia Asset TrustsSpecial purpose trusts established under Supplemental Trust Deeds to the Titan NZ Master Trust Deed (dated 13 September 2001) with Perpetual New Zealand as trustee Titan NZAn Australian trust established under Funding Trusta Supplemental Trust Deed to the Titan Master Trust Deed (dated 16 September 1998) with Perpetual Australia as trustee NZ BranchThe New Zealand branch of the Titan NZ Funding Trust NZ OwnerNew Zealand owners or issuers of assets to be securitised TSLTitan Securitisation Limited or a trust established under the Titan Master Trust Deed dated 16 September 1998 with Perpetual Australia as trustee QSLQuasar Securitisation Limited or a trust established under the Quasar Master Trust Deed dated 16 October 2001 with Perpetual Australia as trustee ContractorsEmployees of BNZ/NAB contracted to the NZ Branch to perform securitisation services SecondeeFull time BNZ staff member seconded by the NZ Branch to perform the day to day tasks of the NZ Branch 1.The Arrangement is the creation of a securitisation trust structure (ìTitan NZ trust structureî) under which BNZ or NAB can offer NZ Owners access to a pre-established securitisation vehicle, through which they can access a competitive source of funding from a wider and more liquid capital market. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. The structure 2.A number of special purpose Asset Trusts, with Perpetual New Zealand as trustee, either have or will be established under Supplemental Trust Deeds to the Titan NZ Master Trust Deed (dated 13 September 2001). The Supplemental Trust Deeds that establish each Asset Trust will specify provisions that apply to each individual Asset Trust. These provisions may be in addition to, amend or replace provisions of the Titan NZ Master Trust Deed. 3.Each Asset Trust will originate (ie create) or purchase an asset or a portfolio of assets to be securitised from NZ Owners. The Asset Trusts will be New Zealand ìqualifying trustsî (as defined in section OB 1) by reason of being settled by a New Zealand resident settlor (BNZ). Perpetual New Zealand is a company incorporated and resident in New Zealand. Perpetual New Zealand and BNZ are not ìassociated personsî as defined in section OB 1. 4.NZ Owners will generally not be associated with BNZ or NAB. The only two qualifications to this are (i) if BNZ or NAB itself wished to securitise certain of their own assets via this structure or (ii) if a subsidiary of BNZ or NAB wished to securitise certain of its own assets via this structure. 5.Thus in addition to adding to the competitiveness of BNZ in the securitisation market, the establishment of a NZ securitisation trust structure provides the potential for BNZ to securitise its own assets, such 28 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) as mortgages or trade debts, in the future. This may have accounting and capital efficiency advantages for BNZ. 6.The structure will primarily be used for NZ Owners, but may also be used to securitise BNZís own assets. 7.NZ Owners who sell assets to the Asset Trusts or who originate assets directly in the name of Asset Trusts will be bound by the commercial and legal terms of the sale or origination which may include ongoing servicing obligations in respect of the assets. In some instances these NZ Owners will continue to perform certain services in respect of the securitised assets. This will be provided for in the sale and purchase agreement or origination agreement in respect of assets to be sold to, or originated by, the Asset Trust or in a separate services agreement. 8.The first Asset Trust, the Titan NZ No 1 Trust, has already been established for a securitisation transaction. 9.Each Asset Trust will fund the purchase or origination of assets by issuing debt instruments to the Titan NZ Funding Trust or the NZ Branch (depending on aspects discussed below) pursuant to a Titan NZ Trust Note Issuance Facility Agreement. The trustee of Titan NZ Funding Trust is Perpetual Australia, a company incorporated and resident in Australia. 10. The Titan NZ Funding Trust has been established as an Australian Trust under a Supplemental Trust Deed to the Titan Master Trust Deed (dated 16 September 1998). The Titan Master Trust Deed provides for the future establishment of trusts for the purpose of securitising pools of assets that may from time to time be originated or acquired by Perpetual Australia (as trustee). The Supplemental Trust Deed establishing the Titan NZ Funding Trust specifies provisions which relate specifically to the Titan NZ Funding Trust. These add to, amend or replace certain provisions of the Titan Master Trust Deed. 11. Perpetual Australia and NAB are not ìassociated personsî as defined in section OB 1. NAB wholly owns BNZ. Perpetual Australia and Perpetual New Zealand are also not ìassociated personsî. 12. When obtaining funding within New Zealand, the Asset Trust will contract with the NZ Branch of the Titan NZ Funding Trust. The NZ Branch of the Titan NZ Funding Trust then issues notes to New Zealand investors. When obtaining funding from offshore, the Asset Trust will contract with the Australian office of the Titan NZ Funding Trust to provide funding to it. 13. The Australian office of the Titan NZ Funding Trust will in turn contract with TSL or QSL to provide funding to it. A Titan NZ Funding Trust Fund Note Issuance Facility Agreement will provide for the issue of notes by the Titan NZ Funding Trust to TSL and QSL. TSL and QSL will in turn sell notes to dealers or investors. Those notes will be marketed globally, and dealers and investors will typically be non-New Zealand residents. TSL and QSL are both companies incorporated in Australia (or in the case of a trust, a trust established in Australia). 14. The beneficiaries of each of the Asset Trusts are expected to be either the relevant NZ Owner, TSL or QSL. The beneficiary of the Titan NZ Funding Trust is TSL. 15. TSL and QSL are off balance sheet to the NAB/ BNZ Group. They are special purpose companies incorporated in the Australian Capital Territory (or in the case of a trust, a trust established in a State or Territory within Australia). TSL and QSL are not ìassociated personsî with NAB or any NAB Group company for income tax purposes. 16. Interest will be payable at normal commercial rates on armís length terms on funding: (a)from the Titan NZ Funding Trust (b)from NZ Investors (c)from TSL and investors in notes issued by TSL, and (d)from QSL and investors in notes issued by QSL. 17. Pursuant to a Titan NZ Trust Security Trust Deed, each Asset Trust will grant security over its assets to a Security Trustee which will hold that security for the interests of creditors of the Asset Trust which will include the investors in the notes, ie the Titan NZ Funding Trust and/or the NZ Branch. An independent trustee, which at the time of the ruling application will be Perpetual New Zealand, will act as Security Trustee in relation to each Asset Trust. The Titan NZ Trust Security Trust Deed may change depending on the types of securitised assets, but only to the extent necessary to accommodate the asset type, or to a non-material extent. 18. Pursuant to a Custody Agreement, Perpetual Australia or another independent trustee, in its capacity as Custodian, may provide custodian services in respect of certain assets held by the Asset Trusts, such as holding the assets and documents evidencing title to the assets. 19. The Titan NZ Funding Trust and/or the NZ Branch will grant security over its assets to a Security Trustee representing respectively the interests of 29 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) creditors (including TSL or QSL for the Titan NZ Funding Trust, NZ note investors for the NZ Branch). An independent trustee which, at the time of the ruling application, will be P.T. Limited, an Australian resident company (and a related party of Perpetual Australia), will act as Security Trustee in relation to the Titan NZ Funding Trust under a Titan NZ Funding Trust Fund Security Trust Deed. This Security Trust Deed is unlikely to change significantly when the transaction contemplates issuing short term debt instruments through either TSL or QSL. However certain changes will need to be incorporated if a transaction contemplates the issue of medium term notes. If funding is sourced from NZ investors, similar security arrangements will be made by the NZ Branch. 20. A Liquidity Facility is also provided to either the Titan NZ Funding Trust or the Asset Trust by NAB and/or other appropriately rated financial institutions in return for a liquidity fee when the Titan NZ Funding Trust is issuing short term debt instruments. Where liquidity is provided at the Titan NZ Funding Trust level, a Titan NZ Funding Trust Liquidity Facility Agreement will be required. 21. Where the NZ Branch issues short term debt instruments domestically, Liquidity Facilities will also be provided to the Asset Trusts or the Titan NZ Funding Trust by NAB/BNZ and/or other appropriately rated financial institutions in return for a liquidity fee. Where notes are issued to TSL and QSL, it is more likely that the liquidity facility will be provided at the Titan NZ Funding Trust level rather than the Asset Trust level, although this will be dependent on the requirements of the transaction and market conditions at the time. 22. A Titan NZ Funding Trust Clean Up Option Agreement is also likely to be required if the Liquidity Facility Agreement is at the Titan NZ Funding Trust level rather than the Asset Trust level. 23. Further, pursuant to the ISDA Master Agreements, BNZ, NAB and possibly other financial institutions may enter into various derivative agreements with Perpetual New Zealand and Perpetual Australia such as interest rate and currency swaps. 24. In some instances assets to be acquired or originated by an Asset Trust may be funded by BNZ or other financial institutions under a Warehouse Facility pursuant to a Titan NZ Trust Warehouse Facility Agreement. For example, this may occur where the assets supporting the notes to be issued by the Asset Trust have not yet been rating assessed. When notes are issued by the Asset Trust to the Titan NZ Funding Trust or its NZ Branch, the proceeds are used by the Asset Trust to repay the Warehouse Facility. 25. A Payment Directions Agreement may be entered into where assets are funded by a Warehouse Facility. 26. NAML, an Australian resident company, will act as trust manager of the Asset Trusts and the Titan NZ Funding Trust. NAML is a wholly owned subsidiary of NAB. 27. In respect of any internationally-sourced funding the Asset Trusts will have no contact with the NZ Branch. Each Asset Trust is a passive vehicle which, under the management of NAML, implements part of a securitisation solution for the NZ Ownerís funding needs. As discussed in more detail at paragraphs 75 to 92 below, the NZ Branch has entered into contracting arrangements with BNZ or its parent NAB and NAML, pursuant to which employees in certain positions of BNZ/NAB market the use of the Titan NZ trust structure to prospective clients/NZ Owners and seek to implement securitisation transactions through the Titan NZ trust structure. The Contractors will present various securitisation proposals and if mandated will implement the chosen structure. It is generally the NZ Owner that decides which solution is most appropriate in the light of the nature of the assets, its own requirements and funding costs and other attributes inherent in any securitisation structure. 28. NAML as Asset Trust manager will perform the mechanics in terms of contracting for the issue of notes to the Titan NZ Funding Trust (Australian office) (for offshore funding) or the NZ Branch (for NZ funding). 29. In some circumstances the structure of the securitisation will have the funding route as a predetermined element of the structure. In these cases, NAML, as the manager of the Asset Trust, will have no discretion in terms of the funding route used. In other circumstances NAML will have a degree of discretion as to the funding route employed. The most appropriate route will be based on market demand conditions and funding costs. However, the Contractors, in making a securitisation proposal to the NZ Owner in these circumstances will have had regard to the most appropriate funding route at that time. 30. Further, funding obtained from TSL and QSL will not be routed through the NZ Branch or have any relationship with the NZ Branch. Rather, the Australian office of the Titan NZ Funding Trust will contract with TSL and QSL as the Australian office will have direct access to TSL and QSL and will therefore be more easily able to source funds from offshore. TSL and QSL have no presence in New Zealand and do not carry on business in New Zealand. 30 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) 31. It was estimated at the time of the Ruling application that most transactions that will be put through the Titan NZ trust structure (whether funded through the Titan NZ Funding Trust (Australia), or the NZ Branch) will be in the range of $NZ75 million to $NZ200 million. Need for securitisation structure and offshore funding 32. One of the essential commercial drivers for setting up an independent securitisation vehicle is to enable banks to offer new and existing customers more competitive funding solutions. The Titan NZ trust structure seeks to improve the securitisation solutions BNZ can offer to NZ Owners by, amongst other things, enabling access to lower cost benefits of broadly based and more flexible offshore funding. 33. Funding cost advantages accrue both through a large securitisation structure being able to access a number of markets and pricing advantages through the market recognition of the securitisation structureís brand. Such structures are used almost universally by securitisation sponsors throughout the world. 34. The Titan NZ Funding Trust is being used in the New Zealand structure because of the expectation that there will be a need for the funding to be predominantly from offshore due to the limits in size and liquidity in the New Zealand market. 35. TSL and QSL structures currently operate in Australia and are utilised by NAB and its customers. TSL has a recognised brand in Australia, and is expected to provide a high level of origination skills and experience. QSL has been recently established and is developing its brand in Australia. The Titan NZ trust structure will have at its disposal the expertise of proven originators, the Contractors who operate in the more developed Australian market. This is complemented by a professional and dedicated New Zealand based servicing function through the NZ Branch. These factors are further discussed below. 36. The decision whether to fund in A$ (or US$) through the Australian office of the Titan NZ Funding Trust or in New Zealand through the NZ Branch will be dependent on the location with the cheapest source of funds or which market is more suitable given the volume and nature of the underlying assets, investor demand in respective markets at the time, and the requirements of the NZ Owner. 37. The Titan NZ trust structure will enable NZ Owners to enjoy the benefit provided by the depth and pricing advantages of the offshore capital markets due to their ability to absorb much larger issue volumes (therefore being more liquid) without being unduly penalised on the yield. As well, while the Titan NZ trust structure allows access to the more liquid offshore markets it also maintains the ability to access the NZ market. 38. The Titan NZ trust structure also offers a back up funding solution if market conditions cause a need for an alternative funding source to be adopted when a transaction is being negotiated. 39. Further, the effectiveness of a securitisation solution depends, inter alia, on its ability to reproduce itself relatively cheaply and to raise funding on beneficial terms. Fixed upfront costs are an impediment and a structure like the Titan NZ trust structure allows a portion of these fixed costs to be defrayed over a number of transactions. It also allows ongoing management to be conducted more effectively. The Titan NZ trust structure is a pre-established structure with well developed documentation and procedures which can be used to allow efficient and cost effective implementation and running of transactions on an ongoing basis. Further need for funding trust ñ re overseas funding 40. The Titan NZ Funding Trust is also being used in the New Zealand structure because the ìTitanî name will attract investors. The Titan NZ Funding Trust is separate from the Asset Trusts because it is commercially attractive to use Titanís established reputation (and the growing reputation of Quasar) in the market in relation to the raising of funds from offshore investors. 41. In the Australian structure TSL and QSL directly fund the Australian Asset Trusts. The New Zealand position is different for the reasons set out below. 42. Firstly, using the Titan NZ Funding Trust, being an Australian trust with a branch in New Zealand, allows access to a broader pool of liquidity support providers. The reason for this is because there is a much larger number of financial institutions in Australia that will be able to provide liquidity support. This is especially the case where funding is provided by TSL or QSL, in which case liquidity support is required in Australian or US dollars (as opposed to the NZ Branch issuing commercial paper to NZ investors). 43. Further, for structural and documentation reasons it was seen as more expedient and efficient for TSL or QSL to purchase notes from an Australian trust with Perpetual Australia as trustee and NAML as manager. 44. TSL itself was also not considered an appropriate direct funding entity to the Asset Trusts because there is an intention to attract a broader pool of 31 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) investors and to use the structure for a broader pool of assets (hence the involvement of QSL). Using a branch of TSL to fund assets through QSL would have created an undesirable brand fusion between QSL and TSL. It is important for BNZ and NAB to maintain a clear distinction between the Titan and Quasar brands from a marketing perspective as TSL and QSL provide two distinct funding solutions for issuers. Using a branch of the Titan NZ Funding Trust, rather than a branch of TSL, eliminates TSL from any transaction which will ultimately be funded by notes issued by QSL (and vice versa). Further it is not considered viable, given the size of the New Zealand securitisation market to set up two branches in New Zealand, one for TSL and one for QSL. 45. The isolation of the NZ assets exposure in the Titan NZ Funding Trust and NZ Branch also makes the credit rating process easier and more flexible than if a branch of TSL is used. The segregation of NZ assets is easily achievable at the Titan NZ Funding Trust via the use of the Titan NZ Funding Trust Supplemental Deed and the Titan NZ Funding Trust Security Trust Deed arrangements. This would also be achievable at the Asset Trust level, but as stated above, that could potentially give rise to liquidity support issues. 46. Further, as TSL is a pre-established entity and is very restricted in what it can do by virtue of the terms of the transaction documents to which it is a party and rating agency requirements, it would have been difficult to obtain approval for a branch of TSL in New Zealand. It was thought cleaner and more expedient to establish the Titan NZ Funding Trust and have it establish a branch in New Zealand to avoid this approval process. 47. As a consequence it was determined that the Titan NZ Funding Trust should be established. 48. TSL is an established entity in the Australian securitisation market and will use its existing reputation and credit rating to attract investors in its notes. QSL has recently been established and is expected to build the same reputation and also use its credit rating to attract investors in its notes. The difference between TSL and QSL and the advantage of the Titan NZ Funding Trust having access to both vehicles is that because of credit rating requirements, QSL has the ability to invest in lower rated notes than TSL and so provides NZ Owners with the ability to securitise a much broader range of assets. TSLís and QSLís investors: 49. TSL will issue mainly to Australian asset backed commercial paper (ìABCPî) investors and TSL (USA) Inc. will issue mainly to US ABCP investors via its US dealer panel. 50. All ABCP investors of TSL, TSL (USA) Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of TSL incorporated in the US State of Delaware which issues mainly to US ABCP investors via its US dealer panel) and QSL are non-retail investors, eg funds managers and superannuation funds. 51. In time it is proposed that the NZ Branch of the Titan NZ Funding Trust will issue ABCP to non- retail ABCP NZ investors. 52. It is also possible that the Titan NZ Funding Trust will issue medium term notes to TSL or QSL in order to issue medium term notes to the market. The NZ Branch i)Functions 53. The NZ Branch of the Titan NZ Funding Trust will be responsible for marketing the Titan and Quasar brands in New Zealand, obtaining funding from NZ investors and performing other services in respect of the Asset Trusts and for BNZ. The NZ Branch will have the ability to issue debt instruments to New Zealand investors. As discussed below, the NZ Branch will initially employ one full time Secondee and will contract for the services of three Contractors from BNZ/NAB. 54. Part of the commercial rationale for the NZ Branch is to benefit from the power of the Titan brand in Australia, and the need for a physical presence in New Zealand to attract New Zealand investors who are familiar with the New Zealand market. Without the presence of the NZ Branch, the Titan (and Quasar) programme would not function effectively. In particular, the key factors which influenced the decision to establish a branch of Titan in New Zealand were as follows: (a)the desire to use a number of personnel with a range of securitisation experience and in particular taking advantage of the proven experience and expertise of personnel that work in the more developed Australian market; (b)the need for a New Zealand based flagship for Titan in New Zealand, especially for NZ Owners who implement transactions through the Titan NZ trust structure; (c)the need for a physical New Zealand base that origination personnel can use to help market, develop, negotiate and implement Titan NZ transactions; (d)the advantages provided by having the servicing and administration of Titan NZ transactions done in New Zealand; 32 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) (e)the identification of personnel suitable for the servicing and administration tasks required; and (f)the desire to expand the New Zealand funding market and in doing so increase the flexibility of funding solutions on offer to New Zealand clients. 55. BNZ and its parent NAB expect to benefit in terms of increased banking business and enhanced customer relationships from the use of the Titan and Quasar names and structure. It is hoped that a New Zealand structure will enable BNZ to increase the scope of business it can undertake with any particular NZ Owner and increase the availability of funding to NZ Owners. Servicing Functions 56. The servicing functions of the NZ Branch will include the following: ïLiasing with auditors; ïLiaising with the registrar and paying agent under commercial paper issues in New Zealand; ïManaging the NZ Branchís cashflows including the receipt and reinvestment of income and payment of interest and expenses; ïDirecting the trustee with respect to payments to be made from the bank accounts of the NZ Branch; ïMaintaining accounting records of all transactions and providing copies of these records to NAML; ïMaintaining management information reports and providing such reports to NAML; ïChecking covenants compliance; ïSoliciting bids, receiving and accepting bids from the New Zealand dealer panel at each commercial paper rollover date, including, ñreceiving bids from Dealer Banks on day of Tender ñselecting bids in order of price and advise successful Dealers ñmaking calls on liquidity facilities when bids for commercial paper result in tender shortfall, and ñwriting reports on draw downs, rates, split of subscriptions, etc, in respect of debt draw downs. ïEnsuring compliance with New Zealand law and the trust deed establishing the Titan NZ Funding Trust and NZ Branch; and ïIn conjunction with the trustee and NAML, implementation and management of contracting arrangements with BNZ or NAB including negotiation of fee arrangements, negotiation and renewal of Contractors as they expire and liaising with the Contractors on an ongoing basis. Managing BNZ asset backed transactions 57. The services for BNZ are set out in the Services Agreement and involve management of BNZís existing asset backed transactions and others agreed from time to time. The details of these transactions are set out in the draft Services Agreement which has an initial period of two years, and automatically extends unless terminated by any party. 58. These are transactions that have been entered into by BNZ and require ongoing management. 59. While servicing/managing BNZís existing transactions will form part of the Secondeeís work initially, this is not the core task of the NZ Branch. The NZ Branch is being established as a key strategic part of the Titan NZ trust structure. As a result of further transactions being implemented through the Titan NZ trust structure, it is expected that the servicing function provided by the NZ Branch will eventually involve predominantly Titan NZ transactions with existing BNZ transactions providing only supplementary business to the NZ Branch. 60. Although it is anticipated that future BNZ originated transactions will be executed through the Titan NZ trust structure, there may be eventualities (eg the credit quality or nature of the underlying assets) where a separate standalone programme is required. In these cases provision is made within the Services Agreement for the NZ Branch to provide management services. 61. As the NZ Branch will have the management skills required for its own activity, including servicing the Asset Trusts, BNZ has an interest in using the NZ Branchís competencies against payment of an armís length management fee. NAB/BNZ has taken a business decision to structure its securitisation business around the Titan (and Quasar) structure and perceives benefits in having the centralisation of securitisation management in one unit. For example, one such benefit is that the identification of risks or benefits from certain aspects of a transaction can be seamlessly passed over to other transactions to ensure such risks or benefits are dealt with appropriately over all securitisation transactions. 33 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) 62. Further, BNZ considers there to be advantages in isolating a particular set of transactions, and the risks that are associated with them, in a separate and distinct entity. The NZ Branch provides this and is compensated for the risk it assumes. 63. The servicing of the existing transactions by the Secondee is, in essence, providing ongoing management in normal operational conditions. Where existing asset backed transactions require executive action outside normal management, other BNZ securitisation staff will be involved. 64. The precise tasks that will be performed in respect of each transaction are set out in schedule 2 of the Services Agreement. However, the general nature of the activities that will be performed on behalf of BNZ are as follows: ïArranging liquidity facilities and liaising with liquidity facility providers on an ongoing basis ïWhere required, arranging hedge contracts/ credit enhancements to be entered into by the Asset Trusts and liaising with hedge/credit enhancement providers on an ongoing basis ïArranging the acquisition/sale of any assets ïLiaising with third party asset servicers ïLiasing with auditors in conjunction with NAML ïLiaising with the registrar and paying agent under commercial paper issues in New Zealand ïMaking regular payments of interest and fees ïLiasing with participating banks ïMaintaining accounting records of all transactions and providing copies of these records to BNZ and NAML ïMaintaining management information reports and providing such reports to BNZ and NAML ïMaking calls on credit enhancement providers ïChecking covenants compliance ïChecking asset servicer reports and ensuring compliance to rating agenciesí requirements (for rated transactions only) ïLiaising with and instructing the trustee of the Asset Trusts on an ongoing basis, and ïSoliciting bids, receiving and accepting bids from the New Zealand dealer panel at each commercial paper rollover date, including: ñreceiving bids from Dealer Banks on day of Tender ñselecting bids in order of price and advising successful Dealers; ñmaking calls on liquidity facilities when bids for commercial paper result in tender shortfall; ñwriting reports on draw downs, rates, split of subscriptions, etc, in respect of debt draw downs. Servicing the Asset Trusts 65. As stated, NAML (an Australian resident company) will act as trust manager of both the Asset Trusts and the Titan NZ Funding Trust. This includes the task of servicing the Asset Trusts. However, because of its lack of presence in New Zealand, NAML will delegate certain servicing functions and some management functions in respect of the Asset Trusts to the NZ Branch pursuant to a Delegation Agreement. In its service role, the NZ Branch will be required to calculate and direct Perpetual New Zealand as trustee of the Asset Trusts in relation to the receipt and payment of interest, principal and fees in respect of the assets and liabilities of each Asset Trust, and perform various services in respect of those assets similar to those set out in respect of existing BNZ asset backed transactions. There is no overlap in NAMLís role and the NZ Branchís functions pursuant to the Delegation Agreement other than necessary continued supervision by NAML. The extent of the delegation by NAML is expected to be greater where the source of funding is the domestic market (via the NZ Branch) as opposed to TSL or QSL. The extent of delegation will also vary depending on the asset type and structure. 66. It is intended and expected that the NZ Branch will service every Asset Trust, even where the NZ Owner is an existing client of BNZ, or BNZ itself. However, as stated in paragraph 7 above, certain servicing obligations in respect of the specific assets may remain with the NZ Owner, including a situation where BNZ might securitise some of its own assets through the structure. 67. It is important that the servicing function is carried out from New Zealand because the servicing of a securitisation transaction is much more complex than the servicing of simple debt transactions. This is essentially because of the stringent requirements that the rating agencies impose on the NZ Owner and the servicer of the programme to be able to 34 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) achieve a strong credit rating on the securitised debt. It is important that the issuer and the servicer communicate frequently and easily, and the Secondee will be identified as a contact point for clients. It is strongly desirable that the servicing takes place in New Zealand. NAML does not have the New Zealand presence and does not have skills and experience in the New Zealand securitisation market. 68. This is strategically essential for the NZ Branch as servicing of the Asset Trusts is an essential building block for the effective presence of the Titan and Quasar securitisation trust structures in New Zealand and for brand development. The NZ Branchís servicing function, by delivering excellence in service, will contribute to the development of the Titan brand. It also provides convenience and advantages in terms of the contacts and networking a New Zealand based person has with other New Zealand based parties that play important roles in securitisation transactions. For example, if a Titan transaction is funded in New Zealand, the Secondee will have direct contact with the commercial paper dealers in New Zealand and can call or visit them if necessary. The same applies to liquidity providers, hedge providers, standby facility providers, warehouse providers and other liquidity enhancement providers where these are New Zealand based institutions, and the registrar and paying agent for commercial paper programmes. The Secondee will deal with these parties on a regular basis, providing an established networking advantage to the NZ Branch. 69. Because NAB/BNZ believes that the local servicing presence is a very important factor in securitization transactions, the Contractors will promote the local servicing presence to NZ Owners. 70. One element of NABís strategy for its securitisation business is the centralization, where possible, of the management of its securitisation transactions in specialised off balance sheet entities. This has benefits, not only for prudential reporting purposes, but also enhances the quality of risk management and the centralization of expertise. Virtually all large securitisation arrangers use the services of a management unit with a high degree of separation from the rest of their operation. 71. The Delegation Agreement has been drafted as a master agreement pursuant to which specific tasks to be delegated to each Asset Trust are specified in a schedule each time a new Asset Trust is established. This recognises that the specific tasks to be delegated will depend on the type of assets to be securitised and whether the asset is to be funded via the domestic or offshore market. 72. Whilst the delegated functions in respect of the Asset Trusts could theoretically be carried out by NAML, it does not make commercial sense for NAML to perform such functions if it has the ability to delegate them to someone ìon the groundî in New Zealand. In particular, establishment of bank accounts, performing account and cash reconciliations, directing the trustee in relation to payments and any activities required where the facility/swap/other provider is BNZ, should be carried out locally if possible. 73. The extent of delegation will depend on the asset type involved. 74. As Asset Trust manager, NAML will continue to perform its obligations to monitor the financial and contractual performance of each Asset Trust, and prepare and maintain accounts and financial records. Marketing 75. In addition, the NZ Branch will be required to market the Titan and Quasar brands in New Zealand through Contractors from BNZ/NAB. Contractors are also responsible for the negotiation and execution of transactions. As stated above, the NZ Branch will enter into contracting arrangements with BNZ or its parent NAB and NAML (as Titan NZ Funding Trust manager), pursuant to which employees in certain positions of BNZ/NAB market the use of the Titan NZ trust structure to prospective clients and seek to implement securitisation transactions through the Titan NZ trust structure. 76. Once it is established every transaction put through the Titan NZ trust structure will be arranged by Contractors working for the NZ Branch. 77. Contractually and legally the Contractors act for the NZ Branch when implementing transactions. It is important to clearly differentiate the Titan NZ trust structure from any other securitisation solutions used by BNZ to help develop the Titan brand in New Zealand. 78. As stated, because NAB/BNZ believes that the servicing is a very important factor in securitisation transactions, it is important that the Contractors promote the local servicing presence as a key deal winning aspect of the Titan NZ trust structure. For example, this will be included in presentations to potential NZ Owners. Further, meetings will, if practical for NZ Owners, take place at the NZ Branch premises and NZ Owners will be introduced to the Secondee to put a face to the servicing aspect of the transaction. NAB/BNZ strongly believe that the Contractors must be associated to the local presence, and therefore must be operating for the 35 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) NZ Branch. The NZ Branch also provides a base where the Contractors can meet with clients to make presentations and discuss, negotiate and execute transactions. This also helps associate the Contractors with the local presence. As well, having a physical office presence and an identified focal point, which is branded, displays a clear sense of professionalism and commitment to the New Zealand market, which can be important factors in marketing and successfully securing transactions. 79. The Contractors work within the NAB Groupís securitisation business. Two Contractors will be NAB personnel based in Australia. The Australian securitisation market is one of the largest in the world and the Contractors need to be based there in order to maintain and develop the required level of expertise. Securitisation transactions are highly varied and require differentiated skills which are specialised in nature. These skills are available within the wider NAB Group. 80. The actual time that will be spent in New Zealand by the Australian based Contractors will vary depending on the opportunities that present themselves. 81. A good proportion of the Contractorsí time will also be spent working with other BNZ staff in identifying opportunities and preparing approaches without the need for travel. 82. The role of the Contractors and their physical presence in New Zealand, although periodical, is fundamental to the NZ Branchís strategy. 83. There are three contracting agreements for Contractors covering different areas of expertise. 84. The contracting arrangements between the NZ Branch and BNZ or NAB will be in respect of specific positions within BNZ or NAB for an initial period of two years. Each contract will be in respect of one staff member although the identity of that staff member could change if an individual leaves BNZ or NAB or changes positions during the term of the contract. The personnel contracted by the NZ Branch from BNZ or NAB will be professionals each with specific expertise in the different types of securitisation transactions intended to be put through the Titan NZ trust structure. The Contractors will be responsible for the following: Marketing Each Contractor will market the capabilities of the Titan NZ trust structure to prospective securitisation clients in the Contractorís niche area. Their tasks include: ïlooking actively for business opportunities to be funded through the Titan NZ Funding Trust or the NZ Branch ïliaising with the Secondee of the NZ Branch in relation to potential transactions ïmeeting potential customers and discussing business opportunities for the Titan NZ Funding Trust or the NZ Branch ïmaking presentations to potential customers ïnegotiating the commercial terms of potential transactions ïnegotiating securitisation agreements and related documents for the Asset Trusts and the NZ Branch in conjunction with NAML and the trustee of the Asset Trust ïmaking offers on securitisation transactions on behalf of the Titan NZ Funding Trust and the NZ Branch ïpreparing regular marketing and activity status reports, and ïseeking mandates from NZ Owners. Negotiation and implementation Tasks include: ïnegotiating with NZ Owners and other parties involved in securitisation transactions including credit enhancement providers ïwriting term sheets ïwriting a transaction report to NAML (as Asset Trust manager) for approval, after a mandate has been obtained from a NZ Owner ïdoing modelling work and due diligence on the assets, necessary to obtain credit ratings from the rating agencies ïmanaging the credit rating process ïstructuring and writing information memoranda on the transaction for the benefit of NAML, TSLís and QSLís investors ïstructuring and negotiation of the legal documentation of the transaction in conjunction with NAML and the trustees ïmanaging the structuring and negotiation with the client during the implementation process ïfollowing completion, liaising with the Secondee of the NZ Branch to ensure smooth post implementation phase ïpost implementation, managing the relationship with the client and trying to identify opportunities to increase the programme size or extend the programme to new asset types, product features, credit procedures, etc and liaising with the Secondee of the NZ Branch with respect to this 36 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) ïmarketing to the New Zealand originators of assets ïwriting a transaction report to NAML (as Asset Trust manager) for approval, after a mandate has been obtained from an issuer ïseeking mandates from NZ Owners ïseeking mandates from existing asset backed issuers wanting to expand their existing programmes offshore. 85. The technology used in structuring a securitisation programme varies according to the underlying assets (ie residential mortgages, motor vehicles, heavy equipment etc). Therefore some originators are specialised in some asset classes. Further, each geographic market is different in terms of investor requirements and credit rating requirements, for example. Thus, it is important that among the Contractors acting for the NZ Branch, some specialise in the NZ market. 86. Contractors will be marketing to both New Zealand investors and NZ Owners. Where the successful execution of transactions involves funding from New Zealand, the Contractors will be involved in assessing and ensuring investor demand for that funding. They will not be involved in selling that funding to New Zealand investors on a day-to-day basis. This is the role of the dealers under the funding programme of the NZ Branch. 87. However, as maintenance of the attractiveness of the Titan (and Quasar) structure is an important element in securing transactions on an ongoing basis, it is in the Contractorsí interests to ìmarketî the Titan (and Quasar) structure on a generalised basis to all investors, including New Zealand investors. The Titan and Quasar brand names are considered to have advantages in the market and that is why the structure is being marketed through the NZ Branch. BNZ/NAB see it as important that the use of Titan/Quasar is consistently applied throughout the structure and not just when seeking offshore investors to fund the securitisation transactions. 88. The Contractors will be contracted on an armís length basis recognizing both the NZ Branchís and BNZ/NABís benefit from implementing transactions through the NZ Branch. BNZ/NAB will continue to remunerate the contracted staff but will receive a share of the income received by the NZ Branch in respect of any transactions put through the Titan NZ trust structure by the Contractors as consideration for providing the Contractors. 89. Origination income usually takes the form of arrangement fees paid by originators of assets (ie the NZ Owners) in respect of transactions using the Titan (or Quasar) programme and structure. 90. Only estimates of the number of transactions have been given to the Rulings Unit due to the unpredictable nature of the securitisation market, and the length of time it can take to implement transactions. The size of the transactions and the resultant arrangement fee may also vary. 91. The Titan/Quasar programme will be marketed on an ongoing basis, but the number of expected hours will depend on the opportunities that arise and how much effort is needed to exploit any particular opportunity. However, on average, as a broad generalization, Contractors are expected to spend in aggregate approximately 200 to 300 hours per year marketing the services of the Titan NZ Funding Trust or the NZ Branch. Implementation of a transaction would occupy further contractor hours, estimates of which have been provided to the Rulings Unit. 92. The combination of marketing/origination through Contractors, administration, and funding functions through the Secondee should contribute to the NZ Branch being perceived as a standalone entity being able to provide integrated services to its customers. This will facilitate obtaining mandates for the Titan NZ trust structure to manage the Asset Trusts and provide funding for the assets of NZ Owners. ii) Staff 93. The role of the NZ Branch in the Titan NZ trust structure requires the NZ Branch to have the services of a full time Secondee to perform the day to day tasks of the NZ Branch, as well as the services of the Contractors. 94. The NZ Branch will have at least one full-time staff member seconded from BNZ on an armís length basis with an armís length fee being charged pursuant to the Secondment Agreement. The Secondee will be seconded on an exclusive basis to the NZ Branch and will be under the control of the trustee of the Titan NZ Funding Trust. BNZ will continue to do the payroll, and the salary will be re- paid to BNZ by the trustee. BNZ will also receive a fee which will cover the costs of providing the staff member, including the cost of payroll services. 95. The full-time Secondee will be a skilled person possessing the relevant skills to administer and manage the transactions going through the NZ Branch on a day to day basis, administer note issues from the NZ Branch into the New Zealand market where that is considered viable, and to provide servicing functions to the Asset Trusts and BNZ. As stated, the Secondee provides the day to day administration and management of the NZ Branch. The Secondee will also work in conjunction with the Contractors from BNZ or NAB to attract further work to the NZ Branch and to manage and administer the transactions implemented by those Contractors. 37 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) 96. The nature of the Secondeeís tasks will be such that no secretarial services will be required. 97. On a six-monthly basis the Secondee will provide a written report on the NZ Branchís progress to NAML and TSL. 98. The applicant has provided the Rulings Unit with a breakdown of time estimates for the Secondee to perform their function. It is noted that the accuracy of these estimates can be affected by factors such as the performance of the Secondee, the technology available and the market place at the time. 99. It is expected that the number of staff members will increase as the business of the NZ Branch grows. The NZ Branch has the ability to directly employ staff in the future. The applicants expect the NZ Branch operations to expand considerably by the end of 2005. iii) Premises 100. Subject to paragraph 101 below, the NZ Branch operations will be based at fixed, identifiable premises on Level 13, BNZ Tower, 125 Queen Street, Auckland, licensed from BNZ for an armís length price pursuant to the Licence and Services Agreement. A plaque bearing the name of the NZ Branch will be displayed in the foyer, and outside the lifts on level 13. These premises will be exclusively occupied by the Secondee of the NZ Branch and Contractors when working for the Branch. The area to be occupied is approximately 10 square metres in a room with direct access from the lobby. Access to meeting rooms, a kitchen, toilets and other common areas will also be provided. Also under the Licence and Services Agreement, the NZ Branch will license certain software as described in the Agreement, and certain equipment listed in schedule 1 to the Agreement. That will include a computer, a dedicated phone line and facsimile lines, a chair, desk and filing cabinet. The NZ Branch will also have an email address, its own stationery and letterhead. 101. While not anticipated, the premises of the NZ Branch could change if, for example, BNZ moved its office premises, or if the NZ Branch outgrows its office space and decides to move to alternative premises. The NZ Branch may also wish to license alternative equipment and software or purchase its own. In these circumstances, at a minimum, the NZ Branch will arrange for alternative premises, equipment and/or software as that detailed above. 102. The initial term of the licence is two years and it is renewable. However, either party can terminate it with 3 months notice. The licence of the office, software and equipment will be provided at an armís length rate. 103. It is considered that this office space will be sufficient initially. Provision is made in the Licence and Services Agreement for more space to be made available if necessary as the business of the NZ Branch expands. 104. The office will be primarily a work space for the Secondee to fulfil the NZ Branchís activities, and for the Contractors to work from whilst in New Zealand. The Secondee may use the meeting rooms to meet clients post implementation and/or to meet with third parties involved in the servicing and administration of transactions. As stated, the meeting rooms can also be used by the Contractors to meet with clients, BNZ relationship personnel and any other parties involved in marketing and implementing a securitisation transaction. The NZ Branch office space will also be used for storing documentation, market information and marketing material. Copies of documentation relating to the delegated tasks in respect of the Asset Trusts, the management of BNZís existing asset backed transactions and the issuance of commercial paper in New Zealand will also be maintained in the office. 105. Contractors and the Secondee will typically meet in the common meeting rooms available under the Licence and Services Agreement. iv) Profit projections 106. The NZ Branch is expected to make a profit each year through performing the functions outlined above. The profits and revenues are expected to grow over the next five years as the awareness of the Titan brand grows and the NZ Branch services more transactions. Projections for the next five years have been provided to the Rulings Unit. The projections are only estimates as the actual revenue will depend on a number of factors including the securitisation opportunities which arise. The profit estimations for the NZ Branch for the first year are as follows: (in $000)Year 1 Total revenue280 Total expenses214 Gross profit66 107. The set up costs of the Titan NZ trust structure and the NZ Branch are being borne by NAB/BNZ. This is because the Titan (and Quasar) structure is an important strategic business proposition for NAB/ BNZ. To enable its viability, NAB/BNZ is absorbing the set up costs as part of its sponsorship of the Titan and Quasar structures, in line with normal commercial practice in this area. 38 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) 108. Income from servicing BNZ asset backed transactions is not forecast to significantly grow as the primary focus of the Secondee and Contractors will be to originate and service the NZ Branchís own transactions. 109. As the Titan and Quasar brand names are more widely recognised in the New Zealand market, new transactions (therefore new Asset Trusts) will be structured. Thus the servicing of Asset Trusts will be a strategically essential transaction type of the NZ Branch. 110. Income from origination of new business is further explained at paragraphs 88 to 90 above. 111. Estimates of income to the NZ Branch have been provided to the Rulings Unit. Actual amounts and the funding mechanism will be dependent on the factors discussed at paragraph 36 above. 112. There are strong expectations that the ABCP issued by the NZ Branch will be purchased by NZ investors. 113. Where the Australian office of the Titan NZ Funding Trust issues notes to TSL or QSL, the Australian office will derive margin income on the notes issued to it by the Asset Trusts. This income is not paid to or attributed to the NZ Branch. NAML 114. NAML is an Australian resident company and wholly owned subsidiary of NAB. As stated above, NAML will act as trust manager of the Asset Trusts and the Titan NZ Funding Trust. This includes the task of servicing the Asset Trusts. However, because of its lack of presence in New Zealand, NAML will delegate certain servicing functions and some management functions in respect of the Asset Trusts to the NZ Branch pursuant to a Delegation Agreement. Further details in this respect are set out at paragraphs 65 to 74 above. 115. BNZ currently has no dealings with NAML except as Warehouse Facility Provider to the first Asset Trust established under the Titan NZ trust structure, of which NAML is trust manager. 116. NAMLís time involvement will depend on the number of Asset Trusts in operation, the frequency of the asset payment dates (eg monthly versus quarterly) and the complexity of the transactions undertaken. The greater the number of Asset Trusts, the greater the volume of work required to be undertaken. It also depends on the extent of the delegation from NAML to the NZ Branch. 117. NAMLís fee at both the Asset Trust level and at the Titan NZ Funding Trust level comprises a base fee and may also include a performance fee. The base fee will be a set predetermined amount. 118. The performance fee (if any) will vary depending on the nature of the transaction, the other costs and whether the NZ Owner is to retain the excess income from the transaction, but will be commercially determined and based on performance. 119. The trustee of the Titan NZ Funding Trust will pay NAMLís fee in respect of the Titan NZ Funding Trust and the trustee of the Asset Trust will pay NAMLís fee in respect of the Asset Trusts. 120. Under some future transactions a revolving structure may be used so that the NZ Owner can continue to sell receivables to the Asset Trust as they are originated (for example by selling goods on credit). As well, under these transactions the interest rate on the receivables assets may be fixed or floating and so may be different to the interest rate on the notes issued by the relevant Asset Trust. In these circumstances, the Asset Trust will enter into an interest rate swap with BNZ to hedge its interest rate risk exposure. 121.Whether future transactions will be mandated or not will depend on several factors including the ability to use the Titan NZ trust structure and the advantages it offers. If they are mandated, the arrangement fee (if any) will be paid to the entity that arranges the transaction which is expected to be the Contractors acting for the NZ Branch. If these transactions are successfully implemented, they are expected to be funded through the Titan NZ Funding Trust, and serviced by the NZ Branch. 122. While the absence of the NZ Branch and the Contractors contracted to it has not stopped transactions being competed for, it would enhance the chances of securing those transactions. One of the motivations for BNZ in establishing the Titan NZ trust structure as set out in this Arrangement is to provide securitisation solutions it can offer to NZ Owners in a competitive market. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: (a) The office premises licensed to the NZ Branch of the Titan NZ Funding Trust by BNZ pursuant to the Licence and Services Agreement will be exclusively occupied by the staff and Contractors working for the NZ Branch. (b) Unless the circumstances in paragraph 101 of the Arrangement apply, the Titan NZ Funding Trust will renew the licence pursuant to the Licence and Services Agreement for at least the period of this Ruling, and BNZ or the Titan NZ Funding Trust will not terminate the licence during the period of this Ruling. 39 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) (c) If there is any change in the location of the NZ Branchís premises as contemplated by paragraph 101 of the Arrangement, as a minimum the attributes of those premises will be materially the same as those set out in paragraph 100 of the Arrangement for at least the period of the ruling. Further, any change in location of the premises will be for genuine commercial reasons, and the premises will be within office accommodation. If any equipment and/or software is replaced or substituted as contemplated by paragraph 101 of the Arrangement, this will be with equipment and/or software not less substantial or functional than that previously used. (d) The Titan NZ Funding Trust intends to make a profit from the activities of its NZ Branch. (e) The profit estimations set out at and referred to in paragraph 106 of the Arrangement, and the breakdown of those estimations as provided to the Rulings Unit, provides what are in good faith believed to be realistic estimates of the revenue and expenditure of the NZ Branch of the Titan NZ Funding Trust, and incorporates what is believed to be all foreseeable expenditure that is likely to be incurred in operating the NZ Branch. (f)In respect of lending funds to the Titan NZ Funding Trust, each of TSL and QSL: (i)are non-residents for New Zealand tax purposes, and (ii)do not carry on any business, either wholly or partly, in New Zealand. (g) Where funds are lent to the Titan NZ Funding Trust by TSL and QSL the loan contracts will not be made or wholly or partly performed in New Zealand. (h) No funds raised by the Australian office of the Titan NZ Funding Trust from TSL or QSL will be applied towards the activities of the NZ Branch of the Titan NZ Funding Trust. (i)BNZ reasonably believes that it is important that the Asset Trusts are serviced in New Zealand for the reasons set out at paragraphs 67, 68 and 72 of the Arrangement. (j)The NZ Branch will undertake a bona fide marketing function as described in the Arrangement. This marketing function is commercially desirable in respect of both new and existing BNZ customers due to the competitiveness in the securitisation market and BNZ reasonably believes that a marketing function is essential if the NZ Branch is going to be successful in securing transactions to be securitised through the Titan NZ trust structure. (k) BNZ reasonably believes that the Contractors must be associated with the local presence, and therefore must act on behalf of the NZ Branch. Further, BNZ believes that it is important that the Contractors ensure that the local servicing presence is made known as an important element of the Titan NZ trust structure in securing transactions. (l)It is expected that the servicing function provided by the NZ Branch will eventually involve predominantly Titan NZ transactions following the implementation of further Titan NZ transactions, with servicing of existing BNZ transactions providing only supplementary business to the NZ Branch. (m) All of the functions to be carried on by the NZ Branch will be discrete functions, which will, except to the extent envisaged by the Arrangement, be carried out without the assistance or intervention of BNZ, NAB or NAML. For the avoidance of doubt, this Condition will not be breached by BNZ or other Parties to the Arrangement undertaking legal and tax compliance checks of the NZ Branch to ensure it is complying with its legal obligations and the Ruling. (n) Any fees paid pursuant to any Agreement referred to in the Arrangement will be an armís length quantum on a stand-alone basis. (o) There will be no connection, association, relationship, arrangement or understanding in any way connected with the Titan NZ trust structure between any of the Parties to the Arrangement or any of their associates other than as described in the Arrangement, except for facilitative and ordinary activities, arrangements or understandings as may be required for the day to day operation of the business activities contemplated by the Titan NZ trust structure (for example, credit enhancement arrangements). (p) The final form of all documents referred to in the Arrangement will not differ materially to the draft Agreements provided to the Rulings Unit in respect of this Ruling. For the avoidance of doubt, changes to the documents envisaged by the Arrangement or as set out in paragraphs 8 to 21 of the letter of 9 August 2002 to the Rulings Unit accompanying the draft documents are not considered material changes. (q) Any arrangement entered into under this Ruling will not be materially different from the Arrangement as described in the binding private ruling in relation to the first Asset Trust established under the Titan NZ trust structure (BR Prv 03/48). 40 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: ïThe interest paid by Perpetual New Zealand, in its capacity as trustee of each Asset Trust, to Perpetual Australia, in its capacity as the trustee of the Titan NZ Funding Trust, will not comprise ìnon-resident withholding incomeî in terms of sections OB 1 and NG 1(2) of the Act and accordingly that interest will not be subject to non-resident withholding tax or approved issuer levy. ïInterest paid by the Australian office of the Titan NZ Funding Trust to TSL or QSL, in respect of amounts borrowed to fund notes issued by each Asset Trust, will not comprise ìnon-resident withholding incomeî in terms of sections OB 1 and NG 1(2) of the Act and accordingly that interest will not be subject to non-resident withholding tax or approved issuer levy. ïSection BG 1 will not apply to negate or vary any of the conclusions reached above. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from the date it is signed to 30 May 2008. This Ruling is signed by me on the 26 th day of September 2003. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) PRODUCT RULING - BR PRD 03/17 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Vodafone New Zealand Limited (ìVodafoneî). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CH 2, CH 3, CD 5, EB 1, EH 21, EH 22, EH 23, EH 24, BG 1 and GB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and operation of the Vodafone Pacific Limited (ìVPLî) Employee Deferred Share Plan (ìEDSPî) for the benefit of employees in New Zealand and Australia. The Trustee of the EDSP will be a New Zealand resident subsidiary of Vodafone, Vodafone Pacific Limited (New Zealand) Share Plans Limited (ìthe Trusteeî). The Trust Deed, the Plan Rules and the Participation Contract (ìPCî) provided to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue on 2 March 2001 together form the basis of the Arrangement subject to this Ruling. These documents supersede all previous documents provided to the Commissioner in relation to this Ruling. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The remuneration package of Vodafone employees is set each year. The Participants will be offered the choice of taking part of the total value of the remuneration package in cash, salary, or benefits in kind, which may include rights to shares under the EDSP. The EDSP may replace some of the current incentives or performance-based reward programs of Vodafone. 2.The EDSP will be a key part of Vodafoneís remuneration performance pay regime for its Participants. The purpose is to attract, retain and motivate such employees and to act as a deterrent to theft or misbehaviour and to give Participants a clear identity as shareholders in companies in the Vodafone Group. However, the options provide Participants with a chance to share in growth in share value during the holding period. 41 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) 3.The EDSP will offer Vodafone employees rights to acquire shares in VPL or Vodafone Group Plc (ìVGPî) (ìsharesî). Employees who accept the offer are ìParticipantsî under the EDSP. Participation in the EDSP will be offered to all employees. 4.To meet the entitlements of the Participants, shares will be purchased by the Trustee on the New Zealand or Australian or London Stock Exchanges and held by the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Trust. Where VPL shares are unavailable or are inappropriate given the remuneration purposes of the plan, VGP shares will be purchased on the London Stock Exchange. Shares will be acquired by the Trustee on market at their prevailing market value. 5.While the Participants will hold rights to shares under the PC, those rights will not be in respect of specific shares and no specific shares will be allocated notionally or beneficially to the Participants. The rights will be operative for up to a maximum period of 10 years or earlier on termination of employment. 6.The rights to receive Allocation Rights from the Trust will be for nil consideration. A Participant may, on the satisfaction of any Relevant Requirements, exercise his or her right to purchase shares from the Trustee for a consideration not exceeding $1. 7.Vodafone will make cash contributions to the Trustee to fund the purchase of shares. Such cash contributions will be used by the Trustee for the following purposes: ïTo purchase shares offered to Participants in recognition of those Participantsí reductions in monetary remuneration including bonus and incentive payments (ìSalary Sacrificeî). For the purpose of this Ruling such offers shall be known as ìSalary Sacrifice Offersî. ïTo purchase shares offered to Participants in recognition of Participantsí additional services or performance (ìIncentive Offersî). ïTo purchase shares offered to Participants as supplementary or special offers equal to the amount of any Salary Sacrifice Offers or Incentive Offers accepted by the Participants (ìMatching Offersî). The Matching Offers procedure is the usual method of providing discounts and additional benefits in addition to other existing remuneration arrangements for the Participants. ïTo pay for services used by the Trust such as accounting, auditing, consulting, and trust management (ìServicesî). 8.Offers made under the EDSP in relation to any Participant, as a percentage of each Participant employeeís total wages, salary or other remuneration, will not exceed: ïin respect of Salary Sacrifice Offers, up to 25%. ïin respect of Incentive Offers, up to 30% for Participants who are managers and executive directors, and up to 15% for all other employees. ïin respect of Matching Offers, up to 5%. 9.Vodafoneís contributions to the Trusteeís Salary Sacrifice Offers for each Participant will be equal to the employeeís Salary Sacrifice. Vodafone will make contributions to fund the purchase of shares for Incentive Offers and Matching Offers out of its own funds and not with reference to Participantsí Salary Sacrifice. 10. The minimum vesting or non-exercise period for the Salary Sacrifice Offers and Matching Offers is 24 months after the date of purchase, and this period may be reduced to 12 months in the future. There is no minimum vesting period for Incentive Offers. 11. The Participantís interest in the shares in the Trust cannot be transferred and will be subject to cancellation by the Trustee (eg, in the case of theft, defalcation or misbehaviour, etc). 12. On exercise of the right to receive shares in accordance with Rule 9, shares may be transferred in specie to Participants, or cash distributions made by the Trustee to Participants funded from a sale of shares, or from additional contributions from Vodafone. Exercise may take place at the discretion of the Participant subject to the Relevant Requirements and shall take place on termination of employment or 10 years after the date of purchase of the shares by the Trustee (Refer Rule 9.1). 13. Further details of the Arrangement as contained in the Trust Deed, the Plan Rules and the PC (ìthe documentsî) are detailed below. Trust Deed 14. The Trust Deed provides that VPL wishes to establish a trust for the employees of Vodafone and associated companies. 15. The Trust Deed provides that the Trustee will apply trust funds in accordance with the Plan Rules. 16. The Trust Deed incorporates the Plan Rules as part of the Trust Deed. 42 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) Plan rules 17. VPL may from time to time direct the Trustee to offer one or more employees the right to enter into a PC in the form set out in the Schedule to the Plan Rules (Rule 7). Offers will be made to all employees as outlined earlier. 18. The Participant may accept an offer to enter a PC by indicating the Participantís desired reduction in monetary remuneration, signing the PC and returning it to the Trustee before the close of the offer period (Rule 7.3). 19. By entering into a PC the Participant authorises a reduction in that Participantís monetary remuneration including a reduction in any bonus or other incentive payments (ie, Salary Sacrifice). Such reductions are to be apportioned over the term specified in the relevant PC (Rule 8). 20. Vodafone and the Participants will execute an addendum to the employment contract making provision for the Salary Sacrifice, and amending the contract of employment, in the following terms: I, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ have accepted an offer by the Trustee of the Vodafone Pacific Limited Employee Deferred Share Plan, to participate in the Plan and to acquire the right to purchase shares from the Trustee, on the terms and conditions referred to in the Trust Deed and the Participation Contract. I authorise and accept a reduction in my pre-taxation monetary remuneration of an amount equal to the Employee Election (as defined in the Participation Contract), and I authorise and accept a reduction in any future and contingent bonuses or other future and contingent incentive payments of not more than the amount of the Employee Election. 21. If an employee chooses not to accept the offer to participate in the EDSP and consequently there is no Salary Sacrifice, the employee will receive as part of his or her salary, bonus and incentive payments, the amounts that would otherwise be deducted from his or her salary, bonus or incentive payments as Salary Sacrifice. If a Participant chooses not to accept an Incentive Offer, he or she will receive additional remuneration for the additional services or performance which qualified him or her for receiving the Incentive Offer. 22. Allocation Rights (a right granted by the Trustee to a Participant to purchase shares under the EDSP) will be granted in respect of shares, the purchase price of which has been fully satisfied by the reduction in monetary remuneration accepted and authorised by a Participant. 23. A Participant may, subject to the satisfaction of any Relevant Requirements, exercise the employeeís right under a PC to purchase all or part of the shares the subject of the PC from the Trustee for a consideration not exceeding $1, or to receive proceeds from the sale of those shares by the Trustee (Rule 9.1(a)). 24. On termination of employment or on the expiry of 10 years from the date the Trustee purchased the shares, the Participant is deemed to have exercised the Participantís right under the PC and is to receive the shares or receive proceeds from the sale by the Trustee of shares the subject of the PC (Rule 9.1(b) and (c)). 25. Where a Participantís employment is terminated and the Participant has not satisfied the Relevant Requirements, the Trustee (at the direction of VPL) may allow a Participant to elect to exercise the right under the PC to purchase shares for consideration not exceeding $1 or at the Participantís election, receive the proceeds from the sale by the Trustee of shares under the PC (Rule 9.2). 26. In respect of a Participant to whom Rule 9.1(b) applies, if the Contract Shares that have been transferred to or sold on behalf of the Participant have not been fully satisfied by the agreed reduction in monetary remuneration, the Employer company shall be entitled to: ïdeduct the outstanding amount from the termination benefits payable to the Participant (if any), and/or ïdirect the Trustee to sell sufficient of the Participantís Contract Shares to fund the outstanding amount and retain the proceeds for its own use (Rule 9.3). 27. VPL may direct the Trustee to apply plan shares by: ïtransferring the shares to any other incentive plan or scheme for the benefit of the employees, or ïtransferring the shares to a superannuation or similar fund for the benefit of employees (Rule 11). 28. Dividends received by the Trustee will be either accumulated or allocated to Participants, at the discretion of the Trustee (Rule 12.2). The circumstances would depend on the factors covered in Rule 12.2 of the Plan Rules. That is, the Trustee would consider in consultation with VPL, how much of the income of the fund would be applied to meet Plan expenses or for any other purpose relevant to the Plan, for example, to purchase additional shares. After these decisions the Trustee could decide at its own discretion to distribute some or all of the remaining income to Participants. The 43 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) decision to apply income to Participants would be at the absolute discretion of the Trustee and no criteria would be followed, although if the Trustee decided to apply income to Participants this would be applied predominantly in proportion to the shares subject to PCs held by the Participant. 29. All voting rights in respect of Plan Shares are vested in the Trustee regardless of any Relevant Requirements, and the Trustee will abstain from exercising those rights (Rule 13). 30. Upon termination or winding up of the Trust, each Participant will be deemed to have exercised his or her rights under the PC to purchase shares from the Trustee for a consideration not exceeding $1, or the Participant can elect to receive the proceeds from the sale by the Trustee of shares the subject of the PC in respect of which the Relevant Requirements have been satisfied or at VPLís direction in respect of which the Relevant Requirements have not been satisfied. Participation Contract (PC) 31. The PC is between the Trustee and the Participant under which the Participant can exercise Allocation Rights and acquire VPL or VGP shares. 32. Under the PC the Trustee grants and the employee accepts a right as a Participant under the Trust Deed to purchase shares from the Trustee (an ìAllocation Rightî). The employee agrees to a reduction in the Participantís pre taxation monetary remuneration, bonuses, or other incentive payments as detailed in the PC (Clause 2). 33. The Participant may exercise his or her right to purchase shares from the Trustee by giving the Trustee an ìExercise Noticeî subject to satisfying the ìRelevant Requirementsî (Clause 3). 34. The Exercise Notice must specify the number of shares the Participant wishes to purchase and whether the Participant wishes to: ïpurchase the relevant shares from the Trustee, or ïrequest the shares be sold by the Trustee on their behalf (Clause 3.1). 35. The Participant is deemed to have given an Exercise Notice in the following circumstances (Clause 3.2): ïtermination of employment (Plan Rule 9.1(b)) ï10 years have passed from the date of purchase of the shares by the Trustee (Plan Rule 9.1(c)) ïtermination of the Trust (Plan Rule 17.2). 36. On the receipt of a valid Exercise Notice, and receipt of consideration of $1, the Trustee shall either transfer the shares to the Participant or sell them on their behalf (Clause 3.7). 37. The number of shares to which an employee is entitled will be adjusted for any bonus or rights issues (Clauses 4.1 and 4.2). 38. This Ruling does not consider or rule on any aspect of the tax consequences (if any) that may arise from any payment, application or appropriation of all or part of the income arising from the Trust Fund to the Participants. This Ruling does not consider or rule on any tax consequences in respect of any Participants who are not ìresident in New Zealandî (as defined in section OB 1). This Ruling does not consider or rule on any aspect of the tax treatment of the Matching Offers. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)The executed documents being the Trust Deed, the Plan Rules and the Participation Contract will not differ in any material way to the draft documents provided to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue on 2 March 2001. b)The EDSP is, and will be for the period of this Ruling, a ìqualifying trustî as defined in section OB 1. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: ïThere is no gross income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred by the Participants pursuant to the accrual rules by virtue of sections EH 21 to EH 24 in relation to their participation in the EDSP. ïThe benefit received by the Participants under the EDSP is monetary remuneration by virtue of section CH 2. The benefit is included in the gross income of the Participants under section CH 3. ïUnder section CH 2(6), the Participants derive the gross income in respect of the shares obtained under the EDSP, when the Participants exercise their right to acquire the shares from the Trustee. ïThe taxable value of the benefit received by the Participants under section CH 2 is the difference between the amount paid for the shares, being $1 44 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) (one dollar), and the market value of the shares on the day the right is exercised by the employee. If the shares acquired by the Participants are listed on either the London or the Australian Stock Exchange, the value of the shares is the market value of the shares on the day the right is exercised converted into New Zealand dollars using the relevant foreign exchange rate on that day. ïThe amount of the Salary Sacrifice agreed to by the Participants to satisfy the requirements of the EDSP does not constitute gross income of the Participants under sections CD 5, CH 3, or EB 1. ïThe amount of any contribution made by Vodafone to the Trustee does not constitute gross income derived by the Participants under sections CD 5, CH 3, or EB 1. ïSections BG 1 and GB 1 will not apply to negate or vary the conclusions above. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2006. This Ruling is signed by me on the 15 th day of October 2003. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) PRODUCT RULING - BR PRD 03/20 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Platinum Asset Management Limited (ìPAMLî). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated.

DISCRETIONARY REMEDY NOT AWARDED BY HIGH COURT Case:M & J Wetherill Company Ltd & Ors v TRA & CIR Decision date:4 November 2003 Act:Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 Keywords:Judicial review, discretion Summary The High Court held that the plaintiffs were entitled to appeal the TRAís decision in Case U35, but refused to exercise its discretion to order the TRA to sign the case on appeal. There was real doubt as to whether there is a right of appeal in respect of interlocutory decisions of the TRA. Facts This case has a very long history. In 1996 the Commissioner received a number of requests for cases stated on the objectorsí objections (relating to the J G Russell tax avoidance template). The objectors requested that the cases stated be filed in the Taxation Review Authority (ìthe TRAî), but the Commissioner filed them in the High Court. The High Court (Baragwanath J) determined that it would more appropriate for the cases stated to be heard in the TRA and told the Commissioner to file them there. In Case U35 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,330 the TRA (Judge Barber) accepted the Commissionerís application to file the cases stated out of time and rejected the objectorsí application that their objections be allowed. In Case U41 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,380 the TRA refused to allow an appeal of Case U35 and struck the purported appeal out. In M & J Wetherill & Co Ltd v TRA & CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,166 the objectors judicially reviewed the TRAís decisions in Case U35 and Case U41. The High Court (OíRegan J) largely found for the objectors and sent the case back to the TRA for re-determination. His Honour held, in relation to Case U41, that interlocutory decisions of the TRA could be appealed. However, despite their success in the High Court, the objectors appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Commissioner cross-appealed. The Court of Appeal rejected the objectorsí appeal and allowed the Commissionerís cross-appeal: M & J Wetherill & Co Ltd v TRA (2002) 20 NZTC 17,624. The Court of Appeal also refused an application by the objectors for leave to appeal to the Privy Council: M & J Wetherill & Co Ltd v TRA (2002) 20 NZTC 17,681. The Privy Council refused an application for special leave to appeal. In Case W7 (2003) 21 NZTC 11,049 the objectors attempted to appeal, as opposed to review, the TRAís decision in Case U35. The objectors argued that as OíRegan J had held that there was a right of appeal in relation to Case U35 and that since the Commissioner had not cross-appealed that finding, the TRA was bound to follow the ruling of the High Court. They submitted that OíRegan Jís decision was res judicata and the TRA was therefore obliged to state a case on appeal in respect of Case U35. The TRA refused to state a case on appeal and the objectors reviewed Judge Barberís decision. The review was again heard by OíRegan J. The objectors sought an order requiring the TRA to state a case on appeal. The Commissioner argued that the points that would be raised on appeal had already been dealt with by the High Court and the Court of Appeal. The Commissioner also argued that the Court of Appeal had indicated that there was no right of appeal of interlocutory decisions of the TRA. Decision OíRegan J set out the history of the litigation in detail. In particular, OíRegan J noted the comments made by the Court of Appeal that there could probably not be appeals of interlocutory decisions of the TRA. The 49 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) Court of Appeal had commented: In the light of the conclusions and reasoning in relation to OíRegan Jís judgment on review of Case U35, there could be no basis for a separate appeal to the High Court in respect of those matters. However, we are not to be taken as accepting that there is jurisdiction to appeal from a decision of that kind except as relating to ìthe determination on the objectionî (Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994, section 26) which, arguably, is confined to the ultimate substantive determination of an objection. OíRegan J also noted the Court of Appealís comments in the leave application where Richardson P stated: Mr Judd submitted that a rejection of an administrative law challenge to a decision under reg 6(4) and reg 8 could not determine a general appeal on the merits under section 26. The tests, he said, are different. They are. But in some circumstances the two inquiries in the factual area may so overlap that the same decision would have to be given whichever route is chosen. In their petition for special leave to appeal to the Privy Council the objectors foreshadowed an application for review of the TRA if it did not allow an appeal of Case U35. The central issue for OíRegan J was the law of res judicata. A matter is ìres judicataî if it has already been decided by the courts. It therefore cannot (generally) be revisited. OíRegan J stated (at paragraph \[27\]): It could therefore be argued that, having previously sought such relief and the Court having determined not to grant it, the plaintiffs are estopped from pursuing the same cause of action, and seeking the same relief. OíRegan J held that this was not a case of attempted relitigation of a failed argument. The plaintiffs were entitled to pursue their claim even though the relief sought was the same as that sought in the first judicial review proceeding. OíRegan J held that, strictly speaking, the Commissioner could be estopped from arguing that there was no right of appeal from Case U35 as the Commissioner had not cross-appealed that part of OíRegan Jís first judgment. However, the judge also noted the Court of Appealís comments disagreeing with his conclusions and that the Court of Appeal had expressed clear views that the review appeal had effectively disposed of any points that could be raised on appeal. OíRegan J held that on a strict interpretation issue estoppel would not apply to an appeal against Case U35 and that there were still some issues that could yet be determined. His Honour also held that though any appeal would involve a direct attack on the observations of the Court of Appeal, the present proceedings could not be said to be an abuse of process. OíRegan J concluded that based on his finding in the first judicial review case, the objectors were entitled to appeal against the TRAís finding in Case U35. However, OíRegan J did not consider that it was appropriate for him to exercise his discretion to order the TRA to sign the case on appeal. His Honour considered that the observations of the Court of Appeal in the earlier appeal and leave applications as to the correctness of his earlier findings (and the correctness of Case U35) meant that his discretion should not be exercised. OíRegan J also noted that many of the issues had already been dealt with and that the objectors would be able to appeal the substantive decisions of the TRA. The objectors have indicated that they intend to appeal this decision. 50 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) TAX AGENTíS JUDICIAL REVIEW OF DISTRICT COURT FAILS Case:Russell v District Court & CIR Decision date:12 November 2003 Act:Tax Administration Act, Judicature Amendment Act Keywords:Judicial review, interlocutory decisions, prosecutions. Summary The tax agentís judicial review of various interlocutory decisions by the district court was unsuccessful. Facts This was a judicial review application by Mr J G Russell of various interlocutory decisions by the District Court in prosecutions against Mr Russell for failure to comply with section 17 TAA 1994 requests. An interlocutory decision is one made prior to the substantive hearing is largely to deal with managing the hearing (eg evidence, witness statements) The CIR laid 226 informations against Mr Russell (but later withdrew some 91) in respect of his failure to comply with section 17 requests. Mr Russellís defence is that the Commissioner has abused his powers and this is part of the vendetta against him by the CIR. In managing the case(s) the District Court made several orders with which the CIR complied but not to the satisfaction of Mr Russell. In an interlocutory hearing the District Court judge was satisfied the Commissioner had complied with the orders. Mr Russell first sought to appeal this decision but had no right of appeal to interlocutory matters in summary proceedings (section 107 Summary Proceedings Act), he then sought recall of the judgment which was declined and then sought that a case be stated to the High Court for its opinion but this was not available as the case stated can only be on law alone (section 78 Summary proceedings Act) and the issues raised by Mr Russell were mixed fact and law. Mr Russell then commenced judicial review proceedings. The Commissionerís application to strike this out was unsuccessful and this was the substantive hearing. Decision The High Court declined to grant any judicial review remedies in this case. Justice OíRegan reviewed interlocutory decisions of the District Court judge and accepted these were decision properly open to the District Court Judge: ìIn my view, her decisions in that regard are not amenable to judicial review, and even if they were, I can see no basis on which intervention by this Court would be justified.î \[Para 43\]. It was considered that Mr Russellís request for unedited documents which the District Court declined to accede to could not succeed as the trial judge had reviewed the documents and ruled on their relevance-which is part of the function of the judge. \[Para 28\] It was also noted that the method of claiming legal privilege for in-house lawyers outlined in Miller (1997) 18 NZTC 13,00óthat in house counsel file affidavits with the basis of the privilege claim) was not required where the documents spoke for themselves \[Para 32ó also Downey v Wright & Dickson (HC Auckland M275/95, 29 June 1995)\]. Mr Russell has repeatedly argued failure to do so means the privilege had not been effectively claimed. It was also accepted that if there was sufficient nexus between an interlocutory decision and the final outcome, then that interlocutory decision could be subject to appeal as part of appealing the final decision \[Para 45\]. This trended to suggest granting judicial review remedies was inappropriate. 51 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) JOINT VENTURE SCHEME FOUND TO BE TAX AVOIDANCE Case:Erris Promotions Limited & Ors v CIR Decision date:14 November 2003 Act:Income Tax Act 1994; Tax Administration Act 1994 Keywords:Depreciable intangible property, sham, tax avoidance, abusive tax position Summary Investors in the Actonz Joint Venture (ìAJVî) claimed losses passed onto them from the depreciation of software purportedly purchased by the AJV. The Commissioner disallowed these claims for several reasons including tax avoidance and sham. He also imposed 100% shortfall penalties on the investors for taking an abusive tax position. The High Court found for the Commissioner. Facts Background 1.This case concerned the validity of losses claimed by investors of the Actonz Investment Joint venture (ìthe AJVî). Those losses were disallowed by the Commissioner (ìthe CIRî) who considered they were not deductible for a number of reasons. 2.The challenge related to the tax treatment of six pieces of computer software which the AJV purportedly purchased in October 1996 for a total of $685 million. The CIR considered all the software was purchased at grossly inflated prices in order to secure a large GST refund and depreciation deductions. 3.The manager of the AJV, Actonz Management Limited (ìAMLî) initially claimed a large GST input credit of approximately $60 million based on the purchase price of five of the six pieces of software on December 1996 (another piece of the software was conceded later by AML). The CIR disallowed this claim and the dispute continued through to the Adjudication Unit (ìAdjudicationî). A challenge was commenced by AML in December 2000 after Adjudication found for the CIR in October 2000. However, it was agreed between the parties that the GST dispute would be set aside until the depreciation dispute was decided. Income tax dispute 4.The AJV depreciated all six software packages from the 1997 income tax year (despite conceding two of the packages in the GST dispute) and the resulting losses were allocated to investors who had purchased units in the AJV. The investors initially claimed these losses in their income tax returns. Further AJV losses were allocated to investors in the 1998 and 1999 income tax years which were claimed either in tax returns or by way of NOPA. The total amount of income tax in dispute, assuming a marginal tax rate of 33% for each investor, is approximately $226 million. 5.The CIR disallowed the losses as he considered the deductions were derived from a tax avoidance scheme and that a number of the sale and purchase agreements were shams. He also considered the software could not be depreciated as there was no entitlement to do so under the tax depreciation rules. 6.The internal disputes resolution procedure continued through to Adjudication. In March 2002 Adjudication found for the CIR on the grounds that the statutory criteria for claiming depreciation under EG1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (ìthe ITAî) were not met; the documents under which the software was purchased by the AJV were shams and that the deprecation claims of the investors were the result of a tax avoidance arrangement. 7.Erris Promotions Ltd and five other investors (ìthe Erris casesî) filed challenges in the Taxation Review Authority (ìthe TRAî) in May 2002. They were transferred to the High Court upon application by the CIR. The Erris cases were agreed upon by the parties to be representative of all investors in the joint venture. An order was also made by the Court that the Erris cases would be representative under Rule 78 of the High Court rules. Approximately 200 AJV investors will have their case decided by this proceeding. Decision 8.Ronald Young J, finding for the CIR, held that the price paid for the source code was not depreciable and that the scheme amounted to tax avoidance. The taxpayers were liable for a 100% abusive tax interpretation penalty. 9.Ronald Young J held that most of the purchase price of the software purchase agreements could not be depreciated. In each software purchase agreement the source code had virtually all of the purchase price allocated to it and intellectual property, including the copyright(s) had $1 allocated and the other property, essentially the physical representations of the software, also $1. Ronald Young J held that the copyright portion of the purchase price ($1) could be depreciated because it was depreciable intangible property for the purposes of the ITA 1994. The status of the source code had to be judged using the ordinary meanings 52 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) of tangible and intangible property, because there were no statutory definitions of the terms in the New Zealand tax legislation. Tangible was defined as being able to be touched. Intangible with not being able to be touched. In so defining the terms Ronald Young J rejected the approach adopted in the US authority of South Central Bell Telephone Coy v Barthelemy, 643 So 2nd 1240 (1994), preferring instead the approach of the English Court of Appeal in St Albans City and District Council v International Computers Ltd \[1996\] 4 All ER 481. The source code was a set of instructions separate from any physical manifestation; source code as described could not be touched and did not therefore come within the Oxford Dictionary definition of tangible; a set of instructions was no more than ideas expressed in logical form. The source code was intellectual property and intangible. Since the source code did not come within the definition of depreciable intangible property in the ITA 1994 it could not be depreciated. 10. Ronald Young J held that the depreciable loss able to be claimed could only be claimed for the months of the year (whole or part months) the asset was actually owned: section EG 2 ITA 1994. 11. It was held that the agreements for the purchase of the E-Direct, Linx and Packet Plus software were shams. In the case of the E-Direct software, at the purported time of purchase no such software existed and therefore none could be bought or sold. Nothing was transferred other than an idea which was in itself not depreciable. The purported vendors of the Linx and Packet Plus software did not own the software at the time of sale and therefore could not sell it to Actonz. The agreements for the sale and purchase of the software were therefore shams. 12. Ronald Young J held that the scheme was a tax avoidance arrangement. In seeking to apply CIR v BNZ Investments Ltd \[2002\] 1 NZLR 450 (CA) the taxpayers had confused proof of the arrangement and the necessity of a meeting of minds by the two or more persons who constitute an ìarrangementî with tax adjustment for taxpayers who invest in a ìvoidî scheme. Section GB 1 ITA 1994 provided that the tax of any person affected by a void arrangement could be adjusted. This was a logical recognition of the proposition that even if a taxpayer did not know the scheme they were investing in was a tax avoidance scheme (and void) they should not be able to alter their tax liability to their advantage: CIR v Peterson \[2003\] 2 NZLR 77. At best, the investors shut their eyes to what they must have known was a scheme that was too good to be true. In deciding whether the arrangement entered into was tax avoidance it was appropriate to consider the commerciality of the purchase of the software packages. Ronald Young J held it was clear that the dominant purpose of the joint venture was tax avoidance, importantly: (1)the software purchases involved no financial, technical or legal due diligence (2)the purchase prices were grossly inflated (3)much of the software either did not exist or did not work as claimed (4)the investment was significantly sold as a way of avoiding income tax (5)there was little or nor commercial aspect to the scheme (6)the terms of the purchase of the software contained no risk to the purchasers and involved 100% vendor finance (7)the information memoranda on which the scheme was sold provided for an investment with a several hundred percent return solely from tax advantages, without any sales of software licenses. While the technology boom was important background to the negotiations and purchase of the software it did not change the fact that the transactions had no commercial base and were essentially a means of creating a tax advantage. 13. The taxpayers were liable for a 100% abusive tax interpretation penalty. Ronald Young J held that the CIR had to establish an unacceptable interpretation of tax law and (viewed objectively) the tax position the taxpayers took was a consequence of an arrangement that was predominantly for the purpose of avoiding tax. Ronald Young J rejected the taxpayersí reliance on the third party tax opinions and valuations, because that in itself did not constitute reasonable care. The fact that a taxpayer had requested, received and followed the advice of an agent on the interpretation of a tax law, or its application, meant that the taxpayer had taken an ìinterpretationî as required under section 141B TAA 1994 in line with that taken by the agent in terms of the general principles of agency law: Case U47 \[2000\] 19 NZTC 9410. Ronald Young J concluded that no one aware of all the facts surrounding the various software purchases could consider the prices paid for the software anything other than hugely and falsely inflated. The surrounding circumstances pointed clearly to tax avoidance. The interpretations adopted by the taxpayers were not about as likely as not to be correct. An unacceptable interpretation on behalf of all taxpayers was therefore taken. 14. As both LAQCís and individual taxpayers took ìtax positionsî, both were liable for penalty. 53 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) CHURCH SUPERANNUATION SCHEME NOT CHARITABLE Case:Jarod Peter Hester & Ors v CIR Decision date:25 November 2003 Act:Income Tax Act 1994 Keywords:Superannuation scheme, charity Summary The superannuation scheme for employees of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was held not to be charitable. The activities of the employees could not be said to be essential to the operation of the Church and there was not the same level of lifelong commitment as in the Presbyterian Church case. Facts Introduction The plaintiffs were the trustees of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (ìthe Churchî) Deseret Benefit Plan (ìthe Planî). The Plan is a defined benefit and contributory superannuation scheme providing retirement income to employees of the Church. The plaintiffs claimed that the Plan was exempt from income tax pursuant to section CB 4(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (which exempts income derived by trustees for charitable purposes). The plaintiffs also relied on section CB 4(1)(e) and further claimed that the Commissioner had acted in a discriminatory manner by refusing to grant the Plan charitable status. The Plan The Plan is for employees of the Church. The Church does not have paid ministers, but has a system of ìcallingsî whereby Church members perform ecclesiastical functions. The Church itself has charitable status. The salaries received by the members of the Plan related to their temporal job, not their calling. There were two Church related entities that employ members (and potential members) of the Plan: the Church Trust Board and the Church College. Members employed by the Church Trust Board work at either the Churchís Administration Centre in Takapuna or the Church Temple in Hamilton. The Church College is also in Hamilton. The Administration Centre During the relevant period the Administration Centre was responsible for the overall administration of the Churchís operations in New Zealand, including property management, maintaining financial records, and other support for Church programmes. Members of the Plan at the Administration Centre included managers, human resources staff, IT staff, secretarial and clerical staff, and accounting staff. Church College Church College is a private secondary school which is run and financed by the Church. It teaches the national curriculum as well as providing religious education to students. All staff members (apart from one) belong to the Church. Members of the Plan at the College include teachers, secretarial and administrative staff, and catering and security staff. Church Temple The Temple is the most sacred place the Church has in New Zealand. Members of the Plan at the Temple include managers, gardeners, security guards, clerical workers, and clothing and cafeteria workers. The Arguments The plaintiffsí argument was based on two cases where superannuation funds connected to religious organisations were found to be charitable: Presbyterian Church of New Zealand Beneficiary Fund v CIR \[1994\] 3 NZLR 363 (ìPresbyterian Churchî) and Baptist Union of Ireland (Northern) Corporation Ltd v Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1945) 26 TC 335 (ìBaptist Unionî). The Commissioner considered that the Planís situation could be distinguished from those cases. Decision OíRegan J set out background facts about the Plan and its membership. His Honour then summarised the Presbyterian Church and Baptist Union cases. In the Presbyterian Church case, Heron J emphasised the lifelong commitment of Presbyterian ministers, and found that there was a nexus between the financial benefit provided to the retired Presbyterian ministers and the advancement of religion by the Presbyterian Church itself. In the Baptist Union case, MacDermott J had held that the purpose of that fund was prima facie charitable, as it promoted the advancement of religion by allowing ministers to devote their whole time to the work of the Baptist Church. OíRegan J held that ì\[i\]t is clear that the present case is not on all fours with the Presbyterian Church Fund case, because the members of the Plan are not clergy.î The Church does not have paid clergy, though all Church employees (and therefore all members of the Plan) were required to obtain a ìTemple Recommendî, which included the obligation to undertake a calling if requested, and were also required to be ìTemple worthyî (to adhere to a Church-wide standard of behaviour). 54 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) The plaintiffs argued that its employees were integral to the Churchís operation and that the work that they did could not be done by non-members of the Church. The Commissioner submitted that in many cases the tasks performed by the employees could be performed by independent contractors or employees who were not Temple worthy, and therefore it could not be said that without the employees the Church could not operate. OíRegan J accepted this submission. OíRegan J also accepted the Commissionerís submission that there was not the aspect of lifelong commitment that was present in the Presbyterian Church and Baptist Union cases. The judge also noted that there was a significant level of voluntary contributions to the scheme (the Commissioner argued that the Planís provisions for voluntary contributions had no charitable element). His Honour also noted that many of the Churchís employees had skills that could be transported to a non-Church environment, a distinguishing factor from the other cases. OíRegan J rejected an argument by the plaintiffs that he should take into account the potential effect of his judgment on the Church, a charitable organisation. OíRegan J stated (at paragraph \[64\]): The question before the Court is the correctness of the assessment of a particular taxpayer (the plaintiff), and that must be decided on the basis of the tax status of that taxpayer. That can only be determined by reference to the rules applying to that taxpayer. OíRegan J also rejected the plaintiffsí arguments that the assessment was discriminatory against the Plan. His Honour stated (at paragraph \[66\]): The fact that the Commissioner has determined that the characteristics of another taxpayer lead him to a different conclusion in respect of that taxpayer does not mean that he is behaving in a discriminatory way. Rather, it means he is recognising what he perceives to be differences between the taxpayer that lead to a different outcome in respect of each of them. OíRegan J concluded that there were a number of differences between the Plan and the Presbyterian Church case. That case was exceptional and should not be seen as authority that any superannuation scheme for the employees of a church should be charitable. OíRegan declined to follow the Presbyterian Church case to the extent that it could be said to extend to church employees who are not ministers but have an ecclesiastical role in their employment. The purpose of the Plan was to benefit the employees of the Church, which was a private benefit not consistent with the charitable purpose claimed by the plaintiffs. 55 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS OUTBOARD MOTORS ñ DRAFT GENERAL DEPRECIATION DETERMINATION GeneralEstimatedDV bandedSL equiv asset class useful lifedepín ratebanded depín years(%)rate (%) Outboard motors53324 3.

TAX PAYMENTS ñ WHEN RECEIVED IN TIME IR-SPS PRC-101 Introduction 1.This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out the Commissionerís practice for accepting tax payments as having been made in time. Application 2.This SPS replaces SPS PRC-100 Tax payments ó when received in time and will apply from 19 December 2003. Background 3.SPS PRC-100 Tax paymentsówhen received in time (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 10, No 4 (April 1998)) set out when the Commissioner would accept payments as having been made in time. Since that publication there have been changes in the way taxpayers make payments to Inland Revenue. The purpose of this SPS is to reflect those changes and inform taxpayers when a payment will be accepted as having been made in time. 4.This SPS refers to: ïPayments by post ïElectronic payments ïPhysical delivery ïPost-dated cheques ïWeekends and public holidays ïTax pooling, and ïTax transfers. Standard Practice 5.This standard practice applies to all tax types, including Goods and services tax (GST) and child support payments. Payments by post 6.Payments will be accepted as being received in time if mailed and postmarked on or by the due date. 7.For Rural Delivery taxpayers, the date of payment is when it is received by New Zealand Post or similar provider. It is not when the payment is placed in the taxpayerís personal mail box for collection. Overseas payments 8.An overseas postmark cannot be used to determine the date a payment was received by Inland Revenue from a taxpayer living or working overseas. Accordingly, normally the time of actual receipt by Inland Revenue will be used. Electronic payments 9.Taxpayers may make payments electronically, including internet banking. A payment will be received in time when it has been electronically paid or direct credited into an Inland Revenue account either on or before the due date. Internet payments must be completed prior to the end of the banksí online business hours to be recorded as received on that specific day. Internet payments after these online business hours will be processed on the next business day. 10. In the context of electronic payments, ìbusiness hoursî means the hours a bank makes available to customers to initiate electronic payments on any given day. Payments made after these hours will be processed by the bank as at the next business day. Overseas payments 11. A payment will be received in time when it has been electronically paid or direct credited into an Inland Revenue account either on or before the New Zealand due date. Physical delivery 12. A payment will be accepted as being received in time if it is deposited into an Inland Revenue drop box by the close of business on the due date. Westpac payments 13. Taxpayers may also make payments at most branches of Westpac. Payments can be made over the counter or via drop boxes. The payment is received in time if it is physically handed into a Westpac branch by the close of business on the due date. 57 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) Post-dated cheques 14. Inland Revenue will not bank post-dated cheques until the specified date. A cheque that is post-dated after the due date, even though it is received on or before the due date, will be treated as late. This applies to payments that are posted or physically delivered. Weekends and public holidays 15. If a due date falls on a weekend or a public holiday (including a provincial anniversary day), Inland Revenue will accept a payment without charging a penalty when it is handed in or posted on the next working day. Electronic payments 16. If a due date falls on a weekend or a public holiday (including a provincial anniversary day), then an electronic payment will be accepted as in time when it is credited into an Inland Revenue account on the next working day. GST payments 17. Payments will be accepted as being received in time if mailed and postmarked on or by the due date. GST payments are due on the last working day of the month. There is one exception to the GST rule. GST payments, which would normally be due on the last working day of December, are due on 15 January. Tax pooling 18. In cases of tax pooling, the date of payment is when the intermediary makes the tax payment to Inland Revenue. For more information on the implications of tax pooling please refer to Tax Information Bulletin Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003). Tax transfers 19. For the rules regarding the transfers of overpaid taxes please refer to Tax Information Bulletin Vo l 14, No 11 (November 2002). This Standard Practice Statement was signed by me on 10 December 2003 Margaret Cotton National Manager (Technical Standards) RETENTION OF BUSINESS RECORDS BY ELECTRONIC MEANS IR-SPS GNL-430 Introduction 1.This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) provides guidelines on the retention of business records where those records are stored in electronic form, on microfiche or on microfilm. The SPS also provides guidelines on the information and assistance required when Inland Revenue requests information and requires access to business records and supporting background materials. Application 2.This SPS applies from 21 November 2003 which is the date the Electronic Transactions Act 2002 (ETA) and the Electronic Transactions Regulations 2003 (No. 288) generally came into force. 3.The SPS replaces the previous Inland Revenue publications issued on record retention in Tax Information Bulletins Vol 1, No 6 (issued December 1989), Vol 3, No 1 (issued July 1991) and Vol 3, No 9 (issued July 1992). Summary 4.Business records may be kept in either paper-based or electronic form. Where records are held in electronic form, it is important they are kept in a manner that allows Inland Revenue to readily ascertain the amount of tax payable. 5.If information is transferred from source-paper and other non-electronic records into electronic form or microfilm for record retention purposes, the electronic or microfilm record, when reproduced in printed form must be identical in format and in all other respects to the original record. The addition of information such as index referencing is acceptable. The additional information must not obscure the image of the original record and must be distinguishable as additions to the original record. 6.If business records are originally in electronic form, persons should be able to demonstrate that their electronic records systems are secure from both unauthorised access and data alterations. Electronic copies must be readily accessible and capable of being retrieved and produced as a legible hard copy or supplied to Inland Revenue in electronic form upon request. 58 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) Background 7.The Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) requires persons who carry on business or other income earning activities to keep in New Zealand sufficient records in English to enable the Commissioner to readily ascertain the amounts of tax payable by that person. 8.Previously, the majority of business records were kept in paper form and the Commissioner allowed such records to be transferred to microfiche or microfilm in limited circumstances. 9.Technological advances have seen records now being transferred to electronic form or in some cases originating in electronic form. The ETA provides a framework to support those persons who want to conduct their businesses electronically. These persons will also have the option to use technology to store information from source-paper documents or other non-electronic records. The ETA also removes the requirement to retain the source-paper or non-electronic records where persons who use technology to store business records can ensure the integrity of the information transferred from source-paper or other non- electronic records. 10. It is an offence against the TAA if a person does not keep books or records required to be kept by a tax law or does not provide information when requested by an authorised Inland Revenue officer. Legislation Electronic Transactions Act 2002 25. LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO RETAIN DOCUMENT OR INFORMATION THAT IS IN PAPER OR OTHER NON-ELECTRONIC FORM (1) A legal requirement to retain information that is in paper or other non-electronic form is met by retaining an electronic form of the information if ñ (a)the electronic form provides a reliable means of assuring the maintenance of the integrity of the information; and (b)the information is readily accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference. (2) Subsection (1) applies to information that is a public record within the meaning of the Archives Act 1957 only if the Chief Archivist has approved the retention of that information in electronic form. (3) To avoid doubt, if information is retained in electronic form in accordance with subsection (1), the paper or other non-electronic form of that information need not be retained. 26. LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO RETAIN INFORMATION THAT IS IN ELECTRONIC FORM Subject to section 27, a legal requirement to retain information that is in electronic form is met by retaining the informationó (a)in paper or other non-electronic form if the form provides a reliable means of assuring the maintenance of the integrity of the information; or (b)in electronic form ifó (i)the electronic form provides a reliable means of assuring the maintenance of the integrity of the information; and (ii)the information is readily accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference. 27. EXTRA CONDITIONS FOR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONSó In addition to the conditions specified in section 26, if a person is required to retain information that is contained in an electronic communication,ó (a)the person must also retain such information obtained by that person as enables the identification ofó (i)the origin of the electronic communication; and (ii)the destination of the electronic communication; and (iii)the time when the electronic communication was sent and the time when it was received; and (b)the information referred to in paragraph (a) must be readily accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference. Tax Administration Act 1994 22. KEEPING OF BUSINESS RECORDS (1) Without limiting the generality of subsection (7), the records required to be kept and retained under subsection (2) in respect of any business carried on during any income year by any person, shall containó Ö (b)A record of all entries from day to day of all sums of money received and expended by the person (in relation to that business) and the matters in respect of which the receipt and expenditure takes place; and (c)Where that business involves dealing in goodsó (i)A record of all goods purchased, and of all goods sold in the carrying on of that business (except those sold in the course of cash retail trading customarily conducted in a business of the kind of which that 59 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) that annotations, indexing references, or other additional information are included in the record retained in electronic form, provided that theyó (a)do not obscure any of the original information contained in the record; and (b)are distinguishable as additions to the original record. (3) A legal requirement under the Inland Revenue Acts to retain a record that is generated in electronic form and is provided to another person in paper or other non- electronic form (for example, an invoice generated electronically and printed for sending to a customer) may be met by retaining the record in its electronic form only. (4) Despite subclause (1), if a record is received from a person in both paper or other non-electronic form and in electronic form (for example, a bank statement sent by a bank in paper form, and also provided in electronic form), a legal requirement to retain the record may be met by retaining the record in its electronic form only. (5) In this clause, Inland Revenue Acts has the same meaning as in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Standard Practice 11. Regardless of how business records are retained there must be sufficient detail to ensure a complete audit trail that allows tracing the retained records to and from accounting records and to tax returns. 12. Section 25 of the ETA provides the option of using technology to store source paper documents by electronic means. Section 26 of the ETA sets the standard for retaining information in electronic form. The Commissioner considers that the information will be readily ascertainable and meet the requirements of the ETA if the following practice is followed: Retention of records on microfilm/microfiche 13. Paper records microfilmed must be copied completely and accurately. 14. The microfilmed records, when reproduced in printed form, must be identical in format and in all other respects to the original records. The addition of information such as indexing references is acceptable. The additional information must not obscure the view of the original record information and must be distinguishable as additions to the original record. 15. The quality of the microfilmed records must be sufficient to ensure they are readily accessible and capable of being retrieved on legible hard copies (printouts) if required. (2) business is one) showing the goods, and the sellers and buyers or, as the case may be, the agents of the sellers and buyers in sufficient detail to enable the goods, and the sellers and buyers, and those agents, to be readily identified by the Commissioner; and all invoices relating to the goods; andÖ (d)Where that business involves the provision of services, records of the services provided and all invoices relating to them; andÖ (e)The charts and codes of accounts, the accounting instruction manuals, and the system and programme documentation which describes the accounting system used in each income year in the carrying on of that business. (f)... shall keep in New Zealand sufficient records in the English language to enable the ascertainment readily by the Commissioner, or any officer authorised by the Commissioner in that behalf, Ö (l)Ö shall retain in New Zealand all such records for a period of at least 7 years after the end of the income year to which they relateÖ (5) The Commissioner may, by notice in writing given before the expiry of the 7-year retention period specified in subsection (2), require a taxpayer to retain all or any of the records specified in that subsection for a further period not exceeding 3 years following the expiry of the 7-year periodÖ (7) In this section, records includesó (a)Books of account (whether contained in a manual, mechanical, or electronic format) recording receipts or payments or income or expenditure: (b)Vouchers, bank statements, invoices, receipts, and such other documents as are necessary to verify the entries in the books of account referred to in paragraph (a): Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Section 75 of the GST Act has similar requirements to section 22 of the TAA. Electronic Transactions Regulations 2003 SCHEDULE 1, CLAUSE 4 Conditions for legal requirements to retain records under Inland Revenue Actsó (1) A legal requirement under the Inland Revenue Acts to retain a record that is initially in paper or other non- electronic form may be met by retaining an electronic form of the record, only ifó (a) the record is readily able to be produced in paper form; and (b) that paper form is a duplicate image of the original paper or other non-electronic form. (2) For the purposes of subclause (1), it does not matter 60 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) 16. Paper records microfilmed in accordance with the requirements detailed below may be destroyed after transfer to microfilm. Retention of records in electronic form ñ originally in paper form. 17. Paper records transferred to electronic form must be copied completely and accuratelyófor example, the use of imaging to provide information in a format identical in all respects to the source-paper document. The addition of information such as index referencing is acceptable. The additional information must not obscure the view of the original record information and must be distinguishable as additions to the original record. 18. The electronic copy must be readily accessible and capable of being retrieved on legible hard copy (printouts) or supplied in electronic form (on electronic media and unencrypted in a form able to be read by Inland Revenue staff) if required. 19. Source-paper documents or other non-electronic records from which the complete information is transferred and stored in electronic form, in accordance with the requirements of the ETA and the Electronic Transactions Regulations 2003 (No. 288), may be destroyed after transfer to the electronic form. Retention of records in electronic form ñ originally in electronic form. 20. Internal controls must be adequate to ensure that all business transactions executed electronically, including those executed through the internet, are completely and accurately captured. 21. Persons should be able to demonstrate that their electronic records systems are secure from both unauthorised access and data alterations. This usually involves developing and documenting a security program that establishes: ïcontrols to ensure that only authorised personnel have access to electronic records; ïprovide for backup and recovery of records; ïensure that personnel are trained to safeguard sensitive or classified electronic records; and ïminimise the risk of unauthorised alteration, addition or erasure. 22. The charts and codes of accounts, the accounting instruction manuals, and the system and programme documentation which describes the accounting system used must be retained and produced if required, to an Inland Revenue officer. Encryption 23. The electronic copy must be readily accessible and capable of being retrieved and produced as legible hard copy (printouts) or supplied in electronic form (on electronic media and unencrypted in a form able to be read by Inland Revenue officers) if required. 24. The Commissioner may approve the use of symbols and abbreviations to facilitate the electronic transfer of tax invoices, credit notes or debit notes. Requests for approval should be made in writing to Inland Revenue. 25. Those who engage in the electronic transfer of tax invoices, credit notes or debit notes must retain electronic records that in combination with any other records, eg the underlying contracts, price lists, price changes, product code descriptions, have an adequate level of detail to meet the requirements of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act). For example, if a hard copy invoice is requested, the printout must contain all information as required under section 24 of the GST Act. Internet 26. Persons who do business via the internet are required to keep business records of all internet transactions for tax purposes. Emails 27. Some emails may be classified as business records required to be kept for tax purposes. Where emails are business records, section 27 of the ETA requires the origin, destination and time of electronic communications to be retained and accessible so as to be usable for subsequent references. Additional requirements 28. The following additional requirements are also necessary where business records are retained in electronic form. Backup 29. Backup and recovery procedures must be sufficient to guarantee the availability of electronic records for the required record retention period. Hardware/software changes 30. In the event of hardware/software changes: ïfacilities for retrieving electronic records that have been stored on the former system must be retained, or ïthe electronic records must be converted to a compatible system and both sets of files retained complete with documentation showing the method of transfer and controls in place to ensure the transfer was complete and accurate. 61 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) Storage offshore 31. The Commissioner may approve the storage of records offshore. Approval is subject to the records being readily available in New Zealand on request, in English, and at no cost to Inland Revenue in obtaining the information. Each case will be considered on individual merit, having regard to the personís compliance history and whether storage overseas is likely to impede Inland Revenue compliance activities. Providing accounting information in electronic format to Inland Revenue 32. Inland Revenueís Computer Tax Audit Unit and electronic data coordinators specialise in downloading electronically stored information. The preferred media for receiving electronic information is on CD, DVD or floppy disk. However, other media may be accepted such as 8mm tape cartridge, Zip drives, 4mm DAT tapes. An alternative method is transfer of data between personal computers. Other mutually agreeable transfer methods may be negotiated as required. 33. When possible, electronic information supplied to Inland Revenue should be in a fixed record length format, in EBCDIC or ASCII or delimited. Tapes should be created without software compression. The electronic information should be copied to media, not a proprietary back up. Documentation should be supplied with the media showing the record layout, record length, (block size if supplied on tape) and number of records. Assistance to Inland Revenue officers 34. Adequate viewing and printing facilities should be made available free of charge to Inland Revenue officers. If requested, persons must locate selected records that have been stored and print any items selected, free of charge to Inland Revenue officers. 35. Persons must be available to explain the operation of their computer system to Inland Revenue officers. This is the case whether the system is owned and operated by the person or out-sourced to a third party. 36. There must be sufficient detail to ensure a complete audit trail that allows tracing the retained records to and from accounting records through to tax returns. Retention period 37. The electronic or microfilmed records must be retained for the full retention period required by the TAA and the GST Act, currently seven years unless extended to 10 years by Inland Revenue for specific case situations.

MANAGING COMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH A DISPUTE REFERRED TO THE ADJUDICATION UNIT This item outlines how the Adjudication & Rulings group deals with communications it receives that are associated with a dispute that has been referred to the Adjudication Unit. Introduction Under the disputes resolution process, a tax dispute between Inland Revenue and a taxpayer is generally referred to the Adjudication Unit to review. The Adjudication Unit is independent of Inland Revenueís audit function, so as to facilitate impartiality, and is intended to take a fresh look at the application of the law to the facts of the disputed case. As such, the actual and perceived independence of the Unit is a matter that is taken very seriously. As noted in Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 8, No 3, August 1996, it is intended that communications to the Adjudication Unit about a dispute being considered by an Adjudication team would be very rare and, in most instances, would be initiated by the Unit itself. This would generally be in circumstances where the Adjudication team required clarification of some matter concerning the dispute. In all such cases, such contact will be in writing and a copy of the letter is also sent to the other party to the dispute. This is to ensure openness and transparency of the Adjudication process, and also to prevent compromising some aspects of the tax disputes process, including the role of the Statement of Position and the operation of the evidence exclusion rule. The TIB implies that the disputants cannot initiate any communications with the Adjudication team. However, in practice, taxpayers, agents and Inland Revenue staff, from time to time, do attempt to contact the Adjudication Unit for various reasons. These communications are managed by Adjudication & Rulingsí Field Liaison & Communication Unit (ìFLACî) in a manner that endeavours to ensure that the impartiality and independence of the adjudication process is not compromised. The principles There are two principles that guide the Adjudication Unit and FLAC in managing inward communications that are associated with a dispute that has been referred to the Unit. ïThe first principle is one of openness and transparency. This ensures that the adjudication process is consistent with the dispute resolution procedures and is based on an ìall cards on the tableî approach. This includes every communication subsequent to the dispute being referred to the Adjudication Unit which FLAC passes on to the Adjudication team working on the particular case being copied to all parties concerned. This principle is also reflected in the final Adjudication Report which is intended to be comprehensive and address all relevant arguments raised by either party to the dispute. As such, final decisions of the Commissioner are clearly explained in the report. ïThe second principle is one of maintaining the independence of the Adjudication Unit so that the impartiality of the team considering a disputed matter is not compromised. This is to ensure that the Adjudication team cannot be inappropriately influenced by matters beyond the scope of the dispute as embodied in the documentation referred to the Adjudication Unit. As noted in the TIB, the role of the Adjudication Unit is not to carry out further investigations but to form a view based primarily on the information provided in the Statements of Position of the respective parties, including any additions to such statements under section 89 M(13) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These two principles generally overlap so as to effectively require that the parties are aware both of the reasons for the decision and what has influenced the Adjudication team in the course of their deliberations. An example of this can be seen in the final Adjudication Report issued by the Unit, which is comprehensive as to the reasons for the decision(s). If an aspect is not in the report, then it did not influence the Adjudication team and does not form part of the reasoning or decision of the Adjudication team in that matter. 63 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) Applying the principles in practice There are two categories of communications: ïThose generated by the Adjudication Unit itself because they need to know something in order to progress their consideration of the case. ïThose that are generated by the disputantsó generally enquiring as to the state of progress of their particular case, or wanting to contribute further by referring additional material or arguments, suggestions, etc. The first category The first category is straightforward and is of the type referred to in the TIB. FLAC signs such letters and ensures that copies are referred to both parties. The reason for FLAC signing these letters is to ensure that the Adjudication team does not become the contact point for matters arising from such communications, and so is not open to direct contact for debating matters that potentially impact on their impartiality and perceptions of such impartiality. FLAC also ensures that all correspondence received in response is copied to both parties. The types of communications that fit into this category include letters enquiring whether a single report can be prepared in cases which concern more than one taxpayer, and (in rare situations) letters requesting clarification of something in a Statement of Position or requesting evidential material referred to in a Statement of Position but not included in the material provided. The second category As already noted, the second category involves communications received from a taxpayer or their agent, or from the Service Delivery area of Inland Revenue. The nature of these communications can range from enquiries about the state of progress of their particular case to wishing to refer additional material for consideration. Any inward communications are received by FLAC in the first instance and would be answered by FLAC if the matter is of a general or procedural nature. Some entirely administrative or system-related communications which are dealt with solely by FLAC or the systems area in Adjudication & Rulings and are not seen by the Adjudication team working on the case would not generally be copied to both parties. All communications which are passed on to the Adjudication team working on the particular case will be copied to both parties to the dispute. If the sender of the communication claims that it is the subject of legal professional privilege, the applicability of the privilege will be considered and determined by the Adjudication team before any copy is sent to the other party. APPLICATION OF THE ANONYMOUS VERSION OF DETERMINATION S13 Question We have received a query concerning the anonymous version of Determination S13 (as published in the Gazette on 20 July 1999) and whether it applies to a particular taxpayer. The correspondent also queried whether the methodology specified in the Determination was correct for all situations to which it applied. Conclusion The anonymous version of the Determination does not apply to anyone as such. As stated in the published version: The following is an anonymous version of a determination made for a particular applicant who is, or intends to be, a party to the relevant financial arrangement. It is not the determination nor a determination, merely an anonymous version of the actual determination. Accordingly, the anonymous version does not itself apply to any taxpayers. During the course of dealing with the query, we have contacted the agent of the taxpayers that applied for the actual Determination. The agent advised that the taxpayers did not proceed with the arrangement as described in the Determination. Accordingly, Determination S13 does not apply to anyone either. It is also noted that on reviewing the methodology in the Determination S13 as a result of the query, the Commissioner no longer considers that the methodology in the Determination S13 is correct in all respects. 64 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003) REGULAR FEATURES DUE DATES REMINDER January 2004 15GST return and payment due Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due ïEmployer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 20Employer deductions Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due ïEmployer monthly schedule (IR 348) due FBT return and payment due 30GST return and payment due February 2004 5Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due ïEmployer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 9End-of-year income tax ï7 April 2003, 2002 end-of-year income tax due for clients of agents with a March balance date ï7 February 2004, 2003 end-of-year income tax due for people and organisations with a March balance date and who do not have an agent 20Employer deductions Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due ïEmployer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 27GST return and payment due These dates are taken from Inland Revenueís Smart business tax due date calendar 2003 ñ 2004 YOUR CHANCE TO COMMENT ON DRAFT TAXATION ITEMS BEFORE THEY ARE FINALISED This page shows the draft binding rulings, interpretation statements, standard practice statements and other items that we now have available for your review.

Time limit for tax payer to issue NOPA begins on filing return
==============================================================

2004 case note – TRA found no exceptional circumstances existed to excuse the filing of a NOPA out of time – strike out.

Case

TRA Decision No. 31/2004

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, sections 138H, 89K, 92, 138B, 138C, 138E(1)(e)(iv); Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994, section 13A; Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998, regulation 12

### Summary

The tax payer filed a return intending to follow it up with a NOPA requiring that an item returned as income be deleted. It acted in the mistaken belief that the response period commenced on receipt of the notice of assessment, which is no longer issued as a matter of course under the self-assessment regime.

Due to an error, the return acknowledgment was issued to the wrong address and the NOPA was not filed with Inland Revenue until after the response period had expired. The proceedings sought to challenge the Commissioner's decision under section 89K that no exceptional circumstances existed to excuse the filing of a NOPA out of time. The Authority found it had no jurisdiction to hear the challenge.

### Facts

The department applied for an order striking out the notice of claim. In essence the grounds for the application were that the notice of claim disclosed no right of challenge under Part VIIIA of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The background to the application was as follows:

The tax payer filed its 2003 return on 2 July 2003 which disclosed the receipt of the sum of $167,000 paid to the disputant by a former lessee as consideration for cancellation of a lease. The accountant who filed the return considered the receipt to be a capital sum, and made arrangements for a tax consultant to attend to the filing of a NOPA upon receipt of a notice of assessment. The department was sent a letter advising that the address of the tax payer had changed from its accountant to the tax consultant engaged to prepare the NOPA.

On 29 July 2003 the department issued a return acknowledgment form to the wrong address. This resembled a notice of assessment form, but was merely advice of the self assessment figures. The tax consultant expected this communication would be sent to him so he could prepare the NOPA, but he did not learn of it until the former accountant returned from his overseas trip. That led to the disputant filing a NOPA on 31 October 2003, which the TRA accepted was as soon as reasonably possible after discovery by its advisers that the return acknowledgment form had been sent to the wrong address. However, that NOPA was out of time, in that it needed to have been filed by 1 September 2003, unless the department allowed an extension of that period on the basis of there being exceptional circumstances.

### Decision

The TRA found that with the introduction of self-assessment, section 92 of the TAA now provides for each tax payer, not the Commissioner to make an assessment of their taxable income and income tax liability. This meant that the time for filing a NOPA commenced on the date the income tax return was filed, and not on the date the return acknowledgment form was issued by the department.

The TRA accepted that the decision under section 89K that there were no exceptional circumstances to excuse the late filing of the NOPA was not a disputable decision pursuant to section 138E(1)(e)(iv). All other decisions which the disputant alleged the Commissioner had made were merely ancillary to the decision that there were no exceptional circumstances. Alternatively, even if all other decisions were independent decisions which satisfied the decision of "disputable decision" the disputant still had no right of challenge because its NOPA did not satisfy the statutory time limits.

The TRA also found there was no right of challenge under section 138B of the TAA. It was not necessary for the department to issue a response notice as the NOPA was out of time.

Judge Barber also noted the circumstances of the disputant's failure to file the NOPA in time could arguably (but with difficulty) amount to an exceptional circumstance. He earlier observed that the question is not as clear cut against the tax payer as the department thinks it is. However he accepted that this was a matter for the Commissioner and the Authority had no jurisdiction to hear the matter and there was no option but to grant the application.

Time of assessment by Commissioner not seen as justification to uphold judicial review
======================================================================================

2009 case note - decision confirms the findings in Golden Bay Cement, Miller and Abbattis Properties Limited on when an assessment is made.

Case

Amaltal Fishing Company Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Sections 109 and 138D(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The time of assessment is established by the facts of the case. In order for judicial review to apply, the taxpayer will need to establish exceptional circumstances and provide evidence of the effect on them.

### Impact of decision

The decision confirms the findings in **Golden Bay Cement,** **Miller and Abbattis Properties Limited** relating to when an assessment is made. It also confirms the criteria for judicial review after assessment.

### Facts

This is a judicial review by Amaltal Fishing Company (AFC) in respect of assessments made by the Commissioner in April 2006. The assessments related to income earned in the 1994 and 1995 years. 

In 1994 and 1995 AFC was a wholly owned subsidiary of Amaltal Corporation Limited (ACL). In June 1996, AFC and ACL together with a third company in the Amaltal group filed tax returns for the 1994 and 1995 years. Each company was a separate entity. A request was made to have the three returns transferred as a group assessment in the name of ACL. A technical error was made when entering the AFC returns into the first system in June 1996. The error resulted in the returns going into a suspense-type account pending resolution of the error. In September 1996 the group assessment was made. However in order to resolve the error a "reassessment to nil" was entered into the first system against AFC. As a result nil notices of assessment were issued to AFC for the 1994 and 1995 years. 

In November 1997 an investigation was commenced into ACL and AFC. The investigation focus was on the 1994 and 1995 tax years. It was concluded that an adjustment was required to AFC's taxable income. The issue was disputed and in March 2001 an amended assessment was issued to ACL for the 1994 year. An amended assessment was issued to ACL for the 1995 year in May 2001. The assessments incorporated AFC's income and tax. In May 2001, ACL lodged a notice of claim in relation to the amended 1994 assessment with the Taxation Review Authority (TRA). One of the grounds was that the Commissioner did not have the power to jointly assess AFC and ACL. The 1995 amended assessment was opposed on the additional ground that it was time- barred. The Commissioner accepted that the amended assessment for ACL for 1995 was time-barred. However the Commissioner then issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) dated 3 September 2001 to AFC indicating an intention to increase AFC's 1995 tax. AFC issued a Notice of Response (NOR) on 6 November 2001. 

On 7 August 2002, the TRA declared the 1994 amended joint assessment (under ACL) to be invalid and re-assessed ACL's tax for the 1994 year. This left the adjustments to be made to AFC for 1994, to be dealt with separately. A NOPA was issued to AFC for the 1994 year on 20 October 2004. The proposal was to increase AFC's tax. AFC's NOR was issued on 25 November 2004. On 27 April 2006 the Commissioner issued new assessments to AFC in relation to the 1994 and 1995 tax years. AFC failed to challenge the assessments within the prescribed time period. The TRA ruled that there were no "exceptional circumstances" under section 183D of the TAA 1994 (Case Y7, (2007) 23 NZTC 13,066) as did the High Court (**Amaltal Fishing Co Ltd** **v CIR** (2007) 23NZTC 21,639). In June 2007 AFC filed for an application in the High Court for a judicial review.

### Decision

Justice Mallon initially considered section 109 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) which deems disputable decisions correct except in proceedings. She concluded that after cases such as **Golden Bay Cement Co** **Ltd v CIR** \[1996\] 2 NZLR 665(CA; **Miller v CIR** \[2001\] 3 NZLR 316 (PC); and **CIR v Abattis Properties Ltd** (2002) 20NZTC 17,805 (CA) the established rules were:

1.  The correctness of an assessment that has been made can only be challenged in proceedings on objection.
2.  The legitimacy of the process adopted by the Commissioner and the validity of the outcome may be challenged in judicial review proceedings.
3.  If a judicial review challenge is available the court has a discretion whether to grant relief by way of judicial review.
4.  When an objection procedure is available it will only be in an exceptional case that the court will exercise its discretion to grant relief by way of judicial review.

Justice Mallon considered the submission by AFC that judicial review was available whenever there had been a "fatal flaw that affects the vires of a decision". That is, because the TRA and High Court found no exceptional circumstances existed ACL could not get a hearing and therefore there was no other remedial action for what it considered to be the unlawful actions of the Commissioner. At paragraph \[28\] of the decision she said:

*   \[28\] I do not accept AFC's submission that its unsuccessful application to pursue its objections to the assessment through the statutory procedure point in favour of exercising my discretion to grant judicial review relief. It may be a relevant factor in some cases combined with other factors **but it is not a decisive factor in itself. The timeframe for exercising challenge rights under the statutory procedure would be too easily thwarted if that were the case...**

Nor did she agree with the Commissioner's submission that exceptional circumstances in relation to the judicial review could not be established because the TRA and High Court had already said in relation to section138D(2) of the TAA that exceptional circumstances (for allowing appeal outside time period) did not exist. Continuing on in paragraph \[28\] she said:

*   \[28\] To bring a challenge under the statutory procedure outside the required timeframe an applicant must establish "exceptional circumstances" defined as being an event or circumstances beyond the control of the applicant that provides the applicant with a reasonable justification for not commencing the challenge in the required timeframe (section138D(2) Tax Administration Act 1994). **The test is narrower than matters that are potentially relevant to my discretion to grant relief on judicial review.**

Justice Mallon then visited the individual grounds upon which AFC based its application for the judicial review.

#### Ground one - time bar

Justice Mallon found that this was an issue which could have been decided had ACL challenged the assessment within the appropriate time period. She also found that there were no additional circumstances to justify her making a ruling that exceptional circumstances for a judicial review existed. However for completeness she went on to decide on the issue of whether or not the 2006 assessments were time barred. The legislation involved at the time was section 21D of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 (effective from 17 December 1992) which read:

> **21D Assessments and Determinations Made by Electronic Means**
> 
> Any assessment or determination made for the purpose of any of the Inland Revenue Acts that is made automatically by a computer or any other electronic means in response to or as a result of information entered or held in the computer or other electronic medium shall be treated as an assessment or determination made by or under the properly delegated authority of the Commissioner.

Section 25 of the Income Tax Act 1974 dictates the time period for altering an assessment. It reads

> **25 Limitation of time for amendment of assessment**
> 
> (1)  When any person has made returns and has been assessed for income tax for any year, it shall not be lawful for the Commissioner to alter the assessment so as to increase the amount thereof after the expiration of 4 years from the end of the year in which the notice of **original assessment was issued.**

In paragraph \[44\] Justice Mallon noted that:

*   \[44\] An assessment is "the process by which the Commissioner carries out his statutory obligation to ascertain the amount on which tax is payable and the amount of tax": **Lloyds Bank Export Finance Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue** \[1992\] 2 NZLR 1 at \[20\].

Her Honour confirmed that amendments to the legislation were only made to clarify that time ran from the notice, and not from when the assessment was made. Her Honour could not see any distinction between the facts in AFC and **Paul Finance** and **GoldenBay**.

Mallon J then considered the evidence of the person responsible for the entry into the first system and determined that it was never her intention to make an assessment. Her honour was of the view that the four-year time period in section 25(1) of the Income Tax Act did not commence from 3 September 1996 and that notices issued on that day were issued in error.

#### Ground two - conditional assessment

This ground related to the failure of the Commissioner to include a deduction for depreciation in the 1995 year after he reassessed revenue expenditure as capital expenditure in the 1994 year. The contention being that the assessment for the 1995 year could not have been what the Commissioner honestly believed was correct. While he believed depreciation was available, he also believed he could not allow depreciation until the disputed issue of whether or not the 1994 assessment was correct (capital/ revenue distinction) was decided. Despite agreeing with **Miller** and stating that the issue should have been dealt with in disputes proceedings, Mallon J at paragraph \[60\] found 29 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21 No 2 that the Commissioner was in error in issuing an assessment which created a liability when the Commissioner's view was that if his opinion was upheld in relation to the 1994 assessment, he would then need to amend his 1995 assessment. Despite ruling that the issue should have been addressed in disputes proceedings Her Honour adjourned this aspect of the proceedings to allow the Commissioner 14 days to amend the assessments to reflect a depreciation allowance.

The Commissioner has since complied with the directions of the Court.

#### Ground three - section 27(1) of the Bill of Rights Act 1990

Section 27(1) of the Bill of Rights Act 1990 (BOR) concerns the observance of the principals of natural justice. AFC submitted that assessments were **Ultra Vires** because they were not made within a reasonable time. The Commissioner submitted that the BOR did not apply and also that there was no unreasonable delay resulting in AFC suffering any prejudice as a result of the delay.

Justice Mallon referred to **Combined Beneficiaries** **Union** **Incorporated v Auckland City COGS Committee** \[2008\] NZCA 423 which held that section 27(1) did not require that the determination be adjudicative in nature. The determination applied to decisions "to which natural justice ordinarily applies". Justice Mallon again recognised that there was a procedure which a taxpayer could apply in order to challenge an assessment but also recognised that section 27(1) may still apply. She then proceeded on the basis that section 27(1) may apply. The question then to be answered was "whether the principles of natural justice required that an assessment under the Income Tax Act be made without delay?" AFC relied on **Unitec Institute of Technology** **v Attorney-General** \[2006\] 1 NZLR 65 to argue that natural justice required that a decision be made within a reasonable time. The Commissioner submitted that on the facts in this case there was no evidence of unreasonable delay.

Justice Mallon then found that "there is doubt as to whether the right to natural justice in this context included the right to a determination (the assessments) without unreasonable delay." At paragraph \[73\] she concluded:

*   \[73\] Turning to general principal, in broad terms natural justice requires that a person affected by a determination receives a fair hearing. What that entails in any particular case depends on the circumstances and the nature of the determination assessed in light of any relevant statutory provision.

Her Honour then followed the sequence of events and determined that in this case the delay did not cause any breach in natural justice. In isolation the 10-year period for assessment looked like a long time; however, both parties thought that the joint assessments applied in the beginning could be made. This mistake counted for a period of five years. Periods of delay after the five years were seen as undesirable but not particularly lengthy when taken in context. Justice Mallon also found that there was no financial prejudice to AFC because penalties and interest applied to the core tax and could be offset against the depreciation which would now be allowed.

#### Ground four - arbitrary and unreasonable adjustment

This ground relates to a decision of the investigator to assess a portion of an insurance payout to AFC as recovered expenditure rather than as capital profit. The ground raised by AFC was that the Commissioner took irrelevant considerations into account when re-assessing. The claim also alleged an error of law although the error itself was not identified. Justice Mallon found that the grounds for the review "clearly challenge the correctness of the decision". The issue of the correctness of the decision should have been dealt with under traditional statutory review grounds. The only exceptional circumstance which could justify a review was the fact that AFC was time barred, but that alone was not enough to convince her that exceptional circumstances did exist.

Justice Mallon also noted that while AFC may have convinced a hearing authority that the Commissioner was wrong she was not convinced that the Commissioner acted in an unlawful or irrational manner.

Time period for refunds under the Income Tax Act 2007
=====================================================

2013 amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 reduces the time period when refunds can be claimed to four years from the year of assessment.

_Sections CD 40, CD 41, OB 71, OB 72, OB 72B, OP 6, RM 2, RM 10, RM 13, RM 17, RM 22, RM 23, RM 26, RM 28 and RM 33 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 41A, 125, 138E and 184 of the Tax Administration Act 1994; section 202 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 and section 86L of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971_

An amendment has been made to reduce the time period when refunds can be claimed under the Income Tax Act 2007 to four years from the year of assessment.

### Background

If too much tax has been paid, the excess amount is refundable to the taxpayer. Over the years, the time periods for requesting refunds under the Income Tax Act have varied from between three and eight years.

The refund period was aligned with the time bar (four years) in 1944. At the time, it was considered that the time period for a taxpayer to claim a refund should be aligned with the time period for the Commissioner to amend an assessment. With the introduction of PAYE in 1957, the refund period was increased to six years in recognition of the possibility that employers could make mistakes in their calculations. It was increased to eight years in 1968. In 2004, the refund period was amended to four years from the date of assessment, with an eight-year period applying when the overpayment resulted from a clear mistake or simple oversight.

The longer periods for refunds were established in an era when the administrative environment was based on assessments carried out by the Commissioner. Departing from four years for a refund was aimed at ensuring taxpayers were not unduly prejudiced by any errors made by employers or the Commissioner when the PAYE scheme was introduced (as systems were not then computerised).

The time limits on refunds of tax paid in excess, and on the Commissioner amending assessments when insufficient tax has been paid, are a trade-off between achieving finality and ensuring the correct amount of tax has been paid.

In a modern tax administration environment an eight-year refund period was not consistent with the policy objective of reaching a balance between the finalising of a taxpayer's tax position at the earliest practicable stage and the accuracy of that position.

The time limit on the Commissioner to increase an assessment of tax is generally four years from the year of assessment. The Commissioner requires a period in which to determine the accuracy of taxpayer assessments. Setting the time period for refunds at four years has aligned the time period for taxpayers requesting refunds with the time period for the Commissioner increasing an assessment.

This approach also means that taxpayers requesting refunds will be treated similarly. The refund period for taxpayers who are personal tax summary taxpayers is four years. Now all taxpayers will have a refund period of four years from the year of assessment.

The new refund period is similar to that in other jurisdictions, for example, the time period in the United States is three years, and in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia it is generally four years.

During the Select Committee process, one of the submissions set out an example where a taxpayer returned income early in year 1 - the income should have been returned in year 3. When Inland Revenue audited the taxpayer in year 7 the assessment for year 3 was amended but a corresponding adjustment was not made to the year 1 assessment, resulting in the taxpayer being taxed twice on the same income.

Officials consider that such an outcome would not be consistent with the Commissioner's duty under section 6 of the Tax Administration Act to maintain the integrity of the tax system. In such a case it would be generally appropriate not to amend the assessment to prevent double taxation of the same amount of income, and therefore minimise associated compliance and administration costs.

The Commissioner has issued an internal instruction to this effect.

### Key features

The Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended to reduce the time period for refunds under the Act to four years from the year of assessment. This time period will apply consistently to all refunds.

For the donations tax credit which is refunded separately from the income tax process, the time period for taxpayers requesting refunds is four years from the end of the tax year in which the donation was made.

The time period can be extended to a maximum of six years if the Commissioner exercises her discretion under section 78B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow a longer period when a taxpayer has a tax credit under section LJ 2 (tax credits for foreign income tax) or section LK 1 (tax credits relating to attributed CFC income).

The time period for refunds under the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 has also been limited to four years.

### Application dates

For refunds claimed under the Income Tax Act 2007 the amendment applies to refunds for a taxpayer's 2013-14 or later tax year. This means that the current refund time periods continue to apply to refunds for a person's 2012-13 or earlier tax year.

The time period for requesting refunds for the donations tax credit will become four years from the end of the tax year in which the donation was made. This change applies to donation tax credit claims in the 2014-15 and later tax years.

Time to speak up - New Zealanders to have their say about the future of the tax system
======================================================================================

**14 August 2014**

Six people from a variety of backgrounds will give New Zealanders a voice in simplifying, modernising and transforming the way tax is paid.

Commissioner of Inland Revenue Naomi Ferguson has welcomed the appointment of five new members to Inland Revenue's Taxpayers Simplification Panel, to be chaired by Henri Eliot.

 She said it was exciting to have such a wide range of knowledge and experience on-board to help make tax easier for all New Zealanders.

"We have had a great response to our idea of setting up the panel and to the panellists we have selected," she said. "All of them have fantastic skills and will be able to offer and contribute a great deal. Those selected range from successful businesses owners to representing the needs and interests of varied communities.

"The panellists will now engage with all of our customers and small businesses on how we can best reduce the amount of time spent on red-tape and tax compliance," said Ms Ferguson.

To be selected the panellists had to meet criteria including, their experience in setting up and operating small to medium size businesses, knowledge of web and digital design and their access to the views of the wider community.

Inland Revenue is keen to work with everyday New Zealanders and talk to people who might not have been heavily involved in the tax debate up to now," said Ms Ferguson. "We already engage with a variety of interest groups, we listen to their views and so we are familiar with their positions. This panel is about giving a voice to those who have yet to be heard.

"Everything we are doing is about simplifying tax so it is quicker and easier for everyone. Our campaigns and the Taxpayers Simplification Panel are all ways in which New Zealanders can have their say about our tax system as Inland Revenue becomes a world class revenue authority.

"I encourage anyone who wishes to share their ideas about how we can make tax simpler to email Inland Revenue's Taxpayers Simplification Panel at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c8bba1a5b8a4adbca9b088a1baace6afa7bebce6a6b2)
," she said.

The first meeting of Inland Revenue's Taxpayers Simplification Panel will be held on 22 August 2014 and will consider the 1,500 responses Inland Revenue received for its recent Save Time campaign.  This initiative asked individuals and small business owners in the Hawkes Bay to rate six ideas which would make dealing with their tax affairs faster and easier.

Timing of deduction for accounting services
===========================================

2007 case note - Taxpayer is allowed a deduction in the income tax year which the expenditure is incurred - definitively committed, legal obligation to make payment.

Case

TRA Decision Number 14/07

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994, sections BD2, BD4 and DJ5(1)

### Summary

The taxpayer is allowed a deduction in the income tax year which the expenditure is incurred. Expenditure is incurred when the taxpayer is definitively committed to the expenditure, a legal obligation to make payment in the future has accrued, the expenditure must be more than impending, threatened or expected and theoretical contingencies can be disregarded. The taxpayer did not incur the expenditure (accounting fees for the 2003 financial statements and returns of income) until 2004 and accordingly, could only deduct those fees in 2004 - not 2003 as claimed.

### Facts

This case concerns the timing of deductibility of accounting fees.

The Disputant is a limited liability company. It entered into an agreement with its chartered accountants on 6 March 2000 which confirmed "the terms of our continuing appointment to provide accounting services; the nature of those services". In relation to the annual financial statements, the accountants would "bill as the work is performed. These progress billings will be shown in the final bill which will detail the total cost for those statements".

On 31 March 2003 the Disputant accrued $2,285.00 as "being estimate of 2003 fees" and subsequently claimed a deduction in it's 2003 income tax return. The accounting services for the $2,285 were, however, performed and invoiced in the 2004 income tax year.

### Decision

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") confirmed that it is settled law that expenditure can only be deducted if it can be brought within the terms of the Tax Acts and, referring to both the Privy Council and Court of Appeal in _Mitsubishi Motors Ltd v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue_, accounting principles and good commercial practice cannot be substituted for the statutory test of deductibility.  
A deduction must be allocated to the income year in which it is incurred. The principles of "incurred" are also settled law and the principles can be summarised as:

*   Expenditure is incurred in an income year even if there is no actual disbursement.
*   Expenditure is incurred if the taxpayer has "definitively committed" itself to that expenditure.
*   It is not sufficient that the expenditure be merely "impending, threatened or expected".
*   There must be an "existing obligation" and whether, in light of all the surrounding circumstances, a legal obligation to make a payment in the future has said to have accrued.

Where the expenditure arises under a written agreement, whether or not it constitutes an existing obligation is a question of the construction of the deed or agreement.

On the facts of this case, the Disputant may have had statutory obligations to prepare financial accounts and returns of income but it did not have a statutory obligation to pay its accountants to prepare those financial statements and returns of income. The contractual relationship was only that, if the accountants performed work, they would bill the Disputant as the work was performed. As at 31 March 2003, the Disputant was not contractually bound to have the accountants prepare the financial statements and returns of income. On 1April 2003 the Disputant could have ceased using the accountants and used other means (itself or other agents) to prepare the financial statements and returns of income. This is reinforced because, if contractually bound, the Disputant would be liable here for an unquantified rate of payment.

As the legal obligation to make payment only arose upon work being completed and invoiced for, the Disputant was not definitively committed to the expenditure at 31 March 2003. Accordingly, it had not incurred the expenditure in the 2003 income tax year and was not entitled to the deduction in that year.

The TRA noted that it seems basic that if a taxpayer seeks to deduct accountancy fees in a particular year, then as a general rule that service needs to have been provided in that particular year. Any accounting practice to deduct fees in an earlier year for work done some months later is, as a matter of law, a wrong practice. The TRA left open the possibility that there may be merit in the argument that a pre-commitment on a commercial basis for accounting services to be provided after the end of revenue year in question creates a debt incurred in the earlier year

Timing of imputation credits and debits - tax pooling
=====================================================

2010 amendment covering tax pooling and the timing of imputation credits and debits and amending section OB 6 of the Income Tax Act.

The Rewrite Advisory Panel agreed with a submission that section OB 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007 contained an unintended change in law. The Panel considered that the change produced a different timing for the imputation credit on the transfer of an entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account, when compared to the outcome given by section ME 4(2)(ad) of the 2004 Act.

The Panel also noted that consequential amendments would be required for related imputation (tax pooling) provisions (sections OB 34, OB 35, OP 9, OP 32, and OP 33).

The purpose of "tax pooling" is to provide a pool of funds for use by companies to reduce exposure to use-of-money interest and late payment penalties - in particular, for provisional tax. A tax pooling intermediary administers the tax pooling account, including a transfer (when requested) of funds to a taxpayer's tax account with Inland Revenue.

Under the tax pooling rules, if a taxpayer pays an amount for tax into a "tax pooling account", that payment is held in trust for that taxpayer's benefit. Funds held for the benefit of a taxpayer in a tax pooling account are normally described as an entitlement to funds in the tax pooling account.

However, taxpayers may "sell" their entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account to another taxpayer. On that sale, the tax pooling intermediary transfers the entitlement to those funds to the other taxpayer.

Under the tax pooling imputation rules, a company is intended to have a credit in its imputation credit account (ICA) for:

*   a payment for tax made into the tax pooling account (that is, the taxpayer's own deposits into the tax pooling account);
*   the purchase of an entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account.

It is also possible that a purchaser of an entitlement may, instead of transferring the underlying funds to the purchaser's tax account with the Commissioner:

*   later on-sell that entitlement to another taxpayer; or
*   later request that the intermediary refunds to the purchasing company the funds representing that entitlement from the tax pooling account.

The tax pooling imputation rules provide specific timing rules for the imputation credit that relates to a deposit of funds or purchase of funds. These timing rules are necessary to ensure consistency with the overall objectives of:

*   the tax pooling rules;
*   enabling the benefit of tax paid at the corporate level to be available for shareholders; and
*   the rules relating to the transfer of other tax types to a taxpayer's income tax account with Inland Revenue.

The timing of imputation credits arising in relation to an entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account is as follows:

*   The date of the imputation credit for a deposit into a tax pooling account is the date of the deposit. If an entitlement to funds is on-sold, the vendor company must debit its ICA for the amount of the entitlement sold.
*   For a purchased entitlement, the date of the imputation credit for a purchased entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account is permitted to be backdated if the funds are transferred to the company's tax account with Inland Revenue. The backdating of the credit is to a date selected by the taxpayer, but can be no earlier than the date of the original deposit made to the tax pooling account. Some restrictions also apply to the backdating to prevent abuse of the backdating rule.
*   The date of the imputation credit for a purchased entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account that is on-sold (transferred) to another taxpayer is the date of the transfer. A debit to the company's imputation credit also arises for the amount on-sold on the transfer, because the purchased amount is not transferred to the company's tax account with Inland Revenue and therefore does not represent tax paid by the company.
*   The date of the imputation credit for a purchased entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account that is refunded to the company from the tax pooling account is the date of the refund. A debit to the company's imputation credit also arises for the amount on-sold, because the purchased amount is not transferred to the company's tax account with Inland Revenue and therefore does not represent tax paid by the company.

#### Detailed analysis

Section OB has been amended to ensure that a company acquiring an entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account receives an imputation credit, and that the date of the credit is as follows:

*   if the purchasing company requests the intermediary to transfer to the company's tax account with Inland Revenue, an amount representing an entitlement to the funds in the tax pooling account, the date of the credit is determined under the effective date rules in sections RP 19 and RP 20; or
*   if the purchasing company on-sells to another taxpayer that entitlement to the funds in the tax pooling account, the date of the credit is at the date the entitlement is transferred to the other taxpayer; or
*   if the purchasing company requests that the intermediary refunds the funds representing the purchased entitlement from the tax pooling account to the company, the date of the credit is the date of the refund.

#### Consequential amendments to other imputation (tax pooling) provisions

In addition:

*   As originally enacted in the 2007 Act, section OB 34 applied only to a company in relation to a deposit of its own funds in a tax pooling account. Section OB 34 has been amended to ensure that it applies to a company that has purchased an entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account.
*   As originally enacted, section OB 35 applied only to an on-sale of an entitlement that was deposited by the selling company. Section OB 35 has been amended to ensure that it applies to an on-sale of an entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account that a company had previously purchased from another company.
*   As originally enacted, section OP 9 contained the same drafting concerns set out above, and has been amended in the same way as section OB 6.
*   As originally enacted, section OP 32 and OP 33 were drafted differently from the language in sections OB 34 and OB 35. Sections OP 32 and 33 have been amended to ensure they are drafted to be consistent with the amendments for sections OB 34 and OB 35.
*   Section OP 33 has been amended to clarify that the tax pooling intermediary is the person that transfers entitlements to funds in a tax pooling account, as the trustee of those funds.

Tourism service providers' payments made to tour guides or drivers - the income tax liability of those parties and the tour operator employing the guide or driver
==================================================================================================================================================================

QB (Feb 2001) discusses tax implications of payments or 'commissions' made by tourism service providers to those employed in the tourism industry.

### Income Tax Act 1994 and Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979

We have been asked about the tax implications of payments made by tourism service providers (those selling services or goods to tourists) to those employed in the tourism industry, such as coach drivers and tour escorts, to encourage the taking of passengers or clients to those particular tourism service providers.  The payments are colloquially known as "commissions". 

This item considers the application of the Income Tax Act 1994 to each of the following parties:

*   The tour operator - the business principal (e.g. a company or partnership) providing the service of tours.  The tour operator is generally the employer of the tour guide or coach driver who receives the payments.  References to the tour operator in this item are references to this entity.
*   The tourism service provider - the entity making the payments.  The person in the business of providing goods or services to tourists, e.g. tourist attractions or activities, motels, and tearooms.  In this item the tourism service provider is referred to as the payer.
*   The tour guides, tour escorts, or coach drivers - mostly individuals employed by the tour operators - referred to as the payee in this item.  It is the payee who receives payment from the tourism service provider.  Occasionally, a business entity, rather than an individual, may contract with the tour operator to provide tour escort or driving services. 

This item assumes that no employment relationship exists between the payer and the payee.  It is further assumed that no arrangement exists between the tour operator and the payer, e.g. a tour operator instructs the payee to favour a particular tourism service provider who will provide payments.

#### Application of the legislation

##### The tour operator's position

Sections BE 1(1) and NC 2(1) require PAYE to be deducted where an employee receives a source deduction payment from an employer.

"Source deduction payment" is defined in section OB 2(1) as:

... a payment by way of **salary or wages**_,_ **an extra emolument**, a payment made to a specified office holder in respect of the activities of a specified office, **or a withholding payment**. \[Emphasis added.\]

The tour operators have no PAYE liability in respect of these payments under sections BE 1(1) and NC 2(1).  Firstly, given the assumption above that no relationship exists between the payer and the tour operator, the payments are not from the tour operators.  Secondly, the payments are not made in respect of or in relation to employment.  Case law shows that the employment must give rise to the payment, rather than simply being the context or setting for it.  Although the payee would not receive the payment but for being an employee, the "but for" test is not the test applied by the courts.  The payee does not receive the payment in respect of or in relation to his or her job, as the payment is premised on the payee doing something more than his or her job entails, namely choosing where to go on the basis of the payment.

Accordingly, the tour operator has no tax obligations in respect of the payments.

##### The payer's position

If the payments are made to New Zealand residents no obligation to deduct PAYE arises for the payer unless the payee is an employee of the tourism service provider.  It has been assumed for the purposes of this item that no such employment relationship exists.  Therefore, the payments are not "in respect of or in relation to employment" and no PAYE need be deducted.

Where the payments are made to non-residents there is an obligation on the payer, subject to the payee having a certificate of exemption, to make withholding deductions as the payments are within Schedule E (contract payments made to a non-resident contractor) of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979.

In relation to deductibility to the payer, while the matter will depend on the circumstances of the case, assuming the making of the payments to the payees can be substantiated, the Commissioner's practice is that these payments will generally be deductible.

##### The payee's position

The payments are not assessable as monetary remuneration under section CH 3 as, for the reasons stated above, they are not "in respect of or in relation to" employment.  However, the payee remains assessable under section CD 5 as the payments are income according to ordinary concepts.  This is because the receipts in question have the hallmarks of income (refer _Reid v CIR_ (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176).  In terms of the payment's quality in the hands of the recipient, it is clearly a payment received for doing something.  Even if paid in advance, the payments are premised on the payee eventually bringing in clients.  Thus they are payments made in respect of services.  The payments are made for services rather than being gifts, because they are made in the context of business dealings. 

In some instances, instead of a cash sum, the payee may receive goods or services.

In those circumstances, the convertibility principle (_Tennant v Smith_ \[1892\] AC 150 (HL)_, Dawson v CIR_ \[1978\] ATC 6,012) will operate to include as income benefits received that can be converted into money.  However, not all benefits will be income as income does not include what is saved from going out.  So, for example, clothing or passes to an attraction would be income as they could be sold by the recipient; but a free meal received by a coach driver every time he or she brought in tourists would not be.

Some payees will be assessable as New Zealand tax residents as they will satisfy the tests for residency in sections OE 1 and OE 2.  However, subject to any relevant Double Taxation Agreement, non-residents remain assessable as the income is deemed to be derived in New Zealand by section OE 4(l)(q) - income derived from contracts made or wholly or partly performed in New Zealand, or section OE 4(1)(u) - income derived directly or indirectly from any other source in New Zealand.  As noted above, there may be an obligation on the payer to deduct withholding deductions when the payments are to non-residents.

 A payee may be a business entity that, as part of its business, contracts services to the tour operator.   In this event, the payments will be gross income under section CD 3 as amounts derived from a business, or under section CD 5 for the reasons stated earlier. 

The tour operator has no tax obligations in respect of the payments as the payments are not from the tour operators, nor received in respect of or in relation to the employment of the payee.  Where the payments are made to New Zealand tax residents, the payer has no tax obligations.  Where the payments are made to non-residents, the payer has, subject to the payee having a certificate of exemption, an obligation to deduct withholding deductions.  A payee is liable, subject to the provisions of any relevant Double Taxation Agreement, to pay tax on the payments regardless of the outcome of the residence tests in sections OE 1 and OE 2, as the income is deemed to be derived in New Zealand under section OE 4(1)(q) or section OE 4(1)(u).  If the payee receives the payment in the course of the payee's business, the payment is gross income under section CD 3.  In other situations, the payments will be gross income under section CD 5.

Towards a fairer tax system - Tax Working Group Terms of Reference announced
============================================================================

**23 November 2017**

Finance Minister Grant Robertson and Revenue Minister Stuart Nash today announced the Terms of Reference for the Tax Working Group and that the Group will be chaired by Sir Michael Cullen.

“Our 100 Day Plan includes the establishment of a Tax Working Group. The Working Group will consider changes that would improve the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system,” says Grant Robertson.

“This Government is committed to a fair and progressive tax system. It is important that New Zealanders have confidence in their tax system and know that everyone is paying their fair share.”

“At the moment the tax system appears unfair – for example, it doesn’t treat income from speculation in housing as it does income from work. We want to consider how we can create a better balanced system and can encourage a shift to investment in the productive economy.

“Individual wage-earners, businesses, asset owners and speculators should pay their fair share of tax. Right now we don’t think that is happening. This working group is not about increasing income tax or the rate of GST, but rather introducing more fairness across all taxpayers.

“The Working Group will also consider how the tax system can contribute to positive environmental outcomes and the impact of likely changes to the economic environment, demographics, technology and employment practices over the next decade.

“As former Minister of Finance from 1999 to 2008, Sir Michael’s credentials are impeccable and he will be a huge asset to the Working Group.”

“The other members of the Working Group will be announced before Christmas. They will include a diverse range of tax and finance experts and representatives of the business and wider community. The Working Group will be supported by a secretariat of officials from Treasury and Inland Revenue and have an independent advisor to analyse the various sources of advice received,” says Stuart Nash.

“Final recommendations to Ministers are expected by February 2019. As promised before the election, any significant changes legislated for from the Group’s final report will not come into force until the 2021 tax year.

“It is important to ensure that all sectors of the New Zealand economy can feed into the Working Group’s processes and that all relevant perspectives are considered.”

“As we promised during the election campaign, certain areas will be outside the scope of the review, including increasing any income tax rate, the rate of GST, inheritance tax and changes that would apply to the family home or land beneath it,” Grant Robertson says.

“We also want to thank our government partners, the New Zealand First and Green parties, for their input and support of the Terms of Reference for this important piece of work on the future of our tax system.

"This review is a core part of the government’s programme and I’m confident it will deliver recommendations that will enable us to put in place a tax system that is fair for all New Zealanders,” says Grant Robertson.

TRA allows deduction for GST input tax on legal services provided in trusts
===========================================================================

2009 case note – trustees claimed invoice trust deductions for input tax on fees from litigation between trustees and beneficiaries - section 3A, taxable activity.

Case

TRA Decision Number 06/2009; TRA 67/05 and 70/05

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("GST Act) and the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA)

### Summary

The trustees claimed various invoice trust deductions for input tax on legal fees arising from litigation between the trustees and beneficiaries. The question was whether these services were acquired for the principle purpose of the trust's taxable activity.

### Impact of decision

Trustees can claim a deduction for legal fees on a GST input return basis through the trust when the trust is carrying out a taxable activity even if the fees are paid for by a third party. In the absence of an exempt supply or criminal charges outside the scope of normal business activity, GST input tax on legal fees which are incurred in the course or furtherance of a GST registered person's taxable activity will be deductible in full.

### Facts

This proceeding involved two disputant trusts who are acting in a type of representative capacity as part of a complex structure of family trusts all having similar claims. The cases of the other trusts have been stayed pending the outcome of this case.

The disputant trusts claimed deductions of GST input tax for legal fees associated with extensive trust litigation. The trust litigation came about due to a dispute between family members. The dispute involved the removal of trustees of various trusts ("breach of trust proceedings").

The Commissioner disallowed the disputant trusts' GST deductions on the basis that the legal services were not acquired for the principle purpose of making taxable supplies. Also the invoices were not issued to any particular trust nor were they valid "tax invoices" for GST purposes.

### Decision

_Whether legal services were acquired by the disputant trusts?_

The disputant trusts engaged professional legal providers to assist them in defending the breach of trust proceedings. The family trusts (through their trustees) had a legal obligation to pay the legal service providers.

The fact that the legal fees may have been indirectly funded at times by a third party is of no relevance to the GST position in terms of an input tax claim, the GST-registered person has the contractual liability to pay for the relevant supply of legal and other services.

The fact that the majority of the invoices produced during the proceedings were addressed to "The trustees of the Trust" globally is of no relevance.

A GST-registered person will be in the GST tax base and eligible to claim all GST input tax on costs charged to it, unless the trust is making exempt supplies and those costs can be shown to be referable to those exempt supplies.

In the absence of a clear disqualifying feature like an exempt supply or criminal charges outside the scope of normal business activity, GST input tax on legal fees which are incurred in the course or furtherance of a GST registered person's taxable activity will be deductible in full; as they must be to avoid that person being a consumer.

_Whether a taxable activity was carried on by the disputant trusts, and were legal costs acquired in the course of furtherance of that activity?_

The disputant trusts were carrying on a "taxable activity" at the time the relevant legal services were acquired.

**In the case of the first disputant trust,** it carried on the activities of leasing its land to a winery for viticulture purposes and the balance of its land was used for cattle and sheep grazing, breeding and fattening. Financial statements for the trust record the rent being paid. The share of GST input tax incurred on the legal services was "an ordinary incident of administration of the trust" and proper and reasonable cost for the trust to incur (_Variety Leisure, Bayly_ and _Case R38_).

**In the case of the second disputant trust,** it provided bailment services and performed other bailment activities. This trust owned a large amount of livestock and the bailment activity per se was an economic activity and not a hobby. While there was no formal bailment arrangement, the arrangements operated in practice for some time. The fact that a third party provided staff from time-to-time to assist with the running of the trust's farming/economic activities would not alter this conclusion as many farming arrangements, particularly on this scale, often involve shared and informal arrangements. Bailment rental was received by the trust in the relevant GST periods, bailment rental calculations are recorded, as well.

The fact that the trust also had a shareholding in a farming station company did not alter the fact that a taxable activity was being conducted by it. The farming is incidental to the principal taxable activity being carried on. The legal costs incurred were proper and reasonable ones and an incidence of ordinary trust management and administration.

_Whether any legal services were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies?_

The legal services acquired were no different conceptually from the costs or valuation and accounting and consulting services which each of the disputant trusts acquired in the same GST periods.

The key point in solving this issue is to determine what effect the legal services had on the making of taxable supplies by the disputant trusts. The Authority understood that unless the litigation was resolved, the respective taxable activities of the disputant trusts were likely to collapse or, at least, be affected adversely in terms of good trading relations.

The pro-rating system used by the trustees to allocate legal and other costs to each of the disputant trusts was a reasonable and fair thing to do as all the trusts were embroiled in the breach of trust proceedings.

The legal costs charged to the disputant trusts came essentially from one legal service provider. An analysis of the relevant invoices discloses a range of entirely orthodox and general legal costs associated with a breach of trust proceedings.

There is no question that the legal costs incurred in the relevant GST periods related to the defence of the breach of trust proceedings. That is to do with management of the trust and its activity.

Evidence confirmed that claims arising from the breach of trust proceedings against the disputant trusts were designed to protect the income-earning capacity of the disputant trusts, and to protect their capital. The trustees of the family trusts affected by the breach of trust proceedings had to defend allegations of a breach of trust against them. The trustees would have been in breach of trust in not defending the claims.

It is well-established that where a trustee's conduct in terms of a trust is challenged by beneficiaries alleging breach of trust and the trustee incurs legal cost in defending those allegations, the incurring of those costs is a normal incident of the administration of the trust.

If GST input tax is not allowed to each of the trusts as GST-registered persons, they will effectively be consumers for GST purposes, and would bear the actual GST cost charged to them by legal service providers. That seems contrary to the scheme and purpose of the Act. Even if either trust never made a taxable output again, the GST charged to it should be an input because, until the trust exits the GST tax-base, any inability to recover the GST charged to it will always leave it in a position of economic loss. That would not fairly reflect the value-added position of that trust in carrying on a taxable activity.

_Are the tax invoices adequate?_

The Authority has considered that on a sensible commercial practice basis, the invoices for legal services held by the trusts in the relevant GST periods satisfied all the necessary statutory requirements to support the deductions of GST input tax in terms of section 20(2) of the GST Act. The relevant invoices from the main legal service provider and other services providers constituted tax invoices for the purposes of section 24(3) of the GST Act. Consequently even in the absence of a valid tax invoice, it would be impractical in a dispute of this type to require anything more.

### Conclusion

*   The Authority understood the Commissioner acted incorrectly in disallowing the GST input tax claimed by the disputant trusts on the legal services charged to them in the particular GST periods;
*   that the disputant trusts acquired legal services for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies;
*   that the invoices held by the disputant trusts, in respect of the disallowed legal and other services provided to them, constitute valid tax invoices allowing a deduction of GST input tax under section 20(3)(a) of the GST Act.

TRA clarifies scope of "control by any other means whatsoever" associated persons test
======================================================================================

2013 case note – Taxation Review Authority clarifies scope of 'control by any other means whatsoever' associated persons test.

Case

TRA 021/12; \[2013\] NZTRA 11

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") found that because two companies, the disputant and Company O were "associated persons" under section 2A(1)(a)(iii) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("GST Act"), the disputant was not entitled to claim the entire goods and services tax ("GST") component of the purchase price of the property purchased from Company O. The GST input credits available to the disputant were instead limited to the GST component of the significantly lower purchase price Company O had originally paid for the property.

### Impact of decision

The TRA has clarified the interpretation of section 2A(1)(a)(iii) of the GST Act, finding that it was intending to operate as a "catch all" provision covering the association of companies by control, not specifically covered by the tests under subparagraphs 2A(1)(a)(i) and (ii).

### Facts

Mr A is the sole director of both the disputant company and Company O. The disputant company is wholly owned by Company W, of which Mr A is the sole director and shareholder. Company O is wholly owned by Company F, which is in turn wholly owned by Mr A. Company F holds 75% of the shares in Company O for the benefit of the LM Trust and the remaining 25% of the shares for the benefit of Mr A.

In October 2004, Company F (or nominee) purchased a property ("the Property") for a total purchase price of $847,000. This included a GST component of $94,111.12. Company F then nominated Company O as purchaser. Company O then began to develop the Property into an apartment block complex.

In July 2008, Company O and the disputant company entered into a sale and purchase agreement for the Property. Mr A signed the agreement on behalf of both companies. The purchase price including GST was $8,034,750, which was to be paid in 18 instalments by book entry to Company O. The disputant company claimed GST input credits in respect of those 17 instalments, paid in the GST periods between July 2008 and October 2009.

### Decision

Sinclair J began by noting that the disputant and Company O were not "associated" companies under section 2A(1)(a)(i) or the test under section 2A(1)(a)(ii) of the GST Act. The focus of the case would therefore be on section 2A(1)(a)(iii). Section 2A(1)(a)(iii) states that two companies are "associated persons" for the purposes of the GST Act if, amongst other things, a group of persons has "control of each of those companies by any other means whatsoever". In essence, Sinclair J found that section 2A(1)(a)(iii) was sufficiently broad to apply in the present case, and held that both the disputant and Company O were controlled by Mr A and that the two companies were "associated persons" under section 2A(1)(a)(iii).

In considering the purpose of section 2A(1)(a)(iii), Her Honour referred to the Inland Revenue Department Commentary on Taxation (Annual Rates, GST, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill \[Wellington: Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue Department, May 2000\] which summarised the amendments concerning input tax deductions for second-hand goods:

*   The amendment limits the credit available in relation to supplies of second-hand goods between associated parties to the GST component (if any) of the purchase price to the vendor to remove the incentive to enter into transactions primarily to gain the input tax credit.

Sinclair J then considered the meaning of "control", as it appears in section 2A(1)(a)(iii). Her Honour accepted the Commissioner's submission that "control" has predominantly been held to mean legal control and found that Mr A did have legal control of each of the companies through voting interests. Sinclair J noted that section 2A(1)(a)(iii) was also wide enough to include other forms of control.

The TRA referred to _IRC v Bibby and Sons Limited_ \[1945\] 1 All E R 667 (HL), which held that the fact a shareholder was a trustee was not a relevant consideration when determining legal control. In the present case, Sinclair J did not find the existence of the LM Trust to be a matter to be taken into account under subparagraph (iii). Her Honour went on to find that the phrase "by any other means whatsoever" suggested that subparagraph 2A(1)(a)(iii) had a broad effect and operated as a "catch all" provision, covering the association of companies by control not specifically covered by the tests under subparagraphs 2A(1)(a)(i) and (ii).

The disputant argued that the word "other" in the phrase "by any other means whatsoever" suggested that control must be by means other than those identified in subparagraphs 2A(1)(a)(i) and (ii). Her Honour held that the word "other" did not restrict the ability to consider voting interests under subparagraph 2A(1)(a)(iii) where the test set out in subparagraph 2A(1)(a)(i) did not apply. Sinclair J held that control via a corporate trustee comes within subparagraph 2A(1)(a)(iii) as it must be "by other means".

Sinclair J accepted the Commissioner's submission that there was no policy reason to exclude control by voting interests under subparagraph 2A(1)(a)(iii) and stated that it would be against the intention of the legislature to adopt the disputant's interpretation of section 2A(1)(a)(iii), because to do so would have the effect of limiting the application of subparagraph 2A(1)(a)(iii). Sinclair J rejected the disputant's argument that the use of the word "each" in section 2A(1)(a)(iii) suggested that the same means of control had to apply to each company. Her Honour disagreed and held the phrase "by any other means whatsoever" had a wide effect and included more than one or different means.

In addition, the Commissioner, relying upon the decision of _RWR v AJR \[Trusts\]_ \[2010\] NZFLR 82 (HC), found that Mr A had control of Company O because he had control over the LM Trust. In opposition, the disputant submitted that the fact that Mr A had power of appointment did not mean that he had control of the corporate trustee. Sinclair J did not find it necessary to consider this point as she already found that Mr A had legal control of Company O and the issues in _RWR v AJR \[Trusts\]_ were not relevant.

Accordingly, the TRA confirmed the Commissioner's assessment and ruled that the disputant company was only entitled to an input tax deduction of $94,111.12, being the GST component of the purchase price Company O originally paid for the Property.

TRA considers it has no jurisdiction to consider GST periods
============================================================

2015 case note - TRA held that only three goods and services tax periods were properly before, and it had no jurisdiction to consider the periods.

Case

\[2015\] NZTRA 06; TRA 028/08

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") held that only three goods and services tax ("GST") periods were properly before it.

### Facts

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") deregistered the objector for GST effective from 31 August 1995, and reassessed the objector for the three six-month periods prior to the date of deregistration.

The objector lodged objections that were determined against it in 2008, and the Points of Objection Notice was subsequently served on the Commissioner. The Points of Objection Notice was served out of time, however Judge Barber found extraordinary circumstances and granted an extension for its filing.

The objector argued that five earlier tax periods, namely income tax for 1984 to 1995 (inclusive) and GST from 1 September 1986 to 31 August 1995 (inclusive), were also before the TRA in this proceeding.

The objector contended that its notice of objection to five of the GST periods (the disputed periods) was never disallowed. The Commissioner argued that four of the objections were made within time and disallowed in October 1986, and no request was received for a case to be stated within the requisite time period. As to the period ended 28 February 1990, the Commissioner argued this period was never reassessed and so could not be objected to.

With regards to the remaining GST and income tax periods, the objector contended these were before the TRA because the TRA had all the powers of the Commissioner in regards to assessments. The Commissioner argued the TRA only had jurisdiction where the relevant procedural provisions had been complied with, and this had not occurred.

### Decision

#### _Disputed GST periods_

The TRA accepted that the Commissioner reassessed the disputed GST periods and sent the objector notices of assessment. The objector wrote to the Commissioner acknowledging receipt of a "Notice of Assessment – Statement of Account" and gave notice of objection to the reassessments. The Commissioner argued these objections were subsequently disallowed and that the manager of the Tax Avoidance Unit wrote to the director of the objector ("the Director") on 30 October 1996 ("the Letter") advising of this and setting out the procedure if the objector wished to pursue its objections. No request was received from the objector for a case to be stated within the statutory period.

The Director deposed that the Letter was not received by the objector. The tax agent's evidence was that if the Letter had been received, a request would have been made for a case to be stated.

In early 2006, an Inland Revenue investigator started an investigation and on 10 April 2006 wrote to the Director advising of the status of the disputed GST periods, among other matters. The investigator later spoke with the Director, and sent a further letter dated 8 December 2006 enclosing copies of the letters of disallowance and advising that, as no case had been stated, the assessments for the disputed GST periods were confirmed and payment was overdue. No reply was received, and the investigator wrote to the Director again on 7 December 2007, enclosing a copy of the 8 December 2006 letter.

The TRA found the onus was on the objector to prove on the balance of probabilities that it did not receive the Letter. On the evidence, the TRA found on the balance of probabilities that the Letter was not received.

Despite the Commissioner having a copy of the Letter on file with a document log number assigned, there was no evidence of postage. The Commissioner could not therefore avail herself of the deemed receipt by post provision.

The TRA found there was no reason to disbelieve the Director's evidence regarding receipt of the Letter. The absence of a response by the objector to the investigator's 2006 letter denying receipt of the Letter was not of evidential value, especially given the 10-year gap. The Director's request for copies of the "letters of disallowance of objections" referred to in the letter of 10 April 2006 was consistent with the Letter not being received.

The Director's evidence that a Points of Objection Notice would have been issued if the Letter had been received was considered important, as such an approach was consistent with that taken by the objector to maintain its objection in respect of the GST deregistration and associated GST periods.

The TRA did not accept that even if the Letter was not received, notice was given in the Commissioner's later letters of 10 April 2006, 8 December 2006 and 7 December 2007, and subsequent correspondence. These letters were not held to be notification for the purposes of the relevant legislation.

However, the TRA disagreed with the objector's contention that the disputed GST periods were properly before the TRA, as the TRA had no jurisdiction where, as in this case, the objection procedure had not been properly completed.

#### _All remaining GST periods and income tax years_

The Director contended the Commissioner could and should have reassessed all the periods listed in the Points of Objection Notice before now, and that the TRA had the authority and duty to do so. Further, the Director contended the TRA had the authority to consider additional periods as the necessary procedural steps had been fulfilled "as best they can be by the objector in view of all the circumstances".

The TRA found the objection procedure had not been completed for the remaining GST periods and income tax years. As such, the objections in relation to these periods were not before the TRA and there was no jurisdiction to hear such matters.

The TRA also noted that a similar matter is currently back before the Commissioner for her reconsideration, following an order from Ellis J in the High Court. Leave was reserved in that case to bring the matter back before the High Court if progress was not made.

TRA considers residency of individuals
======================================

2017 case note - TRA considered the disputant had a permanent place of abode in NZ in the years in dispute – Diamond, residence, foreign investment fund.

Case

### **Summary**

This is the first case involving an individual’s residence status since the Court of Appeal's decision in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ v _Diamond_ \[2015\] NZCA 613 (“_Diamond_”). The Taxation Review Authority ("the Authority"), applying _Diamond_, considered that the disputant, a professional mariner, had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand in the years in dispute.

### **Facts**

The disputant was born in New Zealand. His parents emigrated from Europe and the disputant holds a New Zealand passport as well as one from his parents' homeland.

In the mid-1960s the disputant and his family went back to his parents' homeland where they lived for about 18 months before returning to New Zealand. Upon leaving school, the disputant joined the merchant navy. Since that time he has been employed in various roles by the same shipping company. In 1980 the disputant was married in Asia. He and his wife had a son and the disputant adopted his wife's two daughters from a previous relationship. In late 1987 the family moved to New Zealand.

In 1995, the disputant and his wife separated. The matrimonial home was transferred to his wife and the disputant purchased a unit so that he had somewhere to stay on visits to New Zealand to see his son who was then at secondary school.

In 1998 the disputant met and married his present wife. His wife lived at 27 Brown Road which had previously been transferred to her as a part of a matrimonial property settlement. In 1997 she established a family trust ("Trust") and 27 Brown Road was transferred to her and her solicitor as trustees of that Trust. The disputant became trustee and beneficiary of the Trust in 1999.

In 2000 the disputant's wife began to accompany the disputant on his voyages at sea. Customs records showed that in the 2001 to 2004 tax years, he spent on average 3.5 months in New Zealand during which time he stayed at 27 Brown Road.

The disputant and his wife formed a partnership which eventually owned four rental properties. In February 2004 these properties were sold to the Trust together with furniture and other items owned by the disputant.

The disputant transferred funds to New Zealand to meet the Trust's outgoings and other expenses by transferring a portion of his US dollar salary into his Hong Kong dollar account with a "salary" notation. These funds were then transmitted from this account to the Trust’s bank account in New Zealand.

In 2006, the Trust purchased 29 Brown Road. This property was tenanted until June 2009. This house was then demolished and a new home was built and completed in mid-2010. Around this time, 27 Brown Road was tenanted and the disputant and his wife moved into 29 Brown Road. 27 Brown Road was eventually sold in October 2014.

The disputant had previously filed New Zealand income tax returns returning his salary. However, for the income years ended 31 March 2005 and 31 March 2006 the disputant filed nil income tax returns. In the year ended 31 March 2007 he filed a non-resident tax return disclosing a small loss for the year and in the years ended 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2009 he filed non-resident tax returns.

In the tax years in dispute, the disputant also had foreign investment fund (FIF) interests. In particular, the disputant was and continues to be a member of his employer’s superannuation scheme which is funded by contribution from his employer.

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“"he Commissioner") assessed on the basis that the taxpayer was a New Zealand resident for tax purposes and therefore was liable for income tax. The taxpayer disputed those assessments.

### **Decision**

The Authority dismissed the disputant's challenge.

_**Permanent place of abode**_

The Authority confirmed that the test in _Diamond_ (_Diamond_ at \[49\]) was relevant and noted that the factors referred to by the Court of Appeal were not intended to be exclusive. Some factors may be more applicable than others, and what is required is an integrated and factual assessment in determining the nature and quality of the use the taxpayer habitually makes of a particular abode.

The Authority agreed with the Commissioner’s approach in examining these factors and adopted that analysis.

In summary the disputant despite his extended periods at sea was found to have maintained an on-going and close association with 27 Brown Road over many years.

His salary was used to meet the Trust’s loan obligations, pay insurances, utilities and other expenses. Vehicles belonging to the disputant, his wife and the Trust were registered to 27 Brown Road and he maintained SKY subscription for use when at the property. This address was used by the disputant for mail including mail related to the Trust’s rental properties. The disputant’s payslips were also addressed to 27 Brown Road when he was not at sea. The disputant was also registered on the Electoral Roll at this address in 2008. Credit card expenses in periods when the disputant resided at 27 Brown Road for everyday purchases were consistent with being resident at that location.

27 Brown Road was largely available for the disputant’s use apart from one occasion in 2004 when the disputant and his wife did not return to New Zealand for a lengthy period. During this time there was a house sitter who paid a peppercorn rental. Otherwise the property was not rented and friends and family stayed at the property on occasion. Apart from their absence in 2004 the Authority found that there was no particular change in pattern of usage of the property over this period.

_**FIF income**_

The disputant contended that the cost of his FIF investments did not exceed the statutory de minimis because his employer incurred the costs in relation to the superannuation scheme. The Authority considered that the de minimis exception was not restricted to cost or expenditure incurred by the person (or by the party acting as agent for that person) and that contributions made by the disputant’s employer to the superannuation fund on his behalf were intended to be included within this definition. The Authority noted that on the disputant’s interpretation a taxpayer could avoid the application of the FIF rules so that contributions made by an agent of the taxpayer had no cost is artificial and contrived as these clearly formed a part of his salary package.

_**Timebar/process issues**_

Having found the disputant to be a New Zealand resident for tax purposes in the tax years in dispute, it followed that the disputant had failed to disclose income and therefore grounds existed under s 108 (2)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") for the Commissioner to amend the time-barred assessments.

The Authority was satisfied that the requisite opinion had been formed under s 108(2) and that it is not necessary that the same person that holds the requisite opinion makes the amended assessments. Following the decision in _Edwards v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2016\] NZHC 1795, Judge Sinclair was satisfied that even if there was any invalidity in the forming of that opinion and/or in the process of exercising the power to amend the assessments under this subsection (which she did not accept), she considered that such matters are “cured” by the de novo hearing before the Authority who must reach its own conclusion.

_**Shortfall penalties**_

In weighing up all relevant factors, the Authority found that the disputant, having failed to meet the standard of being "about as likely as not to be correct", was liable for shortfall penalties under s 141B of the TAA for taking an unacceptable tax position in relation to the years in dispute (reduced by 50% for previous behaviour under s 141FB).

TRA finds in favour of taxpayer - no tax avoidance
==================================================

2010 case note – no tax avoidance in relation to sale of a property - reversion, prepayment of rent.

Case

TRA Decision 02/2010

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

The TRA found that the sale of a property on revenue account from a development company to a family trust where it was held on capital account and subject to a prepaid lease was not a tax avoidance arrangement.

### Impact of decision

The decision accepts that a sale price for the reversion of less than a fair value could be a pointer to tax avoidance \[paragraph 172\].

In this case the notion that the valuation of a property must be at market value when between related parties was not in dispute.

It was considered that there was nothing artificial or contrived about the dispositions of property from company to family trust.

### Facts

A property development company purchased a luxury lodge, it is accepted by all that this was held on revenue account. Mr T was one of two shareholders of the company, as well as one of three directors.

A separate company was later incorporated to run the business at the luxury lodge.

The development company then granted the separate company a lease for 10 years.

This lease was pre-paid by the separate company partly by a loan from the development company.

Later the development company sold the property to a family trust (the disputant) of which Mr T was settlor. Remembering the lease had been prepaid for 10 years, the family trust had really acquired a right of reversion ("the reversion") once the lease expired.

Ultimately, the trust sold the luxury lodge to a foreign company.

### Decision

Judge Barber in making his decision quoted the Supreme Court in _Ben Nevis_ that the:

*   ultimate question is whether the impugned arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, makes use of the specific provision in a manner that is inconsistent with Parliament's purpose. \[paragraph 186\].

In Judge Barber's opinion, on the particular facts of this case there was no tax avoidance arrangement with regard to income tax \[paragraph 176\] or goods and services tax ("GST") \[paragraph 177\].

He accepted the disputant's arguments regarding each property transfer:

1.  The property was bought on revenue account by a developer.
2.  Upgrade costs ran significantly higher than expected.
3.  The Trust rightly acquired the property on Capital account.
4.  The Trust was entitled to deregister for GST \[paragraph 174\].
5.  The Lease was not for dominant purpose of tax avoidance - it was to give Mr T and his family a suitable structure with which to renovate and operate a viable business \[paragraph 178\].
6.  Any concerns over the fixing of rent under the lease, the arithmetic regarding prepayment of rent, and the calculation of the value of the reversion are not to be treated "in this particular case" as tax avoidance - rather as matters requiring revaluation for the purposes of gift duty or dividends or such like \[paragraph 178\].

Accordingly, his Honour held that the income tax and GST assessments must be cancelled.

Paragraph 194 gives Judge Barber's general view:

*   As a general comment, Mr T simply organised a sensible purchase of an historic property and renovated it on revenue account through his development company. The renovations probably led to overcapitalisation because they were so well done. He then transferred the property to his family trust, which he controlled, and the trust acquired the property on capital account as is usual. There is no suggestion that the property was not alienated from development company to family trust, or that the structure was a sham, or that Mr T was the alter ego of the entities involved; although the situation must have been approaching that.

TRA has jurisdiction to substitute an assessment
================================================

2008 case note – TRA has jurisdiction to substitute an available assessment where the original assessment of the CIR is not upheld - onus of proof, resource consent.

Case

Beckham v CIR

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Taxation Review Authority has jurisdiction to substitute an available assessment where the original assessment of the Commissioner is not upheld.

### Facts

In 1992 and 1993 the appellant purchased two adjoining farms at Midgley Road, Mangonui in Northland for a combined price of $444,525.66. The total property, comprising some 375 hectares, was run as a beef cattle unit.

In February 1998 the appellant entered into a conditional agreement to sell the property to a developer, Stargate Holdings Ltd, for $2.1 million plus GST. Stargate intended to subdivide and develop the property into olive groves and on 14 July 1998 obtained resource consent from Far North District Council to do so. Stargate failed to perform its obligations under the contract and in October 1999 the appellant elected to cancel the contract.

On 8 February 2000, the appellant incorporated a company, Ocean View Olives Ltd (OVO), of which he was the sole shareholder and director. On 5 April 2000 he entered into a sale and purchase agreement to sell his Midgley Road property to OVO for $1.6m plus Goods and Services Tax (GST).

On 30 March 2001, the appellant filed an income tax return for the year ended 31March 2000. He did not include as a revenue item the proceeds of sale of the farm to OVO, which he showed as a capital transaction.

On 24 June 2002 the Commissioner issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA), showing the transaction as falling within paragraph (f) of section CD 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 ("ITA94"). The appellant gave notice of response challenging the NOPA, which in turn led to the Commissioner issuing a disclosure notice in respect of the NOPA and a statement of position, to which the appellant issued his competing statement of position. The matter was referred to the Adjudication Unit of the Inland Revenue Department, which led to a Notice of Final Determination which confirmed the Commissioner's view that section CD 1(2) (f) of the ITA94 applied, but which also asserted that had section CD 1(2)(f) not applied, the sale of land would have been gross income under section CD 1(2)(e)(iii)(C) (subject to certain deductions allowable under section DJ 14).

The appellant filed a notice of claim in the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) challenging the assessment, contending that the sale proceeds were not taxable under paragraph (f) and further asserting that paragraph (e) had no application.

The Commissioner's notice of defence sought to uphold the assessment under paragraph (f) but also pleaded in the alternative that in the event that paragraph (f) did not apply, the sale was gross income pursuant to paragraph (e).

The TRA upheld the appellant's contention that the proceeds of sale were not taxable under paragraph (f) but determined that they were taxable under paragraph (e). The TRA indicated that it was prepared to make an assessment in favour of the Commissioner but withheld doing so, reserving leave to the appellant to make further submissions if he so wished.

The appellant did not do so, electing to appeal the TRA's decision to the High Court. The TRA then issued a final decision on the matter, which was also appealed.

In the High Court, the appeals were consolidated and dismissed by Frater J (_Beckham v CIR_ (2007) 23 NZTC 21,499). The appellant then appealed to the Court of Appeal.

### Decision

The appeal was dismissed.  
Held:

1.  The jurisdiction challenge was inconsistent with section 16 of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994, section 138P of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the decision in _Zentrum Holdings Ltd v CIR_ \[2007\] 1 NZLR 145. The TRA clearly had jurisdiction to substitute an assessment under paragraph (e), albeit for a lesser amount than the Commissioner's original assessment.
2.  The Commissioner was not required to calculate explicitly a particular threshold amount. Even if he had it would have made no difference to the outcome.
3.  As to the second point, the short answer to the appellant's submissions is that paragraph (e) does tax potential value if that highest and best use derives from potential or _a fortiori_, actual resource consent. And the evidence supporting the assessment was overwhelming.
4.  Further the Commissioner's submission that by section 149A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 the onus of proof lay on the taxpayer was noted, and the Court found the submission that there was a potential value above $740,000 aside from the likelihood of resource consent was without evidential support. The appellant would have had to show that the land had a pre-consent value of $1,369,105 in order to fall outside of paragraph (e), and that was plainly untenable.

TRA's alternative assessment upheld
===================================

2007 case note - TRA upheld the taxpayer's challenge to the CIR's assessment but then assessed an alternative ground. The High Court dismissed the taxpayer's appeal.

Case

Max Beckham v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

The TRA upheld the taxpayer's challenge to the Commissioner's assessment but then assessed an alternative ground. The High Court dismissed the taxpayer's appeal against the TRA's decision.

### Fact

This is a consolidated appeal from two decisions of the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") concerning the taxpayer's liability to pay income tax on the proceeds of sale of farmland. The decision was deferred pending the final outcome of _Zentrum Holdings Ltd v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ as it was relied on by the taxpayer. (On 23 May 2006 the Court of Appeal released its judgment in _Zentrum Holdings Ltd_ allowing the Commissioner's appeal. In September 2006 the Supreme Court granted the taxpayer leave to appeal, but in the event that appeal was abandoned and the parties accepted that the High Court was bound by the Court of Appeal's judgment.)

The taxpayer was a farmer who sold farmland to a company of which he was the sole shareholder and director for the purpose of subdivision. He did not declare the sale receipt for income tax purposes.

The Commissioner assessed the taxpayer's liability to pay tax under section CD1(2)(f) of the Income Tax Act 1994. He contended that the taxpayer was party to an undertaking or scheme for the sale and subdivision of the land and that the work done on the land was of more than a minor nature and was carried out within ten years of the date of acquisition of the property: section CD1(2)(f), and, in the alternative, that the taxpayer was assessable on the profit on the sale, as at least 20% of the profit was due to resource consent being granted: section CD1(2)(e).

The taxpayer challenged the assessment to the TRA. In a decision dated 19 July 2005 the TRA upheld the challenge, concluding that the taxpayer was not the developer of the subdivision. However the TRA decided that the evidence established that the granting of resource consent resulted in an increase in value of the property by at least 20%, which meant the Commissioner could assess the taxpayer under the alternative ground of section CD1(2)(e). The TRA reasoned that as the Commissioner had the power to do so, so did he, and it was not necessary to refer the matter back for reassessment under the alternative provision. The TRA gave the taxpayer leave to call further evidence or make further submissions.

The taxpayer appealed and the Commissioner cross‑appealed. The TRA then issued a "final decision" endorsing the earlier decision and assessing the taxpayer's tax liability.

### Decision

In relation to the first issue the taxpayer argued that the challenge considered by the TRA related only to the validity of the assessment under section CD 1(2)(f), and that once that challenge was determined the TRA's role and jurisdiction came to an end. There was no basis to reassess under a different section. He relied on the HighCourt decision in _Zentrum Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ in which the Commissioner was prohibited from arguing on appeal a ground that was not the ground of assessment. That decision was overturned by the Court of Appeal.

The Commissioner argued that the TRA was correct in holding that section CD 1(2)(e) had been raised in the challenge and that the Commissioner was not precluded from relying on it. That provision was raised in both the Commissioner's and the taxpayer's statements of position, as well as in the taxpayer's notice of claim to the TRA and the Commissioner's notice of defence. The taxpayer contended that these references merely provided background material. The assessment was made under section CD1(2)(f), but the Adjudication Unit's Notice of Final Determination stated that "had section CD1(2)(f) not applied, the amount Mr Beckham derived from the sale of the land would have been gross income under section CD 1(2)(e) ...."

The High Court rejected the taxpayer's arguments. FraterJ held that where a disclosure notice is issued and the taxpayer subsequently challenges the assessment, the matters in issue are limited to the legal and factual issues identified in the statements of position, but all of those issues are legitimate matters of dispute in the challenge proceedings. The alternative ground of assessment was clearly foreshadowed in the communications between the parties and there was no procedural impropriety or unfairness involved in applying it.

Given the decision that the TRA had jurisdiction to consider the alternative ground, it followed that it also had the power, like the Commissioner, to reassess the quantum of tax payable under that ground. The Court rejected the taxpayer's argument that the issues were fully determined at the point where the challenge to the first assessment was upheld. It followed that the September decision constitutes the final determination of issues by the TRA and any right of appeal must be from that decision.

In relation to the merits of the substantive assessment, the High Court held that, on the evidence, it was open to the TRA to hold that at least 20% of the difference between the value of the land as a farm and the sale price was attributable to the resource consent.

TRA strikes out taxpayer's late claim
=====================================

2016 case note – CIR's application to strike out proceedings granted by Taxation Review Authority – late claim, exceptional circumstances.

Case

TRA 029/15 \[2016\] NZTRA 05

Legislative References

Rule 15 District Court Rules 2014 and Part 8A Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") applied to strike out the disputant's belatedly filed notice of claim. The disputant filed a response which the Taxation Review Authority ("the TRA") accepted as an application to allow proceedings to be commenced out of time. The TRA determined (on the papers) that there were no exceptional circumstances, consequently dismissing the disputant's application, and granted the Commissioner's application to strike out the proceedings.

### Impact

The decision reinforces the importance of complying with the strict procedures for the commencement of challenge proceedings in the TRA as outlined in the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").

### Facts

The disputant owns a residential property and claimed rental losses in relation to the property in the 2006, 2007 and 2009 to 2012 income years.

The Commissioner made reassessments for the 2009 to 2012 income years after two separate audits of the disputant's income tax returns.

The disputant served a Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") on the Commissioner on or about 12 November 2014 seeking an adjustment of $18,087. The NOPA was rejected by the Commissioner and the Disputes Review Unit subsequently decided that the adjustment proposed by the disputant should not be made.

The Notice of Final Decision dated 30 June 2015 and a copy of the adjudication report were sent to the disputant including information regarding the specific procedure to be followed if the disputant wished to challenge the assessment.

The investigator responsible for the audits of the disputant's tax returns (‘Ms A') spoke with the disputant on several occasions in August 2015 regarding bringing challenge proceedings and the procedure to do so.

Ms A received a handwritten document on 27 August 2015 from the disputant titled "Notice of Claim" which had been sent to the Commissioner's office in Wellington. Ms A subsequently followed up with the disputant reminding her of the procedure to bring a challenge and the dates by which to do so.

On 8 September 2015, Ms A received a second document purporting to be the disputant's notice of claim. Ms A then contacted the Litigation Management Unit ("LMU") which confirmed the document had not been filed in the TRA as required.

Mr X, a solicitor with LMU, contacted the disputant by phone and email on 9 September 2015 regarding the procedure and timeline for commencing a challenge in the TRA. He spoke to the disputant again on 18 September 2015 and recommended that she file a notice of claim as soon as possible.

On 24 September 2015, the disputant filed a notice of claim with the TRA.

The Commissioner applied to strike-out the disputant's challenge proceedings on the grounds that the proceedings were filed out of time and no application had been made for an extension of time.

The disputant filed a response which the TRA accepted as an application to allow proceedings to be commenced out of time under s 138D of the TAA. Additionally, the disputant was given further opportunity to file affidavit evidence in response to the Commissioner's application, as well as being urged by the TRA to seek legal advice.

### Decision

The TRA was satisfied that the disputant's failure to file her challenge within the required time period in accordance with s 138B(3)(c) of the TAA came about because the disputant did not follow the procedure for bringing a challenge and not because of any event or circumstance which was beyond her control.

Therefore the TRA concluded that no exceptional circumstances existed and accordingly dismissed the disputant's application to allow the challenge proceedings to be commenced out of time.

Having decided that the disputant had failed to comply with s 138B of the TAA, the TRA applied the decision in _Allen v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (\[2006\] 3 NZLR 1, (2005) 22 NZTC 19,473 (CA) at \[41\]) and concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the claim and that it must strike out the challenge proceedings under s 138H of the TAA.

TRA upholds Commissioner's reassessments for undisclosed income
===============================================================

2017 case note – Taxation Review Authority upholds CIR's reassessments - undisclosed income, asset accretion method, credibility.

Case

TRA 023/15 \[2017\] NZTRA 02

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994: ss 141C and 149A

### **Summary**

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) reassessed the taxpayer for undisclosed income and imposed gross carelessness shortfall penalties. The taxpayer challenged the reassessments claiming that the money had come from various sources, including the sale of gold Krugerrand coins and an interest free loan from her uncle in China. The Taxation Review Authority (“the Authority”) found the taxpayer's explanations to not be credible, and consequently upheld the Commissioner's reassessments.

### **Impact**

The decision reiterates the fundamental principles applying to the Commissioner when making amended assessments, and is an example of the appropriate use of the asset accretion method.

### **Facts**

The Commissioner reassessed the disputant for undisclosed income in the tax years ended 31 March 2005 to 31 March 2011, and imposed shortfall penalties for gross carelessness or in the alternative, for failing to take reasonable care. The disputant challenged the reassessments and imposition of shortfall penalties.

The disputant first came to the Commissioner’s attention during an audit of the X Restaurant (“the restaurant”). The disputant had been employed at the restaurant as a waitress and at times, acting manager since 1996. As part of the restaurant’s audit, the Commissioner checked bank statements of a small sample of its employees including the disputant’s. The bank statements of the disputant recorded a high frequency of large deposits and withdrawals over a number of years. Notably, a substantial number of the deposits were made in cash, and in 2008, the disputant had purchased a house mortgage free for $405,000.

On 1 February 2012, the disputant filed income tax returns for the 2000 to 2011 tax years. The returns disclosed that the disputant had earned income from the following sources: (a) wages from the restaurant; (b) interest on her New Zealand bank accounts and term deposits; and (c) overseas income consisting of interest earned on a bank account in Australia. Following receipt of these tax returns, the Commissioner commenced an audit into the disputant’s tax affairs.

The disputant claimed that her money had come from several sources (apart from the income which she had declared) including: (1) the sale of gold Krugerrands coins which had been given to the disputant by her grandparents in China; and (2) an interest free loan of NZ$286,000 from her uncle in China. The disputant also alleged that the funds deposited in her Australian account and on which she had declared the interest earned, were funds belonging to her parents.

The Commissioner maintained that the disputant’s explanations for her increase in assets were not credible, and accordingly reassessed the disputant for undisclosed income.

### **Decision**

_Sale of Krugerrands_

The disputant claimed that she had been gifted a number of gold Krugerrand coins, which she had brought to New Zealand and sold. During cross-examination the disputant changed her evidence as to when she brought the coins to New Zealand. The disputant told the Authority that she sold the coins to tourists dining at the restaurant. The amounts she said were paid for the coins greatly exceeded the spot price of gold in the period (expert evidence was provided by a gold trader and investor).

The Authority held that overall it did not find the disputant to be a reliable or credible witness and held her answers to be often vague and inconsistent.

The Authority found it was implausible that over a period of six years, the disputant had sold 73 Krugerrands to Asian tourists at the restaurant for sums very considerably above the spot price of gold at the time.

Accordingly, the Authority did not accept the disputant’s explanation that one of the sources of her money was the sale of Krugerrands at the restaurant.

_Loan from Uncle_

The disputant gave evidence that in 1999 on a visit back to China she and her uncle Mr SP entered into an agreement for an interest free loan of RMB1,250,000 (“the Loan Agreement”). The Loan Agreement provided for the money to be used by the disputant to purchase a house, and the disputant gave evidence that this house was to be used by Mr SP’s children when they came to New Zealand to study. Under the Loan Agreement the disputant was to pay the children’s education and living expenses and deduct these sums from the loan amount.

Mr SP gave evidence by video link from China. Under cross-examination Mr SP initially conceded that the Loan Agreement was not signed in 1999 and volunteered that it had been signed “just because of the tax department matter”. However, following further questioning he changed his evidence to say that he could not remember when it was signed. The Authority held it was satisfied the Loan Agreement was prepared and signed after the Inland Revenue investigation commenced.

Overall, the Authority found the evidence of both the disputant and her uncle to be unconvincing. The Authority noted that it was plain the disputant had received large amounts of money over the years and the onus was on her to satisfy the Authority as to its source. The Authority was not satisfied that there was a loan agreement between the disputant and her uncle, and accordingly did not accept the disputant’s explanation that a source of her funds was money advanced under this alleged agreement.

_Australian Bank Account_

Evidence was given by the disputant and her father Mr XD in relation to the money in the disputant’s Australian bank account. The disputant contended that the funds paid into the account belonged to her elderly parents.

The disputant told the Authority that when her parents first moved to Australia they would withdraw their pension payments, and keep the money at home as they did not trust banks. On one of the disputant’s visits to Australia it was decided that she would manage her parents’ money; she opened an account in her own name and her parents’ savings were deposited into that account.

The Commissioner produced evidence from the Australian Taxation Office detailing Mr XD and his wife’s pension payments. The received payments differed from those used by Mr XD in his own calculations, and were significantly less than the total amounts deposited into the disputant’s account.

The Authority agreed with the Commissioner that it could properly be inferred that the deposits paid into the account by the disputant on her visits to Sydney were not sourced from her parents’ income and were income of the disputant.

_Reassessments_

The investigator for the Commissioner gave evidence that because it appeared that the disputant’s income and expenses were mostly in cash, she formed the view that the disputant’s income could not be assessed by simply looking at the deposits made into her account. The investigator therefore decided to use the asset accretion method.

The Authority found that, in the circumstances of the case, the Commissioner was justified in reassessing the disputant for undisclosed income using the asset accretion method.

_Shortfall penalties_

The Authority held that any reasonable person in the disputant’s position would have foreseen that their failure to disclose income would create a high risk of a tax shortfall. Accordingly, the Authority held that the imposition of gross carelessness penalties was appropriate.

_Decision_

The Authority upheld the Commissioner’s reassessments and imposition of shortfall penalties for gross carelessness.

[FINAL Programme Business Case Addendum 2021–22](https://www.ird.govt.nz/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/about-us/bt-guide/outcomes/programme-business-case-addendum-2021-22.pdf?modified=20220705225430&modified=20220705225430)

This year, we achieved 7 out of the 10 indicators for which there are quantitative measures. The measures achieved relate to digital uptake, system availability, system resilience, additional Crown revenue and administrative savings.

The measures not achieved were:

*   The 'percentage of customers who find it easy to comply' remained steady at 82% in 2022–23. This measure is proving difficult to shift as it measures customer perceptions of their experience with us. These perceptions are influenced by a number of factors; including the challenges from the adverse weather events and economic environment.
*   Results from our 2021 survey of small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) show the target reduction in compliance effort was not achieved. SMEs reported saving 5 hours compared to a target of 17 hours. The value of the time saved by SMEs was also behind target. It appears that COVID-19 and payday filing had an impact. We continue to focus on designing our services to reduce effort for SMEs. Note: We delayed our survey planned for 2023 to reduce the burden on businesses as they were managing the impact of the adverse weather events. The survey will be run again in 2024.

We recognise that achieving targets in these areas by 2023–24 will be challenging.

The transformation programme closed on 30 June 2022, but we will continue to track and report against its benefit commitments until 2023–24.

3 Achievement of additional Crown revenue is measured through case studies and proxy measures, given the difficulty of direct attribution.

Reduction in the time and cost to implement policy
--------------------------------------------------

Case study – annual changes

Each year, as part of our April 2023 changes, we work on a range of enhancements, policy and remedial changes. Prior to the introduction of our core tax technology system START, the focus was primarily on delivering cyclic changes—our yearly reviews and updates. This includes updating ACC, minimum family tax credit and paid parental leave rates and updating and publishing our student loan repayment thresholds. We also update all relevant calculators and materials for these rate changes. 

Other legislative changes included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 were changes to GST, property rules, our international regime, fringe benefit tax and insurance deductibility. 

The introduction of START and other changes made as a result of our transformation means we are now able to make changes that benefit our customers or improve internal processes at the same time. We now have standard design patterns that allow us to deliver change in a much shorter period of time. We also listen to feedback from our customers as we develop and test improvements, making changes based on their feedback. 

An example of this is the changes made to how errors are corrected on employment information returns. We tested the solution with the Aotearoa New Zealand Digital Advisory Group. Their feedback and revised solution helped make it easier for them to implement the solution. Early engagement and co-design with stakeholders will continue to be a key part of improving our change process.

Case study – Implementing Cost of Living Payments

The Cost of Living Payment Scheme was a new type of payment for New Zealand, and we needed to design system requirements and processes to do it. Although the delivery window was very short, from 11 April when policy and decisions were confirmed to the first payment on 1 August 2022, the time frame was manageable. Cost of Living Payments were delivered on time to the agreed specifications.

Tradies get jail time for hiding income and evading nearly $1 million in tax
============================================================================

**20 February 2018**

Two tradesmen have been given prison sentences this month for each evading nearly $1 million in tax.

Hamilton plasterer Paul Andrew Mills was sentenced on February 9 to two years and one month, while Auckland builder Hamish Paul Aegerter received a sentence of two years and seven months last Friday.

Mills’ was sentenced on 11 tax evasion charges relating to the 2009 to 2017 tax years, while Aegerter’s prosecution was for three representative charges of filing false GST and income tax returns, and failing to file returns.

Inland Revenue Legal Services Leader Karen Whitiskie said Mills hadn’t filed any income tax or GST returns during the nine-year period, and also failed to pass on his employees’ PAYE when he became an employer. In total, he was liable for $996,107 in GST, income tax and PAYE on undeclared earnings of nearly $3 million.

“Mr Mills charged his clients GST but never passed that on to Inland Revenue. He deducted PAYE from his employees but never passed that on either. And he didn’t file an income tax return for nearly a decade,” Ms Whitiskie says.

Aegerter had existed largely outside the tax system for 17 years. When he finally filed some income tax returns, he grossly under-reported his income – for one six-year period he returned income totalling $230,717, but bank records showed he had received $2.5 million.

A wider investigation into Aegerter’s affairs showed he had evaded a total of $879,340 in tax, including failing to pass on $630,682 in GST he’d charged his clients. Bank deposits into company accounts over this period totalled more than $7 million.

“This was a deliberate and calculated abuse of the tax system by these tradesmen. The consequences of their actions were that they deprived other New Zealanders to the tune of just under $2 million in tax revenue. That’s money could have gone towards funding a range of important social services everyone benefits from.

“It is really disappointing these tradesmen thought this behaviour was acceptable.

“We recognise that sometimes businesses will get into difficulties. In such cases, people should come and talk to us and we can discuss their options.”

Te tauhokohoko ā-rawa whiti-rangi Trading in cryptoassets
=========================================================

If you’re in the business of trading (or dealing) in cryptoassets you need to pay income tax on your profits.

Working out if you’re in the business of trading in cryptoassets
----------------------------------------------------------------

Trading (or dealing) involves buying and selling cryptoassets to make a profit.

The main way to tell if you’re in the business of trading in cryptoassets is by looking at:

*   the [frequency of your transactions](/api/glossary/item?id={072CB9C3-0321-447B-BB87-538B83C35889})
    
*   how much time and effort you put into buying, selling or exchanging cryptoassets.

Other things to consider are:

*   the reasons for your transactions
*   whether your activity is organised and systematic
*   how long you hold your cryptoassets
*   the amount you invest.

It’s likely that you’re in the business of trading in cryptoassets if you:

*   have a high number of transactions
*   spend a lot of time and effort managing your cryptoasset portfolio
*   work on your cryptoasset portfolio on a fairly continuous basis.

If you are in the business of trading cryptoassets, your cryptoassets are likely to be [trading stock](/api/glossary/item?id={043388F8-C02F-4070-8DE0-A534FFDE8412})
.

[Cryptoasset businesses](/cryptoassets/business/businesses)

Trading in cryptoassets if you work full-time
---------------------------------------------

If you have a full-time job and spend some of your spare time buying and selling cryptoassets, you’re probably not a trader unless your activity is highly organised and structured.

Even if you’re not a trader, you’ll still need to pay tax on any gains if you bought your cryptoassets for the purpose of selling or exchanging them.

Cryptoassets that are not part of your trading business
-------------------------------------------------------

If you’re a trader you might have some cryptoassets that are separate from your trading business.

If you claim that cryptoassets you sold were not part of your trading business, you will need clear and compelling evidence to show that they were not part of your trading business when you both bought and sold them. 

If you hold cryptoassets that are not part of your trading business, you will still need to pay tax if you:

*   bought those cryptoassets to sell or exchange
*   are carrying on a profit-making scheme.

Wiremu is trading in cryptoassets

For 18 months during 2016 to 2017 Wiremu worked part-time as a taxi driver. During this time, he invested $30,000 in the cryptoasset market.

Wiremu spent between 4 and 5 hours most days checking and studying the market. He used several cryptocurrency exchanges and often made multiple transactions each day. He made significant profits from this activity.

Wiremu was in the business of trading in cryptoassets.

He had a high number of transactions on a fairly continuous basis over a reasonable period of time.

The time and effort he put into buying and selling together with his high profits show his trading activity was fairly organised and systematic.

Mizuki is not trading in cryptoassets

Mizuki has a full-time job as a mechanic and buys $50 worth of Bitcoin every week. They set up an automatic payment to a cryptocurrency exchange and the exchange deposits the Bitcoin into their wallet every week.

Mizuki keeps a casual eye on the market and sometimes buys a little more Bitcoin or some altcoins. Occasionally they sells some of them.

Mizuki is not in the business of trading in cryptoassets. Although they have a reasonably high number of transactions on a continual basis, the time and effort put into buying and selling cryptoassets is not significant, and the amount of money invested is relatively small.

Even though Mizuki is not a trader they will still need to pay tax on any gains if they bought cryptoassets for the purpose of selling or exchanging them.

Trans-Tasman imputation for New Zealand companies
-------------------------------------------------

New Zealand companies can choose to use the Australian franking (or imputation) rules to avoid being taxed twice on some Trans-Tasman investments. If you're considering using the Australian franking system, you should visit the Australian Tax Office (ATO) website.

[Australia's special rules for Trans-Tasman imputation](https://www.ato.gov.au/business/imputation/in-detail/trans-tasman-imputation-special-rules/)

Trans-Tasman imputation for Australian companies
------------------------------------------------

In a similar way, Australian companies can also keep an imputation credit account (ICA) in New Zealand. Companies that do this are called Australian imputation credit account companies. They can pass imputation credits on to their shareholders for New Zealand tax that has been paid.

Australian imputation credit account companies must meet all the New Zealand domestic, administrative and legislative requirements for imputation.

### Who is eligible

Australian companies and unit trusts can choose to keep a New Zealand imputation credit account if they:

*   are ‘resident in Australia’, according to the New Zealand residence rules but in regards to Australia
*   are not treated under a double taxation agreement as a resident in a country other than Australia or New Zealand
*   meet the New Zealand eligibility criteria for keeping an imputation credit account (except residency).

If the company is part of a [wholly owned](/api/glossary/item?id={0D199BE9-BE71-40C4-95FC-9DC483D2F3CD})
 group, all the companies in this group will be jointly liable for any further income tax, penalties and interest incurred.

From 15 March 2017 a New Zealand resident company automatically (without the need for an election) becomes an Australian ICA company when its residence tie-breaks to Australia under the Australia/New Zealand double tax agreement (the DTA).    
  
Any accumulated imputation credits up until the point of becoming an Australian ICA company are retained.  

### How to make an election

An Australian company must elect to maintain an imputation credit account in New Zealand at least 30 days before it pays a dividend that includes a New Zealand imputation credit. For all other purposes, this choice is backdated to the beginning of the tax year.

Australian companies that want to keep a New Zealand imputation credit account can register online through myIR, or complete a Trans-Tasman imputation election form - IR488.

If the Australian company is not already a New Zealand taxpayer, we'll issue an IRD number so they can keep the imputation credit account.

A New Zealand resident company that automatically becomes an Australian ICA company because its residence tie-breaks to Australia under the Australia/New Zealand DTA must also register online through myIR, or complete a Trans-Tasman imputation election form - IR488.

Trans-Tasman imputation
=======================

2005 remedial amendments to the trans-Tasman imputation rules.

**_Sections FDB 1, ME 1, ME 1B, ME 1C, ME 10, ME 11, ME 12, ME 18, ME 19, MG 11 and OB1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and Income Tax Act 2004, section 139A of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

### Introduction

A number of remedial amendments have been made to the recently enacted trans-Tasman imputation rules to improve their administrability and coherence.

### Background

The trans-Tasman imputation rules in the Income Tax Act were enacted in 1995 to bring Australian resident companies within the scope of the imputation rules. This was part of a bilateral agreement with the Australian government which also included New Zealand-resident companies within the Australian imputation rules.

Australian and New Zealand shareholders of trans-Tasman companies that choose to take up these reforms can now be allocated imputation credits representing New Zealand tax paid and franking credits representing Australian tax paid, in proportion to their ownership of the company. However, each country's credits can be claimed only by its residents.

### Key features

*   Section FDB 1(1)(e) has been repealed and section FDB 1(2)(ab) has been added to clarify that an imputation group must include all members of a consolidated group or no members of a consolidated group.
*   Section FDB 1(2)(b) has been amended to clarify that it is only when members of more than one consolidated group form or join an imputation group that the credits in a consolidated group imputation credit account must have the same shareholder continuity profile.
*   Section ME 1(2)(a) has been amended to clarify that it is companies resident in countries other than New Zealand that are excluded from maintaining imputation credit accounts, rather than non-resident companies. This is because it is only resident companies under section ME 1(1) that are required to maintain an imputation credit account.
*   Section ME 1B(4)(a) has been amended to give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue a discretion to accept late elections. The Commissioner will accept a late election only when the election would have been valid had it been received on time.
*   The formula in section ME 1C has been corrected so it is "a x b" - that is, dividend times the exchange rate (rather than the previous a + b).
*   Section ME 10(1D)(b) has been clarified to ensure that all entries to the imputation credit account from the New Zealand members of a trans-Tasman imputation group go to the resident imputation group, whether or not they could be considered to be "transactions".
*   Section ME 12(1)(b)(i) has been removed and sections ME 18(1)(a), ME 18(3)(b), ME 19(3)(a) and (b) and ME 19(4)(b) have been amended to ensure that, for companies within a consolidated or imputation group, transfers can still be made between an individual company's imputation credit account and policyholder credit account. Section ME 18(4)(b) has been updated to refer to an imputation group's imputation credit account.
*   Section ME 11(1)(f), ME 11(2)(d) and MG 11(1) have been amended to ensure that transfers made from a dividend withholding payment account to an imputation credit account can also be made to the imputation credit account of the imputation group of which the dividend withholding payment company is a member.
*   The definition of "resident in Australia" in section OB 1, paragraph (a), has been omitted. This ensures that Australian resident companies which are also resident in New Zealand (dual resident companies) are eligible to elect to become imputation credit account companies.
*   Section 139A(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to omit annual imputation returns from this provision. This is to improve the consistency of the late filing penalty rules.

### Application dates

The Commissioner's discretion to accept late elections and the amendments to allow transfers from a company's dividend withholding payment account to its imputation group's imputation credit account apply from the date of enactment, 21 December 2004.

The amendment to section ME 1C comes into force on 1 October 2003, the date from which Australian companies could pay imputed dividends.

The other amendments apply from 1 April 2003, the date from which Australian companies could use New Zealand's imputation rules.

The principal purpose of the transfer of a mining licence was to make a taxable supply. Although the Commissioner did not establish the purchase price was a sham, the transaction involved tax avoidance as the price was grossly inflated.

### Facts

This case concerns a GST input claim by Glenharrow Holdings Limited (Glenharrow) relating to the purchase of a greenstone mining licence. The mining licence was issued in November 1990 and due to expire on 14 November 2000. The licence was purchased in 1996 by Michael Meates for $10,000. In 1997 Mr Meates was approached by Gerard Fahey who wanted to purchase the licence. The Court found that Mr Fahey believed the licence area contained a large amount of valuable stone.

Mr Meates asked his cousin, who was not a registered valuer but who had studied valuation as part of his MBA, to value the licence. The cousin "conservatively" valued the licence at $45 million.

Mr Meates told Mr Fahey he would sell the licence for $45 million. Mr Fahey agreed to this price on the basis there would be vendor finance. A skeleton agreement provided for an $80,000 deposit, with the remaining $44,920,000 to be vendor financed. _Glenharrow_, a company controlled by Mr Fahey was nominated as the purchaser. The $80,000 deposit was paid and the licence was transferred to _Glenharrow_. There was an exchange of cheques between the parties, and mortgages executed over the licence and shares in the company in favour of Mr Meates. A debenture over the company's assets was also registered in favour of Mr Meates.

The Commissioner allowed an input claim for the deposit of $80,000. The application for a refund of $4,991,111 for the balance of $44,920,000 was rejected by the Commissioner.

In 1999 _Glenharrow_ applied to the Minister of Commerce to vary the conditions of the mining licence and extend the term of the licence to 42 years. It later applied for a new licence to be issued. Both requests were rejected by the Minister. _Glenharrow_ sought judicial review in two separate proceedings. _Glenharrow_ was successful in the High Court with its first proceeding. However, _Glenharrow_ was unsuccessful in the second review proceeding, which it appealed to the Court of Appeal and Privy Council, losing both appeals.

By the time the licence expired in November 2000 _Glenharrow_ had mined only 36 tonnes of rock. The Commissioner argued that there was no credible reason why _Glenharrow_ could not have worked the licence from the time that it was purchased to support the position that the vendor financed portion of the purchase price was a sham.

### Decision

#### Sham

Chisholm J found that the full purchase price was not a sham. The evidence of the parties involved in the valuation and transaction was found to be credible. Although "much too optimistic", the parties intended to be bound to the full amount of the transaction. Chisholm J also found the valuation was flawed, but this did not detract from the fact it was genuinely believed to be accurate. The delays in _Glenharrow_ commencing mining operations were attributable to Department of Conservation issues and thus the lack of mining activity not found to be inconsistent with the intention of the parties.

#### Principal purpose of making taxable supplies

The Commissioner submitted that the principal purpose of the parties was to claim a GST refund. Chisholm J held that "principal purpose" was the primary purpose that the taxpayer had in mind or view, and that it is not synonymous with intention or motive. The principal purpose has to be ascertained at the time the transaction takes place, and that actions may speak louder than words in determining what the principal purpose was. Chisholm J also found that both subjective and objective factors may be taken into account. Chisholm J found that the principal purpose of the transaction was to make a taxable supply.

#### Tax avoidance

This case fell under section 76 prior to its amendment, which required the intent and application of the Act to be defeated. It was common ground that there was an 'arrangement' on the facts of the case. The core issue was whether the Act required a subjective intent to defeat the intent and application of the Act, or whether an objective test should be applied. Chishom J adopted the reasoning in _Ch'elle Properties_ \[2004\] NZLR 274 which held the section was objective in its application. His Honour held that notwithstanding being worded differently from section BG1, section 76 had "all the trappings of an anti-avoidance provision" and needed to be interpreted in a way that would give effect to Parliament's intent.

Chisholm J canvassed factual issues as to whether the consideration was grossly inflated. He concluded that it was. It therefore followed that the intent and application of the Act was defeated. His Honour roughly calculated the required reconstruction to be in the vicinity of $8 million, but requires the valuation expert of the Commissioner to revise his calculations and that a memorandum be submitted to the Court.

[Changes to the GST rules](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-gst-and-remedial-matters-act-2010/changes-to-the-gst-rules "Changes to the GST rules")

Transactions involving nominations
==================================

2010 changes to the GST rules provide greater certainty for transactions involving nominees by adopting an 'economic substance' approach.

Nominee transactions ordinarily involve a purchaser nominating another person (a nominee) to receive goods and services and/or settle the transaction.

The new rules are intended to provide greater certainty for transactions involving nominees by adopting an "economic substance" approach. These rules are not intended to apply to transactions that involve other structures, such as assignments, novations, or agency arrangements.

### Key features

New section 60B clarifies the GST treatment of transactions involving nominations - when a contractual purchaser nominates another person (a nominee) to receive the goods or services from the contractual vendor.

In these circumstances, the GST treatment will depend on which party provides payment for the supply of goods or services. In respect of transactions involving land, however, the supply will always be treated as being made by the supplier to the nominee.

### Application date

The new rules will apply to supplies made on or after 1 April 2011.

### Detailed analysis

#### _Effect of nomination on a supply_

New section 60B applies when a person (person A) enters into a contract to supply goods and services to another person (person B) and person B directs person A to provide the goods and services to a nominated person (person C) who is not party to the contract.

The section does not apply to situations involving supplies made to or by agents, as these situations are governed by section 60 of the GST Act. Also, the new rule does not apply to assignments or novations.

The GST treatment of a supply will depend on the exact circumstances of the transaction.

#### _Contractual purchaser and nominated person have the same registration status_

If a contractual purchaser (person B) and the nominated person (person C) are both registered or both not registered for GST, the treatment of the supply will depend on which party provides consideration for the supply:

*   If person B pays the full consideration for the supply, the supply is treated as a supply from the supplier (person A) to person B and the existence of person C is ignored (section 60B(2)).
*   If person C pays the full consideration for the supply, the supply is treated as a supply from person A to person C and the existence of person B is ignored (section 60B(3)).
*   If person B and person C each pay part of the consideration for the supply, the supply is treated as a supply from person A to person B. However, person B and person C may agree in writing that the supply is to be treated as a supply made to person C. No such agreement can be made if person B has claimed an input tax deduction in relation to the supply (section 60B(4)).

#### _Contractual purchaser and nominated person have different registration status_

If the registration status of a contractual purchaser differs from the registration status of the nominated person (that is, one party is registered for GST and another party is not registered for GST), the supply is always treated as a supply from the supplier to the nominated person.

#### _Nominee transactions that involve land_

If a supply wholly or partly consists of land, the supply is always treated as made by the supplier to the nominated person. This is intended to provide consistency with the fact that the zero-rating rules apply at the time of settlement.

#### _Record-keeping requirements_

The nomination rules in section 60B affect the tax invoice requirements. In normal circumstances, a taxpayer must have a tax invoice to claim an input tax deduction. In transactions involving nominations, a nominee may not have the requisite tax invoice as it may have been issued to the purchaser. In these circumstances, new section 24(7B) requires a nominee to maintain records that would allow the name and address of the supplier, the date of payment for the supply, a description of the goods and services supplied, and the consideration for the supply to be ascertained.

New section 20(2)(e) further specifies that a nominee may use the records kept in accordance with section 24(7B) as documentation to claim a deduction of input tax.

Te whakawhiti i te utu tiaki pēpi: ngā ture Transfers of paid parental leave: the rules
=======================================================================================

You may be able to transfer some or all of your entitlement to your spouse or partner, but entitlements can only be transferred once.

This also means, once you transfer your entitlement to your spouse or partner, you cannot transfer it back.

A transfer could allow both of you to spend time getting to know your new baby or child under 6.

To qualify for paid parental leave, your spouse or partner must stop working, have primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of the child, and meet the ‘work requirements’.

[Work requirements for paid parental leave](/paid-parental-leave/qualifying/work-requirements)

Only 1 person can receive paid parental leave payments at a time.

Apply for a transfer
--------------------

You can request to transfer your entitlement to your spouse or partner when you register for paid parental leave. Or, if you’re already registered, you can complete the online form in myIR.

Your spouse or partner will get an alert in myIR asking them to apply for paid parental leave. If they’re not registered for myIR, we’ll send them a letter.

[Transfer your paid parental leave](/paid-parental-leave/transfers/transfer-your-payments)

Rules for transfers
-------------------

Your spouse or partner’s paid parental leave entitlement depends on the amount of income they earn. That means their payments may be different from yours.

Entitlements can only be transferred once, so you need to decide which of you will be taking the payments first.

Paid parental leave payments are paid to a family for a maximum of 26 weeks.

In other words, if you get payments for 10 weeks and you transfer your entitlement to your spouse or partner, they’ll get payments for the remaining 16 weeks. Their paid parental leave period starts the day after your paid parental leave period ends.

### Payment period must be continuous

Parental leave payments are payable for one continuous period of up to 26 weeks. You can transfer some or all your parental leave payments to your spouse or partner.

If you transfer your payments once you start receiving them, you cannot transfer them back again. If your spouse or partner needs to return to work early, the parental leave payments will end.

If you transfer your payments before you start receiving them, you will be able to transfer them back again. That means if your spouse or partner needs to return to work early, they can transfer payments back to you before they return.

The rules for transferring parental leave payments are not the same as the more flexible rules for sharing parental leave.

Example: Annabelle transfers her entitlement to partner Jake

Annabelle and Jake are parents of baby Lily, who was born on 17 January. On 5 January, Annabelle goes on paid parental leave to prepare for Lily’s arrival.

Both parents want to spend time with Lily, so after 12 weeks of paid parental leave, Annabelle transfers her entitlement to Jake, who meets the work requirements.

Jake takes paid parental leave for 10 weeks.

If Jake takes parental leave payments, Annabelle would not be entitled to receive payments, once Jake’s payments end.

Example: Only 1 transfer within the family

Harry and Reuben adopt 6-month baby Emily when Harry’s sister is no longer able to look after her.

As the primary carer, Harry goes on paid parental leave to look after Emily. In the evenings, Reuben gives Harry a break from parenting and it’s clear Emily and Reuben have a special bond.

After 10 weeks, Harry transfers his entitlement to Reuben, who goes on paid parental leave, expecting to see out the remaining 16 weeks as Emily’s stay-at-home dad.

However, after 5 weeks, Reuben is offered a significant promotion at work ─ simply too good to turn down.

Reuben returns to work with some regret, but knowing that he and Harry need the extra income now they have a surprise new family member.

Ideally, Reuben would transfer his entitlement back to Harry, but that’s not possible.

Entitlements can only be transferred once.

What happens next
-----------------

We'll make the transfer when we process your company's income tax return - IR4. If your company updates its imputation credit account separately, we'll make the transfer when we get the IR4J form.

The shareholder-employees being transferred tax must record this amount in their Individual income tax returns - IR3.

Your responsibilities
---------------------

Your company cannot transfer more tax than was deducted from its schedular payments.

You'll also need to make sure your company is eligible to transfer tax credits to shareholder-employees.

Transformation
==============

This appropriation covers the design and implementation of a modern system for tax revenue and social policy administered by Inland Revenue.

We achieved 1 out 1 performance measures.

Show all

What we intended to achieve

This appropriation is intended to design and implement a modern system for tax revenue and social policy administered by Inland Revenue that meets Government priorities and responds to customers' changing expectations. This will lead to the more efficient collection of taxes and distribution of entitlements. It will also have wider benefits for Aotearoa New Zealand, including reduced compliance and operating costs, as well as more agile delivery of policy changes in the future.

How we performed

This year, we finished our multi-year programme to transform tax and social policy payments. Transformation was delivered on time and under budget - we handed back more money this year as part of Budget 2022 and closed the programme as planned on 30 June 2022.

In October 2021, we moved child support into our new system and upgraded the online services all our customers use, to make it easier for customers to keep track of their obligations and payments. Read more about these changes.

1 Due to the substantive completion of our transformation programme and the closure of this appropriation as at 30 June 2022, the Unaudited forecast for 2023 is nil. An amount of $24 million funding has been transferred from the 2021-22 financial year to the new 'Residual activities following the transformation programme's substantive closure' appropriation for the 2022-23 financial year.

Tracking the outcomes of the transformation programme

We use several indicators to measure the outcomes of the transformation programme investment as detailed in the table below. Read more about previous years' results in 'Business Transformation: Implementing a Digital Revenue System – Final Programme Business Case Addendum'.

[Outcomes](/about-us/business-transformation/outcomes)

This year, we achieved 7 out of the 10 indicators for which there are quantitative measures. The measures achieved relate to digital uptake, system availability, system resilience, additional Crown revenue and administrative savings.

The measures not achieved were the following.

*   The percentage of customers who find it easy to comply decreased by 1 percentage point, from 82% in 2020-21 to 81% this year. This measure is proving difficult to shift as it measures customer perceptions, which presents some challenges in the current environment.
*   The reduction in compliance effort for small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) was not achieved. SMEs reported saving 5 hours compared to a target of 15 hours. The value of the time saved by SMEs is also behind target. These are indicative results based on 2021 survey results. It appears that COVID-19 and payday filing are having an impact. We continue to focus on designing our services to reduce effort for SMEs.
*   We recognise that achieving the targets in these areas by 2023-24 will be challenging, and that an ongoing focus on reducing effort will be required.

The transformation programme closed on 30 June 2022, but we will continue to track and report against its benefit commitments until 2023-24.

ABOUT OUR BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION Email IRTransformation@ird.govt.nz for further information. BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION August 2021 Latest news about Inland Revenue's transformation Final Business Transformation changes For more than four years we’ve been transforming how we deliver tax and social policy services. The final release of our Business Transformation Programme will go live later this year. We're targeting late October as planned but are closely monitoring any external events that may affect this timing, such as COVID lockdowns and the recent closure of our Wellington office. myIR changes In our final release we’ll be upgrading to the latest version of myIR. All customers who use myIR will notice an improvement - how much will depend on the extent that they use myIR and the complexity of their needs. Important information will show on the myIR homepage A new layout with simpler navigation will make it easier for customers to access important information from the myIR homepage for each of their accounts, such as total balances, any upcoming, due now, or overdue payments and links to complete tasks such as making a payment or filing a return. A new Alerts tab on the myIR homepage will allow customers direct access to all their alerts – these will be sorted by account type and due date and they’ll be able to filter and dismiss the alerts. If customers have a logon with access to multiple accounts (e.g. various business accounts), they’ll need to select the customer they want access to, before having visibility of the accounts for that customer. myIR will adapt to screen size Whatever device customers use to access myIR, for example their phone, tablet or laptop, content will automatically re-size if the device’s display is large enough, and if not, it will stack and wrap content within panels. IRD Business Transformation news Ha ving trouble viewing this email? View Online Changes for child support All child support customers will be able use myIR to: register for child support, and apply for and respond to administrative reviews and objections It will also be easier for them to manage their child support details, including being able to update their contact and bank account details, and notify us of a change of circumstances. Changes for tax intermediaries The myIR version upgrade will also bring changes specific to tax intermediaries. These include: A new Intermediary centre that will allow them to perform intermediary functions from any level in myIR. The Intermediary centre will replace the Tax Preparer tab. We will be removing the intermediary workspace but there are new alternate ways to access clients: They will be able to add up to 50 clients to a favourites tab so it’s easy to find those they access regularly. There is also a History tab and Last viewed link that will help intermediaries find recently accessed clients. The search functionality for intermediaries will include the ability to search for a client by name as well as by IRD number and Customer Identifier. The search by name is a new addition in response to feedback we’ve received from tax intermediaries. Find out more The following webinars provide more information on the upcoming myIR changes: Introducing the myIR version upgrade (for all audiences) myIR navigation for businesses and individuals myIR navigation for tax intermediaries Alerts for tax intermediaries Further changes for businesses and employers New legislation for child support will come into effect making it compulsory for child support payments to be deducted from the salary or wages of returning liable or newly liable parents. We will inform employers of any of their employees who become liable for child support payments. We'll also provide the information they'll need to make deductions from salaries / wages. Payday filing On 1 April 2021, it became a requirement for all employers to use the latest version of payday filing (Version 2) when submitting their Employment Information and Employee Details returns. When we go live with our final release, Version 1 will be retired for filing. If an employer is still using the ‘file upload’ option to manage payroll in myIR, they must ensure their file format is updated to payday filing version 2. Employers must amend Employment Information files using the same version they filed through, so V ersion 1 amendment files (EIA) will continue to be accepted. Find out more The following webinar provides more information on the changes coming for business and employers: Introducing the final Business Transformation changes for businesses and employers Alternatively, you can also visit ird.govt.nz/changes-businesses Other changes Bankruptcy From go-live, bankruptcy will no longer result in a new IRD number, customers will instead be able to continue using their existing IRD number. Correspondence As part of this final release, correspondence dating from April 2017 onwards will still be available in m yIR. Historic letters dating back to April 2010 will no longer be accessible in myIR, however customers will still be able to request older information from us. Audit letters that were sent as far back as February 2017 (when our system gained the capability to send things electronically) will become available in myIR. These will be visible to owner and administrator logons, and tax agents who have the Customer master link. In preparation for this change we are encouraging customers to review logons that they have set up for administrators. With this release, we will further reduce the amount of correspondence issued by paper - child support letters, child support deduction notices, debt deduction notices to employers and audit letters will begin to issue electronically when the recipient is registered for myIR. Credit/debit card payments From go-live overseas customers who pay their student loan and child support obligations by credit or debit card will be charged the convenience fee of 1.42%. This is consistent with the fee that is passed on to all other Inland Revenue customers. There are several payment options available to our overseas customers. They can find out more at ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/make-a-payment/ways-of-paying. New RWT on interest rate Individuals will have the option to change their RWT rate to 39% with their payers of interest, such as banks and other financial institutions. The new RWT on interest rate aligns with the new 39% personal tax rate that came into effect on 1 April 2021. Webinars Our webinar series provides more information on the upcoming changes: ird.govt.nz/bt-webinars. Available webinars: Introduction to the October 2021 changes Introduction to the new myIR version upgrade Introduction to the new navigation in myIR Alerts in the upgraded version of myIR You can also visit ird.govt.nz/business-transformation-2021 for information on the upcoming changes. Guides for filing Employment Information (EI) forms We're working on creating a better filing experience for employers, tax intermediaries and software developers. As part of this work, we've created two guides to help employers file their Employment Information (EI) forms. The first one provides helpful assistance to complete common myIR employer related tasks and the second assists employers with myIR filing errors. Support for businesses following alert level change Significant support is available for businesses following the rise in alert levels announced by the Prime Minister on 17 August 2021. These measures include: The Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS). This payment will be available nationally to help eligible businesses continue paying staff and protecting jobs.

BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION February 2020 Latest news about Inland Revenue's transformation Our services will be unavailable Our Business Transformation programme is well under-way. We’re transforming our systems to make it simpler for New Zealanders to pay their taxes and receive their entitlements. This includes improvements to myIR, student loans, KiwiSaver and more. In April, our next set of changes come into effect. In order to make these changes our key services will be unavailable between 3pm Thursday 9 April and 8am Thursday 16 April. During this time our phone lines and offices will be closed, and you will not be able to access myIR or e-File. Resident Withholding Tax exemption register We have introduced a new online RWT exemption register that lists the IRD numbers of all customers who are exempt from having RWT deducted from the interest and dividends they receive. Currently we issue successful applicants with a certificate of exemption from RWT. This process will remain in place until 31 March 2020. From 1 April, payers of investment income (e.g. payers of interest and dividends) will access the register to confirm which of their customers have RWT exempt status. They will no longer ask for or accept physical certificates of exemption. The register: is automatically populated by Inland Revenue identifies customers only by their IRD number can be searched by exemption status, IRD number and when the information was last updated is updated overnight every business day (Monday to Friday) – so it provides near real time information. IRD Business Transformation news Having trouble viewing this email? View Online Payers can use the register now to verify if a customer has an exemption, or to check the exemption status (e.g. cancelled, revoked or end-dated (expired)). ​​​​​​​ If a customer has an exemption under an Act that is not administered by Inland Revenue, they may need to apply to us to be included on the register. If you are a charity registered with Charities Services you do not need to apply for RWT exempt status. We will automatically put you on the register. You can find out more and access the register at www.ird.govt.nz/rwt-exemption Moving away from cheques From 1 March we will stop accepting payment by cheque, including cheques dated after 1 March 2020. There are several payment methods offered by us and the banks, including: Online through your bank Online in myIR Automatic payment authority form (IR586) Cash or Eftpos at Westpac (From 1 July 2020, all payments at Westpac must be accompanied by a barcode) We encourage you to speak with your bank or a tax professional to help you find the best payment method for you. For more information on these payment methods visit www.ird.govt.nz/cheques We are also in the process of introducing a new phone payment option, which will allow customers to make payments 24/7 using our SPK2IR phone service. We will provide more information closer to the time, but we are aiming for this option to be available from mid-April. If you have already spoken with your bank and/or tax professional and are unable to use another payment method, please contact us to discuss your options. Research and Development Tax Incentive - website The Research and Development Tax Incentive (RDTI) supports Government’s target to increase New Zealand’s R&D expenditure to 2% of GDP by 2027. In February a new RDTI website was introduced to help businesses understand the benefits of undertaking R&D and to encourage more businesses to invest in it. Designed for busy business-decision-makers, the website features an easy-to-follow introductory guide to RDTI eligibility and a step-by-step overview of how to apply. The RDTI is jointly administered by Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation, and information on the new website has been developed collaboratively by both agencies with support from MBIE. Learn more at www.rdti.govt.nz Tax technical beta site available in late March As part of our work to build a new and improved Tax Technical website, we’re making a beta, or test version available ahead of the first published release. We’re planning to make the beta site available in late March, accessible via the existing Tax Technical section of the Inland Revenue website. We’re keen to get your thoughts and feedback on the new look and feel, features and layout of the Tax Technical site and we encourage you to visit the beta version when it’s available. You will be able to provide comments while on the site using the feedback button on each beta page. Feedback we receive during this time will help us to improve the site before the first release.

Student loan changes From April, student loan transactions will be fully administered in our new system. As a result, it will be easier for student loan customers to manage their loan and find the relevant information. In April student loan customers will see changes in their myIR accounts including: A clearer view of their total student loan balance and repayments made A breakdown of any assessments, including amounts due and due dates Departure and arrival dates if they travel overseas New calculators to work out how long it will take to repay their student loan or when interest will be charged when they go overseas New payment options are being introduced to make it easier for customers to repay their loan.

New Zealand based customers will also be able to make credit card payments by phone 24/7. There will also be some student loan changes for employers. The new employee onboarding process will identify if a new employee should have a student loan tax code and advise the employer to update this before their first pay. When an employee’s loan is expected to be repaid within three months, we will write to the employer to let them know how much is left to deduct. This will significantly reduce the likelihood of employees having unnecessary over deductions from their pay.

KiwiSaver changes KiwiSaver is a work-based savings initiative designed to help New Zealanders save for their retirement. From April, KiwiSaver will be fully administered in our new system.

Updating investment income allocations in myIR From 1 April investment income reporting is changing. If you receive investment income, you will need to ensure that your investment income payer (eg their bank) has your IRD number to avoid being charged the non-declaration rate of 45%. If you have a joint account, we will split any investment income reported equally across all the joint account holders who have provided a valid IRD number to the payer. If this allocation isn’t correct, you can update it in myIR using the following steps: 1. Select your income tax account 2. In the Earning summary section, select view details 3. Select the income period dates for the period the investment income was earned 4.Select Update investment percentage 5. Next to the payer you have received investment income from, select view detail 6. All accounts listed with that payer will show, along with an account identifier (as provided by the payer) and ownership percentage. Select View detail. Note: If an account identifier hasn’t been provided by the payer, it will show “not identified”. You can continue with the below steps if this shows 7. The table shows the dates the income has been received. Select Add ownership period. 8. Complete the From field and the Ownership percentage field. Then click next. Note: If the To field is left blank, the updated percentage will remain until you advise us otherwise 9.Review the details and select the Confirmation checkbox. Click Submit. The percentage and income received in the dates provided will be updated instantly. The update will only be made to the individual’s ownership percentage. Other account holders will need to update their details separately. For more information about investment income reporting changes visit ird.govt.nz/investment-income. Income equalisation schemes The income equalisation schemes allow farmers, fishers and foresters who are eligible taxpayers to even out fluctuations in income by spreading their gross income from year to year. From April we will manage income equalisation schemes in our new system. This will mean:  You can tell us about deposits, and request withdrawals for income equalisation in myIR – the paper form (the IR155) will be discontinued  You can make deposits electronically in myIR or via internet banking. Use the new account code when making payments via internet banking:  EQU – Income Equalisation  All withdrawals will be paid out by direct credit  You can see scheme balances and other transactions, such as interest, at any time in myIR under the new accounts (Income Equalisation)  Deposits and withdrawals will be shown in your income summary and pre-populated into the “other income” field on your income tax returns in myIR.  Once the income equalisation schemes move into our new system you will no longer need to use cheques for deposits or withdrawals. Deposits can be made using an alternative payment method and you can supply your bank account details for withdrawals.  For more information about alternative payment methods visit ird.govt.nz/payments. New Inland Revenue Tax Technical website coming soon A new and improved Tax Technical website is on the way, with the first release available in the next few months.

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Proactive release: This document has been released by Inland Revenue under section 18(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This release supports the purposes of the Official Information Act 1982 by increasing progressively the availability of official information to the people of New Zealand. In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee Inland Revenue’s July 2020 Transformation Update Proposal 1 This paper provides an update regarding Inland Revenue’s progress in modernising the revenue system. I am asking Cabinet to note the progress made to date and the impact of COVID-19 on Inland Revenue’s capacity and on its plans for completing the transformation programme. Executive Summary 2 Inland Revenue has chalked up some significant achievements in recent months. Release 4 of its transformation successfully went live on 16 April 2020, moving KiwiSaver and student loans to new systems and processes, and the department has played a key role in supporting our responses to COVID-19. Inland Revenue has achieved this while supporting customers, organising its people to work remotely and preparing for the peak tax season, including this year’s automatic income tax assessments. 3 Going live in the middle of a pandemic was a difficult but necessary call to make. Not going live would have delayed making new services available to customers which make it easier for them to get the help they need and better ensure their payment obligations reflect their current income. 4 The majority of the go-live process was completed remotely, an undertaking made possible by the investment in transformation. The capabilities delivered by transformation have also underpinned our responses to COVID-19. Inland Revenue has supported the Ministry of Social Development to deliver the wage subsidy, implemented business tax changes to free up cashflow, and implemented the Small Business Cashflow (loan) Scheme. New systems and processes were able to be extended to accommodate these initiatives as the requirements were clear and simple and leveraged the out-of-the-box functionality of the core system. 5 To deliver all of this, Inland Revenue has had to make choices about where it focuses its efforts. It is clear that the system constraints of the past are now much reduced. However, Inland Revenue’s ability to support customers is currently stretched to capacity. The department i s providing a heightened level of support until the end of July 2020 to its customers and people following the Release 4 changes, supporting customers as they face challenging financial circumstances, and continuing to provide a wide range of services to customers every day. 6 In light of COVID-19, Inland Revenue is now re-planning the final changes of transformation, the work to close the programme, and the move to its new operating model. It is too early to say what the implications for the timeframes, costs and benefits of 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] the transformation programme will be. My working assumption is that Inland Revenue will complete transformation within the existing funding envelope approved in 2015 by government. Inland Revenue will keep the Minister of Finance and me fully informed as it thinking develops and will report back to Cabinet in November 2020. 7 Inland Revenue will continue to play a key role in our responses to COVID-19. It will be important for us to keep in mind Inland Revenue’s capacity in the design of further COVID- 19 response packages. We may need to consider trade-offs in the role the department plays, how Inland Revenue is best able to contribute, and when. Release 4 has successfully gone live 8 Inland Revenue successfully implemented Release 4 of its transformation programme on 16 April 2020. This release moved KiwiSaver, Student Loans and the end-to-end processing of PAYE to new systems and processes. Enhancements were also made to digital services, income tax and Working for Families. More frequent and more detailed reporting of investment income information became mandatory from 1 April 2020. The changes made give New Zealanders more information and options as they manage through this difficult period. 9 New services are now available which make it easier for people to get the help they need and better ensure their payment obligations reflect their current income. All customers who are experiencing financial difficulties can apply for relief through a simple, new myIR 1 service. Employers can set up instalment arrangements themselves online for any debt they owe. Student loan borrowers who are struggling to make repayments can now apply for a special deduction rate online. Previously, customers had to ring or write to Inland Revenue to access these services. What took a number of days can now be done with a few clicks. 10 Going live as planned was not an easy call to make as the decision had to be made when New Zealand was barely a week into the Alert Level 4 lockdown. However, it was clearly the right decision. Inland Revenue considered a range of alternative dates, recognising that the risks of any future date were unknown. Before deciding to proceed as planned, Inland Revenue consulted a range of stakeholders, including tax professional bodies and KiwiSaver scheme providers. Not making the changes would have meant delaying benefits to customers and made it more difficult for Inland Revenue to help support our response to COVID-19. 11 The vast majority of the go-live process was completed remotely for the first time. This is a significant achievement and only made possible by the investment in transformation. 12 Inland Revenue has upgraded its workplace technology as part of transformation to ensure that it can continue to provide services in the event of disruption. This has enabled approximately 4,000 of its people to work remotely in response to COVID-19. Together with very good practices around how Inland Revenue manages each release and readies customers and its people for change, this made a very quick pivot to a remote cutover possible. 13 During the weekend of 9 to 15 April 2020 when Release 4 products were being moved to new systems and processes, there was a maximum of 8 people on site at Inland Revenue’s offices at any one time, compared to a peak of approximately 100 people for 1 Inland Revenue’s secure online services 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] previous releases. Approximately 270 people worked on Release 4 cutover remotely, compared to less than 10 people for Release 3 in April 2019. 14 The benefits of the changes made in Release 4 are already evident. New processes are far more efficient, meaning customers’ accounts are far more up-to-date and accurate. This is particularly important in the current environment and will help support the recovery from COVID-19. 15 For example, since go-live Inland Revenue has been able to transfer contributions to KiwiSaver scheme providers far more quickly. In the weeks immediately after go-live, around three-quarters of members’ contributions were transferred to scheme providers within 3 to 7 working days and 99% were transferred within 14 days. Previously, it would take Inland Revenue, on average, 20 to 23 working days to transfer contributions. As at 8 June 2020, Inland Revenue had passed 27 million messages worth $1.7 billion to scheme providers since go-live on 26 April 2020. This compares with the previous peak in August 2019 of 7.9 million messages worth $785 million. New Zealanders now have their contributions invested far more quickly which, over time, should have a beneficial impact on their retirement savings. 16 Similarly, there have been significant improvements in the administration of student loans. Closing a loan is now an overnight process with nearly all loans automatically ceased when they are paid off. Previously it took up to 42 days due to the amount of manual work involved. During this period customers often continued to have deductions made from their salary and wages. As at 4 June 2020, since go-live around 24,000 borrowers have been advised that their loans have been paid off, with $5 million refunded to them. 17 Release 4 builds on previous releases and is further helping to ensure that people make and receive the right payments. The automatically issued income tax assessment process for 2020 began on 18 May 2020. The process will run more smoothly this year as a result of Release 4 go-live. Inland Revenue has made some enhancements to the process to ensure refunds get to people as quickly as possible, including running the process over a shorter time period. As at 8 June 2020, approximately 1.1 million New Zealanders had automatically been issued with their tax refunds totalling $571 million. Some 160,000 have received a bill and have until 7 February 2021 to pay it. The threshold for writing off debt was increased from $50 to $200 this year. This means fewer people will have bills to pay and fewer will call Inland Revenue. 18 Inland Revenue is now in the early life support period for Release 4, where a heightened level of support is available to customers and its people. As with any release, Inland Revenue has found that some things have not worked quite as expected and has made changes as a result. The level of changes being made is far lower than for previous releases. Customer reaction has largely been muted, which is unsurprising given the circumstances, and while some are taking time to get used to new ways of doing things, others say they are finding the changes easy to work with. These represent the latest in a series of significant changes since 2017 to the way Inland Revenue operates 19 Customers are spending less time and effort ensuring they meet their obligations and receive their correct social policy entitlements. Tax is being more correctly withheld and entitlements more accurately calculated during the year. We now have greater agility to make policy changes and to better use the information Inland Revenue holds to deliver improved outcomes for New Zealanders. Inland Revenue itself is now far more resilient, 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] as has been amply demonstrated by the department’s response to COVID-19. These outcomes have been achieved through a combination of changes to policy, process, technology and Inland Revenue’s operating model. 20 Customers now have online services for all tax products, Working for Families, KiwiSaver and student loans. They can do far more for themselves including filing returns, keeping track of their payments, and making payments. Inland Revenue is using the employment and investment income information it receives more frequently to pre-populate individual customers’ online accounts. This gives people greater visibility of what they have paid and what they owe and means that payments should be more accurate during the year. 21 Employers now have a single account with all their information in one place in myIR. They can see what they have paid and what they need to do in a single place. A survey completed in the first week after go-live found that 60% of employers were finding it easier to file. 22 The year ended 31 March 2020 was the first full year that Inland Revenue received employment income information every payday. It is also the first year Inland Revenue has received information about recipients of investment income more often from payers who chose to provide it. This became mandatory for payers of investment income from 1 April 2020. This more detailed and timely data means Inland Revenue can proactively contact customers during the year to ensure they are paying and receiving the right amounts. For example, once it became clear last year that a significant number of people were on an incorrect prescribed investor rate (PIR), Inland Revenue proactively contacted them about correcting their PIR. Of the approximately 140,000 customers who have had their automatic assessment so far this year, approximately 90,000 have had a more favourable outcome compared to last year as a result. Whereas they had a bill to pay last year, this year 68,000 have received a refund and 22,000 have had a small bill written off. 23 Third parties are now a much more integral part of the revenue system. Throughout transformation Inland Revenue has worked with those who advise and provide services to customers to ensure revenue processes fit seamlessly into normal business processes. Inland Revenue has recently established a tax agent cohort, which includes members from each of the big four firms, representative bodies, and agents based in the regions. It is proving to be a very valuable way for Inland Revenue to understand customer sentiment as the members represent a diverse range of customers across the country. 24 New analytical capabilities are shaping how Inland Revenue supports customers to pay and receive the right amounts across a range of areas. For example, u nderstanding the impacts of COVID-19 on customers and the emerging trends in behaviours to inform what steps to take to support the best outcome for the customer. T ext analytics are analysing notes in START 2 and myIR to determine why customers are calling and to identify those who might need some proactive support. 25 Changes to Inland Revenue’s operating model and the implementation of Ātea 3 are enabling the department to work more efficiently and productively. In recent months, Inland Revenue has achieved the target of paying 95% of domestic suppliers within 10 working days. The e-invoicing capability delivered as part of Ātea will enable I nland Revenue to increase this level of performance further, although the speed at which the 2 START stands for simplified tax and revenue technology and is the name chosen by Inland Revenue for the GenTax software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC 3 Ātea is the name Inland Revenue has chosen for its new enterprise support services platform. Enterprise support services are the internal systems and processes that support the day-to -day running of Inland Revenue. 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] department will be able to proceed will also be dependent on the take up of e invoicing by businesses. The next release in Ātea is due to go-live at the end of July 2020. This is likely to be implemented remotely, further demonstrating the benefits of transformation. The capabilities delivered by transformation have been key to supporting our response to COVID-19 26 Inland Revenue has played a significant role in delivering our response to COVID-19. The initiatives implemented have leveraged the capabilities delivered by transformation. 27 Having more up-to-date employment income information has enabled Inland Revenue to effectively support the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) in delivering the wage subsidy. I nformation about self-employed individuals, employers and employees was shared with MSD which enabled many applications to be automatically approved. Many however needed further clarification and a direct 0800 number was established for MSD staff to connect directly with Inland Revenue. As at 8 June 2020, Inland Revenue’s people had answered more than 353,000 calls from MSD. 28 Business tax changes to free up cashflow, including a provisional tax threshold lift, the reinstatement of building depreciation and writing off interest on the late payment of tax have been implemented, as has a loss carry-back scheme. As at 8 June 2020, around 1,700 customers had received refunds through the scheme totalling $8.5 million. Inland Revenue’s new analytical capabilities are playing a role in the administration of the scheme by identifying areas of customer confusion and errors, both deliberate and inadvertent. Changes to loss continuity rules will be consulted on later in the year and applied retrospectively for the 2020/21. 29 Most recently, Inland Revenue was able to quickly implement the Small Business Cashflow (loan) Scheme. The payment and collection functionality already built within START was extended to accommodate this initiative as the requirements were clear and simple and leveraged the out-of-the-box functionality of the core system. This enabled Inland Revenue to implement the Scheme in a matter of weeks. As at 8 June 2020, Inland Revenue had received more than 77,000 applications and approved loans worth approximately $1.2 b illion. 30 Supporting our response to COVID-19 coincided with the implementation of Release 4, and when Inland Revenue was organising its people to work remotely and preparing for the peak tax season, including this year’s automatic income tax assessments. I believe that Inland Revenue would not have been able to respond so effectively even as recently as two or three years ago. 31 It is clear that, as a result of the investment made in transformation, as a government we now have greater flexibility and agility to make changes. We will need to use this flexibility wisely. 32 Prior to transformation, Inland Revenue’s heritage systems and processes were the greatest constraint on agility. They were complex, time-consuming and expensive to change. There were other constraints on the department, such as being unable to respond to customer demand at peak times, however these were not as significant as the constraints imposed by FIRST. 4 4 FIRST is Inland Revenue’s old core technology platform and is being replaced by START. 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 33 System constraints are no longer the issue, provided exceptions are minimised, requirements are clear and a good fit with Inland Revenue’s capabilities, and data sources are well understood. This is a huge change as the answer to “can the system do this” is now almost always yes, rather than no. 34 The constraint now is Inland Revenue’s ability to support customers. Meeting customer demand has always been a challenge for Inland Revenue and this is particularly true in a COVID-19 world. While the investment in workplace technology and the move to broad- based roles are enabling Inland Revenue to be more agile, there are limits to what can be achieved. 35 Inland Revenue estimates the productivity of its people had reduced by up to 25% as some people do not have the technology to enable them to work remotely, some have sub-optimal home set ups, and some have reduced availability due to childcare needs. This situation improved under Alert Level 2, with productivity significantly restored by the end of May 2020. Inland Revenue is working through how best to support its customers and its people during the respond, recover and rebuild phases. 36 It is clear that the improved agility to make changes provided by new systems and processes is currently out-pacing Inland Revenue’s organisational agility and capacity. This is something we will need to bear in mind in the design of further COVID-19 response packages. Inland Revenue is key to supporting our response, however we may need to consider trade-offs in the role the department plays, how Inland Revenue is best able to contribute, and when. Inland Revenue is also making other changes to better support New Zealanders at this time 37 Inland Revenue’s priorities are supporting customers, supporting our response to COVID- 19, and continuing to support R elease 4. There is a way to go before Inland Revenue can confidently say Release 4 has been bedded in. The early life support period is scheduled to run until 31 July 2020. 38 In dealing with customers as they respond to and recover from COVID-19, Inland Revenue is taking, and will continue to take, a highly supportive and empathetic approach. The focus is on helping customers through this period and working with them to find the best way to manage their obligations. There is now a great deal of flexibility available to Inland Revenue in dealing with customers who have been affected by COVID-19, such as extending dates or time periods and varying requirements. By working with customers to get the best outcome, Inland Revenue is helping to minimise the impacts of the disruption, minimise additional stress, and support businesses to remain operating where possible. 39 This has required some trade-offs to be made to maintain services and support customers. During the respond phase, with limited exceptions, no new audit or debt collection cases will be opened and existing disputes will be managed as judiciously as possible. Inland Revenue’s specialists in these areas are supporting COVID-19 activities and other priority work for around 50-70% of their time. The balance of their t ime is on case work in progress, reviewing disbursements, customer-initiated work such as voluntary disclosures, rulings, and annual risk reviews for the largest businesses. 40 This balance will change as the economy recovers from COVID-19. Inland Revenue will adjust its resourcing, including the amount of time its specialists spend on particular activities, to reflect the needs of the recovery and rebuild phases. 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 41 In exceptional cases, Inland Revenue will still pursue enforcement activity. I expect these to be very isolated cases and for action to be taken only where there is a clear and material risk to the integrity of the revenue system. 42 Inland Revenue will not achieve some of its performance measures this year in light of COVID-19, given the necessary and sensible decisions the department has made about where to focus its resources. The department’s performance frameworks may need updating to reflect its greater agility and the impact that circumstances can have, such as COVID-19, that sometimes require difficult trade-offs to be made. The final stage of the transformation programme is being re-planned 43 The end of transformation is now in sight. Implementation began with Stage 1 in February 2017 and has included the progressive migration of products to new systems and processes, wide-ranging changes to policy and legislative settings including the biggest change in a generation for individuals, and changes to the way Inland Revenue works, along with new tools and technology. 44 Following Stage 1, Inland Revenue moved to implementing changes in a series of releases to reduce risk and to minimise impacts on customers. The programme will conclude as planned, with a final stage, Stage 4. 45 The majority of the products Inland Revenue administers are now running on new systems and processes. The exceptions are Child Support, paid parental leave, and some minor products. This group of products is part of the final stage, along with the decommissioning of heritage systems and processes, completing the implementation of Ātea, and completing the implementation of new analytics and intelligence capabilities. 46 Inland Revenue will continue to work differently, with many of its people, including those working on transformation, continuing to work remotely currently. As the Minister of Finance and I refresh the tax policy work programme in light of COVID-19 and as thinking develops on the next wave of response and rebuild, Inland Revenue may well need to use some of its design and delivery teams to further support new policy responses. T herefore, it is necessary and sensible for Inland Revenue to re-plan the work remaining to complete transformation. 47 Given the impacts of COVID-19 on Inland Revenue, officials advise me that it is no longer possible to complete the final stage as a single major release in April 2021 as planned. Inland Revenue’s commitment to completing transformation as quickly as possible to provide customers and government with as much flexibility as possible and to reduce risk is unchanged. What will change is the approach to the final stage. It is likely that products will be progressively moved to new systems and processes in a series of smaller changes over a longer period, rather than as a single, large block of change. 48 Some of the smaller products, for example unclaimed monies, 5 can be implemented largely by the programme without having much impact on the wider business. However, child support will only be successful with the involvement of experts from across Inland Revenue. Child support implementations are notoriously difficult as they affect a 5 Unclaimed money is money held by a person or organisation, such as a solicitor or a Bank, where the owner of that money (or someone with authority to act on behalf of the owner) cannot be found. In general, money is classed as unclaimed after a certain length of time has passed since the person or organisation holding the money has been able to contact the owner. The length of time depends on the type of money. For the most part, unclaimed money is eventually transferred to the Crown, usually to the Treasury or the Inland Revenue Department, or the Public Trust. 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] vulnerable customer group with complicated personal circumstances. Inland Revenue deals with approximately 164,000 parents who pay child support. It is important for Inland Revenue to take the time to get this right, particularly given current circumstances. 49 While Inland Revenue has demonstrated it can move products to new systems and processes remotely, the design and build phases for the core system have not been conducted remotely before. Typically, design and build require significant collaboration and this may not be as efficient and effective while the majority of Inland Revenue’s people are working remotely. This means it is highly likely that child support will be implemented later than April 2021 and that the end date of the programme will be pushed out beyond the expected end date of September 2021. 50 Inland Revenue does not expect the delay to be a lengthy one and is committed to completing transformation and closing down the programme as quickly as possible in 2021/22. The caveat will be the amount of additional COVID-19 related work we ask Inland Revenue to do. 51 It is too early yet for Inland Revenue to be definitive about what the re-planning of the final stage will mean for the timeframes and costs of the transformation programme. Inland Revenue is working through the options and is keeping the Minister of Finance and me fully informed. My working assumption is that Inland Revenue will complete transformation within the existing funding envelope approved in 2015 by government. A full update will be provided by Inland Revenue in its November 2020 report to Cabinet. The final stages of organisation design are also being re-planned 52 Proposed changes to Inland Revenue’s organisation design are being re-planned. This will help to ensure that Inland Revenue’s people can focus fully on supporting customers and our response to COVID-19 without the distraction of a consultation process. Inland Revenue had previously indicated (CAB-19-MIN-0583 refers) that further changes would take place during 2020 and 2021. This will now occur later than the timeframes originally envisaged. 53 Organisation change is still required in the near future to ensure that customers’ and the government’s needs can continue to be met, that the gains made by transformation are enduring, and that Inland Revenue can operate sustainably. Recognising the current environment, Inland Revenue’s current thinking is that organisational change will take place more incrementally over a sustained period during late 2020 and in 2021. An update will be provided in Inland Revenue’s November 2020 update to Cabinet. 54 Retaining resources for slightly longer than planned does provide some opportunities. It will better position Inland Revenue to provide on-going support to customers as we chart a course through COVID-19. 55 We could choose to leverage Inland Revenue’s capabilities to design and deliver our COVID-19 responses, after having considered the implications and trade-offs. This could also provide opportunities for other agencies to learn from Inland Revenue’s experience and expertise and to leverage the investment made in transformation. 56 Many agencies are alr eady doing so, particularly in the enterprise support services area. Inland Revenue has provided 32 other agencies with access to the common process model. The department is also working with a number of agencies, including Customs, StatsNZ and , t hat hav e c hos e n t o implement the cloud- Withheld under Section 9(2)(i) of the Official Information Act 1982. 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] based Oracle technology Inland Revenue is using to support their back-office functions. There could also be opportunities for other agencies to leverage the investment made in Inland Revenue’s core systems. 57 For Inland Revenue, retaining these resources provides the opportunity to ensure the capabilities delivered by transformation are more fully embedded so it can continue to deliver government priorities successfully in the future. There are some potential implications for benefit realisation 58 Realisation of the non-financial benefits of transformation, policy agility, system resilience and easier for customers, is already well-advanced. These benefits are expected to be fully realised by the close of the programme, albeit it is taking time for customers to get used to and trust new ways of doing things. 59 The re-planning of organisation design changes may have implications for Inland Revenue’s ability to realise the administrative savings. The savings have already been removed from outyear baseline funding so the challenge for Inland Revenue is to manage within a reduced funding level. These savings are part of the funding available for transformation. It is too early yet for Inland Revenue to say what the implications will be. 60 Realising further reductions in businesses’ compliance effort may be difficult to achieve in light of the economic impacts of COVID-19. The impacts may over-shadow businesses’ perception of the extent to which their compliance effort has changed. To date, the compliance effort for small and medium-sized enterprises has reduced as expected. 61 Realisation of additional Crown revenue may also be impacted. Inland Revenue will continue to maintain the integrity of the revenue system, leveraging the enhanced analytical capabilities now embedded that will be critical to helping customers to get things right and ensuring revenue leakage is minimised. 62 Inland Revenue will provide an update on progress on realising its benefit commitments in its November 2020 update. Risk remains high 63 While risk has reduced somewhat, it will remain high until transformation is complete. It is important to maintain momentum to ensure Inland Revenue moves completely off its heritage systems and processes. The department will go as fast as it can, as safely as it can. 64 The most significant risks I see for the remainder of the programme are: 64.1 The re-planning of the final stage and the work required to support our COVID-19 responses could slow programme momentum and make retaining key people more difficult. To mitigate this, a small group of people within the programme are focused on re-planning the final stage and on responding to COVID-19. This is enabling the majority of the programme team to remain focussed on their work. Inland Revenue has identified key people within the programme and has succession plans in place. 64.2 Moving child support to new systems and processes is more difficult than expected. To mitigate this, Inland Revenue will involve specialists from across its business and external stakeholders as appropriate to ensure the design of services meet 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] customers’ needs and that customers understand what is changing and why. Notwithstanding, there are likely to be difficulties as child support customers have complex circumstances and can be hard to reach. 64.3 Inland Revenue does not achieve all its benefits commitments. It is likely this risk will eventuate as a result of external factors or the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. As noted, there are potential implications for the financial benefits Inland Revenue committed to delivering. The Minister of Finance and I will be kept fully informed of any trade-offs that need to be made and any material changes will be brought to Cabinet to consider. 64.4 If COVID-19 and transformation work is not balanced appropriately, Inland Revenue may never complete transformation and will therefore be unable to fully migrate off heritage systems and processes. This would result in higher costs, as two core systems would have to be run and maintained indefinitely, higher operational risk due to on-going co-existence, and benefits not being fully realised. To mitigate this, the Minister of Finance and I will work with Inland Revenue to ensure an appropriate balance is maintained and that any trade-offs required are made visible. Next steps 65 The next steps are to: 65.1 complete the re-planning of the final stage of the programme by August 2020; 65.2 support the passage of the Child Support Amendment Bill which contains key transformation proposals; 65.3 continue with the on-going programme of independent quality assurance; and 65.4 provide a further progress update to Cabinet by November 2020. Consultation 66 A copy of this paper has been provided to the Accident Compensation Corporation; the Department of Internal Affairs; the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet; the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment; the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Social Development; the New Zealand Customs Service; and Stats NZ. Financial Implications 67 The proposals in this paper have no financial implications. Human Rights 68 The proposals in this paper have no human rights implications. Legislative Implications 69 The proposals in this paper do not require any changes to legislation. 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Regulatory Impact Analysis 70 The proposals in this paper do not require a Regulatory Impact Statement. Gender Implications 71 The proposals in this paper have no gender implications. Disability Perspective 72 The proposals in this paper have no implications for people with disabilities. Proactive Release 73 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, and associated minutes in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Central agencies’ comment (The Treasury, State Services Commission and Government Chief Digital Officer) Acknowledgement of success 74 The central agencies commend Inland Revenue on the scale of their achievement since the last Cabinet update. Inland Revenue has successfully gone-live with Release 4, the most technically difficult release to date, with minimal issues, and have played a central role in delivering the Government’s response to COVID-19 thus far. 75 Inland Revenue’s ability to play this role is in large part due to the capabilities business transformation has created. This is evidence that the programme is delivering on its policy agility and system resilience benefits commitments. These benefits are outlined in paragraphs 58 to 61. Risks to benefit realisation 76 Business transformation is tracking well on a technical level, but it remains an inherently high-risk programme that requires careful management to successfully complete. Central agencies have committed to work with Inland Revenue to ensure business transformation benefits are realised in a transparent and sustainable manner. 77 In our view, there are significant challenges to sustainably realising the projected revenue uplift and administrative savings, while also maintaining the tax system’s integrity at current levels. Inland Revenue’s current forecasted baselines implies a significant reduction in staff levels. There is a risk this decreases their ability to deliver their required outputs. COVID-19 and its related effects exacerbate these challenges and increases the risk that the programme’s benefits will not be sustainably realised. This risk has two main drivers: 77.1 Constrained administrative capacity: Inland Revenue has played a central role in supporting the Government’s COVID-19 response. The additional demands associated with the COVID-19 response have placed a heavy burden on the department’s administrative capacity. Administrative constraints arising from these additional demands will affect the ability of the department to deliver both business- as-usual functions and future releases of business transformation. 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 77.2 Changing environment: the economic landscape has changed significantly since the approval of the business case (not least because of the impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic). There is likely to be a greater demand for a different mix of outputs from Inland Revenue (e.g. direct customer contact and integrity activities). The full realisation of the financial benefits from business transformation may compromise the ability of the department to respond effectively to these changing demands. 78 While Cabinet has agreed to extra time-limited funding to mitigate the COVID impacts, this will not address the programme’s pre-existing challenges. Benefits prioritisation and next steps 79 Given the newly heightened risk environment, the Treasury agrees with Inland Revenue that it is necessary to re-plan the final stage of transformation. 80 Inland Revenue intends to report back to Cabinet on its benefit commitments in November. The Treasury recommends that this report back assess the impact of fully realising business transformation benefits on the delivery of the department’s outputs – and, in particular, on the department’s ability to deliver integrity activities. This will allow Ministers to consider the organisational impacts of future reductions in Inland Revenue’s baseline as a result of realising the business transformation benefits. 81 Any reduction in the size of business transformation’s financial benefits will have an ongoing fiscal impact, because the expected administrative savings have already been included in forecasted baselines. However, in light of the current and expected demands on Inland Revenue, the Treasury’s preliminary view is that integrity work and revenue uplift should be prioritised over the realisation of administrative savings. The Treasury will provide full advice on benefits prioritisation after the completion of the re-planning and benefit commitment update. 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommendations I recommend that the Committee: 1 note that Inland Revenue successfully migrated KiwiSaver and Student Loans to new systems and processes on 16 April 2020; 2 note that the final stage of the programme will not now be implemented as single release in April 2021 thereby delaying the closure of the transformation programme; 3 note that changes to Inland Revenue’s organisation design are being re-planned and will now be implemented incrementally during late 2020 and in 2021; 4 note that trade-offs may be required depending on any additional COVID-19 related work we ask Inland Revenue to do; 5 note the potential implications for realisation of financial benefits; 6 note that the next progress update will be provided to Cabinet by November 2020 and will include the revised timeframe for and, if necessary, costs of, the transformation programme.

BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION July 2021 Latest news about Inland Revenue's transformation Upcoming changes For more than four years we’ve been transforming how we deliver services to make tax and social policy fit seamlessly into people’s lives. This has included changes to policy, legislation and business processes, a new computer system, along with changes to the design and structure of our organisation. We’re now nearing the end and in October we’ll deliver the final elements of our business transformation. The October release includes implementing new child support legislation, moving child support into our new system and upgrading to the latest version of myIR, along with some other tax and social policy changes. We’ll tell you more about these changes in the coming months, but if you’d like to learn more visit ird.govt.nz/business-transformation-2021. Resurgence Support Payment Following the COVID-19 alert level increase on 23 June, applications are now open for the Resurgence Support Payment (RSP).

In addition to the RSP, there are other ways we can help. If your business is struggling due to COVID- 19, send us a message in myIR or visit ird.govt.nz/covid-19 for more information. Changes to child support legislation In April this year, we introduced some amendments to legislation around child support penalties. We no longer charge monthly incremental late payment penalties. Note: Any incremental penalties charged before 1 April 2021 will remain, but no further incremental penalties will be charged. We simplified the penalty write off rules: to make it easier to write-off existing incremental and initial late payment penalties; and change the treatment of initial late payment penalties to reduce the circumstances when they can be written off. Further changes from the Child Support Amendment Bill will come into effect in October and November this year. These will include: further changes to late payment penalties compulsory employer deductions of child support from salary and wages (for newly liable and returning liable customers) a four-year time bar on child support reassessments and applying for administrative reviews offsetting amounts owed (when two parents owe each other) new grounds for exemptions, and allowing liable parents living overseas to apply changes to key age-related definitions new timeframes for applying for, and providing, parenting orders allowing customers 28 days to advise of existing circumstances after their first assessment We’ll provide you with more information on these changes in the upcoming months. There will also be further changes in April 2022. If you’d like to know more you can refer to our website, the Child Support Amendment bill or our tax policy website. Payment options for overseas based customers We now have a range of payment options available for overseas customers, these include: Direct debit payments Overseas customers living in Australia, the United Kingdom, Europe (Single European Payments Area), Canada, and the United States can make one-off or ongoing direct debit payments through their myIR account. This option will be available for child support payments when child support moves into our new system as part of our next release in October. Money/telegraphic transfer ​ Customers can make payments to us through money transfer sites. A number of these sites do not charge fees for making international payments to us. Credit/debit card payments Customers can also make payments to us using a credit or debit card. Please note: From October 2021 overseas customers who pay their student loan and child support obligations by credit or debit card will be charged the convenience fee of 1.42%. This fee has always been applied to card payments by child support and student loans customers within New Zealand. We absorbed the fee for overseas based student loans and child support customers while they had limited payment options. For more information on the payment methods available visit: ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/make-a- payment/ways-of-paying New default providers announced for KiwiSaver In May, the Government announced new providers of KiwiSaver default funds as part of the KiwiSaver Default Provider Review. From 1 December the providers will be BNZ, Booster, BT Funds (Westpac), KiwiWealth, Simplicity, Smartshares (NZX). These changes only affect people in KiwiSaver who have not yet chosen their own KiwiSaver provider (default members). You can find out who your KiwiSaver provider is by using myIR or SPK2IR (if you have your IRD number) but you will need to contact your KiwiSaver provider to confirm if you are a default member. Inland Revenue does not hold this information. If you are a default member and are already with one of the above-named providers, you do not need to do anything. You will remain with your provider but your KiwiSaver savings will be moved to a balanced fund (from conservative) after 1 December. If you want to stay in a conservative fund for any reason, please contact your provider. If you are a default member and are not with one of the above-named providers, you do not need to do anything. After 1 December you will automatically be transferred to one of the new providers - we will send you an info pack once you have been transferred. If you don’t want to be moved for any reason, please contact your provider. A factsheet on how the changes may affect KiwiSaver members is on our website. Subscribe | Privacy | Copyright | Security | Contact us Webinars We’re kicking off a new series of webinars which will provide more detail on the changes you can expect to see in October. Our first webinars for businesses and employers; individuals and families; and intermediaries will be available on our webinar page (ird.govt.nz/bt-webinars) from 2 July. These webinars will provide an overview of the October changes.

BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION March 2020 Latest news about Inland Revenue's transformation Changes to be implemented over Easter Over the past week we have discussed the risks and benefits of going live now or at a later date with many senior business and tax industry stakeholders. Having considered the risks fully from all perspectives, we have decided that on balance, it is preferable to implement the latest round of our transformation changes over Easter as planned. In thinking about the option to delay, we recognised that the external risks at any future date are unknown. The Government has signalled that managing COVID-19 will be something that is ongoing for some time, and that includes managing the economic impacts. By upgrading our systems in line with our current plan, we increase our ability to respond swiftly which gives the Government more flexibility to help New Zealanders. A delay increases the risk that we won’t be able to meet customers’ needs. The changes we are introducing as part of the fourth transformation release will provide immediate and long-term benefits to New Zealand. Not making these changes would mean delaying the benefits and some are now more critical than ever. For example: People will be able to do more for themselves and apply for help if they need it through myIR. Any customer experiencing difficulties will be able to apply for relief through a simple, new myIR service – they will no longer have to ring us or fill in a form. Borrowers who are struggling to repay their student loans will be able to apply for a special deduction rate online – they won’t have to ring us or write to us. It will be easier for customers to get the help they need and will help to ensure their payment obligations reflect their current income. Employers will be able to set up instalment arrangements themselves online for any debt they owe instead of having to call us. The Government guarantee of employer KiwiSaver contributions (which can only be implemented in our new system) is more important than ever in the current environment. We will temporarily close to implement the changes IRD Business Transformation news Having trouble viewing this email? View Online As we have with our previous changes, we will temporarily close most of our customer facing systems while we implement our next round of changes. We have practised this closedown period, so we have a good idea of how much time is needed. Our priority is to have a stable system for customers and staff. We will turn off our current system from 3pm 9 April until the morning of 16 April. This includes two business days and our phone and online services will be unavailable during that time. Please note that on 16 April COVID-19 restrictions will still apply, front offices will be closed, and our phone services will be severely limited. During the closedown period, we will continue to support MSD in approving wage subsidy applications, and will continue to make all expected payments, including Working for Families payments. What this means for other activities during the closedown period: You can still pay your bill through your bank as you normally would and access our website (see also the payment options section below) If you have draft returns or draft secure mail in myIR, these will be deleted. Be sure to complete these before 3pm on Thursday 9 April so you don’t lose them. Employment Information (EI) returns for payday filing that are due over the temporary closedown can be filed on Friday 17 April. For returns due on 9 April note that our systems will be unavailable from 3pm. If you receive weekly or fortnightly Working for Families payments and are expecting a payment on either Tuesday 14 April or Wednesday 15 April, you will receive your payment early, on Thursday 9 April or Friday 10 April. Responding to COVID-19 Ensuring people get their entitlements, including their COVID-19 relief, is an essential service and Inland Revenue’s top priority. We are now required to operate very differently, including how we work with you. Our phone services are severely limited and the only effective way to contact us is online and through myIR. Please be assured that the people who work at Inland Revenue are doing their very best to make sure all New Zealanders get what they need as soon as they need it. Find out more at ird.govt.nz/covid19 COVID-19 Payment options Inland Revenue will write-off any penalties and interest for businesses unable to pay taxes on time due to the impact of COVID-19. Don’t worry about contacting us right now. Get in touch with us when you can. If you can pay there are several options - internet banking or myIR are the easiest. You can also make credit card or debit card payments over the phone or set up direct debit payments through your myIR account. For further details on alternative ways to pay your tax see: www.ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/make-a-payment/ways-of-paying Some Westpac branches will be open one day a week, on a Wednesday, during the COVID-19 lock- down. For more information on Westpac’s new branch opening hours please visit: www.westpac.co.nz/who-we-are/covid-19/branches-and-atms/ To help get correct payments to people we would like employers to still file their returns as normal. This helps us work out the right amounts for people and helps the Government continue to respond to what is happening in the economy. Please note: A further update will be sent to provide you with more information on remittance of use of money interest. COVID-19 Support for Business Research and Development (R&D) The Government recently passed some changes to the R&D Tax Incentive (RDTI) rules under urgency to provide extra cash support to R&D performing businesses, to help support them through the disruption caused by COVID-19. Broader refundability rules now apply (instead of the limited refundability rules previously in place) and are backdated to the beginning of the scheme (the 2019-20 income year). Businesses can still access the (previous) limited refundability rules, if they prefer these, in the first year of the scheme. Read the COVID-19: Support for Business R&D factsheet to find out more about what the broader refundability rules are and how you can access refundable credits. Seminars now online only We had planned to run a series of face to face seminars around the country to help employers, tax agents and bookkeepers prepare for our upcoming changes. In light of government advice around COVID-19 and the Level 4 precautions being implemented, the seminars are now being presented online, as recorded webinars. The on-demand seminars are available to watch at your convenience at: www.ird.govt.nz/webinars Presentation packs with speaker notes are also available to download. Making improvements to Inland Revenue's website Over the last year and a half, we’ve been working to improve our website, by rebuilding it on a modern and enduring platform so we can give our customers a great online experience. We’re nearing the end of this journey and to complete this process, we’re working to switch off the heritage website and subsites in the coming months. Switching off www.kiwisaver.govt.nz One of the sites we've turned off is the old KiwiSaver subsite – www.kiwisaver.govt.nz. This subsite was turned off on Wednesday 1 April. To ensure customers clicking on an old URL will still get to the new KiwiSaver material, we will provide temporary redirects for several months. Visit the new KiwiSaver material: www.ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver Beta version of the new and improved Tax Technical website available now We’re also building a new Tax Technical website to help people find tax technical answers more quickly. A beta test version of the site is now available from the main Inland Revenue website. If you’re interested, take a look now and familiarise yourself with the new look and feel, features and layout. You can also provide comments on the site by using the feedback button on the beta pages. Feedback we receive will help us to improve the site before the first release, likely to be in late April. We’ll continue to improve the site in stages throughout 2020. Visit the beta content here: www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz On-Demand webinars In April we will endeavour to bring you topic-based on-demand webinars. These are intended to be short presentations which provide you with more detail than our previous webinars. Some of the topics that will be included will be: Short-Process Rulings Investment Income filing Changes to payment methods We encourage you to keep an eye on www.ird.govt.nz/webinars, as these will be uploaded throughout April. The previous webinars that we ran from October 2019 through to March 2020 to help you prepare for Release 4 are also available to view on-demand.
ABOUT OUR BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION Email IRTransformation@ird.govt.nz for further information. BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION October 2021 Latest news about Inland Revenue's transformation Going live with our latest changes This month we will go live with the final phase of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. The improvements will build on the changes we’ve already introduced and will focus on bringing child support into our new system, implementing changes from The Child Support Amendment Act, upgrading to the latest version of myIR, as well as some other smaller changes. As with previous releases, we will need to temporarily closedown our services to allow for the system upgrade to take place. We will shut down our systems at 3pm on Thursday 21 October. From this time myIR secure online services and Gateway Services will be unavailable, and our offices and phone lines will be closed. All systems and services will resume from the start of business on Thursday 28 October. You can visit ird.govt.nz/service-update for more information. GST and provisional tax due date Thursday 28 October is a filing and payment deadline for many businesses, and we know there may be concern about our systems being closed in the week before this deadline. Particularly in light of the stress that the effects of COVID-19 are already placing on business. In response, Ministers have agreed (dependent on passing an Order in Council) that businesses and individuals will have more time to file and pay their GST and Provisional Tax that is currently due 28 October. Once the order passes, everyone will have until 4 November. IRD Business Transformation news Having trouble viewing this email? View Online Working for Families Tax Credits and paid parental leave payments Due to our temporary closedown, some Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC) and paid parental leave (PPL) payments will be paid early. Working for Families: Weekly Working for Families Tax Credit payments will be affected. The weekly payment you would normally receive on Tuesday 26 October or Wednesday 27 October will be paid early on Thursday 21 October or Friday 22 October. This means you will receive two payments in one week – Tuesday 19 October and Thursday 21 October or Wednesday 20 October and Friday 22 October. Fortnightly Working for Families Tax Credit payments are not affected. You will receive your payment on the day you normally receive them. Paid parental leave The fortnightly payment you would normally receive on Tuesday 26 October or Wednesday 27 October will be paid on Thursday 21 October, or Friday 22 October for some credit union customers. The first fortnightly payment following the upgrade will be paid on Tuesday 9 November, or Wednesday 10 November for some credit union customers. This means there will be a three-week gap between the last October payment and the first November payment. Payday filing Employment Information (EI) returns for Payday Filing that are due over the closure can be filed early. The days during the temporary shutdown will not count as working days for filing periods. Filing can be completed up to 3pm on Thursday 21 October and can be resumed from the start of business on Thursday 28 October. myIR drafts All draft requests in myIR need to be finalised and submitted by 3pm Thursday 21 October, otherwise they will be deleted as they can’t be transferred as part of the closedown process. •Pay your bill as you normally would from your bank (you won’t be able to set up direct debits to make payments or pay with your credit card within myIR). •Access general information from our IRD website, including accessing our webinars and landing pages on the October changes.

ABOUT BT | PUBLICATIONS | CURRENT PROGRESS Email IRTransformation@ird.govt.nz for further information. BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION September 2020 Latest news about Inland Revenue's transformation The final phase of IR's Business Transformation We’re on the home stretch! Inland Revenue is now in its final phase of business transformation. Over the last four years we’ve been making it simpler, open and more certain for New Zealanders to pay their taxes and receive their entitlements. We’ve gradually moved our tax and social policy products to a new tax administration system and made changes to policy, legislation, business processes as well as the design and structure of our organisation. In April this year we brought in the latest changes - almost entirely remotely, during the COVID level 4 lock down. We migrated the back-end processing of PAYE, student loans and KiwiSaver into our new system, further improved online services and web channels and implemented improvements to Working for Families. At the same time, we were managing a number of COVID-19 relief initiatives where the resilience and agility of the new system proved invaluable. For example, it took just 10 days from when the Government confirmed its intentions to establish the Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme until the Scheme was launched. Transformation the final phase We’re calling our final phase Stage 4 and it’s a little bit different from our other releases. Previously, our major releases have aligned with the beginning of the tax year in April. Given the impacts of COVID-19, a single large release in April 2021 isn’t possible so the changes are being implemented progressively. These changes will include moving all remaining tax and social policy products into our new system (including child support, paid parental leave, foreign trusts and duties) and upgrading myIR to a new version (Version 12): The first changes, including paid parental leave, will go live on 1 March 2021 The second release, including child support and the myIR upgrade, is planned for October 2021 IRD Business Transformation news Having trouble viewing this email? View Online We’ll also bring in a series of other, mostly smaller, changes throughout Stage 4. Many of the Stage 4 changes will only impact specific, and sometimes very small, groups of customers. We’ll connect with these customers to ensure they understand how the changes may impact them and will continue to provide everyone else with an overview. Legislation Some changes will include legislation change and our proposed policy changes won’t be finalised until the legislation is passed. Transition We remain committed to completing our transformation as quickly as possible and this is currently planned for early 2022. This includes transitioning the programme's knowledge, practices and processes to the business which will progressively take over the controls as the programme winds down and decommissioning the old systems. We’ll tell you more about this, and what it means for you, during Stage 4. Small Business Cashflow Scheme notifications Since May this year, we’ve helped more than 96,250 small to medium sized businesses ease their COVID-19 related financial pressures, with a one-off business loan. With key loan milestones quite a way off for many, we’re aware that some businesses may be worried about being caught off-guard and missing payments or owing additional interest. To ease this burden and provide peace of mind, we’ve built notifications into our system. This means that we’ll automatically notify Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme (SBCS) borrowers ahead of key events. These could include interest starting to accrue if the loan hasn’t been repaid in full within the first year, or when regular loan instalment payments are about to start. Customers with myIR will receive these notifications in their myIR account, while those without a myIR account will receive a letter. The deadline for applications for the SBCS close at the end of the year.

Transition and Business Integration Briefing Pack November 2020 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] •The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the approach to transition planning and management for the BT Programme, to inform external and internal stakeholders in regards to how the programme will be concluded at the completion of the Stage 4 plan. •The planned end date for the BT Programme is 30 June 2022, however as n oted in the Baseline 9 PGC paper, the programme activity will have in the main completed by end of December 2021, with the remaining team focussed on decommission and archiving and closure of the programme. Purpose \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Develop and or transition the processes, frameworks and methods (collectively the “ways of working”) that the BT programme has built up over the course of the transformation timeframe, to the post-BT business units. Support and ensure that all transitioning components are in place to allow business units to self- manage post BT. Form in conjunction with the FOM ( Future Operating Model team), thedetailed plan to formally close out the BT programme ensuring that an appropriate transition time is allocated and that transition risk is mitigated. The transition plan will be progressively implemented, in stages,in line with the establishment of the organisation change, the future operating model and the completion of the BT delivery plan. Background and Introduction \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Objectives •Develop and or transition the processes, frameworks and methods (collectively the “ways of wo rking”) that the BT programme has built up over the course of the transformation timeframe, to the post-BT business units. •Support and ensure that all transitioning components are in place to allow business units to s elf -manage post BT. •Form in conjunction with the FOM ( Future Operating Model team), thed etailed plan to formally close out the BT programme ensuring that an appropriate transition time is allocated and that transition risk is mitigated. •The transition plan will be progressively implemented, in stages,i n line with the establishment of the organisation change, the future operating model and the completion of the BT delivery plan. Deliverables 1.A BT Programme Transition Plan i ncluding a formal readiness and transition process.The plan will be aligned to both the BT Stage 4 delivery plan and the plan that will establish the post BT organisation and future operating model. 2.A det ailed plan to close the BT programme in line with the BT Transition Plan ( the BT resource master list reflecting transition approach at an individual level if required). 3.Includes the safe s torage and archival of all BT Programme collateral that is considered enduring.This will be the Transformation library or enduring collateral / artefacts ( Huringa ( Transformation) a section of the new HaukāingaIR site). 4.Knowledge and formal / informal responsibility transfer as part of the transition, a nd this will be executed in alignment with the well tested BT change management method. BT Transition Objectives and Deliverables \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] BT Transition Planning Approach - 5 - BT Transition planning is based around two major areas of activity that the programme currently is responsible for including: 1.Programme specific activities –activities that are specific to delivering the programme Stage 4 scope and plan, these activities are resourced to deliver the programmes agreed scope and achieve the committed outcomes. The resources that undertake these activities are required until those activities are completed, and the scope delivered. The transition approach for these resources is a scheduled “roll off” at a time aligned to the Baseline 9 plan. It is likely that some allowance will be needed for knowledge transfer where applicable. 2.Enduring services and activities –activities that the programme undertakes that will endure post BT, these services and activities are currently the responsibility of the programme however as the future operating model is forming, the activities will progressively transition to the new business units, and subject to a formal transition process including agreed knowledge and responsibility transfer, the programme will cease to provide the services or lead and or resource the activities. The BT Transition Plan will be formally documented, and progressed through the appropriate governance forums including the PGC. The transition plan will be tracked with regular progress reporting in place. At the conclusion of programme specific activities and on ceasing to be responsible for enduring services, the BT Programme will formally close \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] BT Transition Planning Scope - 6 - In scope for BT Transition planning includes strong linkages to the following newly established business groups of Corporate and Enabling Services specifically: 1.Enterprise Design and Integrity (ED&I)– for enterprise functions including strategic architecture, strategic portfolio stewardship, and governance. 2.Customer & Compliance Services Planning, Design & Delivery (CCS PD&D) – for planning, design and delivery capability, and customer experience design. This area has responsibility for START delivery in the main, together with customer experience design and START gateway services. In addition to START, responsibilities include delivery of the voice channel including responsibility for the customer contact centre systems. 3.Enterprise Services (ES) –in relation to Technology Services, Enterprise Service Delivery, change 4.Information & Intelligence Services (I&IS) Marketing and Communications, Digital Content Management –Planning Design & Delivery, and Information Sharing The BT transition and business integration team have been working with the future operating model team to map the enduring services and activities undertaken by the programme to the new business groups. This has been done to a level of detail that enables the capture of required knowledge and responsibility transfer, frameworks, processes, tools etc. Note that people transition in relation to IR employees is the responsibility of the future operating model team. Transition of programme fixed term resources, contractors and consultants is the responsibility of the BT programme. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 1. Transition Planning Approach – ED&I - 7 - Add the overview content of the interaction of BT with ED&I including portfolio management, PMO, tools, planning processes etc And also to governance And strategic architecture Should include a high level view of transition activities and potential timing.... Transition state 1 – by March 2021 Transition state 2 – by June 2021 Transition state 3 – by September 2021 ( final transition point ?) At this stage BT programme will only retain enough PMO resourcing to complete programme activities ( lean PMO). \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 2. Transition Planning Approach –CCSPD&D - 8 - Add the overview content of the interaction of BT with CCSPD&D including START planning, design and delivery, customer contact centre etc etc... And also to production support And solution architecture and design – how this will interact with the broader ED&I strategic architecture Should include a high level view of transition activities and potential timing... Transition state 1 – by March 2021 Transition state 2 – by June 2021 Transition state 3 – by November 2021 Final Transition state 4 – by January 2022 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4. Transition Planning Approach –II&S - 9 - Most of this has already happened – WWW fully transitioned,, DIP transitioned etc Final Transition – by end of June 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] a.Criticalityto the programme or to IR operations (operations could be disrupted) b.Complexityof transition – scale of knowledge transfer, current capability, technology c.Capacityt o transition – constraints due to current programme delivery and/or business work programme d.Timingof transition – constraints due to decommissioning, vendor off-boarding, delivery of work programme completed. Transition prioritisation criteria and approach A numerical impact rating is then assigned to categorise the capability, service or system into the following groups: •Group A H igh Priority (rating of 9 to 12) •Group B M edium Priority(rating of 5 to 8) •Group C Low Priority (r ating of 4 to 1) •Group D Already transitioned/in progress ( no numerical rating) The BT change impact rating scale has been adapted for the Transition Plan. Enduring capabilities, services and systems are catagorised using the criteria below and assigned a RAG rating. A more detailed view is included in the appendix Assuming that there are no mitigations in place at the time of prioritisation, each item is assessed on the following criteria: \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] •Transition Checkpoint Milestone:by December 2020,Release 4 closed out,the business peak cycle concluded, the Election outcome is known, and any change impacts identified, the programme is be well progressed with the first release of START delivery for Stage 4.ESS Release 3 concluded and a decision made on payroll. Areas of the programme identified for transition that have completed the planned process, knowledge and responsibility transfer will be transitioned to business as usual. •Transition Checkpoint Milestone:b y June 2021, the first release of START delivery for Stage 4 will be completed,the second release of START delivery will be well progressed, The Intel Led Workstream will have concluded and completely transitioned to BAU, the majority of the technical changes for TLO would have completed with the exception of the Contact Centre migration.Decommission will is progressing and ESS will be well progressed on the completion of the final release.All technology processes, knowledge and responsibilities will be transitioned to business as usualincluding all environment services, testing services and other similar capabilities. •Transition Checkpoint Milestone :b y December 2021,the second and final START releases of Stage 4 will be completed and early life support in progress.At this point FIRST will no longer be processing and the decommission process can commence.The programme close down plan will commence in October 2021, with the majority of resources departing the programme around this timeframe, unless they are required for final support, decommissioning, transition support or ESS completion.All finalprocesses, knowledge and responsibilities will have been transitioned to BAU. •Transition Checkpoint Milestone:b y March 2022,the final transition activities and decommissioning is in progress,the ESS Workstream is concluded and \[Information redacted\] decommissioning is commenced.Physical decommission of the \[Information redacted\] Data Centres willoccur in this timeframe and is a progressive process. •Transition Checkpoint Milestone :b y June 2022Programme closure and archiving activities are completed and the formal and final reporting is completed. The \[Information redacted\] Data Centres are closed and physical decommission well progressed,there may be final destruction activities requiring oversight by a BAU team. A final Post-Implementation Review (PIR) may be progressed in early 2022. Transition and Business Integration High Level Plan Dates - 11- 1 2 3 4 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] •The mapping of these elements will need to be validated by primary stakeholders both within BT and the business and will provide input into the Transition Roadmap. •The Roadmap will include agreed start d ates and appropriate checkpoints (as per the Transition Readiness Framework) to ensure that we allow enough time for the knowledge and responsibility transfer to bed in to our Future Operating Model. Transition Roadmap •Transition and Business Integration have used the following documents to identify a number of enduring elements that will need to transition from BT to the business: -Business Transformation Programme Transition Planning (for input into Baseline 9), and -Future Operating Model – p acks and information provided by FOM team •Mapping exercises have been held in conjunction with members of the Future Operating M odel Team to align enduring elements with the areas of the business which will take responsibility for the frameworks, processes, models tools and knowledge that currently sit w i t h B T. EXAMPLE \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] a.Criticalityto the programme or IR operations could be disrupted b.Complexityof transition – scale of knowledge transfer, current capability, technology c.Capacityt o transition – constraints due to current programme delivery and/or business work programme d.Timingof transition – constraints due to decommissioning, vendor off- boarding, delivery of work programme completed. Prioritisation criteria and approach - 13 Enduring capabilities, services and systems are catagorised using the BT change impact methodology. Assuming that there are no mitigations in place at the time of prioritisation, each item is assessed on the following criteria: Example \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Knowledge Transfer Approach - 14 Knowledge transfer forms part of the overall change management approach set out in the Transition Plan and runs through the course of the period of Transition. The Knowledge Transfer Approach sets out the process for transition by identifying, organising, transferring, and measuring the movement of knowledge into a repository called Huringa which houses the library created specifically in SharePoint to capture all the enduring artefacts that the business will need to continue to operate successfully post BT. Further detail can be foundhere. Identify - where we are currently •Knowledge Transfer Approach is developed and tested through s everal pilot groups. •Processes created for engaging with BT to facilitate the knowledge transfer in alignment with Information and Knowledge Management principles. Obtain and organise •Knowledge Transfer Approach agreed and built into Transition Roadmap for enduring elements. •Engagement with BT areas to transition begins, workshops and interviews set up to facilitate the transfer of explicit and tacit knowledge into the Huringa library. Transfer, measure and evaluate •Transfer of knowledge continues and tracked as part of Transition Readiness checkpoints. •Post-transfer support established. •Lessons learnt are captured and fed back to the organisation as part of the overarching Information and Knowledge Management principles. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Transition Readiness Framework - 15 •The purpose of the Transition Readiness Approach will be to allow primary stakeholders to contribute to readiness assessment and decision making as enduring capabilities, services and systems transition from the programme to the business. Stakeholders will be identified as part of the Stakeholder Engagement Plan. •The BT Readiness Framework approach will be used to provide the structure and purpose for readiness checklists, assessments and reports used atkey checkpoints leading up to and during transition.It will enable the assessment of progress and readiness of enduring capabilities, services and systems transition by tranche. •Readiness will be assessed at each of the checkpoints against a specific set of criteria, with residual risk visible throughout. •Criteria (or questions) will be specific to each transition and will collectively reflect the readiness of our organisation, Programme and where appropriate, external stakeholders. The cumulative impact of Stage 4, FOM, other business activity and environmental conditions will also be taken into consideration. •Each subsequent Transition Readiness assessment will allow for exception reporting via an executive summary to be tailored for organisation, BT programme and external stakeholders. •The IR Enterprise Risk Framework and RAG status definitions will be used to provide a consistent, familiar and standardreference. A Transition Readiness Framework is required as part of the overall Transition Plan to assess and report readiness to transition accountability/responsibility \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Huringa ( Transformation enduring library) •Huringa is a new SharePoint library created to capture all the enduring artefacts to be transitioned from the BT Programme to the business. These artefacts will enable the business to continue to operate successfully post BT. •Huringa is distinct from Te Uma ngaHou – the Business Transformation SharePoint site which will be closed out at the end of the Programme.Huringa will remain after BT has closed down. •T&BI will work across BT to determine what needs to be captured for tr ansitioning to the business. Collateral will be carefully managed so that only the enduring items that IR needs to be self-sufficient going forward will be placed there in a logical and easy to access approach. Approach •Workshops will be held with BT workstreams to introduce Huringa, set e xpectations, walk through examples and to help identify what will be enduring. •Guidance documentation has also been developed to help our BT people d etermine what needs to be transitioned and how to move those artefacts into Huringa. •A Teams space will be set up for additional support and to drive e ngagement with communications, quick surveys, FAQ’s, stand ups, workshop recordings and presentations. Timeline •A pilot of Huringa and this transition approach is being planned for during t he week of 9-13 November with the Digital Experience, Non-Production Environments, BT testing and Cloud Services workstreams. • •H uringa will be launched to wider IR early next year in February allowing everyone to open and view artefacts and see the transition progress. Key features •A single register containing (or linking to) a ll the key collateral that the programme has collected and curated since inception. •Only final artefacts will be stored in H uringa. Documents still owned and being used by BT will be “linked” within Huringa until they are ready to be handed over. •Each item will be tagged with: - Short description/narrative - Transition status - Change size - Decomposition of the enduring s ervices in the new organisation - Related phase of change - Related system - BT workstream and BT owner - Business person responsible and acco untable •Will be “integrated” with the new internal website, Haukāinga. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Stakeholder Engagement and Communications Transition and Business Integration will engage and communicate with mainly two audiences within BT and the business: -Those who will help T &BI achieve its goals, and -Those who will con tribute to and be interested in the transition of enduring processes into the business. Stakeholders and audiences are broadly categorised using the Satisfy, Manage, Inform and Engage framework to identify the level and style of engagement required for each group.

Transition and business integration
===================================

As part of the final stage of the transformation, the Transition and Business Integration Workstream focused on support and transition of the Business Transformation programme’s knowledge, practices, and processes back to the organisation. The aim was to enable Inland Revenue to progressively take on the responsibility for delivering change, allowing the programme to step away and gradually wind down.

This would ensure the organisation was set up to deliver continuous improvement as part of its ongoing business to reflect the needs of customers and any future changes in the tax and social policy landscape.

Take a planned and managed approach
-----------------------------------

A key success factor was that we started to develop a planned and managed approach to transition from programme mode to what would become ‘business as usual’ as early as possible. It’s important that the transition is structured with adequate time and resources as it is not something that would happen on its own with a programme of this scale.

We started the transition and business integration work when a team was in place to design Inland Revenue’s future operating model in July 2020. This was 2 years before the Business Transformation programme would officially end.

We first did some mapping to identify the high-level business transformation services and activities that would need to continue after the programme closed. The questions we tried to address together with the future operating model team were: what are those things we do today in the programme from a future operating model point of view, where do those things fit, and what do we need to do?

Based on the design of the new operating model and results from our mapping, we developed the Business Transformation transition planning approach. This outlined when, how and to whom business transformation services and activities would be transitioned. Timing of transition to specific parts of the organisation was aligned to the transformation programme deliverables and the establishment of the operating model changes.

Following on from that, we created and put in place the following:

*   Organisation impact assessment and Change implementation plan.
*   Stakeholder engagement and Communications plan.
*   Transition readiness framework for primary stakeholders to contribute to a readiness assessment at key checkpoints leading up to and during transition.
*   Knowledge transfer approach for transferring both explicit and tacit programme knowledge into an online repository of:
    *   insights
    *   tools
    *   templates, and
    *   other collateral in areas like business design, change management, communications, delivery and testing that can be easily accessed across the organisation.
*   Responsibility transfer plan that set out how and when the transfer of responsibility of activities from the programme to business as usual would occur.
*   Detailed transition plans by group including the transition roadmap of when and to whom responsibility was planned to transfer from the programme. As part of this, we conducted detailed mapping of services, activities, processes, and so on to make sure we were not missing anything.

Progress on transition and business integration was tracked through regular reporting and at the appropriate governance forums.

Partner with leaders across the organisation
--------------------------------------------

We approached the transition and business integration as a partnership between the programme and groups across the organisation, gradually shifting responsibility for driving the transition from the programme to the various leaders. This was key to ensure a smooth transition of process and appropriate services and activities from the programme move to their new owners at the right time.

A year and half prior to the programme’s closure
------------------------------------------------

Readiness was programme-led to make sure stakeholders in both the programme and appropriate groups in the organisation were aware of the transition, understood transition accountabilities and responsibilities, and prepared for the transition.

One year before the programme ended
-----------------------------------

Transition readiness gradually shifted to the appropriate groups.

This shift was aligned to the establishment of the new operating model. Once the future organisation was in place, we worked closely with the newly-confirmed leaders to develop the transition details for each organisational area. To progress transition planning and decision-making, we had regular joint working sessions with leaders and representatives.

Over time, our role in the workstream shifted to facilitator:

*   helping groups work on the finer details such as addressing gaps in the transition of business transformation services and activities
*   mapping out where the appropriate tools and business processes that the programme is responsible for will move within the organisation, and
*   identifying and understanding the integration points with other groups.

The Business Transformation programme could in some ways be considered like scaffolding, supporting Inland Revenue as the new groups and teams are being established. The programme’s scaffolding structures were significant at the beginning and then it progressively came down until nothing remained of the programme leaving Inland Revenue’s new operating model.

Give your people a proper send-off
----------------------------------

As a programme wraps up, people leave to their new or substantive roles within the organisation or leave altogether. It is important to not only complete the appropriate administration processes but to thank people for their contributions and give them a proper send-off.

As we wanted to let people leaving the programme determine how they would like to be farewelled, we created a community on our internal social media site called ‘BT Leavers‘ for people to use as an option to say goodbye to their programme colleagues as well as recognise those who were leaving.

Treatment of distributions from cooperatives
============================================

2006 amendment to the dividend rules ensures certain payouts remain deductible to cooperatives and taxable in the hands of members at their marginal tax rate.

### Sections CD 1B, CD 24B and DV 10B of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section 74D of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968

To remove uncertainty in the treatment of payouts made by cooperatives to their members, an amendment to the dividend rules ensures that certain payouts are not treated as dividends but remain deductible to the cooperative and taxable in the hands of members at their marginal tax rate.

### Background

Cooperatives can deduct distributions of profits arising from transactions with their members under the mutuality provisions contained in section HF 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. Under the general deductibility provisions, however, it was not clear whether cooperatives could treat profits from activities not associated with members in the same manner – for example, investment activities that do not relate to the purchase or supply of product to or from the member.

The amendment clarifies the legislation and ensures that payouts from cooperatives, including value-added components from non-member transactions, will not be treated as dividends and will continue to be deductible subject to certain criteria.

The deductible treatment of payouts applies to most types of cooperatives, including those that receive payments from member shareholders and purchase product on their behalf (such as trading cooperatives).

Payouts from cooperatives to charities and exempt taxpayers will receive the same treatment as taxpaying shareholders. This means that payouts to exempt taxpayers will not be taxed. This treatment is in line with the policy objective of not taxing such organisations.

### Key features

Section CD 24B ensures that New Zealand cooperative companies (or wholly owned subsidiaries of cooperative companies) may elect to exclude certain distributions made by or to members from being a dividend.

For the payout to be excluded from being a dividend and therefore deductible, it must be connected to the supply of trading stock traded between the cooperative and the member. This ties any payout from the cooperative to the member to the sale or receipt of goods. The principal purpose of holding any shares in a cooperative must be for the trade in a product with the cooperative. If a member holds shares in the cooperative and those shares are not required in order to trade with the cooperative, any distribution relating to those shares will be treated as a dividend.

The following further criteria must be met for a distribution to be excluded from being treated as a dividend:

*   The cooperative company has reasonable grounds to believe that the member receiving the distribution is resident in New Zealand or has a fixed establishment in New Zealand at the time the distribution is made.
*   The distribution must relate to the sale and purchase of tangible property. Payouts relating to the sale of intangibles, such as services and financing, will not be allowed to be deducted as trading stock by the cooperative.
*   The distribution must relate to current trading stock that is not sold as part of the disposal of a business. Section DV 10B ensures that a payout from a cooperative will be treated as deductible expenditure to the cooperative if it meets the criteria outlined in section CD 24B.

Section 74D in the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 ensures that this type of payout made by a cooperative company to a member of that company is not treated as a dutiable gift.

### Application date

The exclusion of payouts from the definition of a dividend will apply from the 2005–06 and subsequent income years.

Trinity avoidance scheme
========================

2013 case note – Trinity avoidance scheme - strike out, judicial bias, presumptive bias, nullity, functus officio, finality principle, jurisdiction.

Case

Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Limited and Bristol Forestry Venture Limited, Clive Richard Bradbury and Gregory Alan Peebles v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

High Court Rules

### Summary

The Judgment upheld the application by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") to dismiss or strike out the claim of judicial bias against Venning J in regard to his 2004 Judgment where he held the Trinity scheme was tax avoidance.

### Impact of decision

This decision confirms that where an appellate court has determined an appeal, the trial court does not have jurisdiction to set aside its original judgment on the grounds of bias - it is a matter that needs to be appealed.

### Facts

The Judgment relates to an application by the Commissioner to dismiss/strike out the taxpayers' (Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Limited and others, "Ben Nevis") claim of judicial bias against Venning J ("the Judge") for his 2004 decision regarding the Trinity scheme ("the 2004 Judgment"). The bias being alleged is that (at \[3\]):

*   … when the Judge delivered the 2004 Judgment he was liable to the Commissioner in respect of certain duties arising out of his own investment in a forestry investment trust. Ben Nevis says that the Judge was, as a result, "beholden" to the Commissioner.

It was further submitted that the result of the alleged bias is that the 2004 Judgment is a nullity.

The Commissioner filed a protest under rule 5.49 of the High Court Rules on the basis that the High Court is now functus officio and therefore has no jurisdiction to set aside the 2004 Judgment. The Commissioner also applied to dismiss or strike out the proceedings on jurisdictional grounds, submitting any challenge to the 2004 Judgment can only be heard by an appellate court.

### Decision

#### _Nullity_

The Court was required to determine whether the 2004 Judgment was a nullity that Ben Nevis would have been entitled (prior to any appeals) to have set aside in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction.

Katz J stated that she had "real reservations as to whether allegations of bias (as opposed to breaches of the right to be heard) are appropriately dealt with as 'nullities', other than in the clearest of cases" at \[30\].

Katz J further stated that it must be at least arguable that the 2004 Judgment could have been challenged as a nullity prior to the decision being appealed.

The Court (at \[49\]) found the allegation that the 2004 Judgment was a nullity because the Judge was presumptively biased due to an alleged tax obligation that resulted in him being "beholden" to the Commissioner was:

*   … (an allegation which the Court of Appeal has previously suggested was "startling" and lacking in any evidential foundation). The rule against bias is an aspect of natural justice. However, the allegations of presumptive bias in this case are far removed from the facts of any previous case where a judgment or order has been found to be a "nullity". The nullity exception is usually applied where a procedural breach is both obvious and egregious.

#### _Jurisdiction_

The Court was then required to decide whether it had jurisdiction to set aside the 2004 Judgment following its appeals.

It stated that to declare the 2004 Judgment a nullity it would have to declare the subsequent appeals of the 2007 Court of Appeal and 2008 Supreme Court decisions to be nullities. Further, a re-hearing could not take place unless the High Court set aside the decisions of both the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.

Katz J stated (at \[48\]) that:

*   Once a final judgment has been delivered a court is functus officio, consistent with the principle that litigation must have a defined end point (the finality principle). In the interest of justice, however, courts have recognised some limited exceptions to the finality principle. These include where a judgment is a "nullity" because, for example, it was delivered without one party having been heard (a breach of natural justice). If a judgment is a nullity, the Court which delivered it can generally set it aside, without the need for an appeal.

The Court went on to state that had this case not been previously appealed, it would have been reluctant to dismiss the proceedings solely on jurisdictional grounds. The reasoning being (at \[50\]) that "\[i\]f there is room for reasonable doubt as to whether jurisdiction exists, it will rarely (if ever) be appropriate to dismiss proceedings on the basis of lack of jurisdiction".

However, the Court noted (at \[51\]) that the case is different if a decision has already been appealed, stating:

*   … it is not, in my view, even remotely arguable that this Court now has jurisdiction to set aside the 2004 Judgment. To hear determine \[the bias\] proceedings would require the High Court to disregard the hierarchical nature of our court system and, in effect, declare the decisions of the superior courts to be nullities. The relief sought by Ben Nevis is indisputably beyond the jurisdiction of this Court.

The Court dismissed the proceedings.

Trinity investor’s application to set aside the commissioner’s statutory demand dismissed by High Courts
========================================================================================================

2013 case note – High Court dismisses Trinity Scheme investor's application to set aside CIR's statutory demand – liquidation, recall.

Case

Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2013\] NZCA 2818

Legislative References

Companies Act 1993, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

An application made by the plaintiff to set aside the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") statutory demand application. The plaintiff submitted that the amount claimed by the Commissioner was yet to be determined. The Court found that the amount owing had been determined in an earlier judgment and ordered the plaintiff to pay the sum of $819,268.18 within 10 working days of this judgment.

### Impact of decision

Pending challenges as to a loss attributing qualifying company's ("LAQC") shareholder's tax liability will not be sufficient ground to set aside a statutory demand requiring payment from the LAQC.

### Facts

Redcliffe Forestry Venture Limited ("the plaintiff") applied for various orders relating to a statutory demand which was served. The statutory demand is sought by the Commissioner for the payment of $819,268.18, made up of tax shortfall penalties and interest for the 1998 tax year arising from Redcliffe's involvement in the Trinity tax avoidance arrangement.

The Supreme Court in 2008 found the plaintiff liable for shortfall penalties (_Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289 at \[210\]–\[215\]). The plaintiff was a party to the challenge to the Commissioner's assessment under Part 8A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") which was heard before Venning J as a hearing authority and subsequently upheld by the Court of Appeal (_Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2007\] NZCA 230, (2007) 23 NZTC 21,323) and the Supreme Court (_Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_, \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289).

### Decision

#### Substantial dispute

The plaintiff submitted that the Commissioner's claim was a claim for a contingent or prospective composite sum, the amount of which was yet to be determined. It was submitted that the amount would not be known until the challenges made by the shareholders had been determined and that a separate calculation was required by virtue of section 141(3) of the TAA.

The Court determined that the calculation had already been undertaken and approved by the courts' decisions taken in their capacity as hearing authority and the subsequent appellate courts. Faire AJ concluded that there was no substantial dispute in that the plaintiff had failed to make out a case based on section 290(4)(a) of the Companies Act 1993. The debt is due.

#### Recall application

An application to the Supreme Court was made by the plaintiff after the hearing, to recall a paragraph (paragraph 214) of the Supreme Court judgment (_Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289). Faire AJ found that this application confuses the judgment on the one hand with the reasons for the judgment on the other. He found that the formal judgment is admissible evidence of the outcome of the case and that without recall of the formal judgment the result as pronounced by the Supreme Court stands.

#### Other grounds

The Court considered the decision in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Chester Trustee Services Ltd_ \[2003\] 1 NZLR (CA) 395 at \[3\] where it was observed that:

*   All cases involving s 290(4)(c) must in the end come down to a judgment by the Court as to whether the creditor's prima facie entitlement is outweighed by some factor or factors making it plainly unjust for liquidation to ensue.

Guidance was also given by the Court of Appeal in _AMC Construction Ltd v Frews Contracting Ltd_ \[2008\] NZCA 389, (2008) 19 PRNZ 13 at \[7\] stating that:

*   … it is difficult to imagine circumstances in which the company should be able to avoid paying a debt, merely by proving that it is able to pay that debt. If the debt is indisputably owing, then it should be paid.

The Court considered the alternative ground referred to in the papers that relied on section 290(4)(c) of the Companies Act 1993. The argument was based on there being an abuse of process due to the fact that challenges to assessments that had been filed by the shareholders had not been concluded. Faire AJ concluded that that matter is no answer to the plaintiff's liability to the Commissioner, having regard to the Supreme Court's decision and that there were no proper grounds for applying section 290(4)(c) to this case.

#### Liquidation

In respect of immediate liquidation, both parties advised that they did not wish to contest the conclusions that were set out in \[49\] to \[57\] of the judgment in Bristol Forestry Ventures Ltd \[2013\] NZHC 2384 case. It was therefore concluded that it was not an appropriate case to order the immediate winding up of the company and the appointment of a liquidator.

The plaintiff was ordered to pay the sum of $819,268.18 within 10 workings days of the judgment. In the event of default of payment, the Commissioner is permitted to make an application to put the plaintiff into liquidation.

Trinity investors lose appeal
=============================

2007 case note - Court of Appeal dismissed the taxpayer's appeal and upheld the finding that the Trinity Forestry arrangement is a tax avoidance scheme.

Case

Accent Management Ltd, Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd, Bristol Forestry Ventures Ltd, Clive Bradbury, Greenmass Ltd, Gregory Peebles, Kenneth Laird Estate, Lexington Resources Ltd, and Redcliffe Forestry Ventures Ltd v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

The Court of Appeal has dismissed the taxpayers appeal and upheld the finding that the Trinity Forestry arrangement is a tax avoidance scheme.

### Background

This was an appeal against the judgment of Venning J _Accent Management Ltd & Ors v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2000) 22 NZTC 19,027 in which he upheld tax avoidance assessments and 100% shortfall penalties against the taxpayers who were investors in the Trinity forestry scheme.

The Court of Appeal has dismissed the appeal and ordered the appellants to pay costs to the Commissioner.

### Facts

Investors in the Trinity scheme acquired licences to use land for forestry purposes. The purpose of the licences was cultivation of Douglas fir trees, and the duration was 50 years, which approximates one Douglas fir growing cycle.

The licence agreement purported to give no title to the land or the trees but gave rights to proceeds of sale of the trees after deduction of various charges. The investors agreed by promissory note to pay a fixed price for the licence in 50 years time. The up-front licence fees paid to the landowner exceeded the cost of the land.

Investors in the scheme in the 1997 year (Tranche1) also took out a loss of surplus insurance policy under which the insurer assumes risk for a stipulated value of the forest in the final year of the scheme. The value is the amount the investors must pay for the licence in 2047. Payment of the insurance premiums was also largely on a deferred basis with a small cash payment in 1997 and a further amount by promissory note for payment in 2047. Over 99% of the total expenditure claimed over the life of the investment, and 87% of the expenditure claimed for the first (1997) year was deferred until the year 2047.

The investors contended that the insurance premium and forestry agency fees were deductible in full in the first year, being the year in which they are incurred and that the licence fee was deductible as depreciable intangible property under Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The licence fee cost was the combination of the initial payment and the amount due in year 50, which is amortised over the 50 year duration of the licence.

### Decision

The Court of Appeal dealt with the issues in the following way (and order):

**Sham** - Because the insurance policy creates separate insurance arrangements, it would be possible to treat the insurance arrangements as a sham in relation to the investors associated with Dr Muir and Mr Bradbury only, but while there was artificiality, pretence, and concealment \[on their part\], it could not be said that Muir and Bradbury intended the provisions regarding the wash-up of the scheme to be a dead letter, although the Court saw this aspect of the case as closely balanced. The Court held that the state of mind of Muir and Bradbury could best be categorised as involving indifference as to whether the wash-up transactions occurred.

**Spreading of insurance deductions under the accruals regime** - The Court held for the Commissioner on his cross-appeal that the deductions for insurance premiums are accruals expenditure and are required to be spread over the life of the policy. The Court held that the High Court has misappliedEH 2 in its decision. However, because of the Court's findings on tax avoidance, this point was of no ultimate importance.

**Licence premium deductibility under section EG 1** \- The Court held for the taxpayers on this issue and said that the issue was one of statutory and not contractual interpretation, and that it must ignore elements of the scheme which are primarily relevant to tax avoidance arguments. Accordingly, the Court thought that if the whole of the licence premium had been paid at the outset, the Commissioner would have treated it as the cost of a right to use land, thus able to be depreciated over the term of the venture. It therefore held that the licence payment was the cost of the right to use land.

**Tax avoidance** - The Court upheld the High Court's finding of tax avoidance and said that the real purpose of the arrangement is not the conduct of a forestry business for profit, but rather generation of spectacular tax benefits. This was the major issue for the Court of Appeal and most of the discussion was on this issue, which involved consideration of the _Challenge, BNZI_, and _Petersen_ cases. The Court found:

Manifestations of the absence of a genuine business purpose cannot be brushed aside as irrelevant because of taxpayer autonomy principles.

The scheme was well and truly across the "line" referred to by Richardson P in _BNZI_.

If the scheme is void as against the Commissioner, there is no need for the Commissioner or the Court to conjure up an alternative and more effective scheme into which the taxpayer might have entered.

**Penalties** - This was an entirely tax-driven scheme. The penalties were not imposed prematurely; on any sensible approach the interpretation of section BG 1 taken by the taxpayers was unacceptable.

Trinity supreme court hearing adjourned
=======================================

2008 case note - Supreme Court adjourned the Trinity appeal hearing until 23 June 2008 – tax avoidance.

Case

Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Limited, Accent Management Limited and Ors v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

The Supreme Court has adjourned the Trinity appeal hearing until 23 June 2008.

### Facts

The appellants are the taxpayers in the "Trinity forestry scheme" test case proceedings. A five-day fixture was set down to commence in the Supreme Court on 3 March 2008. The Ben Nevis appellants (SC 43/2007) applied for an adjournment of the fixture and the Accent Management appellants (SC 44/2007) supported the application. The Commissioner opposed the application for an adjournment.

Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was granted on 9 October 2007. After allocating a fixture commencing on 12 February 2008, an application for an adjournment was made and was granted unopposed on 17 December 2007. In the Notice advising of the adjournment, the Registrar allocated a fixture commencing 3March 2008 having ascertained the date was suitable with Mr Carruthers QC for Ben Nevis and Mr Gudsell QC for Accent Management. The Registrar was aware that Mr Stewart QC was not available and the notice of the fixture to the parties noted specifically that it was a date on which "the majority"of counsels were available.

It was not until 17 January 2008 that Mr Stewart QC filed a further application for an adjournment. He had not earlier notified counsel for the Commissioner or the Court that such an application was contemplated.

### Decision

The appellants' application for an adjournment was granted, the 3 March 2008 fixture was vacated and the hearing adjourned to 23 June 2008.

The Court said that under the Supreme Court Rules, the Registrar was obliged to consult with counsel before allocating a fixture but the agreement of counsel was not required. Although the Registrar should try to accommodate the preferences of counsel, it might not be possible to do so and also meet the interests of other parties and the public interest in the orderly dispatch of the work of the Supreme Court.

The principal reason advanced for the adjournment was Mr Stewart's conflicting fixture on 3 March 2008 in the High Court. At the adjournment hearing, Mr Stewart said he considered his obligations to his clients precluded him withdrawing from the cases which clashed with the Supreme Court appeal. In addition, it was said that counsel for the Ben Nevis parties had been unable to confer in preparation for the hearing.

The Supreme Court noted that there were a number of unsatisfactory aspects about the course of events. The Court noted that it was "hard to accept" that counsel for Ben Nevis could not have immediately applied for an adjournment and that it was "harder still to accept"that informal advice could not have been immediately given; the overall effect being that the Supreme Court was "presented with something of a fait accompli".

The Supreme Court found that it was "unsatisfactory"that the Registrar was expected to consult about the fixture separately with all counsel who had the joint conduct of one appeal. Counsel could not expect the preferences of all counsel to be accommodated. However, the Court also said that it would be unreasonable to impose a fixture without notice to allow counsel and the parties to adjust other commitments, including relinquishing briefs; but said that in most cases three months should be more than sufficient time. The Court went on to say that if counsel could not meet a fixture allocated on this basis, it would usually be necessary for other counsel to be instructed.

An adjournment was granted on the basis that the appellants would be "clearly prejudiced"by the insufficient preparation by their counsel. The Court acknowledged that the case raised matters of "substantial public importance on which the Supreme Court is entitled to expect submissions which are well prepared from counsel who are on top of their arguments". In this case, the Court held that it was in the interests of justice for the fixture to be vacated.

Trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry: zero-rating under GST
=========================================================================================================

QB (Jul 2003) considers whether a TIB item relating to taxidermy, GST and zero rating is still correct given changes to the legislation.

### Background

Previously the status of some services performed by the taxidermy industry had been considered in a TIB item Vol 9, No. 6 (June 1997) titled "Trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry: zero-rating under GST".  Currently, the TIB item, in regard to the taxidermy industry, states:

**INTERPRETATION**

**Taxidermy fee**

The taxidermy fees are chargeable with GST at the standard rate as they do not fall within the zero-rating provisions of the GST Act.  While the services are supplied to someone who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are carried out, they are in connection with "moveable personal property situated inside New Zealand at the time the services are performed" and are clearly excluded by section 11(2)(e)(ii).

Section 11 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 has been substituted by sections 11, 11A, and 11B pursuant to section 90(1) of the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000 with application on and after 10 October 2000.  In particular, section 11A(1)(m) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 has now been inserted into the Act.

Question 
---------

We have received a query regarding whether the TIB item, as far as the taxidermy industry is concerned, is still correct given the amendments to the GST legislation enacted on 10 October 2000.

The TIB item is stated to apply to taxidermists performing the service of processing animal carcasses before they are exported to tourists.  We have also been asked whether the TIB item applies to all taxidermy arrangements in the taxidermy, hunting, and safari industries.

### Legislation

Section 11A(1)(m) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 applies to zero-rate services that are provided directly in connection with goods to which section 11(1)(a) to (e) apply.  Section 11A(1)(m) provides:

##### 11A     Zero-rated services

(1)           A supply of services that is chargeable with tax under section 8 must be charged at the rate of 0% in the following situations:

...

(m)                the services are supplied directly in connection with goods to which any one of section 11(1)(a) to 11(1)(e) applies if  supplied to a person who is not resident in New Zealand and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed; or

...

### Conclusion

Taxidermy fees are chargeable with GST at a zero rate where they are consistent with the requirements of section 11A(1)(m).  That is, the service must be supplied directly in connection with goods to which any one of section 11(1)(a) to 11(1)(e) applies (that is, goods exported, or goods entered or deemed to be entered for export), and the supply must be to a person not resident and outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed.  Thus, in respect of the provision of taxidermy services, the TIB item is no longer correct due to the change in the legislation.

In relation to non-taxidermy services considered by the TIB item, it may also be noted that the title and drafting of the TIB item may be considered misleading in that it may suggest to some readers that it applies to all participants in those industries discussed in the item.  However the TIB item,in respect of these other matters, is only intended to explain the factual scenarios described.  Therefore, where a taxpayer's particular facts differ from those described in the TIB item different tax consequences may follow.

\[UNCLASSIFIED\] VARIATION > TRUST REPORTING REQUIREMENTS VARIATION Variation to s 59BA(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for trustees of certain trusts that derive a small amount of income Issued: 18 November 2022 TRU 22/01 EFFECTIVE: for the 2021-22 income year and, for a trustee of a trust that is wound up during the 2022-23 income year, the 2022-23 income year. UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 4 TRU 22/01 | 18 November 2022 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Variation The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has, under the discretion provided under section 59BA(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, made the following statutory variation: 1. Section 59BA(2)(a) – (e) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is varied for a trustee of an Eligible Trust to the name, date of birth, jurisdiction of tax residence, and tax file number and taxpayer identification number, of each settlor who makes a settlement on the trust in the income year. 2. For the purpose of this variation, a trust is an Eligible Trust, for a tax year, where the trustee of the trust derives assessable income for the tax year, the trust is a complying trust under section HC 10 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and the trust satisfies Criteria A and/or Criteria B. Criteria A: 3. For the corresponding income year for a tax year, the trustee of the trust: • has derived no income other than income that would be reportable income, as defined in section 22D of the Tax Administration Act 1994, if the trust was an individual, to the extent to which the total amount of that income does not exceed $1,000; and • has no deductions; and • has not been a party to, or perpetuated, or continued with, transactions with assets of the trust which, during the corresponding income year: - give rise to income in any person’s hands; or - give rise to fringe benefits to an employee or to a former employee. 4. In determining whether a trust complies with the requirements of Criteria A, no account shall be taken of any: • reasonable fees paid to professional persons to administer the trust; or • bank charges or other minimal administration costs totalling not more than $1,000 in the income year; or • insurance, rates, interest, and other expenditure incidental to the occupation of a dwelling owned by the trust and incurred by the beneficiaries of the trust. Criteria B: 5. For the corresponding income year for a tax year: • the trust is a testamentary trust; and UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 4 TRU 22/01 | 18 November 2022 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • distributions from the trust during the income year do not exceed $100,000; and • where the trust earned income that would be reportable income, as defined in section 22D of the Tax Administration Act 1994, if the trust was an individual, tax has been deducted from that income at the correct rate, and the total amount of that income does not exceed $5,000 for the income year; and • the trust derives non-reportable income of $1,000 or less and the trust has deductions against that income of at least $800 for the income year. Application date This variation applies for the 2021-22 income year and, for a trustee of a trust that is wound up during the 2022-23 income year, the 2022-23 income year. Dated at Wellington on 18 November 2022. Catherine Atkins Deputy Commissioner, Customer and Compliance Services – Business Inland Revenue UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 4 TRU 22/01 | 18 November 2022 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Background (material under this heading does not form part of the variation) Summary of effect 1. Under s 59BA(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) a trustee of a trust who derives assessable income for a tax year must file a return of all income derived in the corresponding income year (unless the trustee has been excused from filing a return under s 43B of the TAA). Section 59BA(2) of the TAA sets out further information a trustee is required to provide to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner). 2. The variation limits the information that a trustee of an Eligible Trust is required to disclose to comply with s 59BA(2) of the TAA and means that a trustee of an Eligible Trust does not need to provide all the information set out in s 59BA(2)(a) – (e) of the TAA. 3. The Inland Revenue Department website will set out how a trustee applying the variation is to provide the information. 4. The variation will apply for the 2021-22 income year and, for a trustee of a trust that is wound up during the 2022-23 income year, the 2022-23 income year. 5. Section 43B of the TAA allows a trustee of a “non-active” trust to be excused from the requirement to file a return where certain criteria are met. A trustee of a trust that is excused from the requirement to file a return by s 43B of the TAA is not required to comply with the disclosure requirements in s 59BA(2). 6. Amendments proposed in the Taxation (Annual Rates, for 2022-23, Platform Economy and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) (the Bill), which was introduced on 8 September 2022, would broaden s 43B of the TAA, so that trustees of more trusts (including certain testamentary trusts) that derive small amounts of income would qualify for an exclusion from filing a return. These amendments are proposed to have effect from the 2021-22 income year. 7. The criteria to determine which trustees would qualify for the more limited disclosure requirements in this variation are consistent with what the criteria in s 43B of the TAA would be provided the amendments proposed in the Bill are enacted into law. However, unlike s 43B of the TAA, the variation does not provide an exclusion from UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 4 TRU 22/01 | 18 November 2022 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] filing a return (i.e. a trustee of an Eligible Trust would still be required to file a return under s 59BA(1) of the TAA). Provisions affected 8. Section 59BA(2) of the TAA. Application of variation 9. This variation applies to a trustee of an Eligible Trust that is subject to the information disclosure requirements in s 59BA(2) of the TAA. It varies the information that a trustee of an Eligible Trust needs to provide to the Commissioner to comply with s 59BA(2) of the TAA. 10. A trustee of an Eligible Trust can also choose to provide all the information required by s 59BA(2)(a) – (e) of the TAA. References Legislative references Tax Administration Act 1994: ss 59BA(2) and 59BA(5). About this publication The Commissioner has a discretion to vary the disclosure requirements in s 59BA(2) of the TAA for a trustee or a class of trustees. This discretion is to help ensure there is flexibility to account for situations where there are trustees who may be reasonably unable to meet some of the disclosure requirements and/or particular disclosure requirements are not necessary given the characteristics of a trust and, therefore, impose undue compliance costs. The discretion is found in s 59BA(5) of the TAA. This variation is an exercise of that power.

Trust debts provable in bankruptcy of trustee
=============================================

2006 case note - trust debts provable in bankruptcy of trustee – GST - 'obligation' and 'liability'.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Philip John Duncan

Legislative References

Insolvency Act 1967 and Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

A trustee who incurs an obligation to a finance house to develop and sell a property prior to being bankrupted is not liable for GST that he incurs on behalf of the trust as a result of the sales after the date of bankruptcy. The debt is provable in his bankrupt estate in terms of section 87(1) of the Insolvency Act 1987 (the Act).

#### Facts

This was an appeal against a decision made in favour of Mr Duncan in the District Court.

The Commissioner had claimed that Mr Duncan, as trustee, was personally liable pursuant to section 57(3) of the Goods and Services Act 1985 for the GST debt of a trust. Mr Duncan denied personal liability on the ground that he had been bankrupted and the debt should have been proved in his bankruptcy.

Prior to Mr Duncan trustee being bankrupted he had purchased a property for development and claimed a GST input. Mr Duncan had entered into an agreement with a finance house to develop and sell the properties. After Mr Duncan was bankrupted, but before he was discharged from bankruptcy, the trust sold the developed properties but failed to pay the GST output tax. Mr Duncan was the trustee at all times.

#### The District Court decision

The issue was whether in terms of section 87(1) of the Act the GST output tax was provable in Mr Duncan's bankrupt estate. If it was, Mr Duncan is therefore released from liability in terms of section 114 of the Act. In terms of section 87(1) all debts and liabilities, present or future, certain or contingent, to which the bankrupt is subject at the time of his adjudication, or to which he becomes subject before his discharge by reason of any obligation incurred before the time of his adjudication, shall be debts provable in bankruptcy.

Mr Duncan argued that once the trust had claimed input tax it was always going to have to account for output tax on the sale of taxable supplies. Therefore, at the time of the input claims the trust had a contingent liability for output tax, and, pursuant to section 57(3) of the GST Act, so did the Defendant. This contingent liability was provable in the Defendant's bankrupt estate in terms of section 87 of the Act. As it was not proved, the Defendant was released from liability in terms of section 114 of the Act.

The Commissioner argued that the purchase of the land and the associated GST input claims did not trigger an obligation, contingent or otherwise, for Mr Duncan to account for output tax. That obligation only arose at the time of supply which was after Mr Duncan was declared bankrupt.

The District Court accepted Mr Duncan's argument finding that the future output tax was a contingent liability of Mr Duncan at the time he was bankrupted. It then considered section 98 of the Act. In terms thereof, the Official Assignee can estimate the value of a contingent debt, but if he finds that he cannot fairly estimate it he shall reject the proof of debt. In those circumstances the debt would not be provable in the bankruptcy. The District Court went on to hold that the onus fell on the Commissioner to show that the GST debt would not have been provable and the Commissioner had not discharged that onus.

#### Decision on appeal

The main thrust of the Commissioner's argument was that the District Court erred because it incorrectly defined the term "contingent liability". The Commissioner claimed that, in line with various decided cases, the judge failed to recognise that before there can be a contingent liability under section 87(1) there must be some form of commitment by the debtor from which he cannot unilaterally withdraw. At the time of Mr Duncan's adjudication output tax was not a contingent liability of the trust because the trust was not committed to the taxable supply of the units and there was, accordingly, no certainty that output tax would become payable.

Alternatively, that even if the output tax was a contingent liability of the trust it was not a contingent liability of Mr Duncan at the time of his adjudication. To avoid liability he could have resigned as trustee before the GST was payable.

Mr Duncan supported the District Court's reasoning and finding.

The High Court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the District Court judgment but on different grounds. In accordance with the Commissioner's argument Chisholm J found that the GST that was incurred after bankruptcy was not a contingent liability of Mr Duncan at the time of his bankruptcy.

Even though the sales and the time of supply that gave rise to the GST debt occurred after the date of bankruptcy he found that the liability arose by virtue of an obligation that was incurred prior to bankruptcy. That obligation was the obligation of the trustee to the trust's financier to develop and sell the properties at the time the financial package was agreed. Chisholm J held that the sales of the developed units that gave rise to GST, which occurred after bankruptcy, occurred because Mr Duncan had a pre-bankruptcy obligation to a finance house to develop and sell the units.

In coming to this conclusion he held that, because both the words "liability" and "obligation" are used in section 87(1), parliament must have intended that they carry different meanings and that "obligation" in the section means something less than legally binding.

Chisholm J went on to hold that it would have been possible to estimate the value of the units in terms of section 98 and dismissed the appeal.

This decision is under appeal.

Trust disclosures - common errors
=================================

If you've filed Trust returns with any of these errors, please amend the returns through your software or in myIR.

[Additional reporting requirements](https://www.ird.govt.nz/roles/trusts-and-estates/additional-reporting-requirements-for-nz-domestic-trusts)

Details of the person or entity
-------------------------------

Details of the person for settlors, beneficiaries and powers of appointment must include all of the following:

*   a name
*   date of birth (or entity commencement date if it is a non-individual)
*   jurisdiction of tax residency
*   a New Zealand (NZ) IRD number or Tax Identification Number (TIN) if they are a non-resident of NZ.

You do not have to provide all 4 pieces of information of the settlor, beneficiaries, and powers of appointment in these situations:

*   If the information is about a settlor who did not make a settlement in the current year and the trustee has made reasonable attempts to get the information, but been unable to get the information. In this case, at a bare minimum, supply the settlor’s name and tick the box ‘no settlement has been made by this settlor in this income year’. No settlement value should be supplied for historic settlements.

*   If the person’s jurisdiction of tax residency is NZ and they do not have an IRD number (they are a minor or a non-active company for example), leave the IRD number field blank and tick the box ’TIN not required in jurisdiction’.

*   If the person’s jurisdiction of tax residency is not NZ and they do not have a TIN (either because they are not required to have one or because the jurisdiction does not issue TINs) either tick ‘TIN not required in jurisdiction’ or ‘Jurisdiction does not issue TINs’.

### Common errors we’re seeing for details of persons

IRD numbers are not matching the name or date of birth recorded.

We’re seeing returns filed using:

*   the trust’s own IRD number 
*   the same IRD number against multiple beneficiary names
*   Generic IRD numbers. For example 111-111-111

If the person does not have an IRD number for a valid reason, then tick ‘TIN not required in jurisdiction’ and leave the IRD number field blank. If the person does have an IRD number then the trustee has an obligation to disclose it.

Errors in TIN field
-------------------

The following errors are the most common ones we’re seeing in the TIN field.

*   NZ IRD number entered in the TIN field for non-resident person.  If the person has provided a NZ IRD number, please still put this in the IRD number field
*   Unusual or incorrect information entered in the TIN field such as ‘N/A, 0, -, 000, xxx and ‘beneficiary has not provided’.  If the customer has a TIN, you need to get it from them. If they do not have a TIN then tick one of the boxes on the form to indicate that and leave the TIN field blank.  

‘Jurisdiction does not issue TINs’ should be used only if the overseas country does not issue any kind of tax identifier at all. It should never be used for a NZ resident.

Errors in date of birth field
-----------------------------

The date of birth or commencement date must be in the past. Do not enter future dates.

Settlors and settlements
------------------------

We expect that all trusts required to make trust disclosures will provide settlor information for the 2022 year. In following years, you’ll only need to provide settlor information if a settlement occurred during that financial year.

### Common errors we’re seeing for settlors and settlements

*   Many returns have been filed without any settlor information. A trust cannot exist without a settlement so at a minimum the name of the initial settlor must be provided.
*   Settlor disclosure forms with ‘no settlement has been made by this settlor in this income year’ ticked but still have monetary figures in the settlement amounts.  Only tick this box if the person has not made a settlement in this income year. In other words you’re providing information about a historical settlor.  
*   You are not required to disclose the amount and nature of historical settlements.
*   No settlement value should be supplied for historic settlements.

Financial statements
--------------------

The changes for financials include 4 categories and a total for assets,1 category and a total for liabilities, and the current account year-end balance and owners’ equity.

### Common errors we’re seeing for financials

‘Total assets’ is left blank or appears to be the sum of the 4 listed asset categories. ‘Total assets’ should be all assets owned by the trust.  It’s unlikely a trust would not have other assets (such as a bank account) so it’s unusual for the sum of the 4 listed categories to equal the total assets of the trust. Equally, a trust would not exist without any assets, so a nil balance is also likely to be wrong.

‘Owners’ equity’ is the total of the trust corpus plus any capital gains or retained trustee income.  It does not include the beneficiary current account balances.

Total assets plus Total Liabilities should equal Owners Equity plus Current Account year-end balances.

Trust in business of holding financial arrangements and allowed bad debt deduction
==================================================================================

2010 case note – activity of carrying on the business of holding financial arrangements - trustees entitled to a bad debt deduction.

Case

TRA Decision No. 01/2010

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

The TRA held that there was "just, and only just" a sufficient level of activity to support the disputant trustees intention of profit from their holding of financial arrangements to constitute a business. Consequently, the trustees were entitled to a bad debt deduction under s DJ 1 and s EH 54 (3) of the Income Tax Act 1994.

### Impact of decision

The Commissioner considers that the judgment is confined to its particular facts.

### Facts

On 1 January 2000 the disputant Trust was settled.

On 26 April and 5 May 2000, $180,000 and $100,000 respectively were advanced to the disputant Trust, interest free and repayable upon demand.

Mr B, a trustee and the accountant for the disputant Trust, requested Mr O, a mortgage broker, to refer to him interesting opportunities for consideration by the disputant Trust and other entities Mr B was involved with.

The disputant Trust entered into five arrangements:

1.  On 16 November 2000 the disputant Trust advanced $100,000 to D W Ltd on the security of a debenture and the personal covenant of the company's director. The principal of $100,000 and interest of $25,000 were to be repaid on 17 May 2001.
2.  On 22 February 2001 the disputant Trust loaned $100,000 to Mr L and on 5 April 2001 received back from him $103,041.09 inclusive of interest and principal.
3.  On 5 April 2001 the disputant Trust entered into an agreement for sale and purchase of real estate with N Ltd for the disputant Trust to purchase a city unit at $120,000. The agreement provided that N Ltd would repurchase the unit from the disputant Trust for $130,000 no later than 6 June 2001.
4.  On 5 July 2001 the arrangement with N Ltd was restructured as a loan with interest payable at an effective rate of 53.36% per annum capitalised monthly until full repayment.
5.  On (or about) 4 October 2001 the arrangement with N Ltd was once more restructured, this time as a term loan for $155,000 with interest at 20% per annum (with a penalty rate of 30% per annum). $20,000 was to be repaid on the signing of the loan contract and the balance by 30 November 2001. Second mortgages were to be given over certain properties.

The opportunities concerning D W Ltd, Mr L and N Ltd were referred to Mr B by Mr O.

On 10 April 2002 the disputant received $72,000 from N Ltd in partial repayment of the loan to it.

Trust minutes dated October 2002 noted the loan to D W Ltd and the balance of the loan to N Ltd as unrecoverable and recorded "write off both loans as bad immediately and remind accountant to include in financial accounts this period".

On 16 October 2003 the disputant Trust filed income tax returns (and financial statements) for the income years ended 31 March 2001, 2002 and 2003. The 2003 return and financial statements recorded a bad debt write-off of $100,000. The journal for the disputant Trust's income tax year ended 31 March 2003 recorded bad debt write-offs for the loan to D W Ltd and the balance of the loan to N Ltd. The date the journal entries were made was not known.

The draft accounts and journal for the income tax year ended 31 March 2004 recorded the balance of the loan to N Ltd as a trust asset.

In May 2007 the disputant Trust filed a "revised return" for the income year ended 31 March 2003 recording bad debts written off in the amount of $148,000.

By an assessment dated 12 June 2008, the Commissioner denied the disputant Trust's claim for a bad debt deduction in the 2003 income tax year for the $100,000 loan made to D W Ltd on two grounds:

1.  The disputant Trust had failed to satisfy the burden on it that the bad debt was actually written off in the 2003 income year.
2.  The activity carried on by the disputant Trust was an investment activity and not that of carrying on a business.

### Decision

The disputant Trust and the Commissioner agreed that the:

*   loan made by the disputant Trust to D W Ltd was a bad debt
*   disputant's loan to D W Ltd was a financial arrangement for the purposes of the Division 2 accruals rules
*   loan made by the disputant Trust to Mr L was a financial arrangement for the purposes of the Division 2 accruals rules
*   two restructured arrangements with N Ltd were financial arrangements for the purposes of the Division2 accruals rules.

The disputant Trust's activity involved the holding of financial arrangements (the loan to Mr L and the restructured arrangements with N Ltd) with attributes similar to the D W Ltd loan. Those attributes being the:

1.  provision by the disputant Trust of money to the borrower at the start of the arrangement
2.  borrower being required to repay the money to the disputant Trust at a future date plus interest.

The disputant Trust and the Commissioner disagreed in respect of three issues:

1.  The correct characterisation of the 5 April 2001 agreement for sale and purchase between N Ltd and the disputant Trust. On that issue:
    1.  The disputant Trust contended that the arrangement was a loan secured by a caveat, and as such, had attributes similar to the D W Ltd loan, the loan to Mr L and the restructured arrangements with N Ltd.
    2.  The Commissioner contended that the arrangement was correctly classified as an agreement for sale and purchase of real estate with a buy-back clause and its attributes were not the same or similar to the loan to D W Ltd, the loan to Mr L and the two restructured arrangements with N Ltd.
    3.  The Authority held that the documented purchase and buy-back of the apartment was as a security for a loan to N Ltd. The Authority observed that such a method of providing security is quite common and well understood in commerce as a form of security for a loan.
2.  Whether the disputant Trust's activity in holding the D W Ltd loan, the loan to Mr L and the two restructured arrangements with N Ltd was of sufficient scale and involved sufficient time, effort and money in its ordinary operations (ie not its debt recovery efforts) to be the activity of carrying on a business. On that issue:
    1.  The parties agreed that in order to satisfy the burden on it of proving that the disputant Trust carried on, at all material times, the business of holding financial arrangements the disputant must satisfy the business test formulated by Richardson J in _Grieve v CIR_ \[1984\] 1 NZLR 101 (CA).
    2.  The Authority held, having regard to the factors considered in _Grieve_, that there was "just, and only just" a sufficient level of activity to support the disputant Trust's intention to profit so as to constitute the business of lending money at all material times.
3.  Whether the disputant Trust wrote off the D W Ltd debt in the 2003 income year. On that issue the Authority accepted Mr B's evidence that the relevant journal entries, to write off the debts in issue, were made at proper times in the 2003 accounting year.

(dyads / triads and focus groups): 7 Qualitative approach A series of dyads and triads were undertaken with a mix of individual and business customers. Each dyad/triad consisted of a semi-structured discussion (up to 90 minutes) with two or three participants from a family or business network. A mix of gender, age, and ethnicity, and individuals with varying levels of trust in Inland Revenue, were included in the overall sample, which is displayed to the right. 2.1 Because most New Zealanders don’t interact with Inland Revenue on a regular basis, we ensured that all triads/dyads had interacted with Inland Revenue at least once in the past 12 months. Five of the dyad/triad groups had interacted with Inland Revenue in at least three different ways during the same period. Qualitative summary Following this initial phase of fieldwork, two focus groups were conducted in Auckland: one comprised of individuals with low levels of trust in Inland Revenue, and the other with people with a ‘high trust’ relationship 2 .

Inland Revenue provided Colmar Brunton with contact details for 42,259 individual and business customers. Inland Revenue sent an email to all potential participants, informing them of the survey and giving them the option to opt-out. Those who chose to opt- out of the survey were then removed from the sample, along with those who had recently been invited to complete an Inland Revenue survey through Colmar Brunton 3 . This left us with a total sample of 40,815. Online survey summary All 40,815 were sent an email inviting them to complete the survey, we received 567 bounce-back emails. A targeted reminder was sent to those who did not initially respond. Respondents were not incentivised to take part in the online survey. The final response rate achieved was 9.4%. A total of 3,768 respondents completed the survey (2763 individuals and 1,005 businesses). A sample size of 3,768 has a maximum margin of error of +/- 1.6%. Surveying took place between 31 January 2019 and Monday 11 February 2019. The median duration for the quantitative survey was 14 minutes. 2.2 8 Quantitative approach Weighting The sample was weighted to ensure the final profile was representative of the population of interest. The weighting process was applied to correct for any disproportionality introduced through the sampling process, as well as response bias. Individuals data were weighted by type of social policy, and age within gender. Business data were weighted by business type. At the total level (i.e. individuals and business responses combined) the data were weighted by sample type. 2.2 Path analysis One of the key outputs of this research was a path analysis model. A path model shows the directional relationships between a set of variables, and the relative strength of these relationships. It is used to determine what variables are driving a single outcome variable (e.g. trust in the tax system), and the relative importance each of these variables have when it comes to influencing the outcome variable. 9 10 Reporting Thisreportdetailsthefindingsfromboththe qualitativeandquantitativeresearchcomponents.

Interpreting the qualitative research To what extent do customers trust the tax system and Inland Revenue? What are the drivers of trust? How to improve trust 12 13 14-15 Executive Summary 11 Page number 3 12 To what extent do customers trust the tax system and Inland Revenue? Trust in the tax system is similar to trust in other public systems, while trust i n Inland Revenue compares favourably against a range of high-profile public and private sector o rganisations. 3.1 Overall, 52% of customers trust the tax system, and 58% trust Inland Revenue\*. While trust in Inland Revenue is slightly higher than trust in the tax system, the two are very highly correlated, suggesting most customers do n ot distinguish between the two. Findingsfromthe qualitativeresearch indicatetrustishigherforInland Revenuebecauseit isa tangibleentity (i.e.individualscaninteractwithsystems andprocesses,andformrelationships withInlandRevenuestaff), whereasthe taxsystemis morenebulous. Theresearchfoundthat cultureandethnicityare criticalin pullingapart thosewhoaremoreorless trustingofthetaxsystem andInlandRevenue. 52% 58%\* Trust the tax system Trust Inland Revenue Qualitative research revealed that Asian migrants compare their experience with the New Zealand tax system and Inland Revenue, to previous experiences with the tax system in their country of origin. Both Inland Revenue and the tax system are generally viewed more favourably. There is a perception that the use of tax monies is more visible and transparent within New Zealand. Inland Revenue’s streamlined processes and proactive attitude towards tax returns are two things which contribute to this. Qualitative research findings suggest that lower trust levels are largely to do with a wider distrust of government institutions and feelings of marginalisation. There is an expectation that negative experiences will be repeated, meaning Māori feel they always need to be on guard when dealing with government more generally (including the tax system). Migrants (particularly Asian migrants) are more trusting. Māori (particularly those with close ties to their iwi/hapū) are less trusting. \* This figure differs from IR’ s 2019 Annual Report. This is because the figure in this report is based on the OECD-recommended measurement (o n a scale of zero to ten, responses of 7-10 are considered to be trusting). 13 What are the drivers of trust? 3.2 For both individuals and business customers, there are two main pathways to building trust in Inland Revenue; a functional pathway, and a relationship-based pathway. The main difference between the individual and business models is that, for business customers, easily completing tasks on the Inland Revenue website is one of the drivers of trust. This likely reflects greater levels of interaction with Inland Revenue and the website for business customers. As there are no substantial differences between the two models other than this, a similar strategy will likely work for both customer groups when it comes to building trust. What this suggests is that building trust requires a two- pronged approach. At a functional level, Inland Revenue needs to foster perceptions of being straight-forward, reliable and capable. At the same time, it needs to build a relationship with customers by demonstrating that it is a caring organisation which treats the customer as an equal - working with people to come up with a solution that works for all parties. The two pathways reflect different elements of customer experience. That is, making it easy for customers to interact with the organisation, and building a lasting relationship. Drivers of trust differ to some extent for Māori. For Māori, perceptions of Inland Revenue being accountable to the people have greater influence on trust, as do perceptions of Inland Revenue being on the side of the taxpayer. To build trust in Inland Revenue among Māori the focus should be on improving these perceptions in particular. 14 Amongindividuals, perceptionsof InlandRevenuebeingontheside of thetaxpayerandhavingahuman touchhavebeenidentifiedas priorityareasforimprovement.

Theyinclude: These touchpoints occur the most frequently and have a negative impact on trust in Inland Revenue. For individuals and business customers there is an opportunity to improve trust by increasing exposure to advertising and communications. Those who have seen positive advertising or marketing communications are considerably more likely to trust Inland Revenue, than those who haven’t seen anything. However, relatively few recall seeing or hearing anything. For Māori in particular there is an opportunity for Inland Revenue to demonstrate that it is an understanding organisation that is willing to work with customers in coming up with solutions. Those who had experienced one of the following were more likely to trust Inland Revenue than those who had not: 15 How to improve trust 3.3 Improving the customer experience Call waiting times, Ease of dealing with Inland Revenue, Taking an empathetic approach when dealing with customers, Ease of completing a tax return Consistent messaging.

It is therefore seen to be the organisation that carries out the government’s directives as stipulated within this system – e.g. it calculates and collects taxes on its behalf. As such, while the two bodies are viewed as closely connected, Inland Revenue is perceived to have limited or no ability to operate independently: Male, 26-35 years, Asian migrant, individual “Inland Revenue are the ones who do the computing or the collecting of tax, they don't have the power to change it or make a decision on how much it is.” Female, 46-59 years, New Zealand European, business “I have just been watching Narcos Mexico, first thing that comes to mind is the government is the leader of the cartel and the tax department is the hit man, who does as they're told.” This perceived lack of autonomy could be contributing to a slightly more empathetic view of Inland Revenue, and higher trust in the organisation amongst some: 19 Trust in Inland Revenue and the tax system 4.1 Further, findings suggest that customers sometimes felt a stronger connection with Inland Revenue due to the direct and tangible relationship they have with either staff or the organisation’s systems and processes. By comparison, the tax system is viewed as a more indeterminate or unknown entity: Female, 46-59 years, New Zealand European, business “Personally, I don't think it's Inland Revenue that is ripping people off, they don't set the tax rates, it's the government...They're just doing their job, just collecting the taxes and making sure that people are paying taxes and that people aren't ripping the system off.” Male, 60+ years, New Zealand European, business “It's not something you really trust or distrust, it just is.” 20 Trust in Inland Revenue and the tax system individuals and businesses 4.2 How much do you personally trust the following in New Zealand?

The extent to which people trust Inland Revenue and the tax system also more broadly reflects the extent to which they are willing to trust more generally (at both an interpersonal level and a wider institutional level). Māori are over-represented on many of the factors which relate to low trust levels. Figure 7.

Because for me as a Māori, they’re not doing anything for us. If anything, they are making it worse and the rates for Māori are so much worse... so many are in prisons, the health system is failing them... The qualitative research identified several factors that influence trust. Some are specific to Māori experiences of customer service and some are often linked to personal and cultural values as well as social, cultural and historical factors. Significantly lower levels of trust in the tax system among Māori reflects a wider distrust of government institutions and feelings of marginalisation. There is a sense that Māori feel they don’t get a fair deal and can be marginalized and overlooked by the political system. For Māori, historical trust issues can go back generations and influence trust in government and government agencies today. Male, 60+ years, Māori, Individual “I think Māori as a people we don't trust easily ...and it takes a long time to build relationships with Māori. It's a historical issue, we've been lied to and we paid the price...and because we lost land.” Female, 46-59 years, Māori, Individual “I have seen it in my years how Māori are treated and that is where my trust issues come from. From my tūpuna\[ancestors\] and my mum and all that generation. How they have struggled over the years, you know? It goes back decades and you just learn the history of what happened to us as people, as Māori people and how it is still happening today.” Negativegovernmentagencyexperiencescolourthepresent; andgiveriseto anexpectationthattheseexperienceswillberepeated 8 .

When you look at our history I’m sceptical about how we (Māori) will be treated in the future. History tells us, well our experience tells us that you can’t trust the system. It hasn’t always treated us fairly.” Male, 26-35 years, Māori, Individual Female, 46-59 years, Māori, Individual “I haven’t had any bad experiences with them (Inland Revenue.)

But I do mind paying high amounts of taxes, especially if you really can’t see too much change. Over the years, I just seem to see things going on things that aren’t really helping our people. I mean, all New Zealanders really.” “Tax spending is not directed to where it’s needed. If I think about where our taxes are going and I think that they are spending it all on these new roads and planting trees and we have got people that are homeless and who are starving. Why aren’t they putting that money from the roads into getting these people into homes... So, that’s my perception of ... you know, you see all these new roads getting built and you think –we don’t need these roads, fix up the railway so we can have less traffic on the roads, or invest all that money into health or education for the future of our next generation.” Female, 46-59 years, Māori, Individual Female, 46-59 years, Māori, Individual “The tax system favours the rich and big business.

This means that improving these perceptions will have the biggest impact on trust in Inland Revenue.

Improving these perceptions will have the biggest impact on trust in Inland Revenue among businesses.

Relative importance of each factor to building trust in Inland Revenue - businesses 46 Drivers of trust – business 6.4 We produced a second path model for businesses (see Figure 19 overleaf). The path model shows the directional relationships between variables, as well as the strength of these relationships. Path model -business The path model for businesses is largely consistent with the path model for individuals. Once again, reciprocity (Inland Revenue trusts me to do the right thing), and customer experience (Inland Revenue is straightforward) are the linchpins for both. In addition, both models reveal that there is a functional pathway and a relationship- based pathway to building trust In Inland Revenue. The main difference between the two models is that, for business customers, easily completing tasks on the Inland Revenue website feeds into perceptions of being straight-forward. This likely reflects greater levels of interaction with Inland Revenue and the website for business customers. What this means for Inland Revenue, is that a similar strategy will likely work for both individuals and businesses, however, ensuring the website is easy to use, and striving to improve this, is somewhat more important to trust perceptions among business customers.

Female, 46-59 years, NZ European, business “And communication is an absolute priority... sometimes people have actually been owed tax and they don't even know. Or just even what you should be paying. \[What difference does it make?\] Because it's not like this shadowy figure that comes in the night that you know nothing about and steals your blanket and leaves you lying there in the freezing cold.” Male, 36-45 years, NZ European, individual “Previously you wouldn’t be told of changes and so you would end up thinking everything was all good and then six months later you have got a bill to pay, it's like well why couldn’t you have told me that beforehand? ... It's like they're trying to rip you off.” Forsome,thisalsoincludedtargetedmarketingcommunicationswhichseekto ‘educate’customersregardingrelevanttaxissues: Male, 26-35 years, Pacific, individual “I think education is good, a lot of people don't understand... And if it's a user-friendly way, ‘tax for dummies’ or something ... Yeah, I would trust them a little bit more. I would feel like they're doing more than just taking money, I would feel that reciprocation, like they're giving something back.” Clear and proactive communication: This includes Inland Revenue being proactive with regard to communicating customer responsibilities and obligations, any changes to systems or processes, and situations where tax monies are either owed or owing. 52 Individuals 7.1 Transparencyandeasyaccessto information:ForInlandRevenueto buildandmaintaintrustwith customers,itisimportantthatthe organisationisopenandtransparent.

And how hard or easy they make it.” Basic principles of building and maintaining trust Male, 36-45 years, NZ European, individual “When I was share milking I got into a little bit of trouble with Inland Revenue and I had penalties and all that sort of thing, and if you didn’t pay what you had to pay on the day you incurred 10% penalties. But when they owed you money you could be waiting months for that money and yet there is no penalties involved. So to me it's a two-way street – if you’re going to penalise me then you need to be paying me on time as well.” Female, 26-35 years, Pacific, individual “They're helpful, like they work with you, for example if you have like arrears to pay they will give you a realistic payment arrangement that suits your income that you have.” Aflexibleandempatheticapproach:Individualsfeel thatdemonstratingflexibilityandopennessto workingalongsidecustomersis keytobuildingtrust.

Impact of touchpoints on trust - Māori 58 Maintaining / building trust among Māori Whanaungatanga (relationships) and whakawhanaungatanga (the building of relationships) are fundamental to building trust. Whanaungatanga means taking a relational and not transactional approach. Whakawhanaungatanga and building trusted relationships means the values of honesty and integrity are to the fore and often framed within Māori cultural values such as aroha, manaakitanga, mana and wairua. In practice, this means to build trust among Māori Inland Revenue should look to do the following: Female, 46-59 years, Māori, Individual “So, when I went down there, I was expecting and prepared to be defensive. I got such a shock that they were so friendly. I could explain my situation, they listened and I didn’t feel like I was being interrogated.” Demonstrate active listening and avoid assumptions: The complexity of the system should be acknowledged and there should be no automatic assumption or negative interpretation of Māori actions or intent. They should be given adequate opportunity to explain their position so they feel they are being listened to. Māori 7.2 Male, 60+ years, Māori, Individual “What I mean, so when you ring up there's an offer of help first rather than an accusation of something.” Female, 46-59 years, Māori, Individual “And not treated with suspicion, treated at least in the first instance with genuineness around helping.” 59 EnsureMāorifeelrespectedby frontlinestaff: From a Māori perspective, this means being greeted warmly and professionally and feeling that there is a genuine ethic of care with respect to their mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing. Male, 26-35 years, NZ European, individual “My value set are Māori values. In my role as a manager or a leader I try to model or teach them about manaaki (ethic of care) and kaitiakitanga (to look after/protect). Just all the really strong values that we need in terms of respecting people. Making sure that visitors are welcomed, no one is ignored, and there is respect for one another, and honesty... and wairua. They can walk into the business and just feel a real warmth and respect you know.” Male, 36-45 years, NZ European, individual “Well actually Māori values because you know those terms that come to mind like maanaki and aroha. How we care for people, how we mind their hinengaro (mental and emotional wellbeing) and wairua (spiritual wellbeing).” Maintaining / building trust among Māori Māori 7.2 60 Honestyandintegrity intherelationship. Male, 60+ years, Māori, Individual “Trust is when you have reassurance that, or knowledge that another person will do what they say they're going to do, and that they will be true to their word, because I always say that your word is your mana, so if you don't follow through with what you say you're going to do, then your word is not worth anything, so how can you be believed to follow through at another time. To be trusted means that you have integrity and that keeps people connected and they feel safe, and that's really important in community.” Female, 46-59, Māori, Individual “I think honesty, even if you know, if you don't like it, you need to be able to say what you think you know, being honest. And If you can’t do what you committed to, what you said you would to then, you come back to the table. Trust is hard earned but easily lost. You come back and say, I'm sorry but this is how it is, and that you know, maybe not what I thought in the first instance, and this is why I've changed my mind.” Maintaining / building trust among Māori Māori 7.2 Thetrustbuildingactionsnotedabovearenottoodissimilartothosedescribedfornon-Māori customers.However,giventhathistoricaldistrustMāorihaveof‘thesystem’andthe pervasivenessofnegativeexperiencesofgovernmentagencies,Māoriwillneedtofeelthatthey arerespectedatallpointsofengagement.

Impact of touchpoints on trust - individuals 63 Maintaining / building trust among businesses Beyond the basic principles of building trust, as outlined in Section 7.1.3, qualitative interviews with business customers identified some additional considerations when building or maintaining trust with this customer group. These are outlined below. Male, 36-45 years, NZ European, business “We have got no options, we cannot reverse those charges and then you hear from someone that has got$200,000 of debt to the Inland Revenue that has 80% of it written off. Like I say, you can reverse charges in certain circumstances, but you just don't want to do it here”. An equitable approach: There is a perception amongst business customers that some businesses get an ‘easier deal’ than others within the tax system (e.g. via ‘tax breaks’). Consequently, trust may be built by demonstrating that Inland Revenue takes an even-handed and fair approach to all business customers: Business 7.3 Female, 36-45 years, NZ European, business “I wouldn’t want to be paying my taxes and then have that business down the road not paying their taxes and nobody is following up to get it, so I need to be able to trust them that they're actually doing their job and making sure that everybody is paying their taxes fully and properly”. Female, 36-45 years, NZ European, business “It feels like from what you see and read is that there are inconsistencies how things are handled with different situations, so it seems like one person can absolutely pay no tax and then suddenly it gets wiped, they go bankrupt and they start again. And then someone else on the other side is trying to pay off their tax debts for years to come, it just seems that it's potentially unfair”. 64 An approachable and non- threatening organisation: Some business customers spoke about feeling intimidated by Inland Revenue, either due to previous negative dealings with the organisation, or the perceived power imbalance in the relationship. An organisation which is approachable and accessible, and shows willing to engage with business customers, may therefore improve trust levels with this customer group. Female, 60+ years, NZ European, business “I find them quite nerve racking to deal with, I don't like ringing them, I would more often get \[husband\] to ring them because instantly you're in the wrong... I'm feeling like I'm going to get into trouble... I think it's just because they think... I get the impression that you're already in the wrong even before you state your cause, why you’re there or what you're ringing about.” Male, 36-45 years, NZ European, business “I don't feel that I can approach the IR and have the conversation like we have had tonight. I'm scared of the IR, I'm not scared of you. And in order for me to trust them I need to know that they're not out to get me, they're out to work with me... I find them unapproachable and like I said they enforce like a bully would enforce a school whereas I would trust them more if I felt that I could approach them and talk to them, work with them and that sort of stuff”. Maintaining / building trust among businesses Business 7.3 65 Consistency of information and services provided: For some business customers, inconsistent services or responses from Inland Revenue had contributed to a low level of trust in the organisation. In particular, this customer group are seeking a reliable and uniform level of service, including the dissemination of information from different staff members: Male, 46-59 years, NZ European, business “I think they can be \[fair\] but also the flip side of that it depends who you get, and I heard this from the inside source, if you get the wrong person they're going to make a totally different call which completely undermines the whole company”. Maintaining / building trust among businesses Business 7.3 Female, 36-45 years, NZ European, business “Being able to trust the government or Inland Revenue and those kinds of places that they're not going to make life too hard for you especially being a small business owner... stuff around tax that you have to pay or making it easy to actually set up and get going in a small business because it's actually quite hard. I guess what they have got in place stays in place and it doesn’t flip around too much, that it's steady”. 66 Flexibility in addressing mistakes: An important time where trust can be built or maintained with business customers is during instances where they are unable to meet tax obligations (e.g. filing income tax returns) and/or have fallen behind with tax payments. In such circumstances, they are seeking a flexible and fair response from Inland Revenue; this includes working together to develop a reasonable arrangement for redressing the situation: Male, 36-45 years, NZ European, business “My dealings with Inland Revenue in the past have been soured by just their attitude... like the rules were broken but the way they enforced them, I felt it was archaic and just bully boyish.” Maintaining / building trust among businesses Business 7.3 Female, 36-45 years, NZ European, business “I did get behind in my taxes for a couple of years and they \[IR\] were really good and helped me get it all sorted and back up and getting on top of it all ... They actually gave me time to actually sit down to work through and get what I needed to get done. They didn’t give me a too short deadline that was impossible to achieve so that was good. So, I guess that’s trusting both ways - that they trusted that I would get it done ... \[and\] I trusted that they would give me that time and they wouldn’t hound me and harass me or anything like that”. Female, 46-59 years, NZ European, business “Most people do want to pay their debt, no one wants to get penalised because if a debt keeps growing it makes more people hide and stay away even more. But I think having people approach you and make you feel it's ok, like especially if someone says hey look, I know you're in debt, but we are here to help you sort it out.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

Trusts and estates generally pay tax on any income that they earn. You’ll pay a different amount of tax depending on your trust’s individual circumstances.

The information below applies to trusts and estates from 1 April 2024 for income that is not distributed to beneficiaries. For earlier years, this income was taxed at a flat 33% rate.

Trustee income
--------------

You must pay tax on any income that your trust does not distribute to beneficiaries. If your trust earns $10,000 or less in a tax year, you’ll pay at a 33% rate. If your trust earns any more than that, you’ll need to pay 39%. You can find the exceptions to this 39% tax rate below.

Any settlement on a trust does not count as income for tax purposes.

The estate of someone who has died
----------------------------------

We understand that dealing with the death of a friend or family member can be a difficult time. We want to make it as easy as possible to resolve their affairs, without adding any extra stress.

[I'm looking after the affairs of someone who has died](/situations/im-looking-after-the-affairs-of-someone-who-has-died)
 

If an estate continues to earn income while it’s being wound up, that income will be taxed at a 33% tax rate. This tax rate will apply for all the estate’s income during the tax year the person dies, and for the next 3 years. After that, any income will be taxed as though the estate were a trust.

Disabled beneficiary trusts
---------------------------

If you settled your trust to care for disabled beneficiaries, then it will pay tax at the 33% rate, no matter how much income it earns.

For these purposes, a ‘Disabled beneficiary’ means a beneficiary of the trust who receives 1 or more of the following support payments in a tax year:

*   the disability allowance,
*   the child disability allowance,
*   the supported living payment (because of restricted work capacity), or
*   the JobSeeker Support Health and Disability (if this has been paid for at least 6 months).

Disabled beneficiaries also include anybody over the age of 65 who would have met the ‘disabled beneficiary’ definition in the year they turned 65, or the tax year before that year.

Your trust can qualify for this 33% tax rate if it cares for more than 1 disabled beneficiary, but not if it has any beneficiaries who do not meet the definition.

Energy consumer trusts
----------------------

Energy consumer trusts, also known as lines trusts, are a special type of trust that deals with electricity distribution. These trusts are taxed at the 33% tax rate.

Legacy superannuation funds
---------------------------

Some superannuation funds pay tax at a 28% tax rate.

Income of trusts and estates - IR6 returns
==========================================

In the 2023 tax year, the income of trusts and estates from filed IR6 returns totalled $20.0 billion. This is an increase of 1.9% since 2022.

Graph of income of trusts and estates IR6 returns
-------------------------------------------------

![This graph has two lines that shows the total amount of trust income allocated between beneficiary income and trustee income. On the vertical axis is the total of trustee income and beneficiary income in $ millions. The horizontal axis shows tax years from 2001 to 2022. The amount of beneficiary income rose from $2.0 billion in 2001 to $6.4 billion in 2021 and fell to $5.2 billion in 2022. The amount of trustee income has risen at a faster and more volatile pace than beneficiary income.  Trustee income rose from $2.0 billion in 2001 to $10.3 billion in 2010. In 2011 trustee income fell to $5.3 billion. From 2011, trustee income rose again with a spike in 2013 to $9.1 billion. Between 2014 and 2020 trustee income rose at a steady pace from $6.1 billion in 2014 to $10.1 billion. In the 2021 tax year, trustee income sharply rose to $15.7 billion. In the 2022 tax year, trustee income fell to $14.1 billion.](/-/media/project/ir/home/graphics/about-us/tax-statistics/revenue-refunds/income-of-trusts-ir6-return/income/income-of-trusts-and-estates-resize.jpg?modified=20231113021549)

Over the period 2001 to 2023, trusts and estates have typically received between 40% to 70% of their income as imputed dividends from companies. Much of the volatility in trustee income seen over the 2001 to 2023 period is because of volatility in dividends paid by companies to their shareholders.

Between the 2001 to 2010 tax years, trustee income grew by 420% ($8.3 billion). The growth in income between 2001 and 2010 was driven by both an increase in the volume of trusts filing returns, which increased by 87,300 over that period, and by the aggregate value of dividends received.

In the 2009 tax year the company tax rate dropped from 33% to 30%. The company tax rate dropped again in the 2012 tax year to 28%.

Following both changes to the company tax rate, companies could attach imputation credits to dividends with reference to the higher preceding company tax rates for an additional two years. The changes in the company tax rate and the ability to impute dividends at a higher rate for a short period resulted in a spike in trustee income in the 2010 and 2013 tax years as companies temporarily increased their dividend payments to their shareholders.

Trustee income dropped substantially in the years following the higher dividend payments (2011 and 2014 tax years) as firms adjusted their dividend distributions after the higher pay-outs in the preceding years.

From 1 April 2021, the personal income tax scale changed with the introduction of a higher rate of 39% for people with income over $180,000. The growth in trustee income in the preceding 2021 tax year reflects high profitability and high dividend payouts in that year. 

There was an additional incentive for companies to pay out current and/or previous years retained earnings as imputed dividends to their shareholders, including trusts, prior to the introduction of the 39% top personal tax rate. The increase in dividends received by trusts was generally taxed at the trustee income tax rate of 33% with the relative amount of income allocated to trustees (rather than beneficiaries) increasing from 62% in 2020 to 71% in 2021.

In the 2023 tax year, trustee income increased by 3.5% to $14.9 billion. Income allocated to beneficiaries fell by 2.5% to $5.1 billion. As a result of an increase in trustee income and a decrease in the income allocated to beneficiaries, the share of income allocated to trustees increased further from 73% in 2022 to 74% in 2023. This continued higher relative allocation to trustees may reflect that since the introduction of the 39% personal tax rate in 2022, there is now a tax advantage in treating income as trustee income at the 33% tax rate rather than beneficiary income taxed at personal rates.

Trusts
======

A trust is a creation of the law of equity and is not a legal entity distinct from its trustee. Instead, a trust is a fiduciary relationship where a trustee holds property for the benefit of beneficiaries or, where the trust is a charitable trust, for the specified charitable purposes. Although the trustee has legal ownership of the trust property, they hold it subject to the beneficial interests of the beneficiaries and must act in accordance with the terms of the trust and the Trusts Act 2019.

Targeting serious crime: extending information sharing
======================================================

### Introduction

Government agencies share specified information as part of improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the services they provide.

An existing information sharing agreement between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Police enables Inland Revenue to provide information, under certain criteria, to the New Zealand Police to detect, prevent and prosecute serious crime.

In the existing agreement, serious crime is defined as an offence punishable by a term of imprisonment of four years or more. The information exchanged since the agreement’s implementation in 2014 has delivered significant benefits in tackling serious crime.

The Government is proposing to extend the existing information sharing agreement to include the Serious Fraud Office and the New Zealand Customs Service, so that Inland Revenue can share information with these agencies to help them investigate serious crime.

### Summary of proposals

The Government proposes allowing Inland Revenue to share information with the Serious Fraud Office and the New Zealand Customs Service, under the same framework currently used to share information with the New Zealand Police for targeting serious crime.

The existing framework and proposed model for sharing information with those agencies would allow an agency to request information, or for Inland Revenue to proactively provide information, when the agency or Inland Revenue considers there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that:

*    a serious crime has been committed, is being committed, or will be committed; and
*   the information is relevant to preventing, detecting, investigating, or providing evidence of a serious crime.

​In addition, Inland Revenue must be satisfied that:

*   any statutory criteria relating to the release of protected information are met;
*   the information is readily available within Inland Revenue;
*   it is reasonable and practicable to communicate the information; and
*   it is in the public interest to communicate it.

These proposals do not alter the existing information sharing agreement with the New Zealand Police. They build on that activity to allow the New Zealand Customs Service and the Serious Fraud Office to provide services more efficiently, while maintaining the privacy protections provided by the Privacy Act 1993 and the Tax Administration Act 1994.

The Government welcomes feedback on all aspects of these proposals, including whether additional controls should be put in place.

### The discussion document

The proposals are set out in the Government’s discussion document _[Targeting serious crime: extending information sharing](/publications/2018/2018-dd-tsc-extending)
_.

The proposals are discussed in detail in chapter 2. Details about information sharing and the existing information sharing agreement with the New Zealand Police are set out in chapter 3.

### Closing date for submissions

The closing date for submissions was **30 October 2018**.

Tax Working Group Information Release Release Document April 2019 taxworkingroup.govt.nz/key-documents Key to sections of the Official Information Act 1982 under which information has been withheld. Certain information in this document has been withheld under one or more of the following sections of the Official Information Act, as applicable: \[1\]9(2)(a) - to protect the privacy of natural persons, including deceased people; \[2\]9(2)(f)(iv) - t o maintain the current constitutional conventions protecting the confidentiality of advice tendered by ministers and officials; \[3\]9(2)(g)(i) - to maintain the effective conduct of public affairs through the free and frank expression of opinions; \[4\]9(2)(j) - to enable the Crown to negotiate without disadvantage or prejudice. Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 1 February 2019 Hon Grant Robertson, Minister of Finance Hon Stuart Nash, Minister of Revenue Dear Ministers, It is with great pleasure that I present the Final Report of the Tax Working Group. The Final Report is a result of further consultation and engagement with various sectors of society but particularly focuses on furthering the technical work involved with an extension of the taxation of capital gains as well as the outcomes from further engagement on environmental taxation. The report seeks to present new areas of thought by the Group since the Interim Report but includes the recommendations from both reports in summarised form. The Group has endeavoured to address the points you raised in your letter to me on 20 September 2018 and this letter seeks to highlight our responses. General observations The Terms of Reference noted that the New Zealand tax system has been justifiably commended internationally for being a simple and efficient system. This does not mean, however, that there is not room for significant improvement in the structure, fairness and balance of the New Zealand tax system particularly in the areas of the taxation of capital gains and environmental taxation. There were differing views within the Group as to the appropriate level of extension of capital gains. The clear majority favoured the broad approach outlined in Volume 2 while the minority’s view was that there was only a case to extend taxation to capital gains from residential rental investment properties. The preference of the Group was that any extension of the taxation of capital gains be through a taxation of gains on realisation, rather than a form of risk free rate of return or deemed rate of return methods. The merits of a deemed rate of return method are, however, discussed in the report. The Group has also noted the need for the Government to enhance its institutional technical capability and capacity in the area of tax. This includes the tax technical capability of Inland Revenue’s investigation function, Treasury’s strategic capacity; and also capability across Government to design and implement environment taxation. For the Government’s tax policy function this involves an improvement in its policy processes as well as the understanding of a Te Ao Māori worldview. Packages The Group has considered four illustrative packages for revenue to be recycled within the tax system. They are all predicated on a broad extension of the taxation of capital gains. If a narrower approach was taken to the extension of such taxation the packages would need to be scaled back to maintain revenue neutrality. T he Group’s view is all the potential components have merit and the Government could choose any of them or elements of them depending on its priorities. Further the options are merely possibilities within the tax system and there may be other options, such as increasing benefits or Working for Families Tax Credits that may better advance the Government’s objective to reduce inequality. I n terms of the specific points you raise: C apital, wealth and savings The Group considered whether there were better approaches to understand the wealth, capital income, and effective tax rates of individuals particularly in the top decile. Our recommendations are that the Government: a.Funds oversampling of the wealthy in existing wealth surveys. b.Includes a question on wealth in the census. c.Requests Inland Revenue regularly repeat its analysis of the tax paid by high wealth individuals. d.Commissions research on using a variety of sources of data on capital income, including administrative data, to estimate the wealth of individuals. We also considered whether a threshold would be appropriate where any capital gains on the sale of b usinesses were not taxed. Our view is that there should be a deferral of taxation through rollover relief where a small active business reinvests the proceeds from sale into other active business assets. T he Group also understands that many business owners fund their retirement by selling their business. Another major form of retirement savings is KiwiSaver schemes. As referenced below, if the Government were to lower the prescribed investor rates for KiwiSaver schemes to five percentage points below the savers’ marginal tax rate (so the KiwiSaver tax rates would be 5.5%, 12.5% and 28%), this should be extended in some form to business owners selling their businesses to fund their retirement. T he Group recommends providing a one-off concession by extending these lower KiwiSaver tax rates to the first $500,000 of capital gains made by business owners who sell a closely held active business to retire. This measure could also potentially apply to younger business owners to the extent that the capital gain they made from selling their business is reinvested into a KiwiSaver scheme. T o promote a more balanced savings culture and deeper capital markets, the Group considered a range of possibilities to encourage low-income earners to save. Within the tax system, an illustrative set of options could include: a.A refund of the employer’s s uperannuation contribution tax (ESCT). Inland Revenue would refund ESCT for KiwiSaver members earning up to $48,000 per annum. The ESCT would b e r efunded to the taxpayer’s KiwiSaver account. The refund would be progressively clawed back for employees earning more than $48,000 per annum, so that employees earning over $70,000 would receive no benefit. This is a modification of the capped ESCT exemption that was discussed in the Interim Report. b.Parental benefit. A KiwiSaver member on parental leave would receive the maximum member tax credit, even if they did not make the full $1,024 of contributions. c.Member tax credit. An increase in the member tax credit from $0.50 per $1 of contribution to $0.75 per $1 of contribution. The contribution cap would remain unchanged at $1,024. d.Portfolio investment entity (PIE) rate reductions. A five percentage point reduction in the lower PIE rates for KiwiSaver funds (i.e. the 10.5% and 17.5% rates). Taxation of business and future of work T he Group has investigated and recommended a number of tax measures that could enhance productivity. These include changes to the loss continuity rules, expanding deductions for ‘black-hole’ expenditure, and concessions for nationally significant infrastructure projects. Some or all of these measures could form part of a package of tax reform. W e have also assessed the merits of restoring building depreciation deductions. Subject to fiscal constraints, the Government could consider restoring depreciation deductions if capital gains taxation is extended. A s requested the Group has expanded its consideration of what compliance cost reductions would be beneficial. These are: Fo r immediate action: a.Increasing the threshold for provisional tax from $2,500 to $5,000 of residual income tax. b.Increasing the closing stock adjustment from $10,000 to $20,000-$30,000. c.Increasing the $10,000 automatic deduction for legal fees, and a potential expansion of the automatic deduction to other types of professional fees. d.Reducing the number of depreciation rates, and a simplification of the process for using default rates. S ubject to fiscal constraints: e.Simplifying the fringe benefit tax, and simplify (or even removing) the entertainment adjustment. f.Removing resident withholding tax on close company related party interest and dividend payments, subject to integrity concerns. g.Removing the requirement for taxpayers to seek the Commissioner’s approval to issue GST Buyer Created Tax Invoices. h.Allowing special rate certificates and certificates of exemption to be granted retrospectively. i.Increasing the period of validity for a certificate of exemption or special rate certificate. j.Removing the requirement to file a change of imputation ratio notice with Inland Revenue. k.Extending the threshold of ‘cash basis person’ in the financial arrangement rules, which would better allow for the current levels of personal debt. l.Increasing the threshold for not requiring a GST change of use adjustment. The Government should also review and explore opportunities to: m.Adjust the thresholds for unexpired expenditure, and for the write-off of low value assets. n.Help small businesses reduce compliance costs through the use of cloud-based accounting software. o.Consider compensation for withholding agents if additional withholding tax obligations are imposed. p.Review the taxation of non-resident employees. q.Review whether the rules for hybrid mismatches should apply to small businesses or simple business transactions. The Group continues to be of the view that there are a number of measures required to ensure that the tax system is able to accommodate likely changes in the future of work. International income tax The Group supports the Government’s direction to officials to consider options, including an equalisation tax, for the taxation of multinationals. It recommends that the Government stand ready to implement a digital services tax if a critical mass of other countries move in that direction, and it is reasonably certain New Zealand’s export industries will not be materially impacted by any retaliatory measures. Environmental and ecological outcomes The Group has designed a framework for taxing negative environmental externalities and recommends that the Government adopt it. The Group looked at environmental and ecological outcomes from a short, medium and long term perspective. You have particularly asked about the medium and long term. In the medium term, environmental tax revenue should be used to help fund a transition to a more sustainable, circular economy. In the longer term, environmental taxes could extend New Zealand’s tax base in a regenerative economy. This could be enabled by the consideration and design of innovative new tools like an environmental footprint tax or a natural capital enhancement tax. Other issues The Group continues to be supportive of a tax advocate service and is the view that this could be the first step in the development of a truncated disputes process for small taxpayers. The Group supports the development of a framework for the application of corrective taxes similar to the one the Group has designed for environmental and ecological outcomes. The Group continues to be of the view that the settings for the taxation of charities and in particular charitable business should be reviewed. This is to ensure that the tax benefits provided by the Government ultimately flow to the enhancement of the wellbeing of New Zealanders. The Group has looked at tax depreciation for buildings in various ways. The Group considers that including seismic strengthening has merit and that there be consideration of further extension of tax depreciation for commercial and industrial buildings in light of fiscal circumstances. C oncluding comments W hile the Group has achieved much in its time together, there is still much more to be done. Many of the recommendations require further analysis and engagement with affected and interested parties. I t is important to stress that the Government does not face a binary choice regarding whether or not to extend capital gains taxation. There is a spectrum of choices for the coverage of assets, and the inclusion of each asset class will come with its own costs and benefits. F or this reason, the Government could choose to extend the taxation of capital gains to some asset classes only. The Government also has options around how to stage the timing of introduction and whether to phase in the inclusion of asset classes. R egardless of their position on the merits of extending the taxation of capital gains, all members agree that the introduction of a system for taxing capital gains would be a significant endeavour requiring the full attention of the Government. I f the Government decides to proceed, it is crucial that Inland Revenue is fully resourced and has the capability to develop and implement the new tax. The policy and legislative processes must also include thorough consultation with a diverse range of voices using both formal and informal channels. Th e Group also notes that the Government’s stated timeframes for implementing tax reform will be challenging. The Government will need to ensure additional resources are available for implementation if these timeframes are to be achieved. I f the Government decides not to extend the taxation of capital gains to all asset classes, Inland Revenue will need to fully enforce the existing capital/revenue boundary. This includes the taking of test cases, as well as giving policy and investigative attention to existing areas of concern. Y ours sincerely Michael Cullen KNZM Chair, Tax Working Group
Tax Working Group Information Release Release Document September 2018 taxworkingroup.govt.nz/key-documents This paper has been prepared by a person/group for consideration by the whole Tax Working Group. The advice represents the views of the person/group who prepared the paper and does not necessarily represent the views of the Group or the Government. 1 13 th July 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 WELLINGTON 6140 Report on the suitability of establishing a tax ombudsman and a tax advocate This paper considers whether either of the following alternatives would be appropriate in the New Zealand context: A tax ombudsman; A tax advocate intended to provide ‘smaller’ taxpayers with a low-cost way of settling disputes with Inland Revenue and how would such a process fit within the existing disputes regime Executive Summary Based on a review of other jurisdictions I consider New Zealand’s tax system has fallen well behind current international developments in best practice for taxpayer rights and dispute resolution. These failings are jeopardising the procedural fairness of the tax system. They represent a threat to the integrity of the tax system and taxpayers’ perception of that integrity. I therefore make the following recommendations: 1. The Ombudsman’s office should appoint a properly resourced deputy ombudsman with sole responsibility for oversight of complaints involving Inland Revenue (IR). This would be in line with current best practice developments outside New Zealand. 2. A clear, accessible and affordable disputes process is integral to the integrity of the tax system. The present disputes regime is expensive and its cost acts as a bar to smaller taxpayers in particular, prompting the question of whether a taxpayer advocate is required to provide assistance. Furthermore, there has been a very marked fall-off in substantive tax cases appearing in the courts. This fall-off has been the subject of comment from two Supreme Court Justices. If taxpayers feel the disputes process is not available to them then that represents a threat to taxpayers’ perception of the integrity of the tax system. 3. This threat can be countered by simplifying the current disputes process to reduce costs principally by allowing earlier use of IR’s Dispute Resolution Unit. In conjunction with this reform, IR should establish a Taxpayer 2 Advocate Service (TAS) similar to the Taxpayer Advocate Service run by the United States Internal Revenue Service. 4. The TAS would have responsibility for providing assistance to low income earners, small businesses and individuals with English as a second language who are engaged in a dispute with IR over the quantum of tax payable. Qualifying taxpayers would be able to request assistance from the TAS where the core tax in dispute is under $50,000. 5. Taxpayers who received assistance from the TAS in relation to a dispute with IR should retain their existing appeal rights. The involvement of the TAS would be an integral part of a reformed dispute regime, rather than an adjunct of it as initially suggested. 6. As part of IR’s Charter obligations, the TAS should also adopt the Australian Tax Office’s (ATO) Dispute Assist programme. This would provide assistance to qualifying taxpayers with other issues with IR outside the disputes process such as payment of tax due, repayment of overpaid tax credits, child support and student loans. 7. Although within IR, the head of the TAS would report directly to Parliament’s Finance and Expenditure Committee (FEC). We suggest the head of the TAS is appointed from outside IR. This should promote the independence of the TAS and therefore boost public confidence in the service. 8. Consideration should be given into developing the current IR Charter into a formal taxpayers’ Bill of Rights similar to that available to taxpayers in the United States. It appears taxpayer and tax agents’ knowledge of the Charter is not widespread 1 . IR should promote taxpayer knowledge of the Charter and its annual report to the FEC should include specific details on its progress in promoting the Charter. 2 1 In preparing this report we surveyed the members of the Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand (ATAINZ) and Institute of Certified NZ Bookkeepers (ICNZB) on a range of issues (see Appendix A for details). Only 39% of respondents said they were aware of the IR Charter. 2 We note IR’s current Statement of Intent 2016-2020 does not mention the Charter http://www.ird.govt.nz/resources/4/5/4576ff3c-2e12-458a-abf1-e586e8596ce0/soi2016.pdf 3 Detailed Analysis A. Background 1. The questions I have been asked to consider are at core matters of taxpayer rights, whether it is of oversight of administrative practice or a lower-cost way of settling tax disputes. 2. The issue of taxpayers’ rights in general, other than when involved in a dispute with IR, does not seem to have been officially examined in any detail since the Finance and Expenditure Committee (FEC) Inquiry into the powers of the Inland Revenue Department in 1999. 3 The FEC Inquiry made a number of recommendations regarding taxpayer rights and the Ombudsman’s oversight of complaints about IR. Those recommendations were initially implemented but in recent years some appear to be no longer operative. 3. Subsequently, the McLeod Tax Review in 2001 made only a passing reference to the issue of disputes resolution 4 and the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group final report released in 2010 5 made no comment on the matter of taxpayer rights, whether in respect of disputes or generally. 4. Notwithstanding the relative official silence in the last two reviews of the tax system, tax practitioners, academics and members of the Judiciary have regularly commented on the status of taxpayer rights in New Zealand whether in relation to the disputes process or IR’s exercise of its search, inspection and seizure powers under sections 16 and 16B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 6 Presenting at the NZLS Tax Conference in 2013 Geoff Clews QC remarked of his experience working on the changes to the dispute process in 2010-11: 3 http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/1999-other-inquiry-ird-fec/overview 4 See para 2.21 https://treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2007-11/taxreview2001-report.pdf 5 https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cagtr/pdf/tax-report-website.pdf 6 See for example Tax and the Courts speech by Glazebrook J at the 2015 Tax Conference of Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand https://www.courtsofnz.govt.nz/publications/speeches-and-papers/#speechpaper-list-2015 Small Tax Dispute Resolution in New Zealand – Making Taxpayers ‘Winners’ Not ‘Losers,’ paper by Melinda Jone and Andrew Maples presented at the Australasian Tax Teachers Association Conference in January 2018 https://www.monash.edu/\_\_data/assets/pdf\_file/0003/1256250/Maples-and-Jones- ATTA2018.pdf Search and Surveillance Mike Lennard and Graham Tubb paper presented at the 2011 NZLS Tax Conference Remedies against the Commissioner: revenue through a public law lens Una Jagose paper presented at the 2013 NZLS Tax Conference 4 “While the achievements of that project have improved the process, working on it with IR officials reinforced the impression that IR is very conscious that it presides over a tax administration which is weighted in its favour. It is reluctant to see that change. It may agree to administrative or managerial changes, which are not always just tinkering at the edges, whatever critics may argue, but is most reluctant to see taxpayer interests reflected in a different legislative response. In short, the interests of taxpayers in the system were viewed and distilled through the judgments of IR, rather than by reference to independently stated rights.” 7 5. Since 1999 tax authorities around the world have been sharing increasing amounts of taxpayer information. This trend accelerated in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis, with such information-sharing initiatives as Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and the OECD’s Common Reporting Standard (CRS) on Automatic Exchange of Information. According to the OECD over 100 jurisdictions will exchange CRS information in September 2018 under more than the 3,200 bilateral relationships now in place. 8 This significant intrusion into taxpayer privacy has so far gone largely unchallenged. 6. Over the same period there have been a number of developments around the world in relation to clarifying the rights and responsibilities of taxpayers and tax authorities and the resolution of tax disputes between taxpayers and tax authorities. Increasing numbers of countries are establishing specific tax ombudsmen offices and tax authorities are adopting taxpayer charters/bill of rights. Reflecting the growing interest in these issues a Model Taxpayer Charter 9 was l aunched in 2015 as part of a collaboration between the Asia Oceania Tax Consultants’ Association (AOTCA), Confederation Fiscale Europeenne (CFE) and Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners (STEP). In the same year the International Fiscal Association’s Cahiers de droit fiscal international focussed on the practical protection of taxpayers’ fundamental rights. 7. Against this backdrop it is therefore timely for the Tax Working Group to consider the general state of taxpayer rights in the New Zealand tax system including the current tax disputes process. 7 Para 2.1 reproduced at https://www.taxcounsel.co.nz/Resources/Publications+papers+and+commentary/Remedies +Against+the+Commissioner+of+Inland+Revenue+Considered+Through+a+Constitutional+Le ns/2013+NZLS+Tax+Conference+Paper.html 8 OECD press release https://www.oecd.org/tax/major-enlargement-of-the-global-network- for-the-automatic-exchange-of-offshore-account-information-as-over-100-jurisdictions-get- ready-for-exchanges.htm 9 http://www.taxpayercharter.com/ 5 B. Establishing a Tax Ombudsman 1. At present taxpayers can take complaints regarding IR to the Ombudsman if they have not resolved the matter through IR’s complaints management service. IR remain one of the largest sources of complaints to the Ombudsman with an average of over 100 complaints over the 2011-2017 period. About one-third of all cases taken to the Ombudsman involve child support or student loan which may indicate other issues with representation/appeal rights. 10 2. The FEC Inquiry in 1999 noted “overwhelming support” 11 from submitters for a separate tax ombudsman to investigate taxpayer complaints. However, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue expressed concerns about duplication and uncertainty. The then Chief Ombudsman Sir Brian Elwood submitted 12 that the cost of additional specialist resources to deal with tax administration investigations would be less than the cost of establishing a separate Tax Ombudsman Office. The FEC ultimately decided establishing a separate tax ombudsman’s office was “not desirable” and instead recommended: the Government establish a specialist tax adviser position within the Office of the Ombudsman with appropriate resources to investigate matters of tax administration by \[IR\]. This recommendation was subsequently implemented. 3. The current level of tax expertise within the Ombudsman’s office is not clear and at the very least the FEC’s recommendation in 1999 should be followed and the necessary level of expertise re-established. 4. Since the FEC Inquiry there has been a significant increase in the number of specific tax ombudsmen offices around the world including in the following Commonwealth jurisdictions: 10 Based on the Annual Reports for each of the years ended 30 th June 2011 to 2017 inclusive. http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/resources-and-publications/corporate- documents/annual-reports These statistics do not include complaints under the Official Information Act 1982. 11 http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/1999-other-inquiry-ird-fec/term-of-reference-d 12 See pages 45-46 of the FEC report. In addition, the Parliamentary library supplied me with a copy of Sir Brian’s submission 6 Australia (Inspector-General of Taxation) Canada India Pakistan South Africa Date Established 2003/2015 13 2007 2006 2000 2013 5. The United Kingdom established the Adjudicator’s Office in 1993 to review complaints about HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). In the United States the National Taxpayer Advocate (NTA) was created in 1998 within the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The NTA is the successor organisation to the Office of the Taxpayer Ombudsman. Two other bodies, The Oversight Board (currently suspended for lack of a quorum) and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration have oversight of the IRS. 6. With regards to the situation in countries with similar sized population to New Zealand, Ireland does not have a separate tax ombudsman. All complaints about the Revenue Commissioners are handled by the Office of the Ombudsman. 14 Finland and Norway do not have separate tax ombudsmen and the general ombudsman in both countries handles tax complaints about tax administration. By contrast, from 1 January 2017 the Danish parliament’s ombudsman established a new office which is exclusively responsible for reviewing tax and tax administration cases. 7. As part of the research for this paper over 1,200 ATAINZ and NZICB 15 members were surveyed. As in 1999, there appears to be widespread support for a separate tax ombudsman. To date more than 200 responses have been received. Of these, 94.7% supported the idea of a separate tax Ombudsman with 74.1% considering he or she should be part of the Ombudsman’s office. 8. I consider the extent of IR’s reach and powers are sufficient to merit a specific role within the Ombudsman’s office at the level of Deputy Ombudsman. This would also be in line with international trends towards establishing such offices. Keeping such a role within the Ombudsman’s office should counter concerns about duplication and expense. We also suggest that IR reports regularly to the tax ombudsman on its progress in dealing with complaints through its internal complaint management service. We note that statistics regarding complaints handled internally no longer appear to be part of IR’s annual reports. 13 The Inspector-General of Taxation was created in 2003 and took over responsibility for handling taxpayer complaints about the Australian Tax Office (ATO) from the Commonwealth Ombudsman in 2015 14 https://www.ombudsman.ie/ 15 See Appendix for details of the questions asked 7 C. Improving the dispute resolution process for small taxpayers 1. Taxpayers must not only have the right to challenge the Commissioner they must also feel that both IR and the disputes process will treat them fairly. I do not consider a majority of taxpayers and practitioners involved with the current disputes process 16 would accept that it is fair. 2. Tax practitioners have made repeated complaints about the disputes process since its implementation at the start of the 1996-97 income year and these have been largely ignored. For example, the New Zealand Law Society (NZLS) and the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NIZICA) made joint submissions on the issue in 2008 and then again in 2010. Although some administrative changes were made in 2010/11, all the substantive changes suggested by NZLS/NIZICA in submissions to Tax Administration and Remedial Matters Bill in 2010 were declined. The effect of inaction risks undermining taxpayer perceptions of the integrity of the tax system which is contrary to the responsibility of ministers and officials to protect the integrity of the tax system under Section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3. Supreme Court Justice Glazebrook encapsulated the main complaints about the current disputes process when she observed at the 2015 Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand tax conference: “What is not so positive is the concern that the dispute resolution processes, even in simple cases, takes a lot of time, effort and therefore cost to complete. When this is coupled with the new penalty and interest regime with its differential interest rates for taxpayers and the Revenue, the concern is that taxpayers are “burnt off” by the taxation disputes process. This means that taxpayers may be forced to settle legitimate tax disputes as they cannot afford the time or money necessary to continue court proceedings. Certainly, the time and cost of the dispute resolution processes was one of the concerns coming out of the survey of tax practitioners reported on 19 November 2015 at the conference. 17 ” 4. I recommend the establishment of a TAS to assist smaller taxpayers in disputes with IR involving tax of $50,000 or less 18 . Assistance would be provided through a series of Low Income Tax Clinics (LITCs). Regardless of this, a significant reduction in costs for taxpayers should be achievable by changing the current disputes process to introduce mediation via the DRU if the dispute is still unresolved after the NOPA/NOR exchange is completed. 16 Part IVA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA), a diagram of the current process is at Appendix B 17 Tax and the Courts see note 6 above 18 This was the figure suggested by most respondents to the ATAINZ/ICNZB survey 8 The introduction of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) processes particularly is a growing part of tax disputes internationally 19 . 5. For example, from 1 April 2014 the ATO made in-house facilitation available for individuals and small businesses. This involves an ATO officer trained in facilitative mediation who has previously not been involved in the dispute. 20 According to the ATO, every dispute resolved through in-house facilitation saves taxpayers A$50,000 on average. The process also has “a positive impact on the relationship between the ATO and taxpayer and promotes trust and confidence in the system.” 21 6. Similarly, HMRC offers a voluntary ADR service also involving a HMRC staff member trained in ADR techniques and with no prior involvement in the case 22 . Using ADR does not affect a taxpayer’s appeal rights. According to its 2017-2018 Annual Report 82% of cases accepted for ADR were resolved successfully. In 2017-18 94% of taxpayers and their representatives said they were either satisfied or very satisfied with the ADR process. 23 7. Moving the DRU involvement to after the NOPA/NOR stage would not affect taxpayers’ rights of appeal. In both Australia and the United Kingdom taxpayers adopting the in-house facilitation or voluntary ADR service still retained their appeal rights. 8. I do not consider any change is needed to the NOPA/NOR stage of the disputes process at this point because the increasing availability of insurance against IR reviews and audits should enable taxpayers to cover most costs up and including to the NOPA/NOR stage. However, the present IR policy of limiting the Commissioner’s NOPA to five pages for disputes involving less than $5,000 (excluding evasion and tax avoidance issues) should be revised to apply to disputes under $50,000 as this is the suggested cap for TAS assistance. 9. As noted by Glazebrook J in the passage cited above, the current use of money interest regime with its differential rates 24 can act as a deterrent to taxpayers. I suggest interest should stop running 60 days after a Notice of Response has been filed, thereby completing the NOPA/NOR stage in a dispute. This is because at present no time limit applies for setting a date 19 See Melinda Jone & Andrew Maples Small tax disputes resolution in New Zealand: Making taxpayers "Winners" not "Losers" 20 https://www.ato.gov.au/general/dispute-or-object-to-an-ato-decision/options-for- resolving-disputes/in-house-facilitation/ 21 ATO Annual Report 2016-2017 page 65 https://www.ato.gov.au/uploadedFiles/Content/CR/downloads/annualreport.pdf 22 https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tax-disputes-alternative-dispute-resolution-adr 23 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_d ata/file/724943/HMRC\_Annual\_Report\_and\_Accounts\_2017-18\_\_print\_.pdf 24 The current interest rates are 8.22% for underpaid tax and 1.02% for overpaid tax 9 for a conference hearing. Given the differential between use of money interest rates the present system advantages the Commissioner in disputes. Turning off the interest clock should incentivise both parties to move to the proposed adjudication phase quickly. 10. As a joint NZLS/NZICA submission noted the disputes process is “unique in New Zealand law, and in terms of global tax administration.” 25 This makes statistical comparisons with other jurisdictions difficult. Based on the available data the current disputes process appears to be acting to be acting as a deterrent to litigation on substantive matters. There has been a noticeable decline in cases reaching the courts which has been noted by the judiciary itself. Young J first raised the matter in a 2009 paper 26 and his colleague Glazebrook J discussed it in 2013 27 and again in 2015. According to Glazebrook J the average number of substantive tax cases heard in the Taxation Review Authority and High Court between 1993 and 2015 was as follows: 28 Period Taxation Review Authority High Court 1993-2002 2003-2008 2008-2013 2014-2015 50 10 9 12 20 6 8 15 11. The 2003 Issues Paper Resolving tax disputes: a legislative review, stated the proportion of audited cases giving rise to a dispute was two percent of total cases in 1997. After the introduction of the new disputes regime, this figure had dropped to 0.91 percent in 2002. 29 By contrast the ATO reported that for the 2013-14 year on average about 14 percent of all income tax audits resulted in objections. 30 25 Per NZLS/NZICA joint submission to FEC in 2011 https://www.parliament.nz/resource/en- NZ/49SCFE\_EVI\_00DBHOH\_BILL10469\_1\_A172698/c643b4b633b4e93d50984f72619501aa9cebc bec 26 “Tax Disputes in New Zealand” (2009) 4(1) JATTA (also cited by Glazebrook J) 27 Taxation Disputes in New Zealand paper presented at the Australasian Tax Teachers Association 2013 Conference https://www.courtsofnz.govt.nz/publications/speeches-and- papers/#speechpaper-list-2013 28 Tax and the Courts see note 6 above 29 http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2003-dd-disputes/overview see para 1.8 30 Table 1.1 Tax disputes Report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Tax and Revenue https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary\_Business/Committees/House/Tax\_and\_Revenue/Inqu iry\_into\_Tax\_Disputes/Report 10 12. According to IR statistics the total number of NOPAs and NORs issued during each of the years ended 30 th June 2011 to 30 th June 2017 inclusive was as follows 31 : 2011 20122013201420152016 2017 Taxpayer NOPAs 75 92919589109 86 CIR NORs 62 7067837498 78 CIR NOPAs 306 266289225216225 211 Taxpayer NORs 69 1181371268599 79 Total 512 546584529464531 454 13. In the context of 4.8 million active customers as at 31 March 2107 including over 447,000 companies and more than 246,000 trusts 32 , an average of 517 NOPAs/NORs issued annually seems low. Tax can be litigious particularly when involving issues such as the capital-revenue divide. The question therefore arises as to whether many taxpayers are not entering into disputes because of cost or other factors. It would be helpful if IR were to provide more comprehensive statistics on the level and results of its investigation/review activity. 14. Although it is important to lower the cost barriers to enter into the disputes process, at the same time this does not mean that taxpayers can engage in frivolous or vexatious disputes. Retention of the NOPA/NOR stage should mitigate against such action. 31 Supplied by IR. These are indicative only and no correlation between the NOPAs and NORs should be assumed. 32 IR statistics http://www.ird.govt.nz/aboutir/external-stats/customers/act-by-entity- type/customers-act-by-entity-type.html 11 D. Tax Advocate Service 1. The practical protection of taxpayers’ fundamental rights was subject 2 of the 2015 edition of the International Fiscal Association’s (IFA) Cahiers de droit fiscal international. 33 In it the IFA stated: We have little hesitation in recommending that the best practice is the establishment of a separate office of tax ombudsman/taxpayer advocate/director of legal protection for taxpayers within the tax authority, but clearly independent from the normal operation of that authority. 2. The current best example of the role of a taxpayer advocate would appear to be the United States Taxpayer Advocate Service 34 headed by the National Taxpayer Advocate (NTA) Nina Olsen who has been in the role since 2001. Although both the NTA and Taxpayer Advocate Service are under the jurisdiction of the IRS, the NTA reports directly to Congress 35 . 3. I propose IR should establish a Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) based on the United States model. I envisage the proposed TAS as adjacent but separate to IR and playing a big role in helping IR deliver on the values of the Charter. Any risk of “group think” developing between IR and the TAS could be avoided by ensuring the head of the TAS is someone from outside IR with a strong background in customer rights. The TAS would report to the FEC or alternatively to the proposed Deputy Tax Ombudsman. Whether it’s the FEC or the Ombudsman, TAS should not report to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The success of the role will ultimately depend on its perceived independence. TAS’ independence could be enhanced if it was actually entirely separate from IR, although that might raise inter- jurisdictional issues between it and IR as well as being costlier to introduce. 4. Part of the TAS’ role would be to follow the example of the NTA and establish a series of LITCs aimed at supporting the low income and those for whom English is a second language. I suggest ‘low income’ for this purpose could be below $48,000 for individuals and maybe $60-70,000 for a family unit. As noted in part C above LITCs could also provide support where the total tax in dispute (excluding penalties and interest) was under $50,000. 5. In the United States the NTA runs a grant scheme 36 for charities and other organisations who represent low income taxpayers in disputes with the IRS. Grants are made on a dollar for dollar basis up to a maximum of US$100,000. 33 https://www.ifa.nl/home not available online but IR supplied a copy 34 https://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/about-tas 35 https://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/reports/2017-annual-report-to-congress 36 https://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/about/litc 12 In the United Kingdom charities such as TaxAid 37 and Tax Help for Older People 38 provide assistance in tax matters. This may involve retired tax practitioners advising on specific issues. I recommend the TAS run a similar programme which would involve providing grants to bodies such as the Citizens Advice Bureau and Child Poverty Action Group. 6. We note that Curtin University in Western Australia in conjunction with Greenstone Legal opened a tax assistance clinic on 2 nd July 39 very similar in design to the suggested LITCs. We suggest IR monitors the progress of this initiative. 7. It should be noted that many tax practitioners do currently provide services to taxpayers in dispute with IR on a pro-bono or reduced rate 40 . Arguably, such support represents a hidden subsidy for IR. 87.9% of ATAINZ and NZICB members surveyed were very supportive of the role of a taxpayer advocate 41 . 8. In December 2016 the ATO commenced a pilot called Dispute Assist to support unrepresented individual taxpayers such as the elderly or those dealing with family illness, domestic violence or mental health issues. By 30 June 2017, 64 such taxpayers had received the assistance of an independent ATO guide to assist them through the Australian disputes process and related issues such as tax debts or issues with other government agencies. Subsequently, the Dispute Assist project has been expanded to include small business taxpayers. Regardless of whether a TAS is established, I recommend IR adopt a similar programme to Dispute Assist as soon as possible. Apart from income tax and GST, the programme is likely to support those with issues around child support, working for families’ tax credits and student loans. 37 http://taxaid.org.uk/ 38 http://www.taxvol.org.uk/ 39 https://businesslaw.curtin.edu.au/law/tax-clinic/ 40 In the survey of ATAINZ members, 24 of 33 respondents said they had provided support in tax disputes at no or reduced cost. 41 See Appendix A 13 E. Charter/Bill of Rights 1. The FEC recommended IR establish a taxpayer’s charter outlining taxpayers’ rights and obligations in respect of the tax system. IR first published its Charter 42 in 2001 but it was last reviewed in detail in March 2009. In the meantime, international practice is moving towards clearer expressions of taxpayer rights and obligations either in the form of a taxpayer Bill of Rights or a charter. 2. The Canadian Revenue Agency adopted a Taxpayers Bill of Rights 43 in 2007 in conjunction with the creation of the Tax Ombudsman’s Office. In the United States in 2014 the IRS adopted a Taxpayer Bill of Rights as proposed by the NTA. 44 3. Reflecting the growing interest in these issues the Asia Oceania Tax Consultants’ Association, Confederation Fiscale Europeenne and Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners (STEP) jointly released a Model Taxpayer Charter in July 2015. The Model Tax Charter was drawn up after surveying members in 41 countries including New Zealand. 45 4. However, there are difficulties in developing a taxpayer Charter/Bill of Rights around the extent to which it is legally enforceable. The difficulties of legislating such a document was noted by the Australian Inspector General of Taxation (the IGT) in his 2016 review into the Australian Taxpayers’ Charter and taxpayer protections 46 . He consequently decided not to recommend a formal taxpayer bill of rights. 5. As part of his review the IGT examined taxpayer rights internationally. 47 With regard to the IR Charter he commented it “2.94 The Inland Revenue Charter is noticeably different to other jurisdictions, in that the Charter appears to be targeted at the IRD itself, not the taxpayer unlike those of Australia and the UK which are outward- facing community documents. 2.95 As a result of this difference in approach, the Inland Revenue’s Charter does not set out taxpayer obligations183 and generally does not 42 http://www.ird.govt.nz/aboutir/commitment/aboutir-charter.html reproduced in Appendix C 43 https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms- publications/publications/rc17/taxpayer-bill-rights-guide-understanding-your-rights-a- taxpayer.html#\_Ref191276364 44 https://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/about-tas/taxpayer-rights 45 Members of STEP New Zealand were surveyed 46 http://igt.gov.au/publications/annual-reports/2016-17-annual-report/overview/ 47 http://igt.gov.au/publications/reports-of-reviews/taxpayers-charter-and-taxpayer- protections-review/chapter-2-taxpayer-rights-in-australia-and-international-comparisons/ 14 use ‘rights’ terminology. Instead, it sets out its service commitments. However, the content of the commitments made within the Inland Revenue’s Charter are similar in substance to comparable taxpayer charters or documents in other jurisdictions some of which are discussed above.” 6. However, in the survey of ATAINZ/NZICB members only 39% of all respondents said they were aware of the Charter. Amongst ATAINZ members just over half acknowledged its existence. 7. IR’s Statement of Intent 2016-2020 48 makes no mention of the Charter nor of taxpayer rights, even though the document refers to “customer/customers”133 times. 8. If the New Zealand tax system is to be fully up to date with international best practice then IR will need to both promote taxpayer awareness of the Charter whilst also re-focussing it towards taxpayers. 48 http://www.ird.govt.nz/resources/4/5/4576ff3c-2e12-458a-abf1-e586e8596ce0/soi2016.pdf 15 APPENDIX A TAX AGENT AND BOOKKEEPER SURVEY QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES Survey asked of members of Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand (ATAINZ) and the Institute of Certified NZ Bookkeepers (ICNZB) 1. Do you support the idea of a separate tax ombudsman to handle IRD complaints? Yes 215 No 12 2. If yes, should the tax ombudsman be either: a. A separate unit within IRD; or b. Outside of IRD but a specialist part of the general Ombudsman’s office; or c. Separate of both the IRD and the Ombudsman 18 166 143 3. The United States has a Taxpayer Advocate which has many similar features to an Ombudsman. It also has a role advocating for low income taxpayers, including providing such taxpayers with a low-cost way of settling disputes with the IRS (the equivalent of Inland Revenue). Do you support the establishment of a tax advocate to provide support for taxpayers in disputes with IRD? Yes 197 No 27 4. If yes, what should be the threshold of tax at stake above which no support should be provided? a. $25,000 b. $50,000 c. $75,000 52 78 75 5. Do you think both a tax ombudsman AND a tax advocate are needed? Yes 140 No 75 6. Are you aware of Inland Revenue’s Charter? Yes 39 No 61 16 APPENDIX B CURRENT DISPUTE PROCESS 17 APPENDIX C INLAND REVENUE'S CHARTER (as of March 2009) Inland Revenue collects money to pay for public services.

Tax Working Group Information Release Release Document September 2018 taxworkingroup.govt.nz/key-documents This paper contains advice that has been prepared by the Tax Working Group Secretariat for consideration by the Tax Working Group. The advice represents the preliminary views of the Secretariat and does not necessarily represent the views of the Group or the Government. 1 Summary of submissions from individuals Summary prepared by the Secretariat for the Tax Working Group July 2018 Prepared by Inland Revenue and the Treasury 2 3 TABLE OF CONTENTS OVERVIEW 4 Key questions 5 Income Tax 10 Capital gains tax 14 GST 17 Business tax 20 Frameworks 22 Savings and retirement 25 Corrective taxes 27 Land, wealth, and property taxes 31 International tax 34 Charities and Māori Authorities 36 Tax administration 38 Other tax issues 40 4 OVERVIEW This paper provides a summary of submissions to the Tax Working Group that were provided by individuals (excluding academics). A separate paper has already been provided to the Group providing a summary of submissions from organisations and academics. The Working Group received 6,711 submissions. Members of the Group have access to the original submissions. Of the 6,711 submissions, 4,778 were submitted through the Tax Working Group website and 1,900 were through e-mail. Of the 1,900 e-mail submissions, 1,054 were made using a template provided by the Taxpayers’ Union. That template is included as Appendix A, and where one of their submission points is covered, that is identified with an asterisk (\*). The paper starts by setting out the results from the five polls that were included on the Tax Working Group website and showing the topics submitters raised most often on the website when asked whether New Zealand taxes the right things, and which issues mattered most to them. The paper then provides a relatively high-level summary of submissions – focusing on areas which were raised by a large number of submitters, and setting out the main themes from those submissions. The topics covered in this part of the paper correlate closely to the topic submitters on the website indicated mattered most to them, and so are set out in a similar order. The main issues raised by individual submitters were: • Capital gains tax; • Income tax; and • GST, in particular exceptions from GST. Due to the volume of submissions, a detailed analysis similar to that provided in the previous summary of submissions paper is not feasible. For most topics, this paper sets out how many times it was raised by submitters. This is not always the case, however (e.g. to avoid double counting, or where multiple topics have been grouped together). For some topics, the percentage of submitters in favour or opposed is expressed, although not all topics lend themselves to such percentages. This summary generally focuses on points raised in submissions that are within the scope of the Terms of Reference. However, some areas outside of scope have been included, in particular where there were a significant number of submissions on the matter. In the event of another large-scale public submissions exercise, the Secretariat will look to learn from this process, particularly in respect of the questions asked of submitters. 5 Key questions 6 KEY WEBSITE QUESTIONS The Tax Working Group Website included polls for submitters to provide their views on the direction of tax in New Zealand. The results of these polls indicate that: • The majority of submitters thought tax should remain in the background and collect revenue for core New Zealand services • Submitters were split on whether New Zealand was taxing the right things • A capital gains tax was the issue that mattered the most to submitters • The majority of submitters thought that major changes were needed to the tax system • Submitters were split on whether tax should make housing more affordable The responses to the polls are illustrated in the following graphs. 1116 346 120 443 230 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 Stay in the background and collect revenue for core New Zealand services Encourage New Zealanders to make better choices.

The main three topics raised were GST, income tax and capital gains tax. Within these topics the main issues raised were exemptions from GST, income tax reductions for the poor and increases for the rich and support or opposition to a capital gains tax. When asked what tax issues mattered most to submitters the main two issues raised were income tax and capital gains taxes. 326 321 288 173 168 147 101 93 70 58 45 39 35 35 0.0% 10.0% 20.0% 30.0% 40.0% 50.0% 60.0% 70.0% 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Are we taxing the right things?

Main topics raised 10 Income Tax 11 The areas that submitters raised the most often when talking about level of taxation were: • Income tax (approximately 1,400) • Progressivity of income tax (170) • Tax brackets (262) • Transaction taxes (294) • Secondary tax (223) • Inequality (341) • Tax free threshold (308) • Welfare system (including submissions that were out of scope) (281) • Wealth redistribution (245) Other topics raised in submissions included flat tax, work related expenditure, income splitting, low income, tax breaks, and double taxation. Income tax Support for repealing income tax • Revenue should come from other sources (businesses, land tax, capital gains tax, etc.) rather than wage-earners • Income tax is theft • Should tax wealth, not income Opposition to repealing income tax • Tax Working Group proposals should be revenue neutral\* • People who earn more should be taxed more Increase income tax (Submitters were more likely to discuss income tax increases than decreases) • High earners can afford to pay more tax so they should • This would reduce inequality Opposition to increasing income tax • Higher income tax results in unemployment • Higher income tax rates disincentivises hard work • Lower tax rates give people more choice as to how they spend their money • Tax Working Group proposals should be revenue neutral • Revenue should come from other sources (businesses, land tax, capital gains tax, etc.) rather than wage-earners Support for income tax exemptions • Members of the military (and reserves) and emergency services are serving our country so shouldn’t have to pay income tax 12 Opposition to income tax exemptions • Tax system should be as simple as possible • Everyone should pay tax; loopholes are unfair Progressivity of income tax Support for the progressivity of income tax • To reduce inequality • Taxing people on low incomes makes no sense • Income tax should be increased on the rich; they can afford to pay more • A new top tax bracket should be introduced (threshold could be anywhere from 80k to 200k; the rate 30% to 60%) • The middle class are under increasing pressure Opposition to the progressivity of income tax • A regressive or flat tax system would encourage people to work harder and upskill • Government should not target specific groups with additional taxes (i.e. ‘the rich’) • The rich create employment that benefits wider society Tax brackets • Tax brackets need to be increased to account for inflation; there has been ‘bracket creep’\* • Introduce an additional (top) tax bracket (e.g. a person earning $200,000 should be paying more than a person earning $70,000) Transaction taxes • Repeal all other taxes and implement a transaction tax • Introduce transaction taxes to prevent high earners and large companies from avoiding tax (i.e. all financial transactions which result in profit should be taxed) • GST is too regressive; replace it with a financial transaction tax instead • Would enable Inland Revenue to drastically reduce in size and save the government a lot of money in tax administration Secondary tax (Almost all submissions on secondary tax were opposed to it) • Secondary tax should be abolished • Secondary tax is particularly heavy hitting given its propensity to affect low income earners • Secondary tax should be abolished and one tax code used for all income Tax Free Threshold (Almost all submissions on a tax free threshold supported it) • People on lower incomes should be able to keep more of their money • More administratively efficient for lower income earners to pay no tax than for the Government to supplement their income with transfers 13 • Many other countries have tax free thresholds • Submitters suggested a tax free threshold to be anywhere from $2,000 to $70,000 (although most suggested somewhere between $10,000-25,000). Welfare system • The welfare system is needed to support the poorer members of society • The welfare system is needed to support people who are unable to work • People who are able to work but choose not to should not be supported by the welfare system Inequality • There is growing inequality in New Zealand society • The gap between the rich and the poor is growing because of tax policy that favours owners of capital and burdens lower income wage earners • The level of inequality in New Zealand is unacceptable and the tax system needs to incorporate measures to mitigate it Wealth redistribution (Approximately 93% of submissions on wealth redistribution supported it) • The tax system should redistribute wealth to mitigate the inequality between rich and poor (majority view) • Wealth redistribution should be the primary objective of the tax system • The purpose of the tax system is not to redistribute wealth – it should focus solely on raising the minimum revenue it needs to fund core services (minority view) 14 Capital gains tax 15 The areas that submitters raised the most often when talking about capital gains tax (approximately 1,700) were: • Capital gains tax (1773) • Family home exemption (257) Other topics raised in submissions included realisation basis versus accruals basis, speculation, and the brightline test. Capital gains tax? (Approximately 70% of submissions on a capital gains tax supported it) Support for a capital gains tax • All income should be taxed equally • A capital gains tax would help improve property ownership and prevent property speculation • The lack of a capital gains tax benefits the wealthy and contributes to wealth inequality. It is unfair that the wealthy avoid tax. • A capital gains tax will help the tax system be more progressive • The revenue from a capital gains tax could be used for tax cuts or useful government expenditure Opposition to a capital gains tax • A capital gains tax would not positively affect the housing market. A capital gains tax could instead negatively affect the housing market and increase rents. • Those who have earned capital gains have paid tax on earnings used to purchase the capital asset. It is unfair to tax them again on sale of the asset. • A capital gains tax is an envy tax and is a tax on those who have worked hard and saved. • A capital gains tax would have a negative impact on retirees and would punish those who have taken time to build a nest egg. • A capital gains tax would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investment.\* • A capital gains tax would discourage landlords from investing in rental property and many would leave the rental market, causing supply issues Family home exemption (Approximately 91% of submissions on a family home exemption supported it) Support for a family home exemption • Taxing people’s main homes is not a tax on speculators; it’s a tax on ordinary people trying to build their wealth for retirement etc. 16 Opposition to a family home exemption • A family home exemption will lead to distortions such as people upgrading their homes more and more, in order to get the highest possible untaxed capital gain when they sell it. • Family homes account for around 60% of all houses, so exempting gains from them means exempting the majority of the potential base 17 GST 18 The areas that submitters raised the most often when talking about goods and services tax (approximately 1200) were: • GST exemptions • Repealing GST • The rate of GST • General comments (56) • Goods purchased online (42) GST exemptions (Submitters who mentioned them were more likely to support GST exemptions, than not) Support for GST exemptions • For necessities (fresh fruit & vegetables, utilities, feminine hygiene products) • To encourage healthy eating • To reduce poverty • To support NZ businesses • Should tax ‘bads’ not ‘goods’ Opposition to GST exemptions • Exempting certain goods from GST introduces unnecessary administrative complexity, and is a poorly targeted way of helping the poor • Better to use transfer system instead of introducing GST exemptions • Countries that have GST exemptions have ongoing problems with disputes over where the line is drawn between exempt and taxable items • The strength of the GST system is its comprehensiveness and unavoidability Repeal GST • It is regressive • It causes poverty, inequality The rate of GST Decrease GST rate • Would take pressure off people given cost of living • Would help low income people • In order to reduce total tax take Increase GST rate • GST is an effective way of raising revenue and should therefore be increased (with reductions in income tax to compensate) 19 General comments • Consumption most accurately reflects ability to pay, and is therefore the best framework for a tax system • The tax system should focus on consumption taxes rather than income or wealth taxes Goods purchased online • GST should be levied on goods purchased online so that local retailers can compete with large overseas retailers • Applying GST to goods purchased online would raise more revenue for the Government 20 Business tax 21 The areas that submitters raised the most often when talking about business tax were: • Business/company tax (687) • Provisional tax Other topics raised in submissions included small businesses. Business/company tax Increase company tax • Companies should be paying more tax • The company tax rate should be aligned with the top individual rate • Companies pay less tax compared to individuals Decrease company tax\* • High company tax rate means weak incentive to do business • Businesses are competing internationally • Government spending wastefully • Businesses provide employment • Company tax is a disincentive • People have worked hard • Current rate is relatively high • Compliance is a hassle Progressive company tax rate • Would result in more employment, more revenue from other sources • Helps small businesses get started • Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) struggle with cash flow • Could be used to reward / incentivise businesses which: o are based in New Zealand o are sustainable o create employment o do not pay their senior employees excessively Provisional tax • Provisional tax is complex, too hard to estimate and should be abolished. • 5% uplift is unrealistic and too high. • Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) struggle with cash flow • People have to borrow to pay provisional tax • The (recently introduced) Accounting Income Method (AIM) is too complicated, and there will be limited uptake. • Inland Revenue does not pay interest (or equivalent) if there has been an overpayment 22 Frameworks 23 The areas that submitters raised the most often when talking about frameworks were: • Fairness, equity and balance • Incentives/disincentives (372) • Government spending (265) • Core services and infrastructure (354) • Accountability • Transparency Other topics raised in submissions included productive versus speculative economy. Fairness, equity and balance • The tax system needs to be fair and equitable for everyone • The balance of the current tax system is wrong • The current system disproportionately burdens the poor, and favours owners of capital • The current system does not treat all types of income equally Incentives/disincentives • The tax system is a powerful tool for incentivising or disincentivising behaviour • Because the tax rules create incentives, it is important to create the right ones • The current tax and transfer system disincentivises employment due to abatement rules Government spending (Most submitters who mentioned Government spending were opposed to it) • Government administration creates deadweight costs • Government can’t competently manage the funds it presently collects • Government should live ‘within its means’ • Tax revenue goes to undeserving welfare recipients • Government provides necessary services such as health and education Core services & infrastructure • The purpose of tax is to enable the government to provide core services that society needs to function • Tax revenue should support the funding of infrastructure • Tax should only be used to fund core services and infrastructure • Tax should be used both for core services & infrastructure, and encouraging/discouraging behaviour Accountability • The Government must be more accountable for the way it spends taxpayer money (spending should target core services and infrastructure, stop wasting money on overpriced consultants and wasteful public sector spending) • Members of Parliament need to be more accountable to taxpayers (reduce perks). 24 • Everyone should be accountable and pay their fair share of tax (multinationals, large corporates and charities) • Large corporates should be accountable for pollution and penalised accordingly. Transparency • Making all taxpayers’ tax records public would incentivise compliance and make tax avoidance more visible. • The Government should be more transparent on how taxpayer money is spent. This would increase public confidence in the tax system. • The tax system should be fair and transparent (remove loopholes that allow people to not pay their fair share of tax). • There is a lack of transparency internationally – multinationals are not paying their fair share of tax. This is a global problem that New Zealand can contribute to. 25 Savings and retirement 26 The areas that submitters raised the most often when talking about savings and retirement were: • Funding retirement (337) / superannuation (167) • KiwiSaver (109) Most people who submitted about savings wanted the Government to change the rules to encourage more private savings by individuals. Other topics raised in submissions included support for the idea that interest income should be inflation indexed. Funding retirement / superannuation • People should be encouraged to save for their retirement, in order to be less reliant on the state • An “EET” system would encourage retirement saving more than the current “TTE” system • Superannuation should be kept as a safety net, with people saving as much for their retirement as possible • Superannuation should be abated according to income, and/or number of years spent in New Zealand paying tax • Taxpayers should be able to deduct inflation from income earned from long term savings\* KiwiSaver • Exclude KiwiSaver from a capital gains tax • Provide more incentives for saving (to help people get ahead / prepare for retirement) • Allow KiwiSaver to be used to buy first home (home ownership important) • Increase employer contributions to 5% • Make KiwiSaver or other retirement savings scheme compulsory 27 Corrective taxes 28 The areas that submitters raised the most often when talking about corrective taxes were: • Behavioural taxes (524) • Pigouvian tax (158) • Health (269) • Environment (437) • Pollution tax (189) • Water tax (89) • Tobacco tax • Hypothecation (66) Submitters who mentioned corrective taxes tended to support them. Other topics raised in submissions included “user pays”. Behavioural taxes (Approximately 84% of submissions on behavioural taxes supported them) Support for behavioural taxes • Help people to make good choices • Tax should tax things that are bad for society / that we want to discourage • Education alone is not effective Opposition to behavioural taxes • Public education is preferable • Government interfering too much / should respect people’s choices • Tax should stay in the background • Behavioural taxes would harm poor people more/are regressive\* Pigouvian taxes (Almost all submissions on Pigouvian taxes supported it) • The full costs of business activities should be internalised, instead of being left as externalities that the public and the environment pays for Health • Taxes should be used to encourage people to make healthy choices • The healthier people are, the less strain there is on the healthcare system and tax revenue in general • Decreasing GST on healthy foods and increasing it on unhealthy foods will encourage healthier eating 29 Environment Support for environment tax • The current negative state of the environment • Companies profiting from environmental degradation • ‘Polluter pays’ principle Opposition to environment tax • The Government should not interfere too much. Pollution tax (Approximately 96% of submissions on pollution tax supported it) Support for pollution tax • There should be heftier pollution taxes to discourage people from polluting and help the environment (vast majority view) • There should be carbon taxes • There should be taxes on waste disposal, both landfill and recycling Opposition to pollution tax • The government should leave people alone when it comes to pollution; no evidence tax will help environment, or that environment needs to be helped • Not good for poor people Water tax (Approximately 96% of submissions on water tax supported it) Support for water tax • The current negative state of waterways • Water bottling wrong / bad in the long term • Farmers profiting from water pollution / irrigation Opposition to water tax • Water should be free • Bottled water should be cheap Tobacco Taxes Support for tobacco tax • Tobacco taxes work to reduce consumption • Help people to make healthy choices / better lives 30 Opposition to tobacco tax • Smoking is a personal choice and the Government should not interfere Hypothecation (Approximately 91% of submissions on hypothecation supported it) Support for hypothecation • Hypothecated taxes are an effective way to support key initiatives. Common examples included using a sugar and unhealthy food tax to fund removing GST from fruit/vegetables, or taxing corporate polluters/tourists and using the money for environmental initiatives. • Others approached the issue from a more general view of hypothecation and simply felt that tax should be levied (although nothing specific was suggested) to support areas like retirement, home ownership and a more extensive education/health care system • Implement a luxury tax on large ticket discretionary spending (e.g. luxury cars or boats) Opposition to hypothecation • Hypothecated taxes do not accord with a broad base, low rate (BBLR) framework • Hypothecated tax would have a distortionary effect on people’s behaviour • Tax should be for key infrastructure only and should not be used to influence behaviour in any other way. All other key services can be privatised for efficiency • Some mentioned unfairness (for example “ring fencing” rental losses but not business losses) 31 Land, wealth, and property taxes 32 The areas that submitters raised the most often when talking about land, wealth and property taxes were: • Housing affordability (973) / supply and demand (173) • Land tax • Wealth taxes (409) • Property taxes (158) • Estate duty (123) Housing affordability / supply and demand • The tax system should promote better housing affordability • The tax system cannot make housing more affordable • A capital gains tax would make housing more affordable by stopping speculators from driving up house prices • Housing will only be made more affordable by an increase in supply • A capital gains tax would not improve housing affordability, because the issue is one of supply and demand: o Examples of demand side drivers: uneven regional development, immigration, overseas buyers o Examples of supply side drivers: the Government needs to build more affordable houses Land tax Support for a land tax • A land tax does not create any economic distortions, because the supply of land is fixed • A land tax recognises the wealth tied up in land ownership • Would incentivise more productive use of land • Would regulate property prices Opposition to a land tax • A land tax is unfair on people who are asset rich but income light and may not have the ability to pay the tax easily • Land is often a personal and ancestral thing, and it is unfair to encroach on the benefits of that • Land tax is already being paid through local rates that are levied on the property value, which includes the value of the land Wealth taxes (Approximately 85% of submissions on a wealth tax supported it) Support for a wealth tax • A wealth tax is needed to redistribute some of the wealth rich people have that is capital and not income 33 • It is unfair that the rich can have millions of dollars in wealth and not be taxed on any of it Opposition to a wealth tax • Wealth taxes are unfair as they burden people who are asset rich but income poor, and may struggle to pay it • Wealth taxes are an envy tax that punishes people for working hard and saving responsibly to support themselves and not rely on the state Property taxes (Approximately 84% of submissions on property tax supported it) • Property taxes are needed to balance out the favouring of capital over other forms of income • Property is taxed enough already through local government rates Estate duty (Approximately 69% of submissions on estate tax supported it) Support for estate tax • Inheritances should be taxed to stop intergenerational wealth banking that widens inequality Opposition to estate tax • It is unfair to tax the wealth that people have worked to save and pass onto their children • It is unfair to levy a tax on wealth when the person receiving it had no say over receiving it 34 International tax 35 The areas that submitters raised the most often when talking about international tax were: • Taxing multinational companies (422) • Base erosion and profit shifting (174) Other topics raised in submissions included Fair Dividend Rate (FDR), and the Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) regime. Taxing multinational companies (Almost all submissions on international tax supported the idea of multinationals paying more tax in New Zealand) • Multinationals need to pay their fair share of tax • Tax New Zealand businesses/companies less so they can compete with multinationals operating in New Zealand • Offshore suppliers to New Zealand consumers should pay GST, not fair on New Zealand companies Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) • Multinationals and large corporates are not paying their fair share of tax. Close the loopholes that allow this • Implement larger penalties for all multinationals who avoid paying tax in New Zealand Fair dividend rate / Foreign Investment Fund regime • Fair Dividend Rate (FDR) discourages investment in foreign equities, which would benefit the New Zealand economy as a whole • The Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) regime encourages bad investment behaviour as it forces people to sell assets to pay tax 36 Charities and Māori Authorities 37 The areas that submitters raised the most often when talking about charities and Māori authorities were: • Taxing charities and religious organisations (289) • Māori authorities Taxing charities and religious organisations • Charities should be taxed on the business component of their income; it is not fair that a charity’s business income is exempt from income tax while other businesses have to pay tax on their business income (majority view) • Charities should be taxed on all their income • Businesses operated by charities should only be allowed deductions for profits distributed to the charity\* • Religious organisations should not be considered charities; furthering religion is not a charitable activity Māori Authorities • The Māori Authority Regime is unfair, as the lower tax rate favours Māori businesses over others\* • The tax system should not tax people differently based on demographic factors • The Māori Authority Regime is racist 38 Tax administration 39 The areas that submitters raised the most often when talking about tax administration were: • Avoidance and evasion; loopholes (484) • Ease of administration (49) Other topics raised in submissions included administration costs, compliance costs, future opportunities for tax administration, automaticity, and design issues. Avoidance and evasion; Loopholes • Multinationals and large corporates are avoiding tax and the law must be amended to prevent this from happening • There are too many loopholes in the law that allow rich people to avoid tax (e.g. family trusts, and using imaginative structures dreamt up by lawyers and accountants) • Lack of a capital gains tax allows people to generate wealth and avoid paying tax • Middle class is overtaxed (tax withheld at source, and regressive nature of GST) whereas the law is too generous to self-employed/companies (who have ways to under declare income or too many deductions) • If tax rates were reduced tax then people would not feel the need to try avoid or evade. • Companies operated by charities should be made to pay tax • Tradesmen avoiding tax by offering ‘cash jobs’ needs to be addressed Ease of administration • Retain a broad base, low rate (BBLR) system with as few exemptions and incentives as possible • A capital gains tax does not fit in a BBLR framework and would be too hard to administer • GST concessions make the tax system too complicated • Abolish secondary tax (unfair) • It is inefficient to tax people and then give them the money back through social policy entitlements. Should look at adjusting tax rates accordingly Automaticity • All taxes should be as automatic and as unavoidable as PAYE • Those subject to a withholding tax regime end up paying more tax. This is unfair and we must find a way to automate all taxes • Make tax simpler and automated so we don’t have to pay lawyers and accountants • Automation of tax can be supported by having banks withhold tax from all ‘payments’ • Scrap tax on income and tax on wealth and productivity. A model like this can be more easily automated. 40 Other tax issues 41 Non-residents • Ban the sale of property to foreigners (especially residential property) or alternatively, tax them. Need to make housing more affordable for New Zealanders • Tax foreign companies with no base in New Zealand at a higher rate than New Zealand companies Māori • The tax system should support Māori (employment, business etc.) • The tax system should incorporate Māori values (tikanga Māori, and keep with the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi • The tax system should not favour Māori over any other group – should be treated the same as anyone else Transport (107) • Tax system should encourage use of public transport by making it cheaper (through hypothecated taxes raised by taxing road users, polluters and congestion) • Tax system should encourage uptake of electric vehicles Tourism levy (136) • A tourism levy should be introduced to help support maintenance of New Zealand tourism infrastructure, national parks etc. • Should be a universal flat rate levied on every tourist entering the country • Have a duration-of-stay below which the tax is levied (e.g. 30 days); possibly exempt business people Future opportunities for tax administration • With increased automation, more people will lose their employment and a universal basic income should be introduced to address that scenario • Concern about the impact artificial intelligence would have on taxation and the preservation of jobs • We should tax robots to make up for the revenue lost from the non-employment of people • How do we ensure tax compliance with the growth of cryptocurrencies and systems where wealth can be exchanged anonymously? • Using technology to make tax compliance simpler for individuals 42 Appendix A – New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union submission template Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, This is a submission on the future of tax in New Zealand, with particular reference to the proposals and questions set out in the Working Group’s Background Paper. Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld. Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low-productivity economy. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working Group recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). 43 Maori Authorities and charities New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. 44 Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union.

Coversheet: The excluded home Position Paper for Session 19 of the Tax Working Group 28 September 2018 Purpose of discussion The purpose of this paper is to provide the Group with further information and analysis to assist with the Group’s decisions regarding the design of an exclusion for the family home (referred to as the “excluded home”) from any proposed extension to the taxation of capital income. It also proposes draft text for inclusion in the Final Report (Appendix A). Key points for discussion This paper: a. Provides further comments on the interim decisions the Group has already made regarding the definition of an “excluded home”. In this respect, Officials are looking to obtain more clarity on some of the aspects of the Group’s definition, and how various aspects will work together. b. Discusses options for dealing with properties that are the main residence for the owner and their family, but are also used for other purposes (for example, home offices, Airbnb, and sharing a main residence with a flat-mate). c. Discusses options for taxing properties that move in and out of the “excluded home” definition, both temporarily, and once and for all (for example, where a person who used a property as their main home moves out of it). Recommended actions We recommend that you: a. agree on those further issues raised by Officials regarding clarification of the definition of the “excluded home”. Officials recommend that: • The Group consider whether the “excluded home” exclusion would apply to Māori freehold land. • The “centre of vital interests” test be replaced with a “permanent place of abode” test, with an election where a person has two “permanent places of abode”. Noting that this is not supported by the Independent Advisor who prefers an ‘ordinarily resident’ test. • The reference to a “person and their family” be change to a reference to a “person, or a person and any member of their family living with them”. • The “excluded home” exclusion should be able to apply to two homes during the period where one house is being acquired or constructed, and another is being held for sale. b. agree to a method for dealing with properties that are partially used for other purposes. Officials recommend that a “mainly” test be adopted, with some minor exceptions. Noting that this is not supported by the Independent Advisor who prefers an explicit de minimis. c. agree to a method for dealing with properties that move in and out of the “excluded home” definition. Officials recommend that a straight line apportionment method be adopted in all situations where there is a change of use. d. agree to Appendix A being used as the basis for draft text for the Final Report.

Introduction 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide the Group with further information and analysis to assist with the Group’s decisions regarding the design of an exclusion for the family home (referred to as the “excluded home”) from any proposed extension to the taxation of capital income. This paper has been prepared by the Secretariat. However, the Independent Advisor has contributed text to it on an “on exceptions” basis, where she disagrees with the Secretariat view. It also contains some comments from the Independent Advisor. 1.2 Content and scope This paper will focus on three main areas: • Further comments on the interim decisions the Group has already made regarding the definition of an “excluded home”. • Options for dealing with properties that are the main residence for the owner and their family, but are also used for other purposes (for example, home offices, Airbnb, and sharing a main residence with a flat-mate). • Options for taxing properties that move in and out of the “excluded home” definition, both temporarily, and once and for all (for example, where a person who used a property as their main home moves out of it). Treasury:3896338v1 7 2. Problem definition and objectives 2.1 Context The Group has been asked to consider the design of a potential extension of the taxation of capital income. However, the Group has been instructed that any proposal must exclude the family home and the land under it. 2.2 Policy problem or opportunity In Appendix B to the Interim Report, the Group set out their preliminary conclusions with regard to the definition of an “excluded home”. In summary, the Group’s interim decision is that the “excluded home” would have the following features: • The property has been occupied mainly as a residence by the person and their family as their family home or “centre of vital interests”. • The property is used as the family home up to the time of sale (however, some allowance can be made for a period of up to 12 months where the home is empty while it is held for sale). • At any one time, the exclusion would only apply to one property owned by a person. • The exclusion would only apply to people who are tax resident in New Zealand (taking into account the application of double tax agreements). • The exclusion would apply to a property owned by a trust if the person living in the property is the settlor of the trust, or a beneficiary who is irrevocably entitled to the property. • The exclusion would apply to shares in a flat owning company, provided the person or persons who own the shares occupies the property as their family home. • The exclusion would apply to a property owned by an ordinary company or look through company, provided the person or persons who own the shares occupies the property as their family home. • The exclusion would still apply where the person temporarily lives in another place for up to four years. • The exclusion would apply to land of an area up to the greater of 4,500m 2 , or the amount required for the reasonable occupation and enjoyment of the house. • Consideration also needs to be given as to whether there should be a cap of $5 million in value. This paper builds on the work the Group has already done in defining the “excluded home” in Appendix B to the Interim Report. This paper further discusses how the Treasury:3896338v1 8 “excluded home” should be defined, and options for dealing with situations where the property is concurrently used for other purposes (referred to in this paper as partial use), or where there is a complete change of use of the property. We note that the partial use and change of use principles discussed in this paper will also apply to other types of property where the use changes from private to income earning or vice versa. Treasury:3896338v1 9 3. Policy considerations In determining which option is to be preferred, it is helpful to take into account various policy considerations. These considerations can then be weighed and decisions can be made about which are more important in this context. Officials have identified the following factors that appear to be relevant for the design of the “excluded home” exclusion: • Terms of reference – The Group has been instructed that an extension of the taxation of capital income should not include the family home and the land under it. • Simplicity – Simple rules are easier for taxpayers to understand and apply. However, simplicity can lead to a lack of accuracy. • Accuracy – Rules that require detailed calculations of actual use of a property give rise to a more accurate tax outcome. However, such rules are often complex and time consuming for taxpayers to apply. • Certainty – Rules that involve objective tests that are obvious to apply and provide more certainty for taxpayers than subjective tests that can lead to different views as to the outcome. Where there can be differing views, this can lead to disputes between taxpayers and Inland Revenue. • Ability to pay – The ability of a taxpayer to pay a tax liability should be taken into account when determining when that liability should arise. • Level of compliance costs – The level of costs that taxpayers will be required to incur in order to comply with the rules is also a relevant consideration. It is also helpful to take account of the rules that apply in other countries when determining appropriate rules for New Zealand, because they have dealt with the same issues before. On this basis, this paper includes brief summaries of the rules that apply in some other countries for comparison purposes. Ultimately, Officials consider that the appropriate policy setting for the design of an “excluded home” exclusion is to design rules that are simple to apply for average taxpayers, which will keep compliance costs low, and which will provide certainty. In particular, Officials would prefer to err on the side of a more liberal definition of the “excluded home” and exclude too much, than on a less liberal definition that may exclude too little. It is also important to bear in mind that in the vast majority of cases, the “excluded home” will be easy to identify, and this paper therefore focuses on more marginal situations. Treasury:3896338v1 10 4.0 Definition of the excluded home 4.1 Group’s decisions to date As discussed above, the Group has made a number of interim decisions regarding the features of the “excluded home” exclusion in Appendix B to the Interim Report. This paper discusses some of those features in more detail, in order to test how they will work in practise, and outlines some other options or issues that Officials have identified. Officials also raise the issue of how the rules should apply to Māori freehold land. 4.2 Rules for Māori freehold land Officials recommend that the Group give some consideration as to whether the “excluded home” exclusion should also apply to Māori freehold land. As stated above, the terms of reference require that the family home and the land underneath it not be subject to any extension on the taxation of capital income. Officials note that there is no explanation for this exclusion. However, the Independent Advisor in her paper Maori assets and capital income noted that, while a gain on a family home (whether realised or not) does increase a person’s wealth, generally speaking it does not increase the person’s consumption potential as it simply represents a place to live and connect with their family. That is it is their turangawaewae. The family home in the Pākehā sense of the term is the house that is the centre of family connections for the individuals who live there. While the nuclear family (i.e., parents and young dependent children) is the most common representation of family in New Zealand, even for Pākehā family is increasingly taking on broader connotations involving blended families (for example, grandparents raising grandchildren, and significant delay for adult children leaving to set up their own households). For Māori the concept of home is even broader. This was discussed in a recent report on Māori housing: 1 The Productivity Commission and other researchers over this time have found that home for Māori starts with the ancestral home-place: important to Māori cultural identity. Home-place links are reinforced by physical associations with land, whakapapa, proximity to extended family, experience of te reo, and the importance of the marae. Home is about whānau, whenua and whakapapa. \[Emphasis added\] 1 http://www.buildingbetter.nz/publications/SRA5/Maori\_and\_indigenous\_housing\_annotated\_biblogra phy.pdf Treasury:3896338v1 11 On this basis, Officials note that it is worth considering whether Māori freehold land is sufficiently analogous to the concept of a family home for it also to be exempted under the concept of “excluded home”. Officials note that the comparison between Māori freehold land and the family home concept is not strictly “like for like”. For example, the argument that Māori freehold land is a family home would be more difficult to support for those connected to the land but not living there on a day-to-day basis. There appears to be a stronger argument that there is an analogy between the two concepts that might justify a similar exclusion. On this basis, Officials will continue considering the inter-relationship between Māori freehold land and the excluded home concept. Our views on this subject will be provided, following consultation, as part of the future Secretariat paper on the Māori asset base. 4.3 More than one residence – “centre of vital interests” test Where a person owns two or more properties that they use as residences, the Group has suggested the use of a “centre of vital interests” test for determining which residence will be their “excluded home”. The “centre of vital interests” test is the test imposed under many double tax agreements (DTAs) internationally, to determine the tax residency of a person, for DTA purposes, where they are residents in two different countries under domestic law. It requires consideration of where a person’s personal and economic relations are closer. The OECD commentary on article 4 of the OECD Model Convention (which determines a person’s tax residency for DTA purposes) indicates that the following types of factors may be taken into account in applying the “centre of vital interests” test (at \[15\]): ... regard will be had to his family and social relations, his occupations, his political, cultural or other activities, his place of business, the place from which he administers his property, etc. The circumstances must be examined as a whole, but it is nevertheless obvious that considerations based on the personal acts of the individual must receive special attention. If a person who has a home in one State sets up a second in the other State while retaining the first, the fact that he retains the first in the environment where he has always lived, where he has worked, and where he has his family and possessions, can, together with other elements, go to demonstrate that he has retained his centre of vital interests in the first State. As can be seen from the commentary, the “centre of vital interests” test measures a person’s ties to a general locality, rather than to a particular home. It refers to the fact that someone can retain their “centre of vital interests” in one place, despite living in another. It also refers to broader personal connections to an area, such as extended family ties, political and social ties, and cultural and other activities. On that basis, Officials suggest that this may not be the best test to use to determine which home should be a person’s “excluded home”. Alternative option – Permanent place of abode An alternative to applying the “centre of vital interests” test is to apply a test similar to the New Zealand “permanent place of abode” test. This test is contained in s YD Treasury:3896338v1 12 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and is used to determine whether a person is resident in New Zealand for domestic tax law purposes. The “permanent place of abode” test measures a person’s connection with a particular home. The term “permanent place of abode” is not defined in the Income Tax Act 2007. It has been described by the Court of Appeal as meaning a place where a person habitually resides from time to time even if they spend periods of time overseas. 2 This test has been considered on multiple occasions by the New Zealand courts, and various factors have been formulated for determining whether a person has a “permanent place of abode”. Relevant to the “excluded home” exclusion, the courts have suggested that it is necessary to consider the durability of the person’s association with the place of abode and how close their connection with it is. The cases establish that some of the material factors to be considered when assessing whether a person has a durable association with a place of abode, such that it can be regarded as their permanent place of abode, are: • the nature and use of the dwelling and the person’s connection with the dwelling; • the person’s intentions; • the person’s family and social ties; • the person’s employment, business interests and economic ties; • the person’s personal property; and • any other factors that shed light on whether the place of abode is a permanent place of abode for the person. These factors are relevant to the extent they indicate whether the person habitually resides in a particular dwelling. The same factors are considered to determine which house is a person’s main home, for the purposes of the bright-line main home exclusion, if they have more than one home. A benefit of using a test based on the “permanent place of abode” test for determining whether a house is a person’s “excluded home”, is that this test is already used in New Zealand tax law, and has already been considered by the courts. The Commissioner has also produced a comprehensive statement discussing how this test works (IS 16/03 “Tax Residence”). The only problem with applying a “permanent place of abode” test is that it is not designed to identify a single property. Instead, it could identify that a person has more than one “permanent place of abode” in New Zealand (the tax residence rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 acknowledge that someone may have more than one permanent place of abode; they focus on whether the person has one in New Zealand). 2 CIR v Diamond \[2015\] NZCA 613. Treasury:3896338v1 13 The Independent Advisor does not support the use of the term permanent place of abode as part of the determination of excluded home. This is because the current concept of permanent place of abode focuses on whether or not an individual is tax resident in New Zealand and therefore liable to tax on foreign income in New Zealand. Consequently the case law considers situations where individuals are not residing in New Zealand. This is shown by the most recent case which interprets permanent place of abode as when an individual: habitually resides from time to time even if they spend periods of time overseas. In the Independent Advisor’s view, for an excluded home definition, as in comparable countries the focus should simply be on the place an individual ‘habitually’ or ordinarily resides when living in New Zealand. She acknowledges that the approaches taken by other countries also have definitional issues but New Zealand could rely on their case law which is directly relevant to the policy concern. Officials recommend consideration of two alternative approaches: • A permanent place of abode test, altered to identify one main property. • A permanent place of abode test, with an election option where a person has two permanent places of abode. The first alternative is to alter the “permanent place of abode” test in this context to identify one property. Thought would have to be given to how this would be done. However, it is likely that this would involve a further balancing of factors. Officials note, however, that the use of any test that requires various subjective factors to be weighed will result in uncertainty for some taxpayers, and is likely to lead to disputes. An alternative is to allow a person who owns two properties that satisfy the “permanent place of abode” test to elect which one is their “excluded home”. A person would still only be able to have one “excluded home” at any one point in time. There appear to be two options for the timing of an election: • An election could be made at the time of sale of the first residence, as part of the tax statement that is already required to be completed as part of every land sale, reporting the years of ownership when the person has elected that the property was to be their “excluded home”. • Alternatively, an election could be required when a person acquires a property, again as part of the tax statement that is already required to be completed as part of every land sale, with further elections each time the property changes use. The benefit of an election approach is that it provides certainty for taxpayers. If the elections can be made through the tax statements that are already required as part Treasury:3896338v1 14 of every land sale, this will also require relatively little compliance, compared with the need to obtain complex tax advice where the application of the exclusion is based on subjective factors. However, there is a risk with this option that a person will always choose their more expensive home at any time. Examples The following example illustrates how these options would apply: Example – Multiple homes Jamie and Cam are married and own a small home in Auckland. Both of them often travel to Hamilton for work so decide to buy a second home in Hamilton. At first, they split their time relatively evenly between the two homes. As Jamie’s business expands, she finds herself spending more time in Hamilton than in Auckland, though Cam still splits his time evenly between the two. If taxpayers are allowed to elect an excluded home, Jamie and Cam may elect their Auckland home for their entire period of ownership simply because it has increased in value more over that time, even if they spend more time in Hamilton in later years. If the permanent place of abode test is used, there is uncertainty over which home should be their “excluded home” in each year. There will also be substantial audit difficulties. Officials’ recommendation Officials recommend the adoption of an election option for situations where a person has two residences. Such an option is simple, and relatively easy to apply, and provides certainty for taxpayers, which means it is less likely to lead to disputes between taxpayers and Inland Revenue. Such a rule also appears to be consistent with the rules applied in other countries. Officials recommend that the election is made retrospectively at the time that the property is sold, as this involves the least compliance for taxpayers. 4.4 “Person and their family” The Group has suggested that an “excluded home” should be a property occupied mainly as a residence by the “person and their family”. Officials note that a person could be living alone, without any other family members, in a property, which would still be their main home. Therefore, Officials recommend that this be re- worded to refer to the residence of “a person, or a person and any member of their family living with them”. This is the wording used in other residential exclusions from the land sale rules (for example, s CB 16). 4.5 One excluded home – Family units The Group has suggested that a person and their family (a “family unit”) can only have one “excluded home” at any time. However, the Group has also suggested that, where two people who are married, or in a civil union or a de facto relationship, are genuinely living apart, they can each have an “excluded home”. Treasury:3896338v1 15 In order to clarify how these two principles will work together, Officials recommend that further consideration be given to how a “family unit” is defined, in order to determine when people that may be considered part of the same “family unit” could live apart. Officials recommend that a “family unit” be defined as a person and the following persons (if any): • their spouse, civil union, partner or de facto partner, unless: o they are legally separated; or o they usually live in separate homes, that are owned individually by each of them; and • their children under the age of 18 years; and • any other member of their extended family who is living with them. Officials recommend that a “family unit” can only have one “excluded home” at any one time. If a “family unit” has more than one residence that could be an “excluded home” at any one time, an election must be made to determine which of those residences will be the “family unit’s” “excluded home”. These recommended rules are consistent with the rules that apply in other countries. Examples The following examples illustrate how the above rules recommended by Officials would operate. Example 1 – One “family unit” Karen and her husband own a house in Wellington where they live with their two small children (ages 4 and 7). Karen and her husband also own an apartment in Auckland where Karen stays two to three days a week when she is working in Auckland. The family also spend approximately six weeks per year (during school holidays) living in the Auckland apartment as a family. Karen, her husband and their children are one “family unit”. Therefore, they are only entitled to have one “excluded home”. They will need to elect which property will be their “excluded home”. Example 2 – Couple has separated John and Trudy have been married for 10 years. During that time they lived together in a home they jointly own. Their relationship breaks down and they decide to separate. John remains in the home they shared, and Trudy purchases a new home. After their separation, John and Trudy can each have a separate “excluded home”. Example 3 – Separate homes Natalie and Sarah are married. However, they each own separate homes, and do not usually live together. Their personal property is kept separately in their respective separate homes. Natalie and Sarah can each have a separate “excluded home”. Treasury:3896338v1 16 Example 4 – Extended family Helen and Murray are married. They own a home that they occupy as their residence. Helen’s mother, Joan, also owns a home that she has occupied for many years. However, due to Joan’s ill health, it is decided that Joan will move in with Helen and Murray, and that Joan’s house will be rented out. After Joan moves in with Helen and Murray, the “family unit” will only be entitled to one “excluded home”. Joan will not be able to claim the “excluded home” exclusion on her home for the period that she is living with Helen and Murray. 4.6 One excluded home – Period of sale and purchase/construction As discussed, the Group has recommended that a person can only have one excluded home. However, the Group has suggested that some allowance would be made for a period of up to 12 months where the home is empty while it is held for sale (i.e., a person would be allowed two “excluded homes” during this period). Officials agree with this proposal. It aligns with the principle that the rules for the “excluded home” exclusion should be simple and clear. However, Officials recommend that more consideration is given to the period of overlap that would be appropriate. Officials also recommend that this rule be limited to situations where the property is left vacant while it is being held for sale (i.e., it would not apply if a person rented the property out while it was being held for sale). Officials also recommend that similar rules be considered for times when a person owns one property that is their “excluded home”, and has purchased another property that consists of vacant land where they are building a new home. This would also be consistent with a more liberal definition of the “excluded home”. However, once again, Officials recommend that more consideration be given to the period of overlap that will be allowed. In particular, Officials would want to limit the period so as to not allow land banking to occur. Examples The following examples illustrate how the above rules would operate. Example 1 – Sale and purchase Kate and Will own a property that they have occupied as their “excluded home”. They decide to move to another area. They find a new home, purchase it, and move into it. However, it takes three months to sell their old home. While it is on the market, the old home is left vacant. Kate and Will will be entitled to claim the “excluded home” exclusion for both homes for the three months that they own both. Example 2 – Building a new home Burt and Ernie have a home in central Wellington. They decide to purchase a vacant section in the outer suburbs and build a new home for themselves. It takes two years from the date of purchase of the vacant section for the new home to be built. During that time Burt and Treasury:3896338v1 17 Ernie continue to live in their central Wellington home. Once the new home is completed, Burt and Ernie sell their central Wellington home and move into their new home. Burt and Ernie will be entitled to claim the “excluded home” exclusion for both properties for the two years that they owed them both. Example 3 – Land banking Jason and Kim have a family home that they have occupied for a number of years. They decide to purchase some vacant land, with the intention of building a new home for themselves. They hold the land for three years before they start to develop plans. Once they start to develop plans, it takes a further three years to complete the home. Once the new home is completed, Jason and Kim sell their old home and move into their new one. Officials consider that six years is too long for the “excluded home” exclusion to apply to both properties. Such a rule may encourage people to hold vacant land. Therefore, Officials do not recommend that both properties can qualify for the “excluded home” exclusion for the whole six-year period. 4.7 Property is occupied “mainly” as a residence The Group has suggested that the excluded home should be a property that has been occupied “mainly” as a residence by the person and their family. Officials have considered the application of this test as an option for dealing with partial income earning use of a residential property at chapter 5 below. Officials recommend that the Group further consider whether the “mainly” test is the best test in the context of that discussion. 4.8 Periods of absence The Group has suggested that a property must be used as a residence up to the time of sale, but has suggested some flexibility for temporary absence (up to 4 years). Officials recommend that this issue be considered further in the context of the change of use rules discussed further in this paper. 4.9 What do other countries do? For comparison purposes, Officials set out below a summary of how some other countries define their version of an “excluded home”. Australia In Australia, there is an exemption for a person’s “main residence”. This term is not defined in the relevant legislation. Whether a property is a “main residence” is a question of fact. The following factors may be relevant in determining whether a property is a person’s “main residence”: • the length of time the person lived there; • whether the person’s family lives there; Treasury:3896338v1 18 • whether the person’s personal belongings are kept there; • the address to which the person’s mail is delivered; • the person’s address on the electoral roll; • whether the property has services such as telephone, gas and power connected; • the person’s intentions in occupying the property. A person is usually only allowed one “main residence”. However, if a person acquires a new home before selling their old one, they can treat both homes as their “main residence” for up to six months, provided certain conditions are met. If a person has two properties that are simultaneously used as residences, a choice as to which property the “main residence” exemption will apply to is made at the time the first property is sold. If a person lives in a different home to their spouse or children they need to either choose one home to be their “main residence” for both of them, or nominate the two different homes as the “main residence” for each of them. If a couple nominates different homes for the same period, each person receives an exemption for their share of the property up to 50%, so the exemption is effectively split (for example, if a spouse owns 50% of the nominated property their share is fully exempt, but if the spouse owns 100% of the nominated property, their share is only exempt for half the period). If a person builds or renovates a house on land they own they can treat the land as their “main residence” for up to four years before they move in, provided they move in as soon as practicable and stay in that main residence for at least three months. The Commissioner has a discretion to extend the four year period in special circumstances. Canada Canada has an exemption for a “principal residence”. A “principal residence” is defined as a housing unit (which includes a house, apartment, mobile home, houseboat), a leasehold interest in a housing unit, or a share in the capital stock of a housing corporation (equivalent to a share in a flat-owning company). The exemption will only apply where the person owns the property (including beneficial ownership), alone or jointly. The housing unit must also be ordinarily inhabited by the person or their spouse, common-law partner, former spouse or common-law partner, or child. The “principal residence” exemption can apply for an income year even if the person and/or their family only inhabited the property f or a short period of time in that year, unless the main reason the person owns the property is to produce income. When the property is sold, the person must designate the years that the property was the person’s “principal residence” in their tax return. Treasury:3896338v1 19 A person can only have one principal residence per “family unit” for any one time, and can only claim the “principal residence” exemption for years when they were resident in Canada. A “family unit” is defined as the person and the following persons (if any): • the person’s spouse or common-law partner throughout the year, unless the spouse or common-law partner was separated from the person for the entire year under a court order or written agreement; • the person’s children (except those who were married, in a common-law partnership or 18 years of age or older during the year); and • where the person was not married, in a common-law partnership or 18 years of age or older during the year: o the person’s mother and father; and o the person’s brothers and sisters (except those who were married, in a common-law partnership or 18 years of age or older during the year). When one residence is sold and another is acquired in the same year, a person is effectively allowed to claim the “principal residence” exemption in respect of both properties (as a result of the way the gain is calculated). The “principal residence” exemption does not apply for income years where a person has vacant land on which they are constructing a residence. South Africa In South Africa, there is an exemption for the first R2 million (approximately NZ$200,000) on the sale of a “primary residence”. A “primary residence” is defined as a residence in which a natural person or special trust holds an interest, and which that person, or a beneficiary of the trust, or a spouse of that person or beneficiary, ordinarily resides in as their main residence, and uses or has used mainly for domestic purposes. The word “mainly” refers to a use of more than 50% measured based on floor area or time. If the property is not “mainly” used for domestic purposes it will not qualify in whole or in part. The “primary residence” exclusion can only be claimed on one residence at time (though an overlapping period of up to two years may be allowed where a person is changing residences). United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, gains arising from the disposal of a “principal private residence” may be exempt. A person’s “principal private residence” is a dwelling house (including a house, flat, houseboat or fixed caravan) that has been their main or only residence throughout the period of ownership. The exemption will not apply if a person acquires a property with the intention of realising a gain on disposal. Treasury:3896338v1 20 A person can only have one “principal private residence” at a time, and if they have more than one residence, they can nominate which residence is to be treated as their “principal private residence”. If no election is made, the decision will be made based on the relevant facts. A person who is married or in a civil partnership, and not separated, can only have one “principal private residence” per couple. The couple can nominate jointly which residence is to be their “principal private residence” if they have more than one when they marry or are registered as civil union partners. If a couple separates, each partner can have a different “principal private residence”. Treasury:3896338v1 21 5. Partial use 5.1 Introduction Partial use of a property refers to a situation where a property is used for both private and income earning purposes during the time it is owed by a person. Partial use can take the following forms: • Partial use on a floor area basis – where part of a person’s home (on a floor area basis) is set aside permanently for income earning purposes (for example, where a property has a dairy downstairs and a living area upstairs). • Partial use on a time basis – where a person uses their home for private purposes part of the time they own it, and for income earning purposes for the rest of time they own it (for example, where a person owns a property for 10 years, lives in it for 6 years, and rents it out for the remaining 4 years). • Partial use on both a floor area and time basis – where part of a person’s home (on a floor area basis) is used for income earning purposes part of the time (for example, renting a room out occasionally through Airbnb). This chapter of this paper deals with scenarios where there is partial use on a floor area basis, and partial use on both a floor area and time basis. The scenario where there is partial use on a time basis is referred to in this paper as a “change of use”, and is discussed in chapter 6 below. In Appendix B to the Interim Report, the Group said that, where a person partially uses their home for other purposes the exclusion should be reduced accordingly. It raised two options for doing this, being: • apportionment based on floor area; and/or • a de minimis rule where the home is “mainly used” as a residence by the taxpayer. A de minimis rule would allow minor income earning use to be ignored when determining whether the “excluded home” exclusion should apply. Officials have considered options for dealing with this situation, taking into account methods used in other jurisdictions, as well as the rules that are currently applied in New Zealand where properties are used for mixed purposes. This part of the paper outlines the options that Officials have identified. It also provides examples of how this would work in practice, for the Group to consider. 5.2 Options Officials have identified two potential options for dealing with partial income earning use of an “excluded home”, as follows: Treasury:3896338v1 22 • The first option is to allow partial income earning use, provided that the property is “mainly” used as a residence. • The second option is to require apportionment of the net sale proceeds taking into account actual use of the property. These options are discussed below. “Mainly” used The first option is to allow some income earning use of part of a residence, without any effect on the application of the “excluded home” exclusion, provided that the property is “mainly” used for residential purposes. Example Winston owns a five bedroom house that he uses as a residence for himself and his family. He also runs a consulting business out of one room in his house. As the area of the house used for income earning purposes is minor, and the house is “mainly” used as a residence, the “excluded home” exclusion will apply to the whole of the net sale proceeds when the property is sold. This is in line with the Group’s current interim decision that an “excluded home” should be a property that has been occupied “mainly as a residence by the person and their family”. However, the use of such a test does raise some potential issues. In particular, Officials note that the word “mainly” could have multiple interpretations, as follows: • The word “mainly” is used in the main home exclusion now contained in s CB 16 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The predecessor to this provision in earlier Acts used the term “primarily or principally”. This term was replaced with “mainly” when the Act was re-written without any intended change in the interpretation. Case law suggests that “primarily or principally” (now “mainly”) in this context refers to a use that is more than incidental. 3 • The term “mainly” has been interpreted in other contexts as often meaning “more than 50%”. 4 However, in some contexts it indicates a higher or lower threshold. The cases are consistent in considering that word cannot be read in isolation and takes its meaning from the context in which it is used. Officials recommend that “mainly” in this context be interpreted as being “more than 50%”. Such an interpretation is consistent with the ordinary usage of the word “mainly”. This could be stated in the legislation for clarity. The Independent Advisor notes that even ‘more than 50%’ could involve significant use other than as a family home. However if that were the intention of the Group her view is that 3 Trustees of the B Family Trust v CIR \[2013\] NZTRA 05. 4 For example, Fawcett Properties Ltd v Buckingham County Council \[1960\] 3 All ER 503 (HL). Treasury:3896338v1 23 this should be specifically provided for in the legislation rather than relying on interpretation of ‘mainly’. The use of a “mainly” test respects the terms of reference, because it ensures that the whole of the family home, and the land under it, will be excluded from an extension of the taxation of capital income. The use of a “mainly” test is also generally simple to apply, and will keep compliance costs low because taxpayers will not be required to carry out complex calculations when they sell their properties. The Independent Advisor notes, however, that without a specific definition taxpayers will be required to justify their level of non-family home use as being consistent with a ‘mainly’ test. However, on the margins, where there could be some debate as to whether a property is “mainly” used as a residence, such a test may not be particularly certain, and may in fact require some compliance in determining whether or not the use is above or below the 50% threshold. In addition, a “mainly” test will lead to inaccuracy, because it will allow people to use their properties for income producing purposes without having to pay any tax on any associated gains on sale. Apportionment The second option is an apportionment approach. Under an apportionment approach, the net proceeds from the sale of a property (i.e., the sale price less the purchase price and the cost of any capital improvements) are apportioned between the private and income earning uses of the property. Example Philippa owns a house, which she use as her main residence. She uses one room of that house (making up one fifth of the total floor space) as an office from which she runs her business. When she sells the house, 4/5 of the net sale proceeds relate to the private use of the property, and can benefit from the “excluded home” exclusion. The other one fifth of the net sale proceeds relates to the income earning use, and would be subject to tax. This method is currently used to determine the extent to which a person is allowed a deduction for expenditure when properties are used for mixed purposes. The advantage of an apportionment approach is that it ensures accuracy. It also gives rise to some certainty, particularly on the margins, because a person will always have to carry out a calculation, rather than being left wondering whether they fall within a more subjective “mainly” threshold. However, it will also give rise to higher compliance costs, because people would have to carry out potentially complex calculations when they sell their properties. Such an approach is also not simple. In order to limit the compliance cost impact, a de minimis threshold could be considered, below which, any income earning use will be ignored (for example, where there is less than 25% concurrent income earning use, that will be ignored, Treasury:3896338v1 24 and the whole property will be treated as an “excluded home”). Such rule would effectively be a hybrid between the “mainly” test, and an apportionment approach. However, a de mininis threshold will still require a calculation to be carried out to ensure that the use is below the required threshold. 5.3 Examples The following examples illustrate how the two options above would apply in practice. Example 1 – Areas permanently set aside for income earning purposes George owns a two storey property. The front two rooms of the ground floor are set up as a doctor’s surgery. The remainder of the house, including three more bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen and living areas (approximately 65% of the floor area of the property), are used as George’s family home. “Mainly” approach Applying a “mainly” approach, as 65% of the property is used as the family home of the doctor, the property is “mainly” (ie, more than 50%) used as a residence, and the “excluded home” exclusion will apply. Apportionment Applying an apportionment approach, the “excluded home” exclusion will apply to 65% of the net sale proceeds, but 35% of the net sale proceeds will be subject to tax. As 35% of the sale proceeds would be taxable, a proposed 25% de minimis suggested above would not apply to stop this portion being taxed. Example 2 – Areas used for both private and income earning purposes at different times Mary purchases a house, which she occupies as her main home. The house has two living areas, one of which has a small kitchenette. Mary decides to advertise the use of one of the bedrooms and the second living area with the small kitchenette (approximately 33% of the total floor area of her house) on Airbnb. Mary has paying guests staying in her house for an average of 50 days each year. Mary uses those areas for her own private use at other times of the year. “Mainly” approach Applying a “mainly” approach to this example, the “excluded home” exclusion would apply. Both the area used (33% of the floor area) and time the area was used for income earning purposes (an average of 50 days a year) amount to minor income earning use of the property. Therefore, the property is “mainly” used as a residence. Apportionment Applying an apportionment approach, when Mary sells her house, she will have to apportion the net sale proceeds based on both the floor area used to derive income from Airbnb (ie, 33% of the total floor space), and based on the number of days she had paying guests (50 days each year). This will result in approximately 5% of the net sale proceeds being subject to tax (33% x 50/365). For example, if the property was sold for a $100,000 gain, the calculation would be as follows: (100,000 x 33%) x 50/365 = $4,521 However, if a 25% de minimis is adopted, this income earning use would be ignored and the whole property would be subject to “excluded home” exclusion. Treasury:3896338v1 25 Example 3 – Areas use for both private and income earning purposes simultaneously Thomas owns a four bedroom house. In order to pay his mortgage, he rents two of the bedrooms (approximately 25% of the floor area of the house). He also shares the use of the living areas (33% of the floor area of the house) with his flatmates. In this scenario, the living areas are being used simultaneously for both private purposes (ie, this is part of Thomas’s residence) and for income earning purposes (as part of the area that is being rented out). “Mainly” approach Under a “mainly” approach, the property is “mainly” being used by Thomas as his residence. He has exclusive access to two of the four bedrooms and shared access to the living areas. Apportionment Under an apportionment approach Thomas will be required to apportion the net sale proceeds based on the floor area devoted entirely to income earning use (ie, 25% of the total floor space). Thomas will also be required to make an apportionment to account for the partial income earning use of the living areas. This would be based on 50% of the gain attributed to that 33% of the house. The Commissioner has previously stated the view that expenditure relating to common areas can be apportioned as 50% private and 50% deductible. 5 Officials consider that a similar principle could be applied to apportioning net sale proceeds under a new tax on capital income. This would result in approximately 41% of the gain on sale being taxable (25% + (33% x 50%)). For example, if the property was sold for a $100,000 gain the calculation would be as follows: (100,000 x 25%) + ($100,000 x 33%) x 50% = $41,500 As over 41% of the sale proceeds would be taxable, a proposed 25% de minimis suggested above would not apply to stop this portion being taxed. Example 4 – Part of a larger building used for income earning purposes Ruby owns a five bedroom property which she uses to run a bed and breakfast business. Ruby uses four of the bedrooms and most of the living areas for the bed and breakfast business. However, Ruby occupies one of the bedrooms and a small living area and bathroom attached to that bedroom as her residence (approximately 20% of the floor area of the property). “Mainly” approach In this example, the property is not “mainly” occupied by Ruby as her residence. She only occupies 20% of the property as her residence, and the other 80% is used for business purposes. Therefore, Ruby would not be able to claim the “excluded home” exclusion in respect of this property. Apportionment However, if an apportionment approach is used, Ruby would be entitled to claim the “excluded home” exclusion for the 20% of the property that she occupied as a residence, and would only have to pay tax on 80% of the net sale proceeds. 5 See “Homestays – GST treatment” in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 13 (May 1996). Treasury:3896338v1 26 5.4 Officials’ recommendations Officials recommend that the “mainly” approach be adopted. Officials consider that this approach better captures the spirit of the terms of reference in that it ensures that an extension of the taxation of capital income will not apply to the family home and the land under it. This approach is also relatively simple to apply, which will reduce compliance costs for taxpayers. The Independent Advisor’s preference, however, is for an explicit de minimis which could be as high as 50% as an alternative to the more uncertain use of the term ‘mainly’. However, Officials recommend that a limited apportionment approach could be considered for scenarios where a part of a property is set aside exclusively and permanently for income earning purposes and cannot be used for private purposes (eg, a downstairs dairy). This ensures that where part of a property is actually a business premises, that part is subject to tax. Similarly, consideration could be given to whether apportionment could apply to allow the “excluded home” exclusion to apply to a residential part of a larger building used mainly for business purposes (eg, the BnB example above). 5.5 Farmland and lifestyle blocks In the context of considering partial use of a property, Officials note that rules should also be considered for farmland and lifestyle blocks. The Group has suggested that the “excluded home” exclusion would only apply to the house and land around it up to 4,500m 2 , or the amount required for the reasonable occupation and enjoyment of the house. On this basis, people who own farmland or lifestyle blocks (assuming most lifestyle blocks are more than 4,500m 2 would not be entitled to claim the “excluded home” exclusion for the whole property. Officials consider that an apportionment approach, based on reasonable valuations, would be appropriate in this circumstance. Example The Farmers own a 100 acre sheep farm. Approximately 1 acre of the land comprises the Farmers house, and gardens. The remainder of the property is devoted to business purposes. The Farmers are only entitled to claim the “excluded home” exclusion for the area comprising the house and gardens. When they sell the land, they obtain a valuation of the area comprising the house and gardens, compared to the rest of the property. The valuation confirms that the house and gardens make up approximately 15% of the value of the whole farm. On that basis, the Farmers are entitled to claim the “excluded home” exclusion for 15% of the total gain on sale. Treasury:3896338v1 27 5.6 What do other countries do? For comparison purposes, Officials set out below a summary of how some other countries treat partial use of a residence. Australia Where a person partially uses their property for income earning purposes, apportionment of the net sales proceeds is required in line with Australia’s interest deductibility rules. Where a person would have been entitled to claim an interest deduction if they had borrowed to acquire the property (whether or not they actually have an interest expense) they are not entitled to claim a full “main residence” exclusion. Instead, the person is required to apportion their net sale proceeds. Where a business or professional practice is run in part of a home, an interest deduction is only allowed if part of the dwelling has the character of a place of business. This is a question of fact, but broadly depends on whether: • part of the dwelling is set aside exclusively as a place of business and is clearly identifiable as such; and • that part of the home is not readily suitable or adaptable for private use. Interest deductibility, and therefore apportionment on sale, is not allowed/required where, for example, a home study is used to undertake work usually undertaken elsewhere, or a person does paid child-minding at home. In those cases the full “main residence” exemption applies. Australia requires apportionment on a reasonable basis, usually based on floor area and period of income producing use. Canada Where a person starts using part of their “principal residence” for an income earning use, a deemed disposal and reacquisition will arise for that portion of the property (usually based on floor area) for market value. Where a person stops using part of their “principal residence” for an income earning use, and resumes using that part as their “principal residence”, this will also result in a deemed disposal, giving rise to a taxable gain. However, these rules only apply where the partial use is substantial and of a permanent nature (ie, gives rise to structural changes). No deemed disposal is required where the income producing use is ancillary to the main use of the property as a residence, there is no structural change (for example where the person carries on a business of caring for children, rents one or more rooms in the house, or has an office or other work space in the home), and no depreciation is claimed for the income producing use. Treasury:3896338v1 28 South Africa Where part of a “primary residence” is used for carrying on trade, the exclusion will not apply to the portion of a capital gain or loss that relates to that part. Apportionment between private and income earning use may be based on floor area (eg, when a portion of the residence is use for income earning purposes), or time (eg, when a primary residence is let out for a period). Apportionment may also be based on a combination of both time and area in appropriate cases. United Kingdom Where part of a building (which is used as a residence) is used exclusively for income earning purposes, only the part that is used as a residence will qualify for the “principal private residence” exemption (eg, if the property consists of living accommodation above a shop, or if a person let s part of their residence). A room that is used partly for business purposes and partly for residential purposes will qualify for relief in full, unless the residential use is very minor. Apportionment between residential and business uses depends on what is “reasonable” based on the facts of each case, and is not necessarily based on the number of rooms or floor area. There are also specific concessions where a person has a single lodger, or the person’s children or parents are paying board for the exclusive use of a room. In these cases, the whole property should still remain exempt. Treasury:3896338v1 29 6.0 Changes of use 6.1 Introduction In Appendix B to the Interim Report, the Group said that rules will also need to be developed for circumstances where the owner of an excluded home moves out of the home, or the owner of a rental property or second home moves into the property so that it becomes an excluded home. As noted above, this paper refers to this partial use on a time basis as a “change of use”. The Group suggested two alternative approaches as follows: • The change of use would result in a deemed sale and reacquisition of the property for market value; or • Any gain on sale of the property could be apportioned based on the time used as an excluded home compared with the time used for income earning purposes. Officials have considered options for dealing with this situation, taking into account methods used in other jurisdictions. This part of the paper provides comments on the three options. It also provides examples of how this would work in practice, for the Group to consider. 6.2 Options Officials have identified three potential options for dealing with the change of use of an “excluded home”, as follows: • The first option is to require a deemed disposal of the property at the time the use of the property changes. • The second option is to require apportionment of the net sale proceeds based on actual use of the property, on a straight line basis. • The third option is to require apportionment of the net sale proceeds based on actual use of the property, on a valuation basis. Deemed disposal The first option for dealing with a change of use is to deem the owner of the property to have disposed of the property for market value immediately before the change of use, and to have reacquired the property for market value immediately after the change of use. Similar rules are included throughout the Income Tax Act 2007. 6 The consequence of a deemed disposal is that: • Where the property changes from being used as an “excluded home” to being used for an income earning purpose, the deemed disposal provides a 6 See for example s DB 27 (Amount from major development or division and not already in income). Treasury:3896338v1 30 cost base, which will be allowed as a deduction when the property is ultimately sold. • Where the property changes from being used for an income earning purpose to being used as an “excluded home”, this would be treated as a sale that is subject to tax. The main benefits of a deemed disposal approach are that it is accurate and timely. Because this approach is based on actual valuations, the tax payable will reflect the actual gain that has been incurred during the period the property is used for income earning purposes. It also ensures that tax is paid at the time when a change of use occurs. However, this approach involves compliance costs for the taxpayer, because they are required to obtain valuations when they change the use of their property. In addition, in the case where a person moves into a property that they previously rented out, this option gives rise to a tax liability when the person has not actually received any cash, and so may not have the funds available to pay the liability. One way to alleviate this effect could be to delay the actual payment of the tax until the property is eventually sold. However, that will delay the time that tax is received by Inland Revenue. This would also raise the question of whether there should be an interest charge for the deferral. Apportionment – straight line The second option is to apportion the net sale proceeds based on the total time the property was used for income earning purposes compared with the time the property was used as an excluded home, on a straight line basis. This would involve the sale proceeds simply being divided in accordance with the period of each type of use. The benefit of this option is that it is simple to apply, and will entail low compliance costs for taxpayers. However, such an approach forgoes accuracy, could lead to under or over taxation depending on market movements. Apportionment – valuation basis The final option is a hybrid deemed disposal/apportionment. Under such a method, the net sale proceeds would be apportioned on actual disposal, but based on the actual increases in value that occurred when the land was held for private versus income earning purposes. The benefit with this option is that it is accurate. It also solves issues with the taxpayer’s ability to pay that arise with a straight deemed disposal approach because the tax is not due until the property is sold. However, this approach requires more compliance costs for the taxpayer as they will be required to obtain a valuation each time the property changes use. This Treasury:3896338v1 31 could be quite onerous if the use of the property changes multiple times during the period of ownership. De minimis threshold Officials note that the proposals above require every change of use to be counted when determining the application of the “excluded home” exclusion. However, consideration could be given as to whether a de minimis threshold could be provided for short-term absences (for example, a year or less). If this was the case then, provided the change to an income earning use was for a year or less, it would be ignored, and the property would be treated as an “excluded home” for the whole period it was held. This option would not be available if a person was claiming an “excluded home” exclusion for another property during this time. 6.3 Examples – Simple changes of use The following examples illustrate how the various options will operate in practice in simple change of use scenarios. Example 1 – Residence to rental Peter purchases a property in 2010 for $500,000. He uses the property as his residence. In 2015, Peter moves out of the property and uses it as a residential rental property. At the time of the change of use, the property is valued at $600,000. In 2018, Peter sells the property for $700,000. Deemed disposal Under a deemed disposal approach, when Peter changes the use of the property from residential to rental, he is deemed to have disposed of, and reacquired, the property for its market value ($600,000). As the property was used as Peter’s residence for this period, no tax will be payable on this deemed disposal because the “excluded home” exclusion will apply. When Peter sells the property in 2018, the $600,000 will be the cost base of the property, which can be deducted from the sale proceeds ($700,000) to determine the taxable gain ($100,000). Apportionment – straight line Under the straight line apportionment approach, on sale of the property 5/8 of the net gain will be eligible for the “excluded home” exclusion because Peter used the property as a residence for a total of five of the eight years he owned the property: $700,000 - $500,000 = $200,000 x 5/8 = $125,000 The remaining 3/8 of the net gain ($75,000) will be taxable income for Peter in the year of sale. Apportionment – valuation basis Under a valuation apportionment approach, when Peter sells the property he has a net gain of $200,000. $100,000 of that gain is attributable to the time that Peter used the property as his family home (ie, $600,0000 - $500,000). Because Peter lived in the property during this period, that portion of the gain will be subject to the “excluded home” exclusion. The other $100,000 of the gain arose during the period that Peter used the property as a residential rental property. Therefore, that gain will be subject to tax in the year of sale. Treasury:3896338v1 32 Example 2 – Rental to residence Sally purchases a property in 2010 for $400,000. She uses the property as a residential rental property. In 2014, Sally decides to move into the property and uses it as her family residence. At the time of the change of use, the property is valued at $550,000. In 2017, Sally sells the property for $675,000. Deemed disposal Under a deemed disposal approach, when Sally changes the use of the property from residential rental to her private residence, she is deemed to have disposed of, and reacquired, the property for its market value ($600,000). As the property was used as a rental property during this period, the deemed net sale proceeds will be subject to tax in 2014 (i.e. , $550,000 - $400,000 = $150,000). When Sally sells the property in 2017, no further tax will be payable because the “excluded home” exclusion will apply. Apportionment – straight line Under the straight line apportionment approach, on sale of the property 3/7 of the net gain will be eligible for the “excluded home” exclusion because Sally used the property as a residence for a total of three of the seven years she owned the property: $675,000 - $400,000 = $275,000 x 3/7 = $117,857 The remaining 4/7 of the net gain ($157,143) will be taxable income for Sally in the year of sale. Apportionment – valuation basis Under a valuation apportionment approach, when Sally sells the property she has a net gain of $275,000. $125,000 of that gain is attributable to the time that Sally used the property as her family home (ie, $675,000 - $550,000). Because Sally lived in the property during this period, that portion of the gain will be subject to the “excluded home” exclusion. The other $150,000 of the gain arose during the period that Sally used the property as a residential rental property. Therefore, that gain will be subject to tax in the year of sale. Example 3 – Change of use on death Brian owned a property in Christchurch where he lived since he purchase it in 2010. In 2018 Brian died. While winding up the estate, Brian’s executors decide to rent the property out. The property is rented until it is sold in 2020. Deemed disposal approach Under a deemed disposal option Brian will be deemed to have disposed of the property on the date that his estate begins using it as a rental property. No tax will be payable by Brian’s estate because the property was used as his “excluded home”. The deemed disposal will give rise to a cost base, which can be deducted from the net sale proceeds when it is finally sold. Apportionment – straight line Under a straight-line apportionment option, Brian’s estate would be required to pay tax on 2/10th of the total gain when he sell the property (because the property was used for income earning purposes for two out of the ten years it was owned by Brian (including the time it was held by his estate). Apportionment – valuation basis Under a valuation apportionment option, Brian’s estate would be required to pay tax on the actual increase in value of the property while it was being used for income earning purposes, but would not have to pay the tax until the property was sold. Treasury:3896338v1 33 6.4 Examples - Temporary changes of use Officials recommend that the same rules also apply to temporary changes of use. Officials consider that this approach better reflects the intention that a person should only be able to claim the “excluded home” exclusion for the period where they are using a home as their residence. The following examples illustrate how the above options would apply to temporary changes of use. Example 1 – Moving for work reasons Donald and Daisy occupy a family home in Auckland, which they purchased in 2010. In 2014, they temporarily move to Wellington for work reasons. Donald and Daisy purchase an apartment in Wellington where they live while they are there, but decide to keep their Auckland home while they are away, and rent it out. In 2017 Donald and Daisy sell their Wellington apartment and move back into their Auckland home. Donald and Daisy live in their home until 2021 when it is sold. Deemed disposal Under a deemed disposal option, Donald and Daisy would need to obtain a valuation for the property each time it changed use. They would be required to pay tax when the use changed back from rental property to family home in 2017. However, no tax would be due as a result of the first change of use, or on actual sale, because the “excluded home” exclusion would apply. Apportionment – straight line Under a straight-line apportionment option, Donald and Daisy would be required to pay tax on 3/11th of the total gain when they sell the property (because they used the property for income earning purposes for three of the 11 years they owned it). Apportionment – valuation basis Under a valuation apportionment option, Donald and Daisy would be required to pay tax on the actual increase in value of the property while it was being used for income earning purposes, but would not have to pay the tax until the property was sold. Example 2 – Moving overseas Mickey and Minnie own a property in Dunedin, which they purchased in 2008 for $300,000. In 2012, Mickey and Minnie decide to go overseas on their OE. They are gone for two years, and during this time they rent out the property. In 2014 Mickey and Minnie return to their property. They occupy it as their residence until 2018 when they sell it and move to another property. Deemed disposal Under a deemed disposal option, Mickey and Minnie would need to obtain a valuation for the property each time it changed use. They would be required to pay tax when the use changed back from rental property to family home in 2014. However, no tax would be due as a result of the first change of use, or on actual sale, because the “excluded home” exclusion would apply. Apportionment – straight line Under a straight-line apportionment option, Mickey and Minnie would be required to pay tax on 2/10th of the total gain when they sell the property (because they used the property for income earning purposes for two of the 10 years they owned it). Treasury:3896338v1 34 Apportionment – valuation basis Under a valuation apportionment option, Mickey and Minnie would be required to pay tax on the actual increase in value of the property while it was being used for income earning purposes, but would not have to pay the tax until the property was sold. Officials note that there may be some concern that a person may not return to pay their tax if they move overseas. However, Officials note that it is proposed that a non-resident should be subject to tax on the sale of New Zealand land. The new withholding rules for sales of land subject to the bright-line rules by non-residents may be able to be extended to facilitate tax collection in this scenario. Example – Empty home Bill owns a property in New Zealand which he occupied as his residence since he purchased it in 2012. In 2015 Bill decides to move overseas for work. He intends to return to the property and does not want anyone to damage it while he is away so he leaves the property empty while he is away. Bill returns in 2018 and continues living in the house until 2020 when it is sold. Deemed disposal Under a deemed disposal option, Bill would need to obtain a valuation for the property each time it changed use. He would be required to pay tax when the use changed back from vacant to private home in 2018. However, no tax would be due as a result of the first change of use, or on actual sale, because the “excluded home” exclusion would apply. Apportionment – straight line Under a straight-line apportionment option, Bill would be required to pay tax on 3/8th of the total gain when he sell the property (because he did not live in the property for three out of the eight years he owned it). Apportionment – valuation basis Under a valuation apportionment option, Bill would be required to pay tax on the actual increase in value of the property while it was vacant, but would not have to pay the tax until the property was sold. 6.5 Officials’ recommendations Officials recommend the adoption of a straight line apportionment approach. Such an approach is simple to apply and involves relatively little compliance from taxpayers. While it is likely to over tax, or under tax, some people, Officials consider that simplicity should be preferred over accuracy in the context of the main home exclusion. As noted above, Officials recommend that the same rules be adopted for all changes of use, whether temporary or not, and whether the property is used for income earning purposes, or is left vacant. However, Officials recommend consideration of de minimis rule for very short absences (for example, a year or less), where the absence will be ignored. Treasury:3896338v1 35 6.6 What do other countries do? For comparison purposes, Officials set out below a summary of how some other countries treat changes of use. Australia If a person stops using a property as their “main residence”, they can continue to treat the property as a “main residence” for up to six years if it is used to produce income, or indefinitely if it is not used to produce income. The six-year period does not need to be continuous, and intermittent periods may be aggregated. If a person uses a property that was their “main residence” for income earning purposes for more than six years, then they are deemed to have disposed of the property for market value and reacquired it at the time they first started using the property for income earning purposes, to determine the cost base of the property. The six year period applies separately each time a property becomes and ceases to be a person’s “main residence”. Canada In Canada, each person can designate a “principal residence” for each tax year. The gain on sale is apportioned based on the number of years for which the property was the person’s principal residence, and during which the person was resident in Canada, as a proportion of the total years the person owned the property. If a person completely converts their “principal residence” to an income-producing use, they are deemed to have disposed of the property at fair market value and reacquired it immediately for the same amount. However, the person can elect to defer recognition of the gain for up to four years, and continue to claim the “principal residence” exemption for that property during that time. If the person makes this election, they have to report the income from their income producing activity but cannot claim any depreciation on the property. During the deferral period, the person will not be able to claim the “principal residence” exemption for any other property, and must be resident in Canada for tax purposes. The deferral period can be extended indefinitely if: • the person or their spouse or common-law partner’s place of employment has been relocated; • the employer is not a related person; • the original property is at least 40km farther from the new place of employment than the person’s new place of residence; and • the person returns to live in their original property during the term of employment or before the end of the year after the employment ends. Treasury:3896338v1 36 If a person completely changes the use of their property from an income earning purpose to a “principal residence” they are deemed to have disposed of the property for fair market value and reacquired it immediately for the same amount, resulting in a taxable capital gain. The person can elect to defer recognition of the gain from the deemed disposal to a later year by filing a signed letter with their tax return. The election is not available if depreciation has previously been claimed for the property. Where a person makes an election to defer the recognition of the gain from the deemed disposal they can claim the “principal residence” exemption for up to four years prior to the change of use. A person can still only have one “principal residence” in any given tax year. South Africa Where a person changes the use of their “primary residence” to an income earning use, they are required to pay tax on part of their capital gain or loss when they dispose of their property. The amount of tax is determined based on the period that the property was used for the income earning purpose compared with the total period of ownership. A person may be entitled to the “primary residence” exclusion for a period not exceeding two years when they are not ordinarily resident in that property, if: • the property that was the person’s “primary residence” is being offered for sale and is vacated due to the acquisition of a new “primary residence”; • the residence is being erected on land acquired to be a “primary residence”; • the residence has been accidentally rendered uninhabitable (for example, because of fire); or • the person has died. In addition, a change of use from “primary residence” to letting will be ignored if: • the residence is let for not more than five years; • the property was used as a “primary residence” for at least one continuous year before and one continuous year after the period when the property was let ; • no other residence was treated as a “primary residence” during the period; and • the person was temporarily absent from South Africa, or was employed or engaged in carrying on business at a location more than 250km from the residence. United Kingdom Where a person has changed the use of their property from private to income earning during the period it is held, any gain on sale is apportioned in a manner which is “just and reasonable”. Apportionment takes into account the extent to Treasury:3896338v1 37 which, and the period over which, each part of the property has been used as the owner’s main residence. In some cases where a person is temporarily absent from their property, they may still be treated as occupying their property. Provided they have used the property as their main residence at some time before and after the period of absence (unless they could not return to the residence because of their employment or their spouse or civil union partner’s employment), the following temporary absences are treated as periods of actual occupation, rather than as a change of use: • Absences for whatever reason, of not more than three years in total. • Absences during which the person (or their spouse or civil union partner) is in employment and all their duties are carried on outside of the United Kingdom. • Absences totalling not more than four years when the distance from the person’s (or their spouse or civil union partner’s) place of work prevents them from living at home and the employer reasonably requires the person to work away from their home. However, a person is still only entitled to claim the “principal private residence” exemption in relation to one property at any one time, unless they are moving between residences. When a person sells a property that they have previously used as their main residence, they are deemed to have used it as a residence during the last 18 months they owned it, even if it is not actually used for that purpose. Similarly, when a person acquires a property, they are treated as residing in that property for up to 12 months (or up to two years in exceptional circumstances) if they could not occupy it because they were unable to sell their old home, or refurbishment is needed. During this 12 month (or up to two year) period of overlapping ownership, relief is available for both residences. Treasury:3896338v1 38 Appendix A: Suggested text for Final Report The “excluded home” The Terms of Reference require that the Group excludes the family home and the land under it from any extension to the taxation of capital income. The Group notes that the Terms of Reference did not define a family home. It also notes that, while a gain on a family home (whether realised or not) does increase a person’s wealth, generally speaking it does not increase the person’s consumption potential as it simply represents a place to live and connect with their family. That is, it is their turangawaewae. The family home in the Pākehā sense of the term is the house that is the centre of family connections for the individuals who live there. While the nuclear family (ie, parents and young dependent children) is the most common representation of family in New Zealand, even for Pākehā family is increasingly taking on broader connotations involving blended families (for example, grandparents raising grandchildren, and significant delay for adult children leaving to set up their own households). For Māori this concept is even broader. To integrate this with the design of an extension of the taxation of capital income, the Group proposes that there be an exclusion for a property that is mainly used as residence for a person, or a person and any member of their family living with them (referred to as the “excluded home”). The rest of this section details the Group’s recommendations of how to define an “excluded home”. Who can own an “excluded home”? An “excluded home” can be a property owned separately or jointly by the person who uses it as a residence. An “excluded home” can also be: • a property owned by a trust, if a person occupying the property mainly as their residence is: o a settlor of the trust; or o a beneficiary of the trust who is irrevocably entitled to the property; • shares in a flat owning company, if a person who owns the shares occupies the property mainly as their residence; or • a property owned by an ordinary company or look through company, if the person who owns the shares occupies the property mainly as their residence. Only New Zealand residents (who are treated under a double tax agreement as being resident in New Zealand) can have an “excluded home”. Treasury:3896338v1 39 Only one “excluded home” A person, or a person and their family living with them (a “family unit”) can only have one “excluded home” at any one point in time. If a person or “family unit” has more than one property that is used mainly as a residence by them, they will be required to make an election as to which property is their “excluded home”. A “family unit” includes a person and the following persons (if any): • their spouse, civil union, partner or de facto partner, unless: o they are legally separated; or o they usually live in separate homes, that are owned individually by each of them; • their children under the age of 18 years; and • any other member of their extended family who is living with them. The following examples illustrate how these definitions work: Example 1 – One “family unit” Karen and her husband own a house in Wellington where they live with their two small children (ages 4 and 7). Karen and her husband also own an apartment in Auckland where Karen stays two to three days a week when she is working in Auckland. The family also spend approximately six weeks per year (during school holidays) living in the Auckland apartment as a family. Karen, her husband and their children are one “family unit”. Therefore, they are only entitled to have one “excluded home”. They will need to elect which property will be their “excluded home”. Example 2 – Couple has separated John and Trudy have been married for 10 years. During that time they lived together in a home they jointly own. Their relationship breaks down and they decide to separate. John remains in the home they shared, and Trudy purchases a new home. After their separation, John and Trudy can each have a separate “excluded home”. Example 3 – Separate homes Natalie and Sarah are married. However, they each own separate homes, and do not usually live together. Their personal property is kept separately in their respective separate homes. Natalie and Sarah can each have a separate “excluded home”. Exceptions There would be two exceptions to the general rule that a person or “family unit” can only have one “excluded home”. Where a person or “family unit” purchases a new property, and is holding their old property for sale, both properties can be “excluded homes” for a short period. However, the original property must have been used mainly as the residence of the Treasury:3896338v1 40 person or “family unit”, and the new property must be purchased with the intention that it will be used mainly as a residence for the person or “family unit” from the time of purchase. The old property must also remain vacant during the period that it is held for sale. Example – Sale and purchase Kate and Will own a property that they have occupied as their “excluded home”. They decide to move to another area. They find a new home, purchase it, and move into it. However, it takes three months to sell their old home. While it is on the market, the old home is left vacant. Kate and Will will be entitled to claim the “excluded home” exclusion for both homes for the three months that they own both. When vacant land is purchased with the intention of building a home that will mainly be used as a residence of the person or “family unit”, both the vacant land and another property that the person owns can be “excluded homes” for a short period. The other property that the person owns must be occupied by the person or “family unit” mainly as their residence, and the person or “family unit” must intend to occupy the new property mainly as their residence once the home is completed. Both properties cannot be “excluded homes” where the vacant land is held for a long period before it is occupied. Example 1 – Building a new home Burt and Ernie have a home in central Wellington. They decide to purchase a vacant section in the outer suburbs and build a new home for themselves. It takes two years from the date of purchase of the vacant section for the new home to be built. During that time Burt and Ernie continue to live in their central Wellington home. Once the new home is completed, Burt and Ernie sell their central Wellington home and move into their new home. Both properties are “exclude homes” of Burt and Ernie for the two years that they owed both. Example 2 – Land banking Jason and Kim have a family home that they have occupied for a number of years. They decide to purchase some vacant land, with the intention of building a new home for themselves. They hold the land for three years before they start to develop plans. Once they start to develop plans, it takes a further three years to complete the home. Once the new home is completed, Jason and Kim sell their old home and move into their new one. Six years is too long for the vacant land to be treated as an “excluded home”.. Therefore, both properties will not be “excluded homes” for the whole period they are both owned by Jason and Kim. The Group recommends that further consideration be given to the appropriate time period that two properties can both be treated as “excluded homes”. Land under an “excluded home” The “excluded home” includes the land under the house, and the land around the house up to the greater of 4,500m 2 , or the amount required for the reasonable occupation and enjoyment of the house. Treasury:3896338v1 41 Where the total area of the property is greater than 4,500m 2 , or not required for the reasonable occupation and enjoyment of the house, the gain on sale will be apportioned on a reasonable basis. Example The Farmers own a 100 acre sheep farm. Approximately 1 acre of the land comprises the Farmers house, and gardens. The remainder of the property is devoted to business purposes. Only the area of the house and gardens is part of the “excluded home”.. When the Farmers sell the land, they obtain a valuation of the area comprising the house and gardens, compared to the rest of the property. The valuation confirms that the house and gardens make up approximately 15% of the value of the whole farm. On that basis, only 15% of the total gain on sale can be allocated to the “excluded home”. Māori freehold land \[Placeholder for a comment regarding the application of the “excluded home” exclusion to Māori freehold land\]. Partial use of “excluded home” for income earning purposes When a person uses part of their property for income earning purposes while they are also living in the property (eg, where there is a home office, a room is used for Airbnb, or where a person has flatmates), the entire property will still be an “excluded home” as long as it is “mainly” used as the person’s residence. The Group proposes that “mainly” in this context will mean that the property is more than 50% used as a residence, and will take into account both the floor area used for income earning versus private purposes, and the time that the property is used for income earning purposes. The following examples illustrate how this will apply: Example 1 – Home office Gary owns a five bedroom house that he uses as a residence for himself and his family. He also runs a consulting business out of one room in his house. As the area of the house used for income earning purposes is minor, and the house is “mainly” used as a residence, the entire property is an “excluded home”. Example 2 – Airbnb Mary purchases a house, which she occupies as her main home. The house has two living areas, one of which has a small kitchenette. Mary decides to advertise the use of one of the bedrooms and the second living area with the small kitchenette (approximately 33% of the total floor area of her house) on Airbnb. Mary has paying guests staying in her house for an average of 50 days each year. Mary uses those areas for her own private use at other times of the year. Both the area used (33% of the floor area) and time the area was used for income earning purposes (an average of 50 days a year) amount to minor income earning use of the property. Therefore, the entire property is “mainly” used as a residence, and is an “excluded home”. Example 3 – Flatmates Treasury:3896338v1 42 Thomas owns a four bedroom house. In order to pay his mortgage, he rents two of the bedrooms (approximately 25% of the floor area of the house). He also shares the use of the living areas (33% of the floor area of the house) with his flatmates. In this scenario, the living areas are being used simultaneously for both private purposes (ie, this is part of Thomas’s residence) and for income earning purposes (as part of the area that is being rented out). The Group considers that the property is “mainly” being used by Thomas as his residence. He has exclusive access to two of the four bedrooms and shared access to the living areas. Therefore, the entire property is an “excluded home”. However, the Group proposes that where there is an area of the house which is set aside exclusively for income earning purposes and cannot be used for private purposes (eg, as a doctor’s surgery or dairy) then only the area that is used for private purposes will be an “excluded home”. Any capital gain on sale would be apportioned, and the gain relating to the area of the house used for income earning purposes will be taxable. Example – Doctor’s surgery George owns a two storey property. The front two rooms of the ground floor are set up as a doctor’s surgery. The remainder of the house, including three more bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen and living areas (approximately 65% of the floor area of the property), are used as George’s family home. Only 65% of the property is an “excluded home”. The remaining 35% of the property is not an “excluded home” and any capital gain on sale will be taxable. The Group proposes that, when a property is used “mainly” for income earning purposes, a person should be able to apportion the capital gain on sale and treat the part of the property used as a residence as an “excluded home”. Example 4 – Part of a larger building used for private purposes Ruby owns a five bedroom property which she uses to run a bed and breakfast business. Ruby uses four of the bedrooms and most of the living areas for the bed and breakfast business. However, Ruby occupies one of the bedrooms and a small living area and bathroom attached to that bedroom as her residence (approximately 20% of the floor area of the property). The 20% of the property that is used as Ruby’s residence may be treated as an “excluded home”, and Ruby would only have to pay tax on 80% of the gain on sale. Changes of use Where a person completely changes the use of their property, for example from a main residence to a rental property or vice versa, they will apportion the capital gain on sale in line with their actual use of the property. The following examples illustrate how this would work in practice: Example 1- Residential to rental Peter purchases a property in 2020 for $500,000. He uses the property as his residence. In 2025, Peter moves out of the property and uses it as a residential rental property. At the time of the change of use, the property is valued at $600,000. In 2028, Peter sells the property for $700,000. Treasury:3896338v1 43 On sale of the property 5/8 of the net gain will be excluded from tax because the property was Peter’s “excluded home” for five of the eight years he owned the property: $700,000 - $500,000 = $200,000 x 5/8 = $125,000 The remaining 3/8 of the net gain ($75,000) will be taxable income for Peter in the year of sale. Example 2 – Rental to residential Sally purchases a property in 2020 for $400,000. She uses the property as a residential rental property. In 2024, Sally decides to move into the property and uses it as her family residence. At the time of the change of use, the property is valued at $550,000. In 2027, Sally sells the property for $675,000. On sale of the property 3/7 of the net gain will be excluded from tax because the property was Sally’s “excluded home” for a total of three of the seven years she owned the property: $675,000 - $400,000 = $275,000 x 3/7 = $117,857 The remaining 4/7 of the net gain ($157,143) will be taxable income for Sally in the year of sale. The Group proposes that the same rules will apply where a person dies, and the property is rented out while the estate is wound up. Example 3 – Change of use on death Brian owned a property in Christchurch where he lived since he purchase it in 2020. In 2028 Brian dies. While winding up the estate, Brian’s executors decide to rent the property out. The property is rented until it is sold in 2030. Brian’s estate would be required to pay tax on 2/10th of the total gain when it sells the property (because the property was used for income earning purposes for two out of the ten years it was owned by Brian and his estate). The Group proposes that apportionment will also apply where there is a temporary change of use. However, the Group is considering a possible de minimis rule for very short absences, where the absence will be ignored. The following examples illustrate how this will work: Example 4 – Moving for work reasons Donald and Daisy occupy a family home in Auckland, which they purchased in 2020. In 2024, they temporarily move to Wellington for work reasons. Donald and Daisy purchase an apartment in Wellington where they live while they are there, but decide to keep their Auckland home while they are away, and rent it out. In 2027 Donald and Daisy sell their Wellington apartment and move back into their Auckland home. Donald and Daisy live in their home until 2031 when it is sold. Donald and Daisy would be required to pay tax on 3/11th of the total gain when they sell the property (because they used the property for income earning purposes for three of the 11 years they owned it). Example 5 – Moving overseas Mickey and Minnie own a property in Dunedin, which they purchased in 20208. In 2024, Mickey and Minnie decide to go overseas on their OE. They are gone for two years, and during this time they rent out the property. In 2026 Mickey and Minnie return to their property. They occupy it as their residence until 2030 when they sell it and move to another property. Treasury:3896338v1 44 Mickey and Minnie would be required to pay tax on 2/10th of the total gain when they sell the property (because they used the property for income earning purposes for two of the 10 years they owned it). Example 6 – Empty home Bill owns a property in New Zealand which he occupied as his residence since he purchased it in 2022. In 2025 Bill decides to move overseas for work. He intends to return to the property and does not want anyone to damage it while he is away so it leaves his property empty while he is away. Bill returns in 2028 and continues living in the house until 2030 when it is sold. Bill would be required to pay tax on 3/8th of the total gain when he sell the property (because he did not live in the property for three out of the eight years he owned it). High value homes In Appendix B to its Interim Report, the Group raised the possibility of applying a limit on the “excluded home” for higher value homes. This option is raised as a potential option for mitigating the “mansion effect”, where people invest more capital in their family home where it can generate untaxed capital gains. Higher value homes also put pressure on the concept of family home and connotations of it being a place for a person primarily to live and connect with their family. However, the Group considers this to be contrary to their terms of reference and so has not considered it further. Treasury:3896338v1 45 References Canada Revenue Agency. (2017).

Introduction 1.1 Purpose 1. In Appendix B to the Group’s Interim Report, the Group proposed that the new rules for the extension of taxation of capital income should be introduced for all affected assets from a particular date (referred to as “Valuation Day”). This would mean that taxable gains and losses would be calculated based on the increase or decrease in value of the assets after Valuation Day. 2. The purpose of this paper is to provide the Group with further information and analysis to assist with the Group’s decisions on rules for valuing assets on Valuation Day. 3. The paper will recap why the Group is proposing a Valuation Day approach. It will outline the decisions the Group has already made. It will also provide further discussion and recommendations on how a “median rule”, proposed by the Group in their Interim Report, could work in practice. 1.2 Content and scope 4. In its Interim Report, the Group said consideration should also be given to whether the median rule would be appropriate in other transitional situations, for example when a person migrates to or from New Zealand, or a house becomes or ceases to be an “excluded home”. 5. Discussion of the median rule in respect of migration will be included in a paper for session 22 (ETIC: International aspects). 6. Following consideration of the paper on the excluded home, in session 19. The Group has decided a Valuation Day type approach should be adopted for situations where a house becomes or ceases to be an “excluded home”. This is covered in more detail below. 6 2. Problem definition and objectives 2.1 Policy problem or opportunity 7. Generally, capital gains taxes have been introduced in other countries either: • for all affected assets, with effect from a certain day, on the basis that gains and losses from that day on are in the base (this was the approach taken by South Africa); or • only for assets acquired on or after a certain day (this was the approach taken by Australia). 8. If the Group recommends an extension to the taxation of capital income, the Group has decided it would apply for all affected assets, with effect from a “Valuation Day”. 9. This approach was favoured because it reduces the lock-in effect which occurs in relation to assets acquired before the new rules are implemented. However, this approach means a cost base will need to be established for all affected assets as at the Valuation Day. 10. This paper considers options for dealing with the need to establish a cost base on Valuation Day for affected assets. 2.2 Stakeholder considerations 11. The Secretariat considers that valuable input on this issue could be obtained from the private sector, and in particular from registered valuers. The Secretariat has not had an opportunity to carry out any consultation on this issue prior to submitting this paper. However, The Secretariat recommends that this be done prior to issuing the Group’s final report. 7 3. Valuation options 3.1 Policy considerations about valuation options 12. The Group has noted that if all assets need to be explicitly valued for Valuation Day, this would impose a significant cost on many taxpayers. Some kinds of assets are much easier to value than others. For example, valuing listed shares and other assets that are regularly traded should be relatively straightforward in most cases. However, valuations for other assets may be unreliable or require incurring significant compliance costs to obtain (for example, obtaining a reliable value for a private company, or of goodwill associated with a business, is likely to require significant time and expense). Furthermore, no matter how much time is taken or expense incurred, market value will inevitably be approximate rather than precise. 13. In determining the best method to be used for valuation, it is helpful to take into account various policy considerations. These considerations can then be weighed and decisions can be made about which are more important in this context. The Secretariat has identified the following factors that appear to be relevant for the design of rules for Valuation Day: • Level of compliance costs – The level of costs that taxpayers will be required to incur in order to comply with the rules is a major consideration • Simplicity and certainty – Simple rules are easier for taxpayers to understand and apply, and reduce risk of disputes that are costly to both the taxpayer and the Commissioner. However, simplicity can lead to a lack of accuracy. • Accuracy – Rules that require very precise valuations give rise to a more accurate tax outcome. However, such rules are often complex and time consuming for taxpayers to apply. • Integrity – Recognising that there will often be a range of acceptable valuations, rules that are more certain will provide fewer opportunities for some taxpayers to “push the boundaries” of what may be acceptable. 14. It is also helpful to take account of the rules that apply in other countries when determining appropriate rules for New Zealand, because they have dealt with the same issues before. On this basis, a brief summary of the rules that applied in some other countries which used a Valuation Day is included at Appendix C. 15. Ultimately, the Secretariat considers that the appropriate policy setting for the design of rules for Valuation Day is to design rules that are simple to apply for the average taxpayer, and that do not involve significant compliance costs. The rules also need to ensure that all owners of capital assets in New Zealand will not be required to obtain professional valuations of all of their assets on the same day. Such a requirement would place an unmanageable burden on valuers, and unreasonable compliance costs on taxpayers. While allowing this valuation to be obtained at a later date, such as when the asset is sold or at the expiry of a set 8 period, would partially mitigate this issue it would still require taxpayers to incur compliance costs. 16. For that reason, the Secretariat recommends that the rules for Valuation Day need to provide taxpayers a choice between accuracy and low compliance costs. They also need to allow for different valuation options for different types of assets. The Secretariat would prefer to err on the side of more liberal rules that do not achieve absolute accuracy, than on less liberal rules that give rise to unreasonable costs for taxpayers. 3.2 Options for valuation 17. Options that could be used for valuation are outlined below. Rather than being options that the Group needs to choose one of, the Secretariat sees these as being options that will apply better to some assets than to others. However, the Group could choose to have default valuation options for each kind of asset, for any taxpayer that does not want to make a choice. 18. The Secretariat notes that it is necessary under current law to ascertain market values in a number of circumstances described in the Income Tax Act 2007 and Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The definition of “market value” varies slightly for the purposes of the different regimes for which it is required; however the definitions tend to rely on common concepts like an arm’s length price, i.e. the price that would be agreed between a willing buyer and a willing seller. The legislation is generally not prescriptive about how to ascertain value, but instead that ‘void’ is filled by guidance issued by Inland Revenue. An example of one of these guidance statements is included in Appendix B. 19. Inland Revenue could prepare guidance, like the statement in Appendix B, on the valuation methods the Commissioner would find acceptable for the various classes of assets that would be brought into the tax base on Valuation Day. 20. The effect of a Commissioner’s Statement would be to provide taxpayers with safe harbour valuation methodologies which the Commissioner will accept. It would also provide guidance as to the information the taxpayer should retain to support the valuation. 21. The statements would not be intended to provide a definitive and comprehensive set of valuation techniques, so that taxpayers could still apply other valuation methodologies that determine the value of the affected asset. There are existing examples where alternative methodologies can be used. The statements would instead require that if another valuation methodology is used, the valuation must reflect the market value of the asset on the Valuation Day. 22. The Secretariat notes that absolute accuracy would not be expected in all scenarios (as accuracy depends in part on the data available and on subjective judgement). However, it would be reasonable to expect that an appropriate process is followed when determining the value at Valuation Day. 9 23. It would also expected that the valuation method, and any input assumptions used to prepare the valuation, should be fully documented and retained as the Commissioner may request to examine the documentation. Where a taxpayer adopts a method not outlined in the statements, they should also retain the documentation outlining the reasons for adopting the alternative method. 3.3 Some potential general options: Actual value 24. Some assets have easily obtainable market values. Assets that would fall into this category would be: • listed shares; and • other things traded on exchanges (e.g. certain commodities) (though these are likely to be subject to tax already as inventory). 25. If shares are listed in New Zealand, their value on Valuation Day could be the closing price on the day before; however, this could create the risk of prices being manipulated due to the relative illiquidity of some New Zealand shares. A volume weighted average price, as discussed below (at paragraph 41), would help address this. 26. If the shares are not listed in New Zealand but are listed on one or more overseas recognised exchanges, the foreign value will need to be converted to its New Zealand Dollar equivalent. The most common method for currency conversion under existing rules is to apply the close of trading spot exchange rate. This will only apply to Australian shares or investors with shares that cost less than $50,000 as portfolios above this value will be applying the Fair Dividend Rate method. 27. If the shares are listed on more than one recognised exchange, the listed price could be based firstly on the recognised exchanges in the taxpayer’s country of residence, or, if that is not applicable, on the average of all the listed prices as converted to New Zealand dollars. 28. In Appendix B to the Interim Report, the Group set out their preliminary conclusions with regard to valuations, and suggested that where International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) rules require assets to be valued at fair market values, the value on Valuation Day could be the value adopted under those rules. The Secretariat notes that, although taxpayers who use IFRS are required to update the fair value calculation in their accounts regularly, care would need to be taken if referring to the fair value amounts as shown in the books at a certain date (e.g. fair values may not have been updated for some time). Further goodwill, while valued at the date of acquisition, is usually not revalued subsequently under the fair value rules, although it can be impaired., Therefore its value at a certain date may be historic. 10 Arm’s length valuation 29. An arm’s length value determined by an independent, suitably qualified valuer. 30. Similar terminology was recently introduced in the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) changes to valuation of assets for thin capitalisation purposes. Straight-line (pro-rating) 31. Another approach could be to allow a person to determine the value of their asset on Valuation Day by allowing them to pro rate the change in value over the time they have held the asset. This option was also briefly raised by the Group in Appendix B to the Interim Report. 32. Under this approach, at the time an asset is sold, the owner would determine the total gain on sale derived over the whole period of ownership, and then determine what proportion of that gain was derived after Valuation Day. This is illustrated by the following example. Example 6 – straight-line John purchased a small trucking business on 1 April 2015 for $200,000. On 31 March 2025 (ie, 10 years later), John sells the business to Paul for $600,000 (ie, a $400,000 gain). As a result of the extension of the taxation of capital income, John will have to pay tax on the capital gain he has derived since Valuation Day (1 April 2021) from the sale of the business (ie, for the last 4 years he owned the business). Applying a straight-line approach, John will have to pay tax on 4/10th of the gain on sale (ie, $160,000). 33. The downside with this option is that it may be difficult to apply to assets whose cost base includes a number of items of expenditure spread over a number of years, or where taxpayers are unlikely to have kept a track of the cost base. Perhaps the most common example would be a sale of a business which has been developed by the vendor. 34. A further downside is that the value is likely to be inaccurate where assets have not grown at a consistent rate before and after the Valuation date. For example, a start-up business that reaches a plateau, or residential property which has grown significantly in recent years but may not increase at the same rate in coming years. However, given the inherent uncertainty of valuations, this may not be seen as an issue in most cases. 3.4 Other options for real property Comparable properties 35. A review could be undertaken of comparable properties sold around the time of Valuation Day. This service is already offered through a number of websites using 11 algorithms based on recent close sales, Ratings Valuations and other comparable data such as property size and features. A prime example of this is QV valuations. Rateable value 36. A property’s value could be the Ratings Valuation (RV) (plus any capital costs incurred since the date the RV was published); 37. The RV chosen could be the closest before or after Valuation Day. 38. As the RV is used to assess local authority rates there would be a natural tension with property owners wanting a low RV for rates purposes and a high RV for Valuation Day. 39. There is a public perception that RVs are often significantly lower than a property’s value. The Secretariat will consult with relevant private sector experts to ascertain if the perception is accurate across all of New Zealand. If the taxpayer is concerned that RVs for property in their area are not comparable to market sale prices, they would be unlikely to choose this option. Māori freehold properties 40. The Valuer-General applies a discount rate when valuing Māori Freehold Land for the purposes of the district valuation roll. This is to recognise that legal restrictions under the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 on owners’ ability to sell Māori Freehold Land have an effect on the value of that land. 1 Further consideration will be given to the underlying policy intent of the discount rate as well as the Group’s intended principles in respect of extending the taxation of capital income. This analysis will be incorporated into the collectively-owned Māori assets paper that will be provided to the Group following consultation. 3.5 Other options for shares Volume weighted average price 41. Volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) over the last five trading days (including the acquisition date) for the listed share. 2 VWAP is currently available upon request from the New Zealand Stock Exchange, for shares listed on the NZX. VWAP is already approved for valuing shares provided in an employee share schemes to smooth out short-term fluctuations in share prices immediately before the Valuation date. 1 The Valuer-General’s approach reflects the Court of Appeal’s decision in Valuer-General v Mangatu Inc \[1997\] 3 NZLR 641. 2 VWAP calculates the average price of an asset based on all sales over a set period, such as five days. This is weighted by the size of the trades so that a large trade has a bigger impact on the VWAP than a smaller trade at the same price. 12 42. The Secretariat will need to discuss this option with the New Zealand Stock Exchange to determine how feasible this will be in practice. It is possible that the Exchange could publish on its website VWAPs for all listed shares on the Valuation Date. Recent transactions 43. For unlisted shares, a valuation based on the company’s most recent arm’s length commercial transaction in the last six months. 3.6 Revenue account property 44. The Secretariat notes that property that was already “revenue account property” will not need to be valued on Valuation Day. “Revenue account property” is defined in the Income Tax Act 2007, as property that: • is trading stock; or • if disposed of for valuable consideration, would give rise to income for the person under the Income Tax Act (with some exceptions). 45. Examples of revenue account property are, personal property acquired for the purpose of disposal, and land that is subject to the land provisions (for example land acquired for a building business, or used for a major development). 46. Revenue account property is already subject to tax on sale, with a deduction allowed for the “cost of revenue account property” (which is broadly the costs of acquiring or developing the asset) at the time of sale. Therefore, people who own revenue account property will already need to have a record of the relevant acquisition and other development costs. 47. People who hold revenue account property will continue to be taxed on the gain that has arisen over the whole period they have owned the property, and not just from Valuation Day. Example 6 – revenue account property In 2018, Penelope purchased a section of land in Tauranga with the intention of subdividing it into four sections and selling off the sections. Under the current law, Penelope will be taxed on the sale of the sections under s CB 12 (Disposal: Schemes for development or division begun within 10 years). Therefore, the land is revenue account property. Penelope is still in the process of developing the land on 1 April 2021 (Valuation Day). Penelope will not need to obtain a valuation of the land on Valuation Day. Instead, when Penelope sells the land she will be entitled to a deduction for the actual cost of acquiring the land, plus any development costs. 13 3.7 Default options 48. The Group might like to consider default valuation options which could be set for each kind of asset. These could operate either as mandatory valuation methods or as a backstop to all the other options for taxpayers who might not want to consider a range of options. For example, a default option for unlisted shares might be the straight-line method, whereas the default option for real property might be based on one of the RVs before and after Valuation Day, or the QV. 49. It is important to note that, if mandatory methods are not set, and the options available are seen as systematically under-valuing the property, the rules may incentivise taxpayers to incur valuation costs to increase their Valuation Day cost base. Equally, if mandatory methods are preferred, they would likely have to be generous to avoid an adverse public reaction. 14 4. The median rule 4.1 Application of the median rule 50. In Appendix B to the Group’s Interim Report, the Group proposed that a “median rule” could be used in calculating the eventual gain or loss when an asset is realised. The objective is to remove gains and losses that arose before Valuation Day but that have not actually arisen looking at the period of ownership as a whole (i.e. if an asset gains in value before valuation day then declines after this or vice versa). Using the median rule, the amount to be deducted from the sale price would be the median of: • the actual cost, including costs incurred both before and after Valuation Day; • the value on Valuation Day, plus costs incurred after Valuation Day; and • the sale price. Example 1 – median rule In 2014 Ben bought a rental property for $500,000. He hired a registered valuer to establish the market value of his property on Valuation Day. The valuer said the property was worth $650,000. Ben sold the property two years after Valuation Day for $800,000. Applying the median rule: Cost = $500,000 Valuation Day = $650,000 Sale price = $800,000 The median value is $650,000. Therefore, Ben is able to deduct $650,000 from the sale price of $800,000, giving rise to a $150,000 taxable gain. Example 2 – median rule with cost incurred before Valuation Day In 2014 Ben bought a rental property for $500,000. He spent $50,000 installing a new kitchen, and adding an extra bedroom. On Valuation Day the property was worth $450,000. Ben sold the property two years after Valuation Day for $900,000. Applying the median rule: Cost = $500,000 plus the $50,000 in capital costs incurred Valuation Day = $450,000 Sale price = $900,000 The median value is $550,000. Therefore, Ben is able to deduct $550,000 from the sale price of $900,000, giving rise to a $350,000 taxable gain. 51. The main benefit of a median rule is that it smooths out the artificial or paper gains or losses that can occur from imposing an arbitrary date on which assets must come into the tax base. In particular, it means that: 15 • a Valuation Day value which is higher than the actual cost and sale price will not create, or increase, a deductible loss because the value of the asset (e.g., a share) was unusually high on Valuation Day; and • a Valuation Day value which is lower than actual cost cannot increase a taxable gain above the actual gain, or turn an actual loss into a taxable gain. Example 3 – Valuation Day higher than actual cost Greg holds shares in an unlisted company, Task Limited, which he purchased for $5,000. On Valuation Day, based on an independent valuation, the shares are worth $8,000. Greg sells all the shares three years later for $5,500. Applying the median rule: Cost = $5,000 Valuation Day value = $8,000 Sale price = $5,500 The median value is $5,500. Therefore, Greg will have no capital gain on sale (ie, $5,500 less $5,500). Without the median rule, Greg would have a capital loss post Valuation Day of $2,500 (ie, sale price of $5,500 less Valuation Day value of $8,000). However, he has made a $500 gain since he originally purchased the shares. With the median rule, the large spike in the price of the shares is smoothed out, and his actual tax position is closer to his real position. Example 4 – Valuation Day lower than actual cost Greg holds shares in Task Limited, which he purchased for $5,000. On Valuation Day, based on an independent valuation, the shares are worth $3,000. Greg sells all the shares three years later for $5,500. Applying the median rule: Cost = $5,000 Valuation Day value = $3,000 Sale price = $5,500 The median value is $5,000. Therefore, Greg will have a capital gain on sale of $500 (ie, $5,500 less $5,000). Without the median rule, Greg would have a taxable capital gain post Valuation Day of $2,500 (ie, sale price of $5,500 less Valuation Day value of $3,000). However, he has only made a gain of $500. With the median rule, Greg’s taxable gain reflects his actual gain. 52. Where a person has incurred post-Valuation Day costs which have to be capitalised, those costs should also be taken into account, both in calculating the original cost, and in determining the Valuation Day value. This should generally ensure that the impending introduction of the tax does not affect decisions as to when capital expenditure is incurred. 16 Example 5 – costs incurred after Valuation day A person owns a building damaged by an earthquake. The cost of the building before the earthquake was $8 million. The value of the building immediately before the earthquake was $12 million. The earthquake reduced the value to $9 million. The owner intends to pay $3 million to bring the building up to code, which will restore the value to $12 million (ie, $9 million post-earthquake value plus $3 million remedial costs). The cost of the building should also be increased by the $3 million of remedial costs, resulting in a cost of $11 million. If this money is spent before the Valuation Day, then the value of the building on Valuation Day will be $12 million (ie, the remediated value). If the money is spent after the Valuation Day, then the valuation figure will be the $9 million valuation plus the $3 million of post-Valuation Day costs for a figure of $12 million. The tax treatment of any sale should be the same, regardless of when the repairs are done. 53. Even with a median rule, there is a risk from inaccurate Valuation Day valuations. If taxpayers artificially inflate the Valuation Day value, there would be no, or a reduced, taxable gain on a profitable sale (since the sale price would be the median price). However, Inland Revenue would be able to challenge the valuation under existing rules if they consider it to be unreasonably high. 54. The median rule also does not protect against an inaccurately low Valuation Day value which could result in unrealised gains on Valuation Day becoming subject to tax upon the asset’s sale. 55. Furthermore, while the median rule will be beneficial in protecting against paper gains or losses, a valuation of assets is still required on Valuation Day, which raises compliance cost issues. Limiting rule – Independent Advisor comment The Independent Advisor considers it is more intuitive to describe the median rule as a limiting rule by applying the following steps: a. Sale proceeds less valuation on Valuation Day. b. If a. is a gain and valuation is lower than cost, then the gain is reduced by difference between cost and valuation. c. If a. is a loss and valuation is higher than cost; loss is reduced by difference between valuation and cost. This is to be capped at zero. 4.3 Median rule for listed shares 56. Although the median rule could also be applied to listed shares, an alternative option the Secretariat recommends the Group to consider would be to exclude listed shares from the application of the median rule. This benefits of excluding listed shares from the operation of the median rule are: 17 • certainty of valuation; • incentive to sell and buy-back; and • effect on funds. 57. As listed shares have a certain value at any particular time the requirement to determine a valuation on Valuation Day will not require an estimated value. This means that any gains or losses derived or incurred before Valuation Day can be removed and only subsequent gains and losses, as opposed to an estimate of gains and losses, can be subject to tax. 58. The effect of imposing a median rule on a person with listed shares would be to incentivise them to sell all their shares that have increased in value on Valuation Day and buy them back. This would impose compliance costs without achieving any economic benefit. This is best explained by the examples below. Example 6 – listed shares that have increased in price In 2018 Ronnie purchased shares in A Co for $20 each. On Valuation Day the shares have risen in value to $50 each. If the median rule applies Ronnie will sell and buy-back the shares because: If the shares drop to $30 he will be able to access the $20 loss whereas if he had held the shares the whole period no loss would have been available under the median rule. If the shares increase to $60 he will be taxable on the $10 gain but this is the same as under the median rule. Example 7 – listed shares that have decreased in price In 2018 Ronnie purchased shares in A Co for $20 each. On Valuation Day the shares have decreased in value to $10 each. If the median rule applies Ronnie is always better off holding the shares (ie, not selling and buying back). If the shares drop to $7 a loss of $3 is available with or without the median rule If the shares increase to $13 a gain of $3 would be taxable without the median rule or no taxable gain with the median rule. If the shares increase to $25 a gain of $15 would be taxable without the median rule or $5 taxable gain with the median rule. 59. The net effect of these two examples is that, even if the rules were to attempt to impose the median rule on listed shares, in practice it would only be optional. It is also consistent with the view on roll-over that losses from listed shares should be ring-fenced because they are able to be easily “cherry picked”. 60. A fund will not want to apply the median rule as it would cause equity concerns between investors who bought shares before and after Valuation Day. 18 Example 8 – listed shares owned by a fund A managed fund bought shares before Valuation day for $1,000 which have increased to $1,500 on Valuation Day. Over the next month the shares decline to $1,200 but continue to be held by the fund. On Valuation Day Hayley buys 1% of the fund for $15 and sells out of the fund one month later for $12. Hayley expects to receive a $3 loss allocation from the fund for tax purposes. However, if the fund has applied the median rule the Valuation Day value is $1,200 so there is no taxable gain or loss that can be attributed to Hayley. Also, the Group is to consider at a future meeting whether accrual treatment is appropriate for managed funds. If that option is taken further, and the median rule remains in place for listed shares owned outside of funds, individuals who invest in funds are likely to be taxable on paper gains after valuation whereas direct investors would not be. 61. However, the Secretariat recognises that not using the median rule for listed shares will mean that investors would be subject to tax on paper gains (ie, where the share price is lower on Valuation Day than the actual cost and sale price of the shares, so that a person is taxed on a gain that they did not actually receive). The Independent Advisor’s preference is for the median rule to still apply to listed shares. As seen in the above example, without a median rule, paper gains will be taxed in the event that the market falls ahead of valuation day. 19 5. Valuing the “excluded home” 62. The Group has decided that a valuation will be required where there is a change of use of an “excluded home” (e.g. from an “excluded home” to a rental property or vice versa). The options in the previous chapters, including the median rule, could apply similarly when applied to a single change of use from an “excluded home” to a non-excluded home treating the date of change the same as a Valuation Day. Example 9 – house ceasing to be an excluded home In 2018 Chris buys a house for $500,000 which he lives in. On 1 April 2023 Chris buys a second house, which he moves into, and rents out his first house which now has a value of $750,000. On 31 March 2025 Chris sells the first house for $800,000. Applying the median rule: Cost = $500,000 Valuation on 1 April 2023 = $750,000 Sale price = $800,000 The median value is $750,000. Therefore, Chris is able to deduct $750,000 from the sale price of $800,000, giving rise to a $50,000 taxable gain. 63. Where a property changes use to an “excluded home” the median rule can also be used to determine the deemed sale price. This will mean any gain on sale will be capped at the overall gain on the sale, including the period it was an “excluded home”. Example 10 – house becomes an excluded home On 1 April 2021 Lucy buys a rental property for $500,000. On 1 April 2023 Lucy moves into the property and it becomes an excluded home. At this date the property is valued at $750,000. Lucy sells the property for $600,000 on 31 March 2025. Applying the median rule: Cost = $500,000 Valuation on 1 April 2023 = $750,000 Sale price = $600,000 The median value, to determine the deemed sale price, is $600,000. Lucy is able to deduct $500,000 from the deemed sale price of $600,000, giving rise to a $100,000 taxable gain. Without the median rule Lucy would have had a $250,000 taxable gain even though she sold the house for only $100,000 more than she paid for it. 64. Where there is more than one valuation, such as when a property is subject to two (or more) changes of use, the median rule cannot easily be applied as there are now more than three values and the relevant three to consider depend on their relative size. 65. It is, however, possible to apply general rules along the lines of the limiting rule described above which will follow the same principles as the median rule. This would be: 20 • A person is taxable on any change in the valuations during the period the property was not an excluded home; however: • Gains during the period the property was not an excluded home cannot exceed total gains over the period the property is owned. • Losses during the period the property was not an excluded home cannot exceed total losses over the period the property is owned. Example 11 – house changes use twice On 1 April 2021 Neil buys a house to live in for $500,000. On 1 April 2023 Neil moves to New York for a two-year sabbatical and rents his house out while he is away. His house is valued at $600,000. On 31 March 2025 Neil returns to live in his house which is now valued at $580,000. Neil eventually sells his house on 31 March 2030 for $800,000. Applying the median rule: Cost = $500,000 Valuation on 1 April 2023 = $600,000 Valuation on 1 April 2025 = $580,000 Sale price = $800,000 During the period the house was not an excluded home it decreased in value by $20,000. However, during the whole period of ownership the house increased in value by $300,000 therefore no taxable loss is available. 66. If the Group is concerned that applying a “valuation” approach to changes of use might lead to anomalous results, a better way to avoid these than using the median rule might be to reconsider the use of a time-based apportionment of actual gain or loss. 21 6. Conclusion and recommendations 6.1 Recommended approach 67. If the Group recommends an extension to the taxation of capital income, the Group has decided it would apply for all affected assets with effect from a Valuation Day. This approach was favoured because it reduces the lock-in effect which occurs in relation to assets acquired before the new rules are implemented. 68. It may not be necessary to specify in legislation how Valuation Day values are determined. Legislation could require taxpayers to determine a valuation and rely on guidance from Inland Revenue on appropriate methods. This method would provide greater flexibility for taxpayers to choose a method that best matches their circumstances. 69. The Secretariat recommends a list of valuation options that taxpayers can choose from, in order to balance compliance costs, simplicity and accurate valuations. 70. There are a number of different valuation options, some of which will apply more appropriately to certain asset classes. Options include: • Actual value – this will typically only apply to assets that have easily obtainable values such as listed shares. • Arm’s length valuation – this will generally be the most accurate but will require high compliance costs to obtain independent valuations. • Straight line – this may be best applied to difficult to value assets such as small businesses. 71. There are also options which apply specifically to real property: • Comparable properties – this could be done on a case-by-case basis or using an algorithm which are already commonly available (for example QV valuations). • Ratings valuation – this is easily obtainable but is likely to be inaccurate and public perception of that inaccuracy may be even greater. 72. The existing rules already require valuation of shares in a number of situations. Two methods which are already established are: • Volume weighted average price – this smooths out temporary fluctuations in asset value of listed shares immediately before Valuation Day. • Recent transactions – this may be suitable for unlisted shares when there has been a comparable transaction within a recent period such as six months. 73. Property that is already revenue account property will not need to be valued on Valuation Day as this property is already subject to tax on sale so values are already held. 22 6.2 Median rule 74. In Appendix B to the Group’s Interim Report, the Group proposed that a median rule could be used in calculating the eventual gain or loss when an asset is realised. The amount to be deducted from the sale price would be the median of: • the actual cost, including costs incurred both before and after Valuation Day; • the value on Valuation Day, plus costs incurred after Valuation Day; and • the sale price. 75. A median rule smooths out the artificial paper gains or losses that can occur from imposing an arbitrary date on which assets must come into the tax base. 76. The Secretariat recommends the Group consider excluding listed shares from the median rule, but note that the independent advisor’s preference is for the median rule to apply to all assets. 6.3 Valuing the family home at change-in-use date 77. The valuation rules outlined above could also be used in the event of a change in use from an “excluded home” to an income earning use or vice versa. However, where there are multiple changes in use the median rule is very complex to apply. Therefore, the Secretariat recommends general rules following the same principles. A simpler alternative that would also avoid valuations giving anomalous results would be to use a time-based apportionment of actual gain or loss. 6.4 Costs, benefits and risks of recommended approach 78. The use of a median rule will reduce the need for a loss ring-fencing rule as taxpayers will not be able to claim losses on assets that have a higher value on Valuation Day than their cost price or their sale price. 79. The median rule will also prevent taxpayers being subject to tax on artificial paper gains that arise only due to the value on Valuation Day being lower than the cost price and the sale price. This would remove one potentially controversial feature that could otherwise arise. 80. A range of options should be available for taxpayers to determine the value of assets on Valuation Day. This will allow taxpayers to choose the method that best matches their circumstances and balances the competing priorities of compliance costs, simplicity, certainty and accuracy. 81. It is important that some of the available methods are perceived as arriving at a reasonable valuation without incurring significant compliance costs. If this is not the case taxpayers will be required to obtain independent valuations which may 23 place an unmanageable burden on valuers, and unreasonable compliance costs on taxpayers. 82. The Secretariat would prefer to err on the side of more liberal rules that do not achieve absolute accuracy, than on less liberal rules that give rise to unreasonable costs for taxpayers or effectively move unrealised gains from prior to Valuation Day into the tax base. 24 Appendix A: Suggested text for Final Report Valuation Day 1. The Group proposes that all assets covered by an extension of the taxation of capital income should be brought into the base with effect from a Valuation Day. This approach is favoured because it reduces the lock-in effect which occurs in relation to assets acquired before the new rules are implemented. Valuation options 2. It is important that some of the available methods are perceived as arriving at a reasonable valuation without incurring significant compliance costs. If this is not the case taxpayers will be required to obtain independent valuations which will place an unmanageable burden on valuers, and unreasonable compliance costs on taxpayers. 3. Current tax legislation which refers to “value” is generally not prescriptive about how to ascertain the value, but instead that ‘void’ is filled by guidance issued by Inland Revenue. This guidance provides taxpayers with safe harbour valuation methodologies which the Commissioner will accept, and what information the taxpayer should retain to support the valuation. 4. The Group proposes that Inland Revenue should publish guidance on what valuation methods the Commissioner would find acceptable for the various classes of assets that would be brought into the tax base on Valuation Day. 5. There are a number of different valuation options, some of which will apply more appropriately to certain asset classes. Options include: • Actual value – this will typically only apply to assets that have easily obtainable values such as listed shares. • Arm’s length valuation – this will generally be the most accurate but will require higher compliance costs to obtain independent valuations. • Straight line – this may be best applied to difficult to value assets such as small businesses. 6. There are also options which apply specifically to real property: • Comparable properties – this could be done on a case-by-case basis or using an algorithm which are already commonly available (for example QV valuations). • Ratings valuation (RV) – this is easily obtainable but may be inaccurate depending on when it was last updated. • Placeholder for Māori freehold land – \[To be determined after the session on Māori assets\]. 25 7. The existing rules already require valuation of shares in a number of situations. Two methods which are already established are: • Volume weighted average price (VWAP) 3 – this would smooth out temporary fluctuations in asset value immediately before Valuation Day. • Recent transactions – this may be suitable when there has been a comparable transaction within a recent period such as six months. 8. Property that is already revenue account property 4 will not need to be valued on Valuation Day as this property is already subject to tax on sale so values are already held. 9. Default valuation options could be set for each kind of asset. These would operate as a backstop to all the other options for taxpayers who might not want to consider a range of options. Median rule 10. The Group proposes that a median rule should be applied to all affected assets, except for listed shares, to calculate the eventual gain or loss when an asset is realised. Using the median rule, the amount to be deducted from the sale price would be the median of: • the actual cost, including costs incurred both before and after Valuation Day; • the value on Valuation Day, plus costs incurred after Valuation Day; and • the sale price 11. The median rule will smooth capital income to prevent taxpayers being subject to tax on artificial paper gains (or losses) that arise only due to the value on Valuation Day being lower (or higher) than the cost price and the sale price. 3 VWAP calculates the average price of an asset based on all sales over a set period, such as five days. This is weighted by the size of the trades so that a large trade has a bigger impact on the average price than a smaller trade at the same price. 4 Revenue account property is defined in the Income Tax Act 2007, as property that: • is trading stock; or • if disposed of for valuable consideration, would give rise to income for the person under the Income Tax Act (with some exceptions). 26 Example 1 – median rule In 2014 Ben bought a rental property for $500,000. He hired a registered valuer to establish the market value of his property on Valuation Day. The valuer said the property was worth $650,000. Ben sold the property two years after Valuation Day for $800,000. Applying the median rule: Cost = $500,000 Valuation Day = $650,000 Sale price = $800,000 The median value is $650,000. Therefore, Ben is able to deduct $650,000 from the sale price of $800,000, giving rise to a $150,000 taxable gain. Example 2 – median rule with cost incurred before Valuation Day In 2014 Ben bought a rental property for $500,000. He spent $50,000 installing a new kitchen, and adding an extra bedroom. On Valuation Day the property was worth $450,000. Ben sold the property two years after Valuation Day for $900,000. Applying the median rule: Cost = $500,000 plus the $50,000 in capital costs incurred Valuation Day = $450,000 Sale price = $900,000 The median value is $550,000. Therefore, Ben is able to deduct $550,000 from the sale price of $900,000, giving rise to a $350,000 taxable gain. 12. The Group proposes that the requirement to determine a value on Valuation Day under the median rule is included in legislation and that Inland Revenue issues guidance on appropriate valuation methods. Valuing the family home at a change-in-use date 13. As discussed above, the Group proposes that a valuation will be required where a house changes use from an “excluded home” to an income earning use, or vice versa. When there is a single change of use the median rule would apply. 27 Example 1 – house ceasing to be an excluded home In 2018 Chris buys a house for $500,000 which he lives in. On 1 April 2023 Chris buys a second house which he moves into and rents out his first house which now has a value of $750,000. On 31 March 2025 Chris sells the first house for $800,000. Applying the median rule: Cost = $500,000 Valuation on 1 April 2023 = $750,000 Sale price = $800,000 The median value is $750,000. Therefore, Chris is able to deduct $750,000 from the sale price of $800,000, giving rise to a $50,000 taxable gain. 14. Where a house changes to an excluded home the median rule can also be used to determine the deemed sale price. This will mean any gain on the deemed sale will be capped at the overall gain on the sale including the period it was an “excluded home”. Example 2 – house becomes an excluded home On 1 April 2021 Lucy buys a rental property for $500,000. On 1 April 2023 Lucy moves into the property and it becomes an excluded home. At this date the property is valued at $750,000. Lucy sells the property for $600,000 on 31 March 2025 Applying the median rule: Cost = $500,000 Valuation on 1 April 2023 = $750,000 Sale price = $600,000 The median value, to determine the deemed sale price, is $600,000. Lucy is able to deduct $500,000 from the deemed sale price of $600,000, giving rise to a $100,000 taxable gain. Without the median rule Lucy would have had a $250,000 taxable gain even though she sold the house for only $100,000 more than she paid for it. 15. Where more than one valuation is needed, such as when a property is subject to two (or more) changes of use, the median rule cannot easily be applied as there are now more than three values and the relevant three to consider depend on their relative size. 16. Instead a limiting rule would apply. This would work as follows: • A person is taxable on any change in the valuations during the period the property was not an “excluded home”; however: • Gains during the period the property was not an “excluded home” cannot exceed total gains over the period the property is owned. • Losses during the period the property was not an “excluded home” cannot exceed total losses over the period the property is owned. 28 Example 3 – house changes use twice On 1 April 2021 Neil buys a house to live in for $500,000. On 1 April 2023 Neil moves to New York for a two-year sabbatical and rents his house out while he is away. His house is valued at $600,000. On 31 March 2025 Neil returns to live in his house which is now valued at $580,000. Neil eventually sells his house on 31 March 2030 for $800,000. Applying the median rule: Cost = $500,000 Valuation on 1 April 2023 = $600,000 Valuation on 1 April 2025 = $580,000 Sale price = $800,000 During the period the house was not an excluded home it decreased in value by $20,000. However, during the whole period of ownership the house increased in value by $300,000 therefore no taxable loss is available. 29 Appendix B: Commissioner’s Statement CS 17/01 Determining “value” of shares received by an employee under a share purchase agreement The purpose of a Commissioner’s Statement is to inform taxpayers of the Commissioner’s position and the operational approach being adopted on a particular tax matter. A Commissioner’s Statement is not a consultative document. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (“the Act”). Introduction 1. Changes to the Income Tax Act 2007, which came into force on 1 April 2017, 5 introduce new reporting rules for employers when shares are issued 6 to employees pursuant to a share purchase agreement (“SPA”). 2. The new reporting rules require employers to report the value of any share benefit received by an employee under an SPA in the relevant employer monthly schedule (“EMS”) for which the share benefit arises. In addition, the new rules also allow employers to elect to withhold PAYE on share benefits received by employees. 3. In order to comply with the new obligations, an employer will need to determine the value of the share benefit received by each employee under an SPA. 4. Having regard to the requirements of the law, valuation uncertainties and employer compliance costs, the Commissioner will accept the methods of valuation set out in this Statement provided that the SPA is conducted on arm’s length commercial terms. 5. While this Statement provides taxpayers with safe harbour valuation methodologies which the Commissioner will accept, this Statement will not apply to any arrangements which are subject to any anti-avoidance provisions in the Act. 6. This Statement also provides guidance in regard to the information the company3 7 should retain to support the valuation (in addition to any constitutional and Companies Act 1993 requirements). 7. This guidance relates to the new provisions and any other aspects of the current provisions relating to the valuation of shares acquired by an employee under an SPA. 5 The Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Act 2016. 6 Note that the phrase “shares are issued” refers to shares (or rights to shares) which are issued or transferred to an employee. 7 Please note that “company” refers to the employing company even if the shares in question are issued or transferred to the employee by another entity. 30 8. This Statement is not intended to provide a definitive and comprehensive set of valuation techniques, and so companies may still apply other valuation methodologies that determine the value of the share benefit. If another valuation methodology is used by a company, the valuation must reflect the market value of the shares on the acquisition date. Employment Income 9. Benefits received by an employee under an SPA are employment income. 10. An SPA is defined in section CE 7 of the Act as: ...an agreement to dispose of or issue shares in a company to an employee that is entered into in connection with the employee’s employment or service, whether or not an employment relationship exists when the employee receives a benefit under the agreement. 11. An SPA involves the acquisition of shares in a company by an employee (or another person for the benefit of an employee). These cover a wide range of share schemes and may involve the immediate transfer of shares, the granting of share options or deferred share schemes where shares vest or are transferred at a later date. 12. A taxable share benefit arises when an employee acquires shares under an SPA and the amount paid by the employee for the shares is less than the market value of the shares. 13. Section CE 2 of the Act determines the value of the benefit the employee receives and the allocation of the benefit to a particular year. 14. Section CE 6 of the Act outlines when shares are acquired by an employee (“acquisition date”) under an SPA. 15. Section CE 6(2) provides that, for the purposes of sections CE 2 to CE 4 and CE 7: (a) shares are treated as having been acquired on the date on which the right or option to acquire them is exercised; and (b) if shares or rights are acquired or transferred under an agreement by a trustee for the benefit of an employee to whom section CE 2 applies, the employee is treated as having acquired or transferred the shares or rights. 16. The obligation to report the value of a share benefit and the election to withhold PAYE is limited to share benefits arising under sections CE 2(2) and CE 2(4) of the Act. 17. Section CE 2(2) relates to shares acquired by an employee under an SPA: If an employee acquires shares under a share purchase agreement, the value of the benefit to the employee is the amount by which the value of the shares when they were acquired is more than the amount paid or payable for them. The employee receives the benefit in the income year in which they acquire the shares. 31 18. Section CE 2(4) relates to shares acquired by an associated person of the employee under an SPA: If, following 1 or more transactions between associated persons, an associated person acquires the shares under a share purchase agreement, the value of the benefit is the difference between the value of the shares on the date of acquisition by the associated person and the amount paid or payable for them. If the difference is negative, the value is zero. The employee receives the benefit in the income year in which the associated person acquires the shares. Value of Share Benefit 19. In order to determine the value of the share benefit arising for an employee or associated person, an employer will need to determine the following: • The value of shares on acquisition date; and • The amount paid or payable for them. 20. The Act does not define “value”, nor does it prescribe any methods for determining the value of shares acquired under an SPA. 21. The Commissioner considers the term “value” for the purpose of section CE 2 refers to the market value amount at which the shares would be exchanged between two non-associated third parties, on an arm’s length basis. This value is required to be determined even if the shares cannot be sold or there is no market for the shares. 22. For completeness, the definition of “market value” in section YA 1 does not apply to this Statement. Acceptable Valuation Methods 23. Where the company adopts one of the methods outlined in this Statement and retains the necessary documentation to support the valuation, the Commissioner will accept the share value and therefore the benefit ascribed to the employee under section CE 2. 24. Absolute accuracy is not expected in all scenarios (as accuracy depends in part to the data sets available and in some situations on subjective judgement), but it is expected that a reasonable, appropriate process is followed when determining the share value at the time the shares are issued. 25. It is also expected that the valuation method and any input assumptions used to prepare the valuation should be fully documented and retained as the Commissioner may request to examine the documentation. 26. Where a company adopts a method not outlined in this Statement, the company should retain the documentation outlining the reasons for adopting the alternative method as the Commissioner may request to examine the documentation. 32 27. The methods which the Commissioner will accept will depend on the type of shares issued to the employee under an SPA – shares in a listed company; shares in an unlisted company; or shares in an unlisted start-up company. 28. Outlined below are the methods the Commissioner will a ccept for the three types of shares. Listed Shares 29. Where the company issuing shares to an employee has shares listed on a “recognised exchange” the Commissioner will accept the share value reached (applicable to the class of shares, and any rights attaching to them, to which an SPA applies) using one of the following methods: • Option A: Volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) over the last five trading days (including the acquisition date) for the listed share; or • Option B: Closing Price of listed share on the acquisition date; or • Option C: If on the acquisition date the employee disposes of the shares at market value on a recognised exchange, the actual proceeds of sale on that date and, if the proceeds of sale are in a foreign currency, the New Zealand Dollar equivalent by applying the close of trading spot price exchange rate on the sale date. Recognised Exchange 30. A recognised exchange is defined in section YA 1. 31. Outlined below are the relevant factors included in the section YA 1 definition: • A recognised exchange market in New Zealand or anywhere else in the world which has the following features: • the exchange market brings together buyers and sellers of shares or options over shares; and • the exchange market involves the listing of prices, whether by electronic media or other means, at which persons are willing to buy or sell shares or options; and • the exchange market provides a medium for the determination of arm’s length prices likely to prove fair and reasonable, having regard to— • the number of participants in the market or having access to the market; and • the frequency of trading in the market; and • the nature of trading in the market, including how prices are determined and transactions are effected; and 33 • the potential or demonstrated capacity of a person or persons significantly to influence the market; and • any significant barriers to entry to the market; and • any discrimination on the basis of quantity bought and sold unless based on the risks involved, the transaction costs, or economies of scale Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) 32. The VWAP for a share is calculated by adding up the dollars traded for every transaction relating to that share (price multiplied by number of shares traded) and then dividing by the total shares traded for the day. Example: VWAP for ABC Limited over a 5 day trading period. Company ABC’s shares are traded on the NZX. ABC Ltd issues shares to its employees on Friday 13 January. Based on information obtained from the NZX, the following ABC shares were traded over the previous five trading days (including the acquisition date) - Monday 9 January to Friday 13 January: Date Number of Shares Volume Weighted Daily Price 9 January 5,000 $2.00 10 January Nil n/a 11 January 4,000 $1.98 12 January 10,000 $2.05 13 January Nil n/a The VWAP is calculated as follows: (5,000 x $2.00) + (4,000 x $1.98) + (10,000 x $2.05) 19,000 = $2.02 The value of the shares issued to ABC’s employees on 13 January is $2.02. Foreign Listed Shares 33. If the shares are not listed in New Zealand but are listed on one or more overseas recognised exchanges, the foreign value determined in accordance with the above options will need to be converted to its New Zealand Dollar equivalent by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the acquisition date of the shares by the employee. 34. If the shares are listed on more than one recognised exchange (including for an employee not resident in New Zealand or dually resident here, a recognised exchange in the employee’s normal country of residence) the listed price should 34 be based firstly on the recognised exchanges in the employee’s country of residence, or, if that is not applicable, on the average of all the listed prices as converted to New Zealand dollars. Newly Listed Company 35. Shares issued to employees as part of an initial public offering (“IPO”) by a newly listed company should be valued using the published offer price for the IPO. 36. The published offer price is the price included in the retail offer documentation. If the shares are only offered to non-retail investors (e.g. institutional buyers, fund managers) the volume weighted average purchase price of the investors should be utilised pursuant to the relevant offer documentation. 37. If there has been no arm’s length trading of the newly listed shares, the published offer price can be used for shares issued to employees after the date of the IPO for a period not exceeding six months (unless there are material changes to the assumptions used to calculate the offer price). Information Requirements 38. The company should retain information that can support the share value and method, being able to supply the relevant documentation to the Commissioner on request. The following information should be retained: • If Option A is used, VWAP calculation and supporting listed price data; or • If Option B is used, closing market listed price data; or • If Option C is used, documents evidencing the sale and currency conversion and, where an independent third party undertakes the sale and any subsequent conversion of the proceeds to New Zealand Dollars, that third party’s advice of the New Zealand Dollar equivalent of the transaction will suffice; or • If newly listed shares, published offer price; or • If foreign listed shares, relevant offer or listed price data and the spot FX rate used. Unlisted Shares 39. Where the company issuing shares to an employee has unlisted shares (not including a start-up company which is defined for the purposes of this guidance below) the Commissioner will accept the share value reached (applicable to the class of shares, and any rights attaching to them, to which an SPA applies) using one of the following methods: 35 • Option A: An arm’s length value determined by an independent, suitably qualified valuer which conforms with generally accepted practice 8 ; or • Option B: A valuation (based on the company’s most recent arm’s length commercial transaction in the last six months prior to the acquisition date) involving the issue or sale of the same class of shares to a non-associated third party (for example, a previous capital raising or sale of a parcel of shares) where, if new shares are being issued to employees the valuation is adjusted for dilution of existing shares; or • Option C: A valuation method prepared by an appropriate person in the company using an appropriate method (this option and the requirements to use this option is explained further below). Dilution Effect When Issuing New Shares 40. All methods should take into account the diluting effect of issuing new shares to employees, particularly if using Option B. Example: Company A has previously issued 1m shares to non-associated third parties for $1m. Subsequently, Company A issues 100,000 new shares to employees for no consideration. The value of the shares will be calculated as follows: Total consideration paid for shares issued $1m / total shares issued 1.1m = $0.91 per share. Foreign Company 41. If the unlisted shares are held in a foreign company, the foreign value determined in accordance with the above options will need to be converted to its New Zealand Dollar equivalent by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the acquisition date of the shares by the employee. Previous Valuation 42. The Commissioner will accept a value based on the most recent valuation prepared by a company using option A, B or C if: • The valuation is for the same class of shares as the shares issued to the employee; and • The valuation was prepared within a period not exceeding six months prior to the acquisition date of the shares by the employee. 43. This Statement will not apply where a company uses a previous valuation and adjustments are made to the original share value resulting in a lower value 8 For the purposes of paragraphs 39 and 50, “generally accepted practice” means a valuation prepared under AES-2 (Business Valuation Engagements) issued by CA ANZ or an equivalent valuation engagement standard. 36 (discounting). This Statement will also not apply where the previous valuation relates to shares of a different class to the shares issued under the SPA. Information Requirements 44. The company should retain information that can support the share value and method, being able to supply the relevant documentation to the Commissioner on request. The following information should be retained: 45. If Option A is used: • A copy of the independent valuation report received by the company. 46. If Option B is used: • Documentation supporting the value of the shares issued or sold to the non- associated third party (for example, copy of sale and purchase agreement or capital raising documentation); and • Confirmation the shares are of the same class; and • Approval of the valuation in writing by one member of the Board of Directors or the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Executive Officer of the company confirming that in their opinion the valuation reflects the market value of the shares issued to the employee at the taxing date. 47. If Option C is used, refer to detailed information requirements below. Option C: Internally Prepared Valuation Requirements 48. If a valuation is prepared internally by the company, the company should retain all the following information: • A copy of the internally prepared valuation; • That the valuation was prepared by a person employed by the company who has the necessary financial skills, qualification and experience to prepare a valuation; • That the valuation is based on an appropriate method. The Commissioner considers the following methods are appropriate methods: • Discounted Cash Flow (DCF); or • Capitalisation of Earnings; • Contemporaneous documentation supporting all workings, input assumptions and comparable data used to prepare the valuation. This should include the following information (where applicable): • Financial information used to determine earnings (for capitalisation of earnings method) or future cash flows (for DCF method), including (but not limited to): 37 • prior year financial statements; • current operating results; • cash flows and future oriented financial information such as budgets, forecasts and projections; • Documentation supporting any normalising adjustments; • Documentation supporting discount rates; • Documentation supporting capitalisation rates or earnings multiples (including any comparable data used to determine earnings multiples); • Reasoning and support for any discounts or premiums; • That the valuation has been approved in writing by one member of the Board of Directors or the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Executive Officer of the company confirming that in their opinion the valuation reflects the market value of the shares issued to the employee on the acquisition date or alternatively, that the valuation has been reviewed and agreed with by an independent, suitably qualified valuer appointed or instructed by the Board of Directors; • A copy of the independent valuation opinion (if applicable). Shares in an Unlisted Start-up Company 49. The following approach can be applied where the company issuing shares to an employee is a start-up company. This generally means a company which: • is in the first stage of its operations; and • initially financed and operated by founding shareholders or investors; and • has not paid any dividends; and • its expenses tend to exceed their revenues and may be yet to produce a profit; and • tend to have very low net tangible assets; and • may have a high level of expended research and development costs relative to its tangible assets value; and • does not yet have a stable market for its product or service. 50. The Commissioner will accept the following methods for valuing start-up company shares: • Option A: An arm’s length value determined by an independent, suitably qualified valuer which conforms with generally accepted practice; or • Option B: A valuation (based on the company’s most recent arm’s length commercial transaction in the last 12 months prior to the acquisition date) involving a share issue or sale of the same class of shares to a non-associated 38 third party (for example, a previous capital raising or sale of a parcel of shares) where, if new shares are being issued to employees the valuation is adjusted for dilution of existing shares; or • Option C: A valuation method prepared by an appropriate person in the company using an appropriate method (this option and the requirements to use this option is explained further below). Option C will not be available if the company has a previous valuation under Option A or a recent issue/sale of shares under Option B. Venture Capital Funding 51. Given the complexities associated with share valuations for venture capital funding rounds, this Statement will not apply to a company with a current or proposed (i.e. is intended to take place within six months of acquisition date of shares by employee) venture capital funding round. 9 The company should obtain a separate arm’s length valuation for any shares issued to employees under an SPA where venture capital funding is involved. Previous Valuation 52. The Commissioner will accept a value based on the most recent valuation prepared by a company using option A, B or C if: • The valuation is for the same class of shares as the shares issued to the employee; and • The valuation was prepared within a period not exceeding 12 months prior to the acquisition date of the shares by the employee. 53. This Statement will not apply where a company uses a previous valuation and adjustments are made to the original share value resulting in a lower value. This Statement will also not apply where the previous valuation relates to shares of a different class to the shares issued under the SPA. Information Requirements 54. The company should retain information that can support the share value and method, being able to supply the relevant documentation to the Commissioner on request. The following information should be retained: 55. If Option A is used: • A copy of the independent valuation report received by the company. 56. If Option B is used: 9 Venture capital funding round means funding by a venture capital fund or firm (including Series A funding rounds). It does not include seed funding from private investors. 39 • Documentation supporting the value of the shares issued or sold to the non- associated third party (for example, copy of sale and purchase agreement or capital raising documentation); and • Confirmation that the shares sold to the non-associated third party are of the same class as SPA shares and have the same rights attached to them; and • Approval of the valuation in writing by one member of the Board of Directors or the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Executive Officer of the company confirming that in their opinion the valuation reflects the market value of the shares issued to the employee at the taxing date. 57. If Option C is used, refer to detailed information requirements below. Option C: Internally Prepared Valuation Requirements 58. If a valuation is prepared internally by the company, the company should retain all the following information: • A copy of the internally prepared valuation; • That the valuation was prepared by a person employed by the company who has the necessary financial skills, qualification and experience to prepare a valuation; • That the valuation is based on an appropriate method. The Commissioner considers the following methods are appropriate methods: • Discounted Cash Flow (DCF); • Contemporaneous documentation supporting all workings, input assumptions and comparable data used to prepare the valuation. This should include the following information (where applicable): • Financial information used to determine future cash flows including (but not limited to): • prior year financial statements; • current operating results; • cash flows and future oriented financial information such as budgets, forecasts and projections; • Documentation supporting any normalising adjustments; • Documentation supporting discount rates; • Documentation supporting capitalisation rates; • Reasoning and support for any discounts or premiums; • That the valuation has been approved in writing by one member of the Board of Directors or the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Executive Officer of the company confirming that in their opinion the valuation reflects the market value of the shares issued to the employee on the acquisition date or 40 alternatively, that the valuation has been reviewed and agreed with by an independent, suitably qualified valuer appointed or instructed by the Board of Directors; • A copy of the independent valuation opinion (if applicable). Application 59. This Statement provides general guidance to assist taxpayers in meeting their tax obligations. This approach can be used by taxpayers for, and will be applied by the Commissioner to, shares acquired by employees on or after 1 April 2017. 60. If you have any concerns about your compliance with the tax obligations discussed in this Statement, you should discuss the matter with an appropriately qualified tax professional. Graham Tubb Group Tax Counsel Date of Issue: 28 April 2017 41 Appendix C: Other countries 1. This appendix outlines how some other countries addressed value on their Valuation Day. Canada 2. Taxation of capital gains was introduced in 1972. On Valuation Day, a cost base had to be established for all capital assets. Taxpayers had to use one of the following two methods to determine the cost of their non-depreciable assets for capital gains purposes: • fair market value; or • the cost under the “median rule”. 3. Once a method was chosen to calculate the capital gain or loss resulting from the first disposition of capital property, the same method has to be used for all dispositions of such property. 4. The median rule set out that the cost of an assets was the middle figure of: • proceeds of disposition; • Valuation Day value; and • actual original cost. 5. For publicly traded stock, a list was published of the closing stock prices on the day before the tax was introduced. An individual holding publicly traded stock could choose to use that price, or the median rule, but if they chose the actual price method, they had to use it for all their publicly traded securities. Ireland 6. Taxation of capital gains was introduced in 1974. A “market value” rule was used. The basic rule underlying this was that the market value was the price which an asset might reasonably be expected to fetch on a sale on the open market. 7. The cost base for shares owned prior to Valuation Day was the price quoted on the stock exchange. 8. There is case law to help guide what is meant by “market value”. The principles from the case law are as follows: • The expected sale price is the price agreed on by persons aware of all relevant details. • In determining the value any reluctance of owner to part with the asset on that date should be disregarded. 42 • Open market includes all potential purchasers. 9. A “Valuation Guide” was created to provide guidance on possible methods/considerations to value unlisted shares based on: • earnings; • assets; • turnover fees or commissions; • control of a company; and • different classes of shares. South Africa 10. Taxation of capital gains was introduced in 2001. In order to ensure the part of the gain or loss which related to the period before the tax was introduced was excluded, a value had to be determined for the asset as at the date the tax was introduced. 11. Taxpayers could use one of the following methods to determine the valuation date value of the asset: • 20% × (proceeds less allowable expenditure incurred on or after 1 October 2001). This method would typically be used when no records have been kept and no valuation was obtained at 1 October 2001. • Market value of the asset as at 1 October 2001. In order to use this method the person must have valued their asset on or before 30 September 2004 except in the case of certain assets whose prices were published in the Government Gazette, such as South African-listed shares or participatory interests in collective investment schemes. • Time-apportionment base cost method. This is a method of calculating the value of the asset based on how long the person has owned it before, and on or after 1 October 2001. 12. For unlisted shares a “Tax Guide for Share Owners” was created to assist in determining the base cost of shares acquired before 1 October 2001 (Valuation Day), based on: • the market value on Valuation Day; • time apportionment; or • 20% of proceeds after first deducting post-CGT costs. 13. The market value is the price a willing buyer would pay a willing seller if dealing at arm’s length in the open market. Case law has provided suggestions of methods that can be used to determine the “market value” including: 43 • net asset value method; • income approach, which seeks to estimate the flow of revenue that the company will generate in the future; and • the discounted cash-flow method, which entails valuing the business in question on the basis of its forecast future cash flow, discounted back to present-day values through the application of a discount factor.
