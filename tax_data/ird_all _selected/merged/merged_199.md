QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 15/13 INCOME TAX – WHETHER THE COST OF ACQUIRING AN OPTION TO ACQUIRE REVENUE ACCOUNT LAND IS DEDUCTIBLE All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about s DB 23 and the financial arrangements rules (the FA rules). Question 1. Where revenue account land is acquired through the exercise of an option, is the cost of acquiring the option deductible? Answer 2. Yes, the cost of acquiring the option is deductible as follows: • If the FA rules apply to the option (and consequent agreement for sale and purchase of the land), the cost of the option and the other consideration for the land are in effect deductible. Those costs will be taken into account under the FA rules, and the FA rules will then establish the cost base of the land, which will be deductible under s DB 23 on the ultimate sale of the land. • Where the FA rules do not apply, the cost of acquiring the option is deductible under s DB 23 because it is part of the cost of acquiring the revenue account land (together with the other consideration for the land). \[Note: throughout this QWBA, references to deductibility under s DB 6 or s DB 2 3 are subject to the general permission being satisfied, and no general limitation (excluding the capital limitation) applying.\] 3. The FA rules will apply unless the option is a short-term option to acquire land, or was granted to the person for a private or domestic purpose. 1 However, the FA rules will apply in those situations if the option is part of a wider financial arrangement. See further from \[14\] on deductibility where the FA rules apply. 4. If the FA rules do not apply, the only question is whether the cost of the option is part of the cost of the revenue account land. The Commissioner considers that it is , as it is part of what is outlaid in order to acquire the underlying land. See further from \[ 21\] on deductibility under s DB 23. 5. If the FA rules apply, the deduction of the cost of the revenue account land may be partly taken through the operation of those rules, and partly taken under s DB 23. The deduction under s DB 23 would be allocated to the income year in which the person disposes of the property. 6. This QWBA also considers the deductibility of the cost of an option that is itself on revenue account – see further from \[39\]. 7. The following flowchart shows how the cost of revenue account land acquired through the exercise of an option is deductible: 1 Where certain criteria are met – see \[15\]. 1 Explanation Background 8. The question we have been asked is whether the cost of acquiring an option to acquire revenue account land is deductible. 9. The question has arisen in the context of the enactment of s CB 15B, which concerns the timing of acquisition of land for the purposes of subpart CB of the Act. 2 The question is not about the application of s CB 15B as such. However, it has been suggested that s CB 15B requires the separate consideration of different estates or interests in, or options to acquire estates or interests in, the same underlying physical land. As a consequence, it has been suggested that the cost of acquiring an option (which is itself “land” for the purposes of the Act) will only be deductible if the option is revenue account property. 2 It is noted that as at the time of publication, there is a proposal for the introduction of a new legislative provision in subpart CB, for which there may be a different time of acquisition rule. No Yes 1 Except in the case of a short-term option that the person has elected to treat as an FA. Yes No No Yes The FA rules apply Was the option granted for a private or domestic purpose? (see \[15\]) Deduction available through a combination of: •Being taken into account under a spreading method and/or the base price adjustment; and •Section DB 23 deduction for the cost of the land (adjusted cost base if there has been income under the FA rules – ss EW 32 and EW 35). (See further \[20\]) How is the cost of revenue account land acquired through the exercise of an option deductible? Is the option a short-term option? (see \[15\]) Deduction available under s DB 23 2 The FA rules do not apply 1 2 Subject to the general permission and the general limitations (except the capital limitation). Is the option part of a wider financial arrangement? 2 Revenue account property 10. Section YA 1 defines “revenue account property” (relevantly) as: YA 1 Definitions In this Act, unless the context requires otherwise,— ... revenue account property, for a person, means property that— (a) is trading stock of the person: (b) if disposed of for valuable consideration, would produce income for the person other than income under section EE 48 (Effect of disposal or event), FA 5 (Assets acquired or disposed of after deductions of payments under lease), or FA 9 (Treatment when lease ends: lessee acquiring asset): ... \[Emphasis added\] 11. There are a number of provisions in subpart CB of the Act which include as income amounts derived by a person from disposing of land. For example, an amount will be income if derived from disposing of land: • that was acquired with an intention or purpose of disposing of it (s CB 6); • that was acquired by a person (or someone associated with them) for the purpose of a business of dealing in land, developing land, dividing land into lots, or erecting buildings 3 (s CB 7); or • within 10 years of its acquisition, if at the time of acquisition the person was (or was associated with someone who was) in the business of dealing in land, or developing or dividing land (ss CB 9 and CB 10); or • within 10 years of the completion of improvements to the land, if at the time the land was acquired the person was (or was associated with someone who was) in the business of erecting buildings (s CB 11); or • that was part of an undertaking or scheme, meeting certain criteria, that involved the development of land or the division of land into lots (ss CB 12 and CB 13). Land can therefore be held as “revenue account property”. Deduction for the cost of revenue account property 12. Section DB 23 allows a deduction for expenditure incurred as the cost of revenue account property. However, if the FA rules apply, they will determine what the cost of the property is regarded as being for the purposes of s DB 23 (see ss EW 2(2)(d) and EW 35). 13. An option (and any consequent agreement for sale and purchase of the land) may be a “financial arrangement” to which the FA rules apply. If it is, the application of the FA rules, which calculate and spread income and expenditure over the term of the financial arrangement, may give rise to income or expenditure. As noted above, the FA rules will then determine what the cost of the property is regarded as being for the purposes of s DB 23 (see ss EW 2(2)(d) and EW 35). 3 I f the business is of erecting buildings, the provision also requires that the person, or the associated person, has made improvements to the land – either before or after acquiring it. 3 Do the financial arrangements rules apply? 14. The FA rules override any other provision relating to the timing or quantification of income or expenditure under a financial arrangement, unless the other provision expressly or by necessary implication requires otherwise (s EW 2 ). An option to acquire land, and any consequent agreement for sale and purchase of the land, will be a financial arrangement unless it is an excepted financial arrangement (see ss EW 3 and EW 4(3), and the definition of “specified option” in s YA 1). Therefore, in considering the deductibility of the cost of acquiring an option to acquire land, it is necessary to first consider whether the FA rules apply, and what their effect is. 15. As noted above, an option to acquire land, and any consequent agreement for sale and purchase of the land, may be a “financial arrangement” to which the FA rules apply. However, the option and agreement for sale and purchase (a “specified option”, as noted above) will not be a financial arrangement if it is either: • granted to the person, for a private or domestic purpose, where: - the purchase price for the land is less than $1m; and - the option requires settlement of the property, if an agreement is entered into as a result of the exercise of the option, to take place on or before the 365 th day after the date on which the option is granted. OR • A short-term option – which is: - an option under which settlement must take place on or before the 93 rd day after the date on which the option is entered into; or - if that date cannot be established, an option under which settlement must take place before the 93 rd day after the earlier of the date on which the buyer first makes a payment to the seller and the date on which the first right in the property is transferred, (though such an option will be a financial arrangement for a party who makes an election under s EW 8 to treat it as one). 16. In either of the above situations, the “specified option” will be an excepted financial arrangement. However, an excepted financial arrangement may be part of a wider financial arrangement. Generally, amounts that are solely attributable to excepted financial arrangements are not taken into account under the FA rules. However, in either of the above situations, if the specified option is part of a wider financial arrangement, any amount solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangement will need to be taken into account under the FA rules (s EW 6(3)). 17. Therefore, if an option (and any consequent agreement for sale and purchase of the land) falls into one of the above two categories, the deductibility of the cost of the option (together with the other consideration for the land) will fall for consideration under s DB 23, unless the specified option is part of a wider financial arrangement, in which case the FA rules would need to be considered first. 18. Any other option to acquire land, and any consequent agreement for sale and purchase of the land, will be a financial arrangement (a “specified option”) to which the FA rules apply. 4 What is the effect of the financial arrangements rules applying? 19. A “cash basis person” is not required to apply any of the spreading methods under the FA rules to their financial arrangements, but may choose to do so under s EW 61 (ss EW 13(3) and EW 55(1)). A person will be a cash basis person for an income year if the value of financial arrangements to which they are a party does not exceed the prescribed thresholds in s EW 57(1)–(3) (s EW 54). 20. Where the FA rules apply, the deductibility of the cost of acquiring an option to acquire land (together with the other consideration for the land) is determined as follows: • Income or expenditure under the financial arrangement is calculated and allocated to each income year of the financial arrangement’s term under the appropriate spreading method (if spreading is required) and base price adjustment in the year that is required. • Any expenditure under the financial arrangement is interest (as defined in s YA 1), and may be deductible under s DB 6 or s DB 7. • Any income under the financial arrangement is income under s CC 3 and would need to be returned in the year(s) to which it is allocated under the FA rules. • Presuming there is no wider financial arrangement, the base price adjustment would typically be required in either the year the option expires or is disposed of, or in the year that any consequent agreement for sale and purchase of the land is settled. 4 • The cost of the option, and the other consideration paid for the land (if the option was exercised) would be taken into account in calculating the amount of income (if any) under the FA rules. • Where the option is exercised and the land acquired, the purchaser is paid consideration that includes property. The value of the property for the purposes of the FA rules is determined under s EW 32. This value may be more or less than what the option holder paid for it. As such, the purchaser may have income or expenditure under the FA rules. • If the land the subject of the option was acquired and is revenue account property, when the person disposes of that land the amount derived on the disposal will be income. A deduction for the cost of the land will be allowed against the sale proceeds, under s DB 23. 5 Section EW 35 provides that for the purposes of determining the amount of that deduction, the person will be treated as acquiring the land for the value determined under s EW 32. What this means in effect is that if the purchaser has already returned some income under the FA rules because the value of the property under s EW 32 was more than what was paid for it, that higher value is the cost base for the property. Similarly, if the purchaser has already had expenditure under the FA rules because the value of the property under s EW 32 was less than what was paid for it, that lower value is the cost base for the property. 4 The base price adjustment could be required at a different time – see s EW 29. 5 As noted above, this is subject to the general permission being satisfied, and no general limitation (excluding the capital limitation) applying. 5 Cost of revenue account property 21. Whether or not the FA rules apply, the deductibility of the cost of revenue account land acquired by way of an option will be determined by s DB 23. It just may be that the FA rules determine what the “cost” of the land is considered to be. 22. Section DB 23 provides for the deductibility of expenditure incurred as the cost of revenue account property, stating: DB 23 Cost of revenue account property Deduction (1) A person is allowed a deduction for expenditure that they incur as the cost of revenue account property. No deduction (2) Despite subsection (1), a person is denied a deduction for expenditure incurred as the cost of revenue account property if— (a) \[Repealed\] (b) section CX 55, CX 56B, or CX 56C (which relate to portfolio investment income) applies to income derived by the person from the disposal of the revenue account property. Relationship with sections CU 2 and DU 3 (2B) Sections CU 2 (Treatment of mining land) and DU 3 (Acquisition of land for mining operations) override this section in relation to land or an interest in land as described in section CU 2(1)(b) that a mineral miner acquires for the purposes of their mining operations or associated mining operations. Link with subpart DA (3) Subsection (1) overrides the capital limitation but the general permission must still be satisfied. Subsection (2) overrides the general permission. The other general limitations still apply. \[Emphasis added\] 23. If a deduction is allowed under s DB 23, it is allocated to the earlier of the income year in which the person disposes of the property or the income year in which the property ceases to exist (s EA 2(2)). 24. Where land is revenue account property for a person, the cost of acquiring the land 6 w ould obviously be expenditure incurred as the cost of acquiring revenue account property. The question we have been asked is whether the cost of acquiring an option, which is then exercised in order for the land to be acquired, will also form part of the cost of acquiring the land, and therefore be deductible. Meaning of “cost” 25. The Act does not define “cost” for the purposes of s DB 23, however, numerous cases have considered its meaning, for example Tasman Forestry Limited v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,147 (CA) and CIR v Atlas Copco (NZ) Ltd (1990) 12 NZTC 7,327, which are discussed below. 26. Tasman Forestry involved consideration of what the cost of certain forestry assets acquired by the taxpayer was, as the taxpayer was allowed a deduction for this cost against profits or gains derived from the sale of timber. 27. Following a merger, it was decided that Tasman Forestry Limited (Tasman) would hold the forestry holdings of approximately 20 forestry companies in the group. Tasman acquired the shares of those companies at fair market value. Each of those companies was then wound up, and the forestry assets of the company 6 Excluding any interest element under the FA rules – though there is unlikely to be any. 6 were distributed to Tasman (referred to as an in specie distribution). In addition, Tasman entered into an agreement with another company, under which forestry assets were exchanged. 28. As noted above, the issue in Tasman Forestry was what the cost of the forestry assets Tasman acquired was. 29. The Court of Appeal discussed the meaning of “cost”, and adopted the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary definition, being “that which must be given in order to acquire something”. The court also stated that “cost” has a wider meaning than payment on purchase, and the fact that determination of cost may require a valuation exercise does not mean there is no cost. 30. In terms of the mechanism through which the forestry assets were acquired, the court noted at 15,157: \[37\] We consider the correct course is not to dissect the transactions by which the forests were acquired, but to view them in their commercial reality. As the Judge found, the shares were purchased as the means for, and with the intention of, acquiring the forests. For practical purposes the cost to Tasman in acquiring the forests was the amount paid for the company shares which gave access to the forest assets. The appropriate proportion of that cost is to be treated as the cost of the timber. \[38\] This accords with the approach that would be taken in respect of other personal property in applying the third limb of s 65(2)(e) relating to profit making schemes. It also accords with the approach taken by Mason J at first instance and Gibbs J in the Full Court of the High Court of Australia in Steinberg v Federal Commissioner of Taxes. Gibbs J said (697): In the circumstances of the present case, where the shares were bought to enable the land to be acquired, the cost of the shares and of the winding up of the company and distribution of the assets can rightly be regarded as the amount actually outlayed for the pur pose of, and in the process of, acquiring the land, although the acquisition was effected not directly, but by a number of steps. In my opinion, therefore, Mason J was right for the reasons which he gave. \[39\] Barwick CJ, dissenting, held there was no profit-making scheme. Accordingly he did not consider the present point and his earlier analysis (683) was directed to the other limb of the Australian provision, the counterpart of the second limb of s 65(2)(e), concerned with the narrower issue of the calculation of profits on sale of property, acquired for the purpose of sale at a profit. \[40\] In each case involving acquisition by Tasman on distribution in specie there was no question that the purchase of the company shares was made for the purpose of acquiring the forests. Accordingly the cost of timber for Tasman was that proportion of the price paid for the shares allocated to the standing timber. Only in the case of the Matahina forest does the cost differ from that for which Tasman contended. In that case the subsequent revaluation of the forest by Crista cannot be taken into account in the cost of timber for Tasman. 31. The right to receive a distribution of the forestry assets on the winding up of the companies flowed from Tasman’s ownership of the shares in those companies. Therefore, the court considered that the cost of the forestry assets to Tasman was the amount paid for those shares. 32. The meaning of “cost” was also considered in Atlas Copco. The issue in that case was what the value of fringe benefits provided by the taxpayer to its employees was. The legislation provided that the value of the benefits was to be determined based on the “cost” of the benefits to the taxpayer. The taxpayer argued that this cost did not include the GST component of the relevant expenditure, because ultimately the taxpayer was able to recover that component by claiming input tax deductions. The Commissioner argued that the taxpayer being able to claim back the GST component did not change the fact that the GST component was part of the cost incurred. 33. The High Court found for the taxpayer, and considered that the approach suggested by the Commissioner was unduly restrictive and would not give effect to the realities of the situation, noting at 738: 7 I have reached the conclusion that the approach suggested by the Commissioner is unduly restrictive and does not give effect to the realities of the situation. The Commissioner contends that the Court should focus only upon one element of the statutory scheme - the payment of the purchase price - and should turn a blind eye to other integral steps in the scheme such as the subsequent deduction of input tax by the registered purchaser. In reality, and in law, there are three components of a sale transaction between a registered vendor and a registered purchaser; the vendor’s obligation to pay output tax, the purchaser’s payment of the purchase price and the purchaser’s subsequent deduction of input tax. The deduction of input tax is not analogous to “a later transaction with a third party” as contended by the Commissioner in the example cited - it is a fundamental part of the whole transaction, and is necessary to give effect to the statutory intention that GST be a tax upon the end-user. 34. The court also had regard to the evidence given by two accountants as to the commonly held commercial understanding of the word “cost”. The court observed that where the meaning of words in a statutory context is unclear or ambiguous, the court may derive some assistance from common business parlance and practice, as well as international standards. The accountants were in agreement about the normal accounting usage of the term “cost”. One of the accountants had stated that there is “an internationally recognised concept of cost which has been applied in a number of jurisdictions and which has been given a consistent meaning over the years in each of them”. He then went on to say that “the general principle is that cost is the economic sacrifice incurred in economic activities – that which is given up or forgone to consume, to save, to exchange, to produce and so forth”. 35. Tasman Forestry, Atlas Copco and other authorities have established that: • The word “cost” is capable of various meanings, depending on the context. • “C ost” means that which must be given in order to acquire something, and has a wider meaning than payment on purchase. • In determining “cost”, a transaction must be viewed in its commercial reality, and some assistance may be derived from common business parlance and practice. 36. Despite this, as noted above, if the FA rules apply, they will determine what the cost of the property is regarded as being for the purposes of s DB 23 (see ss EW 32 and EW 35). The following discussion is premised on the FA rules not applying. If the FA rules apply, see the last bullet point at \[20\] in relation to the cost base of the property. Is the cost of acquiring an option to acquire land part of the “cost” of acquiring the land? 37. It is noted that an option to acquire land or an estate or interest in land is itself land for the purposes of the Act (definition of “land” in s YA 1). It has been suggested that s CB 15B (which concerns the timing of acquisition of land for the purposes of subpart CB) requires the separate consideration of different estates or interests in, or options to acquire estates or interests in, the same underlying physical land. As a consequence, it has been suggested that the cost of acquiring an option (which is itself “land” under the Act) will only be deductible if the option is revenue account property. The Commissioner does not agree. Under s CB 15B, an estate or interest in land may be acquired at the time an earlier estate or interest in the land first arose. However, the issue of the timing of acquisition of land is entirely separate from the issue of what the cost of the land is . 38. On the basis of the meanings that the courts have given to the word “cost”, the Commissioner considers that where an option is acquired in order to acquire land, the cost of acquiring the option will form part of the cost of acquiring the underlying land. The cost of acquiring the option is part of what is outlaid in order to acquire the land. Where the FA rules do not apply, and the land is 8 revenue account property of the taxpayer, the cost of acquiring the option will therefore be deductible under s DB 23 against the proceeds derived from the disposal of the underlying land. As noted above, this is subject to the general permission (s DA 1(1)) being satisfied. 7 39. There may be situations where the option is itself revenue account property (for example, because it was acquired with the intention of being sold), but is not in fact sold (ie, because it is instead exercised or expires). The option would be revenue account property even though it was not sold. As noted at \[10\], revenue account property for a person includes property that if disposed of for valuable consideration, would produce income for the person. 8 The cost of acquiring the option would clearly be expenditure incurred as the cost of acquiring the revenue account property (the option). However, although s DB 23 overrides the capital limitation, the general permission (s DA 1(1)) must still be satisfied in order for the person to be able to claim a deduction under s DB 23 on the exercise or expiry of the option. 40. The general permission requires there to be a nexus between the expenditure and the derivation of assessable and/or excluded income, or for the expenditure to have been incurred in the course of the person carrying on a business for the purposes of deriving assessable and/or excluded income. In the example noted above, the option was on revenue account because it was acquired with the intention of being sold. As such, the general permission would be satisfied, even though there would not be any income derived on the exercise or expiry of the option (see for example CIR v Inglis \[1993\] 2 NZLR 29 (CA) and CIR v Stockwell \[1993\] 2 NZLR 40 (CA)). The cost of acquiring the option would therefore be able to be deducted in the year in which the option is exercised or expires. 41. If the option is exercised, and the underlying land was also revenue account property, the cost of acquiring the option would be part of what is outlaid in order to acquire the underlying land, even though it was not intended at the time the option was acquired that it would be exercised and the underlying land acquired. However, the cost of acquiring the option would have been deducted in the year the option was exercised. As such, no further deduction for the cost of the option would be allowed on the disposal of the revenue account land that is the subject of the option (s BD 4(5)). 42. A further scenario that has been raised is if someone acquires an option with no intention to dispose of the option, but intending to acquire the land the option relates to. However, instead of acquiring the underlying land as intended, the option was either disposed of or expired without being exercised. In this scenario, the fact that the underlying land may have been revenue account property if acquired is not relevant, as it was not acquired. Unless the option was revenue account property, the cost of its acquisition would not be deductible under s DB 23, as there simply was no revenue account property. If the option was revenue account property, the general permission would need to be satisfied for a deduction to be permitted under s DB 23, as noted above. 7 Although s DB 23 overrides the capital limitation, the general permission (s DA 1(1)) must still be satisfied. 8 Other than under s EE 48, FA 5 or FA 9. 9 Examples 43. The following examples are included to assist in explaining when the cost of acquiring an option to acquire land (together with the other consideration for the land, if the option is exercised) will be deductible. They assume that none of the general limitations (excluding the capital limitation, which s DB 23 is not subject to) apply. Example 1 – Cost of option part of cost of revenue account land 44. Company A, a hotel developer, wished to acquire a piece of land in Taupo to build a hotel on. Company A sought an option to acquire the land, to enable it time to establish whether the necessary consents and planning permissions would be forthcoming. The owner of the land agreed to grant an option, under which Company A had the right to purchase the land for an agreed sum, provided that settlement took place within 3 months of the date the option was granted. Company A paid a $20,000 option fee for the grant of the option. Once Company A was satisfied that the required consents and permissions would be able to be obtained, it exercised the option and acquired the land. Once the hotel construction was completed, Company A sold the land to a local hotelier. The land was revenue account property of Company A. 45. The option was a “short-term option”, and company A had not made an election under s EW 8, so the option was an excepted financial arrangement. The option was not part of a wider financial arrangement. As such, the FA rules do not apply, and the deductibility of the cost of the option (together with the other consideration for the land) is determined by s DB 23. 46. The option was acquired in order for Company A to acquire the land, which was revenue account property of Company A. The option fee was part of what Company A outla id in order to acquire the land. As such, the cost of acquiring the option ($20,000) formed part of the cost of Company A’s acquisition of the land, and would be deductible under s DB 23 9 (together with the other consideration for the land) in the income year in which Company A disposed of the land (s EA 2(2)). Example 2 – Deduction for cost of revenue account property when the FA rules apply but there was no income under those rules in respect of the option and ASAP to acquire the property 47. Kylie paid $10,000 for an option to acquire a house in Nelson for $1.1m at any time in the six months from the date the option was granted. Kylie was planning to acquire the property, do some minor renovations to it, and sell it at a profit. Five months into the term of the option, once Kylie sold another property she owned, she exercised the option and acquired the property. The sale of the property was settled six weeks later. Kylie undertook the renovations, and sold the property for $1.5m just over two years later. Kylie is a cash basis person (see \[19\]) and has not elected to use a spreading method. 48. Kylie did not acquire the option for a private or domestic purpose, and in any event, the purchase price for the property was more than $1m. The option is not a short-term option (see \[15\]). The option and agreement for sale and purchase was therefore not an “excepted financial arrangement” but a financial arrangement (a “specified option”) to which the FA rules apply. As such, a base price adjustment was required when the agreement for sale and purchase (under which Kylie acquired the property) was settled. 9 The general permission is satisfied because Company A acquired the property intending to sell it. 10 49. The base price adjustment formula requires Kylie to deduct the amount of consideration paid by her under the financial arrangement (the option and consequent agreement for sale and purchase of the land) from the amount of consideration paid to her under the financial arrangement. None of the other elements of the base price adjustment formula are relevant in this case. 50. The consideration paid by Kylie under the financial arrangement was $1,110,000 (the cost of acquiring the option, and the purchase price for the land). The consideration paid to Kylie under the financial arrangement is the value of the land as determined by applying s EW 32. In this case, that is the lowest price the parties (Kylie and the person she purchased the property from) would have agreed on for the land, on the date the option was granted, if payment had been required in full at the time of settlement under the agreement for sale and purchase. The Commissioner and Kylie agree that the lowest price the parties would have agreed, at the time the option was granted, if payment had been required in full at settlement, is $1,110,000. 51. The result of Kylie’s base price adjustment calculation is therefore $0 ($1,110,000 – $1,110,000 = $0). That means that Kylie does not have any income or expenditure under the FA rules. 52. The underlying (freehold) land, which Kylie ended up acquiring, was revenue account property for her , as she acquired it with the intention of disposing of it after undertaking some renovations. The amount Kylie derived from selling the land ($1.5m) is therefore income to Kylie (s CB 6 10 ), and the cost of acquiring the la nd is deductible under s DB 23 11 against the sale proceeds. For the purposes of determining the amount of that deduction, Kylie is treated as having acquired the land for the value determined under s EW 32 ($1,110,000) – the same as what she actually paid for the land. This means that Kylie will pay tax on net proceeds of $390,000 from the sale. Example 3 – Deduction for cost of revenue account property when there has been earlier income under the FA rules in respect of the option and ASAP to acquire the property 53. Simon incurred $30,000 to acquire an option from a farmer to purchase a tract of farm land near a large suburban subdivision that was being undertaken. Simon was entitled to exercise the option to purchase the land during a period of three years, for $2m. Simon did not plan to exercise the option; he had acquired the option in anticipation of the first stage of the subdivision being successful and the subdivision being expanded further, at which time Simon envisaged that he would be able to sell the option to the developer for a profit. By two and a half years later (six months before the option period was over), it had become clear that the development was proceeding more slowly than expected, and the developer was not yet interested in further expansion of the development. Simon felt further expansion was inevitable, but since he could not make any profit selling the option, he decided to exercise it and acquire the land from the farmer, intending to on-sell the land to the developer once it was needed for further subdivision. Simon ended up selling the land to the developer three years later for $3.5m. Simon is a cash basis person (see \[19\]) and has not elected to use a spreading method. 54. Simon did not acquire the option for a private or domestic purpose, and it is not a short-term option (see \[15\]). The option and consequent agreement for sale and purchase of the land was therefore a financial arrangement (a “specified option”) 10 It is assumed for the purposes of this example that there are no applicable exclusions from s CB 6. 11 The general permission is satisfied because Kylie acquired the property intending to sell it. 11 to which the FA rules apply. As such, a base price adjustment was required when the agreement for sale and purchase was settled. 55. The base price adjustment formula requires Simon to deduct the amount of consideration paid by him under the financial arrangement (the option and consequent agreement for sale and purchase of the land) from the amount of consideration paid to him under the financial arrangement. None of the other elements of the base price adjustment formula are relevant in this case. 56. The consideration paid by Simon under the financial arrangement was $2,030,000 (the cost of acquiring the option, and the purchase price for the land). The consideration paid to Simon under the financial arrangement is the value of the land as determined by applying s EW 32. In this case, that is the lowest price the parties (Simon and the farmer) would have agreed on for the land, on the date the option was granted, if payment had been required in full at the time of settlement under the agreement for sale and purchase. The Commissioner and Simon agree that the lowest price the parties would have agreed, at the time the option was granted, if payment had been required in full at settlement, is $2,035 ,000. 12 57. The result of Simon’s base price adjustment calculation is therefore $5,000 ($2,035 ,000 – $2,030,000 = $5,000). That $5,000 is income to Simon under s CC 3 (see s EW 31(3)) in the year the base price adjustment is required (the year the agreement for sale and purchase was settled). 58. The underlying (freehold) land, which Simon ended up acquiring, was revenue account property for him, as he acquired it with the intention of disposing of it. The amount Simon derived from selling the land to the developer ($3.5m) is therefore income to Simon (s CB 6), and the cost of acquiring the land is deductible under s DB 23 against the sale proceeds. For the purposes of determining the amount of that deduction, Simon is treated as having acquired the land for the value determined under s EW 32 ($2,035,000), rather than the $2,030,000 he actually paid for the land. This in effect takes account of the fact that Simon had $5,000 of income under the FA rules in the year he purchased the land. This means that Simon will pay tax on net proceeds of $1,465,000 from the sale. 12 D epending on the commercial drivers in different situations, it may be that the lowest price the parties would have agreed at the time an option is granted, if payment had been required in full at the time of settlement, is less than the option fee plus the purchase price under the agreement for sale and purchase. If that is the case, the purchaser would have expenditure under the FA rules, and a corresponding decrease in the cost base of the land. The fact that Simon in this example has income under the FA rules is for illustrative purposes only. 12 References Subject references Income Tax, cost of land that is revenue account property, options Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007 – ss CC 3, BD 4(5), CB 15B, DB 6, DB 7, DB 23, EW 2, EW 3, EW 4(3), EW 6(3), EW 8, EW 13(3), EW 32, EW 35, EW 54, EW 55(1), EW 57, ZA 3, the definitions of “land”, “revenue account property” and “specified option” in s YA 1, and Schedule 51 Income Tax Act 2004 – s EH 26(1A) Income Tax Act 1994 – s YA 3 and Schedule 22A Case references CIR v Atlas Copco (NZ) Ltd (1990) 12 NZTC 7,327 CIR v Inglis \[1993\] 2 NZLR 29 (CA) CIR v Stockwell \[1993\] 2 NZLR 40 (CA) Tasman Forestry Limited v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,147 (CA) 13
1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 15/14 GOODS AND SERVICES TAX – PROGRESS PAYMENTS ON BOATS TO BE EXPORTED BY SUPPLIER All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about ss 9(3)(aa), 11(1), 11(4) and 11(5). Question 1. We have been asked when a GST registered boat builder can zero-rate progress payments made by an overseas buyer for the construction of a boat that will be entered for export (or deemed to be entered for export) by the supplier. Answer 2. A supply of goods that will be exported will be zero-rated where the supplier will enter (or be deemed to enter) the goods for export in the course of, or as a condition of, making the supply. The general rule is that export must occur within 28 days beginning on the day of the time of supply. 3. Where an agreement provides for progress payments to be made periodically during the term of the agreement, each payment will have its own time of supply. Therefore, the first progress payment will trigger the 28-day export requirement. The requirement to export within 28 days is unlikely to be satisfied. Therefore, a supplier wishing to zero-rate the supply will need to apply to the Commissioner for an extension of the 28-day requirement. The application should be made before the end of the first 28-day period. 4. The application must be in writing and should include relevant documents (including the supply contract), the date construction is intended to be completed and the intended date of export. Applications should be sent to: Inland Revenue PO Box 5542 Auckland 1141 5. Each application will be considered on a case-by-case basis. However, the Commissioner will usually grant an extension in this situation. Where an extension is granted, the supply can be zero-rated as long as export occurs within the term of the extension. 6. This QWBA is focused on agreements for the construction of boats. However, the same principles apply to other engineering works that involve progress payments and where the goods will ultimately be exported. Explanation 7. “GST and Progress Payments on Boats” Public Information Bulletin No 179, May 1989 set out the GST treatment for a GST registered boat builder who constructed a boat for an overseas buyer and charged progress payments during the construction. The item considered the zero-rating provisions and, in particular, when the Commissioner would extend the 28-day period for export. The purpose of this QWBA is to update and replace the PIB item. 2 8. This QWBA discusses the situation where a registered person builds and exports a boat to an overseas buyer. This QWBA does not look at the situation where a registered person sells a boat to an overseas buyer and the overseas buyer or their agent exports the boat (under its own power). That situation is covered by s 11(1)(i), (7) and (8) (see QB 07/01 “Zero-rating of supplies of sail-away boats - use as security or offered for sale” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007): 22). Time of supply for progress payments 9. Section 9(3)(aa)(ii) alters the time of supply for certain goods and services by deeming a single supply to be a number of successive supplies. It applies where goods and services are supplied:  directly in the construction, major reconstruction, manufacture, or extension of a building or an engineering work; and  pursuant to an agreement that provides for the consideration for that supply to become due and payable in instalments or periodic progress payments. 10. Each successive supply is deemed to take place at the earlier of:  any payment in respect of the supply becoming due;  any payment in respect of the supply being received; or  any invoice relating only to that payment being issued. Example 1 – Time of supply Isaac (GST registered) enters into an agreement with Liam (resident in Dubai) to construct Liam a boat. The agreement provides for 12 bi-monthly progress payments during the construction phase. Under s 9(3)(aa)(ii), each of the bi-monthly payments will be deemed to be for a separate supply. Each supply will be deemed to be made at the earlier of any payment being received or becoming due, or an invoice being issued (solely) for that payment. Zero-rating exported goods 11. A supply of goods will be zero-rated where:  the supplier will enter the goods for export under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 in the course of, or as a condition of, making the supply, and will export the goods (s 11(1)(d)); or  the goods will be deemed to be entered for export under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 and will be exported by the supplier in the course of, or as a condition of, making the supply (s 11(1)(e)). 12. However, these zero-rating provisions are subject to s 11(4) and do not apply unless the supplier exports the goods within 28 days from the time of supply (or a longer period allowed by the Commissioner). As noted above, where an agreement provides for progress payments, each progress payment has its own time of supply. This means that the time of supply of the first progress payment would trigger the 28-day rule in s 11(4). It is unlikely that the boat would be able to be exported within 28 days of the first time of supply. If the 28-day requirement is not met, then the whole supply would have to be standard-rated. 13. However, s 11(5) gives the Commissioner a discretion to extend the 28-day period within which the goods must be exported. Section 11(5) requires the supplier to apply in writing to the Commissioner. Section 11(5) also requires the Commissioner to determine that either: 3  the export of the goods within 28 days could not occur due to circumstances beyond the control of the supplier and the recipient; or  due to the nature of the supply, it is not practicable for the supplier to export the goods within 28 days. 14. The second of the possible grounds seems to be more relevant in this situation. That is, due to the nature of the supply, it is not practicable for the supplier to export the goods within 28 days. This is because the start of the 28–day period is triggered by the first progress payment. 15. An application must be made in writing and should include relevant documents (including the supply contract) and the intended date of export. Each application will be considered on a case-by-case basis. However, the Commissioner will usually grant an extension in this situation. Where an extension is granted, the supply can be zero-rated as long as export occurs with the term of the extension. 16. Even though the supply of a boat is treated as multiple successive supplies, a single application can be made to cover all of the deemed supplies in relation to a boat to be exported. 17. A separate application will usually need to be made for each boat exported as the Commissioner needs to consider the relevant details to determine whether the discretion should be exercised. However, s 11(5) allows the Commissioner to grant an extension for a “class of goods”. This may be appropriate where the goods being supplied and the contractual terms of the supplies are sufficiently similar. Example – application for extension of 28-day export period 18. The following example is included to assist in explaining the application of the law. 19. Ryan (GST registered) enters into an agreement with Sophie to build her a boat and to export it to Australia where Sophie is resident. The agreement provides for monthly progress payments throughout its term. The boat is expected to be ready for export in 12 months. The first progress payment is invoiced at the end of the first month. The boat will not be ready for export within 28 days of the invoice. 20. Ryan realises when he enters into the contract that it will not be possible to meet the 28-day export requirement. As he wishes to zero-rate the payments, he immediately makes a written application to the Commissioner under s 11(5) seeking an extension. The Commissioner accepts Ryan’s application and extends the period for export by 12 months. Ryan is now able to zero-rate the payments as long as he exports the boat within the extended period.

1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 15/15 INCOME TAX – FIRST AID ALLOWANCES All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about ss CE 1 and CW 17. Question 1. Is an allowance paid by an employer to an employee because they hold a first aid qualification taxable? Answer 2. Yes. An allowance paid by an employer to an employee because they hold a first aid qualification is taxable as employment income under s CE 1(1)(a), and subject to PAYE. Such an allowance is not paid to reimburse the employee for expenditure incurred in connection with their employment duties. Rather it is a regular amount paid to the employee because they are first aid qualified and take on obligations to provide first aid services in the workplace if required. Such a payment is therefore income to the employee. 3. If a regular allowance or one-off payment is made to the employee to reimburse them for first aid related costs incurred in performing their first aid obligations or duties in the workplace (eg, the cost of getting a first aid qualification, if this is required, or the cost of an employee keeping their own work-related first aid kit up-to-date), this would be exempt income under s CW 17(2). This is because the payment is reimbursing the employee for expenditure the employee would be able to deduct if the employment limitation did not exist. A payment to reimburse an employee for the employer’s expenses (eg, buying supplies for the employer’s first aid kit) is not income to the employee (ss CE 1 and CE 5(3)). Explanation Background What is an allowance? 4. An allowance is a payment of an agreed amount by an employer to an employee. It is paid either on a regular basis (such as daily or weekly), or when certain events happen. It is taxable to the employee as employment income under s CE 1(1)(a) unless an exemption applies. 5. There are two main types of allowances, commonly referred to as benefit allowances and reimbursing allowances. Benefit allowances are taxable to the employee as employment income under s CE 1(1)(a) and are subject to PAYE. However, reimbursing allowances may be exempt from income tax under the general exemption in s CW 17. During a review of Public Information Bulletins a number of items relating to the tax treatment of employee allowances were identified as needing to be reviewed. This QWBA replaces “First Aid Allowance” (Public Information Bulletin No 149, July 1986). 2 What is a reimbursing allowance? 6. A reimbursing allowance is an allowance paid by an employer to an employee for expenses that an employee incurs or is likely to incur in connection with their employment. 7. A reimbursing allowance is not an exact reimbursement of expenditure. Operating expenses are expenses that the employee would be allowed a deduction for if the employment limitation did not exist (s CW 17(2)). Under s CW 17(2B) the expenditure will be treated as incurred in connection with an employee’s employment if it is a necessary expense incurred in performing an employment obligation from which they earn income. What is a benefit allowance? 8. A benefit allowance is an allowance paid by an employer to compensate an employee for the conditions of their service, such as using a dangerous piece of equipment, working in a dangerous or dirty environment, or working in a remote location. Unlike a reimbursing allowance, a benefit allowance is taxable to the employee as employment income under s CE 1(1)(a) and is subject to PAYE. First aid allowances 9. There are legal requirements in New Zealand under health and safety legislation for employers to take all practicable steps to provide first aid facilities, and to have procedures for dealing with emergencies. This may include the need for an appropriate number of suitably trained first aiders. Employers often pay allowances to employees who are designated workplace first aiders. 10. A first aid allowance is a regular amount paid to an employee because they are first aid qualified and take on obligations to provide first aid services in the workplace if required. It is a benefit allowance, paid to compensate the employee for taking on additional responsibilities. It is not paid to reimburse the employee for expenditure incurred in connection with their employment duties. Such an allowance is therefore taxable as employment income under s CE 1(1)(a). Employers need to account for PAYE on the amount of the allowance. Reimbursement for first aid related expenses 11. If a regular allowance or one-off payment is made to an employee to reimburse them for first aid related costs incurred in performing their first aid obligations or duties in the workplace (eg, the cost of getting a first aid qualification if this is required, or the cost of an employee keeping their own work-related first aid kit up-to-date), this would be exempt income under s CW 17(2). This is because the payment is reimbursing the employee for expenditure the employee would be able to deduct if the employment limitation did not exist. There is the requisite nexus between the expenditure being reimbursed and the employee deriving their income. A payment to reimburse an employee for the employer’s expenses (eg, buying supplies for the employer’s first aid kit) is not income to the employee (ss CE 1 and CE 5(3)). 12. As is the case with other reimbursing allowances, in setting the amount of a regular reimbursing allowance, an employer can estimate the total amount of expenditure an employee is likely to incur in performing their first aid obligations or duties in the workplace. Section CW 17(3) allows employers to make a “reasonable estimate” of the amount of expenditure likely to be incurred by an employee or a group of employees. 13. A reasonable estimate is one that has some basis. For example, the estimate might be based on actual historical data, or from an employer asking a sample of their employees about the first aid related costs they have incurred in performing 3 their obligations. Employers must retain sufficient information about how the estimate was calculated to substantiate the allowance amount. Employers should review their estimates periodically to ensure they remain reasonable.

1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 16/01 INCOME TAX, WORKING FOR FAMILIES TAX CREDITS – PRINCIPAL CAREGIVER – DEPENDENT CHILD – PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR DAY-TO-DAY CARE – MEANING OF “TEMPORARY BASIS” All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Question 1. Can a person looking after a child on a temporary basis become eligible to receive Working for Families tax credits (WfFTC)? Answer 2. To be eligible for WfFTC, a person needs to meet a number of requirements, including that they are the principal caregiver of a dependent child. Generally a person who is caring for a child on a temporary basis would not be eligible for WfFTC because they would probably not meet the principal caregiver requirement, and also the child would likely not be their dependent child. 3. A person will be a principal caregiver for a dependent child when the following criteria are met:  the child meets certain age and status requirements;  the person is primarily responsible for the child’s care;  the child is maintained as a member of the person’s family;  the child is financially dependent on the person; and  the person either: (a) has the primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of the child on a more than temporary basis; or (b) they live apart from whoever meets the requirement in (a), and they have the child in their exclusive care for certain minimum periods (so there is shared care of the child). 4. This QWBA provides some guidance on each of these criteria. Please note: The focus of this QWBA is on situations where someone has taken over the primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of a child for a time, and the question is whether that is on a more than temporary basis. If it is, that would mean that they are the child’s “principal caregiver” and may become eligible for WfFTC. In situations where the care of a child is divided between people in different households, there may be what is known as shared care. In a shared care situation, there will be more than one “principal caregiver” for a child. Under the shared care rules, both parents (or other caregivers) may therefore potentially be eligible for WfFTC. Those situations do not involve considering whether the person has primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of the child on a more than temporary basis. There will be shared care if there is a person who lives apart from someone else who qualifies for WfFTC, and they have the child in their exclusive care for at least a third of a 4-month period, tax year, or (in the case of the parental tax credit) entitlement period. 2 Explanation Background 5. The Working for Families (WfF) regime is aimed at helping families with dependent children, through the provision of financial support to ensure an adequate family income and to help make it easier to work and raise a family. The WfF regime includes four different tax credits: the family tax credit, the in- work tax credit, the minimum family tax credit, and the parental tax credit. 6. There are a number of requirements that must be met for someone to qualify for WfFTC. The main requirements are that the person must be at least 16 years old, satisfy certain residence requirements, and be the principal caregiver for one or more dependent children. In the case of the in-work tax credit and the minimum family tax credit there are also work-based criteria. 7. This QWBA provides guidance on when someone will be a principal caregiver for a dependent child. The criteria for a child being a person’s dependent child, and for the person being a principal caregiver of the child, are set out above at \[3\]. Each of those criteria is discussed below, and summarised in the flowchart in the Appendix to this QWBA. 8. This QWBA does not consider any of the other WfFTC requirements (such as those mentioned at \[6\]). When will a child be a person’s dependent child? 9. A child will be a person’s dependent child when: What are the age and status requirements the child has to meet? 10. To potentially be a “dependent child” for WfFTC, a child must be:  aged: - 15 or younger; or - 16-18, and not financially independent 1 (and in the case of an 18 year old, attending either school or a tertiary educational institution); and  unmarried, and not in a civil union or de facto relationship. 11. It is noted that in some circumstances a child will be excluded from being a “dependent child”. This may be the case where a payment is made because the child is placed in someone’s charge under s 362 of the Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, or if an orphan’s or unsupported child’s benefit is paid in relation to the child. Only in-work tax credits may be available in those situations. 1 A child will be considered financially independent if they work an average of 30 hours or more per week, or if they receive a benefit, student allowance, or other similar government assistance. Dependent child the child meets certain age and status requirements; the person is primarily responsible for the child’s care; the child is maintained as a member of the person’s family; and the child is financially dependent on the person. 3 When will a person be primarily responsible for a child’s care? 12. The person seeking to claim WfFTC must be primarily responsible for the child’s care. This means that the person has the main obligation or responsibility for ensuring that the health, welfare, maintenance and protection of the child are being provided for. Often this will be one of the child’s parents. 13. Where there is a question about whether the primary responsibility for the child’s care has shifted to the other parent, or to another person, it is a matter of judgement whether the person who had the primary responsibility for care has given that responsibility to someone else. This will involve considering who makes decisions about the child’s care (eg, housing, health, education etc) and takes the main responsibility for ensuring that the child is cared for physically and emotionally. 14. This question often arises when an overseas exchange student is staying with a family in New Zealand. In this situation, the Commissioner considers that the New Zealand host family is typically not primarily responsible for the child’s care, and so is typically not eligible for WfFTC for the child. Although the child is staying with and being cared for by the New Zealand host family, the child’s parent(s) or (other guardians / caregivers) will usually still have the primary responsibility for ensuring that the child’s care needs are met. There may be some circumstances where this is not the case, and the host parents have taken over the primary responsibility for care. 15. Another common situation is when multiple generations live together as a family in one household, and a person other than the child’s parent(s) provides much of the day-to-day care for the child. In this situation, if the parent(s) are part of the family and involved in the child’s life, and are not themselves dependent children, the Commissioner considers that they will not typically have given up their primary responsibility for ensuring that the child’s care needs are met. There may be some circumstances where they have given up responsibility, but this will not be the case simply because someone else in the family cares for the child while the parent(s) are working, for instance. This means that if anyone can claim WfFTC, it will be the parents, not the extended family member. When will a child be maintained as a member of a person’s family? 16. The child needs to be maintained as a member of the person’s family. This means that the child is treated as part of the person’s family group and, as with other members of the family, they receive what they need to live, such as food, shelter, and clothing. Being maintained as a member of the person’s family implies that the arrangement is an on-going one, though not necessarily indefinite. When will a child be financially dependent on a person? 17. The child needs to be financially dependent on the person seeking to claim WfFTC. This means that the child is not financially independent, 2 and is reliant on the person for financial support to meet their needs. 18. A child may be financially dependent on more than one person. For example, in a two-parent family, a child will be financially dependent on both parents. It does not matter that one of the parents may not have an income source; the child is still dependent on both parents for the provision of their financial needs. 19. On the other hand, a child will not necessarily be financially dependent on a person just because they provide some money to help support the child. There 2 See footnote 1 above as to when a child is considered financially independent. 4 needs to be dependence on the financial support, such that without it the child’s needs would not be met. When will a person be a child’s principal caregiver? 20. If all of the “dependent child” criteria discussed above are met, the person must also be the child’s principal caregiver to be potentially eligible for WfFTC. This will be the case when: 21. The “principal caregiver” cannot be:  a body of persons (whether incorporated or not);  the spouse or partner of a “transitional resident” (see s HR 8); or  a proprietor or employee of certain residences 3 or institutions 4 in which the child is cared for. 22. In addition to not being the spouse or partner of a transitional resident, the person cannot get WfFTC if they are themselves a transitional resident. If an application for WfFTC is made by a transitional resident, it is treated as being an election to no longer be a transitional resident (see s HR 8(5)). Shared care 23. As noted above, if the care of a child is divided between parents (or other caregivers/guardians), there may be what is known as “shared care”. In a shared care situation, there will be more than one “principal caregiver” for a child. Under the shared care rules, both parents (or other caregivers) may therefore potentially be eligible for WfFTC. 24. A person will be another “principal caregiver” under the shared care rules if they live apart from someone else who qualifies for WfFTC, and they have the child in their exclusive care for at least a third of a 4-month period, tax year, or (in the case of the parental tax credit) entitlement period. 5 25. Those situations do not involve considering whether the person has primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of the child on a more than temporary basis. When will a person have primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of a child on a more than temporary basis? 26. In situations where someone has taken over the primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of a child for a time, they may potentially become eligible 3 Residences established under the Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989. 4 Any institution in which a child is cared for, including residential disability care institutions as defined in s 58(4) of the Health and Disability Services (Safety) Act 2001. 5 This is the first 70 days after the child’s birth date (s MD 11(1)(b)(i)). Principal caregiver the person either: (a) has the primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of the child on a more than temporary basis; or (b) they live apart from whoever meets the requirement in (a), and they have the child in their exclusive care for certain minimum periods (so there is shared care of the child). 5 for WfFTC. This requires considering whether their primary responsibility for the day-to-day care is on a more than temporary basis. Primary responsibility for day-to-day care of the child 27. To meet this requirement, the person must be the one who is primarily responsible for providing or ensuring the provision of what the child needs on a daily basis for their health, welfare, maintenance and protection. 28. To decide if a person has the primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of a child, you must consider the extent to which the person performs the day-to-day responsibilities for the child, or ensures that these responsibilities are met. These day-to-day responsibilities include things such as taking the child to and from school or childcare, preparing their meals, supervising their leisure activities, taking care of their daily routines (such as bathing, hygiene and sleep), and caring for them when sick. 29. This does not mean that the person has to perform all of these responsibilities themselves (though invariably they will perform at least some). For example, the fact that another family member or a paid caregiver performs some, or even most, of these day-to-day tasks does not mean that the person does not have the primary responsibility for the provision of that care. The fact that they have arranged for someone else to perform these tasks while they are at work, or because they require assistance, does not mean they do not have primary responsibility for the child’s day-to-day care. 30. In a sole-parenting situation, it will often be easy to determine who has the primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of the child and so is the child’s principal caregiver. In a joint-parenting situation, where the parents live in the same household, the child’s principal caregiver must still be determined, as this is the person who will receive the WfFTC. The above factors will be relevant to deciding who this is. 31. Where parents (or other caregivers) who do not live together share the care of a child, only one of them can have the primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of the child. However, in a shared care situation both parents (or other caregivers) may be principal caregivers of the child, and so potentially eligible for WfFTC. The requirements for the other parent/caregiver in a shared care arrangement to also be a “principal caregiver” are noted above from \[23\]. Temporary basis 32. A person will not be a “principal caregiver” for a dependent child 6 if they have primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of the child only on a temporary basis. 33. The Act does not define what a “temporary basis” is, and the Commissioner has been asked to provide some guidance around this. 34. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) defines “temporary” as “lasting only for a limited period”. The ordinary meaning of “temporary” indicates that day-to-day care will be on a “temporary basis” if it lasts for a limited (and usually short) period of time. 35. The courts have not considered the meaning of the term “temporary” in s MC 10(1)(a). However, the Australian courts have considered the meaning of “temporary” in the context of social security legislation. In Hafza v Director General of Social Security (1985) 60 ALR 674 (FCA), Wilcox J considered whether a person’s absence from Australia was temporary only, which would mean that 6 Shared care situations aside – see further from \[23\] in that regard. 6 the person would remain entitled to a child endowment under the (then) Social Services Act 1947 (Cth). Wilcox J stated (relevantly) at 682: The Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines ‘temporary’ as ‘lasting for a limited time; existing or valid for a time (only); transient; made to supply a passing need’. The Macquarie Dictionary definition is to similar effect, with the addition of ‘not permanent’. In one sense any absence from Australia, which in fact comes to an end, is temporary; it turns out to have lasted for a limited — as distinct from an unlimited — time and to have been not permanent. In this sense everything in human affairs, including life itself, is ‘temporary’. But it is doubtful whether the word ‘temporary’ was used in this wide sense in s. 103(1)(d). As I have pointed out, had it been intended to protect the endowment rights of persons absent abroad for lengthy periods, who ultimately return to Australia and who, in the meantime, maintain some association with Australia, it would have been enough to refer to residence in Australia. Plainly it was intended to be more restrictive than that. I think that the adjective ‘temporary’ was used to denote an absence that was, both in intention and in fact, limited to the fulfilment of a passing purpose. The purpose might be of a business or professional nature; it might be for a holiday or for compassionate or family reasons. But, whatever the purpose, it seems to me to be implied in the concept of ‘temporary’ absence that the absence will be relatively short and that its duration will be either defined in advance or be related to the fulfilment of a specific, passing purpose. \[Emphasis added\] 36. The Commissioner considers that “temporary” in the context of s MC 10(1) should be given a similar meaning. That is, primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of a dependent child would be on a temporary basis if:  it was for a relatively short period; and  the duration for which the person has the responsibility for day-to-day care is either defined in advance or related to the fulfilment of a specific, passing purpose. 37. Based on the statutory context of the WfFTC provisions, t he Commissioner considers that if someone has primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of a child for a period (or expected period) of at least three to four months, that will be more than “relatively short”. In those circumstances, the person might therefore have primary responsibility for the child’s day-to-day care on a more than “temporary basis”. However, it is also necessary to consider the circumstances of any given situation ─ including whether the period for which the person has the primary responsibility for day-to-day care is defined in advance or is related to the fulfilment of a specific, passing purpose. 38. The Commissioner considers that if someone has primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of a child for a period expected to be less than three to four months, that is not enough to be more than temporary. It is unlikely that a person will meet the level of responsibility for a child to be their “dependent child” (which is required by the legislation) if the intended timeframe for them having the primary responsibility for the child’s day-to-day care is less than that. In the Commissioner’s view, the other WfFTC eligibility requirements, including that the child is the person’s dependent child, give some context to the sort of indicative time period that might be regarded as more than temporary. 39. Conversely, this means that a person who has the primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of a dependent child for a period that is, or is expected to be, more than three to four months is likely to be the child’s principal caregiver. However, if the responsibility for care is for a defined period, or for a specific, passing purpose, that will need to be taken into consideration in determining whether the responsibility for the care is nonetheless only on a temporary basis. Change of arrangements 40. If the arrangements for the care of a child change and this means that a person will no longer be a principal caregiver for the child, that person must notify the Commissioner of the change in care arrangements immediately (see s MC 10(6)). 7 Other requirements for WfFTC eligibility 41. As noted above, this QWBA is only looking at the requirements for being a principal caregiver for a dependent child. It does not consider any of the other WfFTC requirements (such as those mentioned at \[6\]). Examples 42. The following examples are included to assist in explaining when a person will be a principal caregiver for a dependent child by virtue of having primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of the child, other than on a temporary basis. These examples do not consider whether there is shared care of the child, or whether the other WfFTC eligibility requirements (such as age and residency) are met. Example 1: The primary responsibility for the day-to-day care does not change to another person 43. Tane is five years old. He lives with his parents, Anahera and Justin. Anahera is Tane’s principal caregiver. She works as a bus driver and receives WfFTC. Anahera and Justin are undertaking major renovations to their home, and they decide that Tane should stay at his grandmother’s house for approximately five months while the renovations are carried out. 44. For the following five months, Tane sleeps at his grandmother’s house and spends most of his free time there. Anahera drops Tane off to school in the mornings, and his grandmother picks him up after school. After work, Anahera and Justin spend the evenings at Anahera’s mother’s house with Tane. They eat dinner with him, help him with his homework, and put him to bed. Tane’s grandmother prepares Tane’s meals, and Anahera and Justin contribute towards the cost of groceries and other bills. Anahera takes Tane to soccer, birthday parties, and to friends’ houses to play. When Tane is sick during this time, Anahera takes him to doctor’s appointments and looks after him at her mother’s house. She spends the weekends with Tane at her mother’s house, while Justin works on the house renovations. 45. There is no question that Tane is Anahera’s “dependent child” – Anahera is primarily responsible for ensuring that he is cared for, she maintains him as a member of her family, and he is financially dependent on her. 46. Anahera wants to know if she is still considered Tane’s “principal caregiver” during the five-month period of the renovations, and so remains eligible for WfFTC during that time. 47. Anahera continues to have the primary responsibility for Tane’s day-to-day care during the period of the house renovations, while he is staying at his grandmother’s house. This is because she is the person with the main responsibility for ensuring that Tane is physically cared for on a daily basis. It is predominantly Anahera who performs the day-to-day responsibilities involved in caring for Tane, or ensures that these responsibilities are met. While Tane’s grandmother helps provide day-to-day care for Tane, Anahera continues to have primary responsibility for the provision of that care. 48. Because Anahera continues to have the primary responsibility for Tane’s day-to- day care, it is irrelevant that he is living at his grandmother’s house for a length of time that would potentially be regarded as more than temporary in terms of s MC 10(1). Tane’s grandmother does not have the primary responsibility for Tane’s day-to-day care. Anahera remains eligible for WfFTC during the renovation period. 8 Example 2: Having primary responsibility, but only on a temporary basis 49. Michelle is a single mum with a seven-year-old daughter, Isabella. Michelle works in a call centre and, as Isabella’s principal caregiver, receives WfFTC. Michelle has to undergo major surgery, and will not be able to look after Isabella for approximately one month after the surgery. During Michelle’s recovery period, Isabella is going to live with her aunt, Olivia. For that month, Olivia will take on all of the responsibilities involved in Isabella’s day-to-day care. She will be responsible for Isabella’s meals, will take Isabella to school and pick her up from after school care, will help her with her homework, supervise her leisure activities, and care for her in the evenings and on the weekends. Michelle will be unable to ensure that Isabella’s day-to-day care needs are met, and Olivia will be taking on responsibility for ensuring that they are. 50. Michelle wants to know if Olivia will be Isabella’s principal caregiver for WfF TC purposes for this period of time. 51. Olivia will have the primary responsibility for Isabella’s day-to-day care during the time she will be living with her. However, Olivia’s primary responsibility for Isabella’s day-to-day care is only on a temporary basis. This is because it is for a relatively short period (approximately one month), and is for a specific, temporary purpose, as Michelle recovers from her surgery. Olivia will therefore not be Isabella’s principal caregiver during this period, and Michelle will remain Isabella’s principal caregiver. 52. In any event, it is noted that Isabella would be unlikely to be Olivia’s “dependent child” during Michelle’s recovery period. Olivia is unlikely to assume primary responsibility for high level care decisions for Isabella (such as housing, health, education etc) during this period, and Isabella is unlikely to be financially dependent on her aunt just because her aunt is caring for her temporarily. 53. This means that Michelle will continue to receive WfFTC for Isabella during this period. Example 3: Parental caregiver changes 54. James, a single dad, is receiving WfFTC. He is unable to look after his ten-year- old son, Hayden, as his new job requires him to travel extensively. James’ sister, Margaret, who works as a retail assistant, agrees to have Hayden come and live with her until James’ circumstances change. James will only look after Hayden during his annual leave, and every few weekends when he is in town. At this stage, James does not know when he will be able to look after Hayden on a full- time basis again. Margaret looks after Hayden as if he were her own son, and James sends some money to Margaret to help with the costs of looking after Hayden. To work out who is entitled to WfFTC, James and Margaret want to know who is Hayden’s principal caregiver while this arrangement remains in place. 55. While this care arrangement exists, James will not be Hayden’s principal caregiver. He does not have the primary responsibility for Hayden’s day-to-day care during this time; Margaret does. Margaret has the main responsibility for ensuring that Hayden is physically cared for on a daily basis. She performs (or ensures the performance of) the day-to-day responsibilities involved in caring for Hayden. Margaret is taking on the responsibility of caring for Hayden for an undefined period of time, because James does not know when his work will enable him to look after Hayden on a full-time basis again. This means that Margaret is taking on the primary responsibility for Hayden’s day-to-day care on a more than temporary basis. As such, James will no longer be Hayden’s principal caregiver and will no longer be eligible for WfFTC. James is required to notify the Commissioner of the change in care arrangements immediately (see s MC 10(6)). 9 56. For Margaret to be eligible for WfFTC, Hayden must be her dependent child (see \[9\] to \[ 19\]), and the other WfFTC requirements must be met (see for example \[6\]). 57. To determine if Hayden is Margaret’s “dependent child”, it will be necessary to consider whether she has taken on primary responsibility for his care. It will be a matter of judgement whether James has given up this responsibility. This will involve considering who makes decisions about Hayden’s care (eg, housing, health, education etc), and takes the main responsibility for ensuring that Hayden is cared for physically and emotionally. In this case, it may be that Margaret has assumed such responsibility. Hayden must also be maintained as a member of Margaret’s family. This criteria would be met in this case. Finally, Hayden must be financially dependent on Margaret. While James provides some money to help with the costs of looking after Hayden, it may well be that Hayden is financially dependent on Margaret as well as James – more information about the financial arrangements would be required to determine this.

1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 16/02 GST – WHAT IS THE CORRECT RATE OF GST TO CHARGE ON LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDED TO NEW ZEALAND RESIDENT OWNERS OF LAND BEING COMPULSORILY ACQUIRED? All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about ss 8 and 11. Section 66 of Part 5 of the Public Works Act 1981 provides that the owner of land compulsorily taken can recover reasonable legal costs incurred. It has been drawn to the Commissioner’s attention that there is some doubt about the correct rate of GST to be charged on legal services supplied to New Zealand resident owners of land that is being compulsorily acquired. The argument for zero-rating the legal services supplied is that the supply of the land is the only supply made by the land owner to which the compensation for the legal fees incurred can relate. As the supply of the land to the relevant body will be zero-rated under s 11(1)(mb), so should the supply of the legal services. Question 1. At what rate should GST be charged on legal services provided by legal professionals to New Zealand resident land owners in the process of their land being compulsorily acquired? Answer 2. When the legal services are supplied by a GST registered person, GST will be charged under s 8(1) at the standard rate of 15%. 3. The same conclusion will apply to the supply of other services obtained by the New Zealand resident owner of land being compulsorily acquired by the Crown or local authority, eg valuation or surveying services. 4. Section 66 of the Public Works Act 1981 provides that the owner can recover reasonable costs incurred when their land is compulsorily acquired by the Crown or local authority. This includes reasonable valuation and legal fees or costs incurred in respect of the land taken or acquired. Similarly, s 62 of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011 and cl 80 of the Greater Christchurch Regeneration Bill 2015 each provide that the owner can recover actual costs incurred when their land is compulsorily acquired. While the Crown or local authority may pay the invoices issued by the services providers, the services are supplied to the landowner. Explanation Background 5. This item applies to legal services provided to a New Zealand resident owner of land that is to be compulsorily acquired by the Crown or a local authority under the Public Works Act 1981. When land is compulsorily acquired, the land owner is entitled under the Public Works Act 1981 to full compensation from the relevant body for any loss or injury suffered. This will include compensation for any 2 reasonable legal fees incurred by the land owner in the process of the land being acquired by the relevant body. Analysis 6. Section 8(1) requires a registered person to charge GST on the (non-exempt) supply of goods and services made in New Zealand in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the registered person. The rate of GST charged is 15% unless ss 11–11B require the GST to be charged at a rate of 0%. The provision being relied on to zero-rate the supply of legal services to land owners is s 11(1)(mb), which reads as follows: 11 Zero-rating of goods (1) A supply of goods that is chargeable with tax under section 8 must be charged at the rate of 0% in the following situations: ... (mb) the supply wholly or partly consists of land, being a supply— (i) made by a registered person to another registered person who acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies; and (ii) that is not a supply of land intended to be used as a principal place of residence of the recipient of the supply or a person associated with them under section 2A(1)(c); or ... 7. It is well established that GST is a tax on transactions (CIR v New Zealand Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 (CA) at 13,193). The statutory provisions are directed at the contractual arrangements between the supplier and the recipient of the supply (Wilson & Horton Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 (CA) at 12,328). As Durie J stated in CIR v Capital Enterprises Limited (2002) 20 NZTC 17,511 (HC) at \[50\]: The position seems rather to be that the Act taxes transactions at a given point in the transaction but the question of who are the parties is determined by reference to the general principles of the relevant contract law. Certainly I can see no basis for divorcing the supply and receipt of goods and services for the purposes of the Act from contractual relationships. A contract may be formed by the simple act of supplying and receiving. Equally, the Act \[sic\] of supplying and receiving may arise as part of a larger contractual arrangement. Ms Norris is undoubtedly correct in submitting that the core provisions of the Act, ss 6–10, are directed to contractual arrangements between the suppliers and the recipients of the supply (and see Wilson & Horton Ltd v C of IR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 (CA) and in particular Richardson J at p 12,328, Penlington J at p 12,335 and McKay J at p 12,333; Director-General of Social Welfare v De Morgan (1996) 17 NZTC 12,636 at p 12,641). It follows, as Ms Norris submitted, that the tax attaches to the supply to the person who at contract can require its performance. \[Emphasis added\] 8. The focus on contractual relationships means that the nature of the supply for GST purposes will be determined with reference to the rights and obligations created between the parties to the contract (New Zealand Refining (CA) at 13,192; Rotorua Regional Airport Ltd v CIR (2010) 24 NZTC 23,979 (HC) at \[50\]). The application of the statutory provisions will not be determined with reference to anyone who is not party to the contract (Wilson & Horton (CA) at 12,333). What are the contractual relationships between the parties? 9. The Commissioner considers that the contractual relationship is between the legal professional, as supplier of legal services, and the land owner, as recipient of that supply. The Crown or the local authority, as the case may be, is not a party to this contract. The supply of legal services is a separate supply from the supply of the land by the owner to the Crown or local authority. The Crown or local authority does not instruct the legal professional to provide legal services to the land owner. Consequently, the Crown or local authority cannot require 3 performance of the transaction. This is so despite their statutory obligation under Part 5 of the Public Works Act 1981 to compensate the land owner for the reasonable or actual loss incurred in obtaining the legal advice. 10. The contractual and other relationships may be illustrated as follows: Legal / contractual flow Possible cash flow What is the correct GST treatment? 11. Because the contractual relationship is between the legal professional and the land owner, the nature of the supply will be determined under that contract. The services supplied by the legal professional under the contract will be legal advice or other related services. While the advice or other services supplied will relate to the compulsory acquisition of the land by the Crown or local authority, the supply does not “wholly or partly \[consist\] of land” as required under s 11(1)(mb). This is because the supplier – the legal professional – is not supplying the land. Rather, the supply made by the legal professional wholly consists of legal advice or other related services. In this light, s 11(1)(mb) is not relevant. 12. Therefore, s 11(1)(mb) does not apply to zero-rate the supply of legal services to the owner of the land that is being compulsorily acquired by the Crown or local authority. This means that the rate of GST to be charged by the legal professional to the New Zealand resident land owner is the standard rate under s 8(1) of 15%. What if the Crown or local authority pays the fees directly to the legal professional? 13. That the Crown or local authority may pay the legal fees directly to the legal professional does not alter the conclusion that GST is charged at the standard rate of 15% on the supply of the legal services to the owner of the land being acquired (Turakina Maori Girls College Board of Trustees v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,032 (CA) at 10,036). The Crown or local authority’s obligation is to compensate the land owner for the reasonable or actual costs incurred in obtaining the legal services.

1 Classified Public QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 16/03 GOODS AND SERVICES TAX – GST TREATMENT OF BARE TRUSTS All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about ss 51, 57(2), 60(1) and 60(1B). Question 1. Is it the trustee or the beneficiary of a bare trust who makes supplies in respect of the trust property for GST purposes? Answer 2. It is the beneficiary of a bare trust who makes supplies in respect of the trust property for GST purposes, unless the trustee and the beneficiary agree otherwise under s 60(1B). This is because it is the beneficiary that carries on any taxable activity and may be registered or liable to be registered under s 51. Explanation 3. Any reference to “beneficiary” in this Question We’ve Been Asked includes “beneficiaries”. 4. This Question We’ve Been Asked applies once it has been established that a trustee holds property on bare trust for a beneficiary. Whether a bare trust exists in any given situation must be determined on the facts of each case. What is a bare trust? 5. A bare trust is a type of trust under which the trustee holds property on trust without any duties to perform other than to convey the trust property to the beneficiary or as the beneficiary directs. The reference to “duties” in this definition is to duties that the settlor has specified. For example, the trustee may have been appointed to hold the property as nominee, or the settlor may have required that the beneficiary be maintained until becoming entitled to call for capital and income on reaching the age of majority. Once the beneficiary reaches the age of majority, the trustee no longer has a duty to maintain the beneficiary. In both situations, the trustee is “bare” of any duties specified by the settlor. However, so long as a trustee holds property on trust, they always retain their legal duty to take reasonable care of the trust property. The trustee cannot escape this duty: Herdegen v FCT 88 ATC 4995 (FCA); Waters’ Law of Trusts in Canada (4 th ed, Carswell, Toronto, 2012) at 33–34. 6. Therefore, a bare trustee has not only a duty to transfer the trust property to the beneficiary (or as directed by the beneficiary), but also a legal duty to take reasonable care of the trust property in the meantime: Herdegen; CGU Insurance Ltd v One Tel Ltd (in liquidation) \[2010\] HCA 26; Corumo Holdings Pty Ltd v C Itoh Ltd (1991) 24 NSWLR 370 (CA); ISPT Nominees Pty Ltd v Chief Commissioner of State Revenue \[2003\] NSWSC 697. 7. What a bare trustee must do to fulfil their duty to protect trust property depends on the nature of the trust property and any threats to the trust property. However, a bare trustee must refrain from active management that does not fall 2 Classified Public within the duty to maintain the trust property: Bruton Holdings Pty Ltd (in liquidation) v FCT (2011) 193 FCR 442 (FCAFC). When can a bare trust arise? 8. A bare trust can be created by an express declaration of trust, either in writing or orally. It can also arise without a declaration of trust. One of the most common scenarios in which a bare trust arises is where a purchaser (the beneficiary) provides someone else (usually called a nominee) with the purchase money to purchase an asset. This type of bare trust may also be described as a resulting trust: Herdegen. 9. The question of which party makes supplies for GST purposes arises because the bare trustee is likely to have legal ownership of the trust property, but the beneficiary is absolutely entitled to the trust property. Before considering which party makes supplies for GST purposes, we must consider which party is carrying on the taxable activity. The GST Act is concerned only with supplies that are made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Can a bare trustee carry on a taxable activity? 10. A taxable activity is an activity that is carried on continuously or regularly and that involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person. To be a taxable activity, the activity need not be carried on for pecuniary profit: s 6(1)(a). An activity, in the context of ss 6 and 8, points to the combination of tasks undertaken or course of conduct pursued by the registered person: CIR v Bayly (1998) 18 NZTC 14,073 (CA). 11. In the context of a bare trust (and the question being considered), any taxable activity is likely to involve the property held by the bare trustee. The issue arises because it is generally considered that the range of activities that a bare trustee could undertake (and remain a bare trustee) would not extend to carrying on a taxable activity. 12. However, the Commissioner considers that the activities of a bare trustee could meet the definition of “taxable activity” where the bare trustee is discharging their duty to:  transfer property in accordance with the directions of the beneficiary, or  maintain the trust property. 13. An example where this may occur is where a bare trustee in a nominee situation holds commercial property that is subject to a lease. A leasing activity may be a taxable activity: Bayly. 14. Therefore, we must consider whether it is the trustee or the beneficiary of a bare trust who carries on the taxable activity and makes and receives supplies in respect of the trust property for GST purposes. Who makes and receives supplies under a bare trust? 15. The Commissioner considers that it is the beneficiary of a bare trust who carries on the taxable activity and makes and receives supplies in respect of the trust property for GST purposes. Any taxable activity is carried on by the beneficiary, rather than a bare trustee, based on agency principles and case law. Agency principles 16. The trustee is the legal owner of trust property. Generally, legal ownership is the basis for claiming GST inputs and returning outputs: Case N39 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,333; Case P84 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,561; Pine v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,570 3 Classified Public (CA); Case T35 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,235. A person may, however, be both a trustee and an agent. An agent is a person who has authority to act for someone (called the principal) to create a legal relationship between the principal and someone else: CIR v Capital Enterprises Ltd (2002) 20 NZTC 17,511 (HC); Case 14/2014 (2014) 26 NZTC ¶2-024. The acts of an agent are attributed to the principal under the common law of agency: Lilyvale Hotel Pty Ltd v FCT 2009 ATC ¶20-094 (FCAFC). 17. An express agency contract is not necessary for an agency relationship to exist. An agency agreement can be implied from the conduct of the parties: Papalia v Romeo \[2011\] NSWSC 696; Marr v Parkin \[2014\] NZHC 3269. 18. A bare trustee has no independent power or discretion relating to the trust property other than to take reasonable care of the trust property. Therefore, any supply involving the trust property that does not fall within that duty must be made on the instructions of the beneficiary. In such circumstances, in the absence of an express agency, there would be an implied agency: Trident Holdings Ltd v Danand Investments Ltd (1988) 64 OR (2d) 65 (ONCA). 19. The Commissioner considers that the relationship between a beneficiary and a bare trustee acting on the directions of the beneficiary is predominantly an agency relationship: Trident Holdings; Collins v The Queen (2002) GTC 314 (TCC); Butler (ed), Equity and Trusts in New Zealand (2 nd ed, Thomson Reuters, Wellington, 2009) at \[16.6.1\], fn 102; Laws of New Zealand: Agency at \[5\]; JD Heydon, MJ Leeming, Jacobs’ law of trusts in Australia (7 th ed, LexisNexis Butterworths, Chatswood, 2006) at \[210\]; Nuncio D'Angelo, Commercial trusts (LexisNexis Butterworths, Chatswood, 2014) at \[3.34\] and \[3.46\]. 20. Section 60 applies to agency relationships. This means that:  a supply a bare trustee makes for and on behalf of the beneficiary is treated as a supply the beneficiary makes, unless the bare trustee and the beneficiary agree in writing to treat the supply as two separate supplies (ie, a supply from the beneficiary to the bare trustee and a supply from the bare trustee to the recipient): s 60(1) and 60(1B);  a supply made to a bare trustee for and on behalf of the beneficiary is treated as a supply made to the beneficiary: 60(2). 21. The effect of s 60 is that any taxable activity carried on by a bare trustee that involves making supplies on behalf of a beneficiary is carried on by the beneficiary rather than the trustee (unless the trustee and the beneficiary agree otherwise in writing under s 60(1B)). 22. Therefore, the beneficiary (rather than the trustee) is the person entitled or required to register for GST for that taxable activity. Case law principles 23. However, the Commissioner accepts that the agency principles may not apply in every instance where there is a bare trust. In these circumstances, case law suggests that a supply to or from a bare trustee would be treated as a supply to or from the beneficiary: Case R1 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,001; CIR v Campbell Investments & Anor (2004) 21 NZTC 18,559 (HC). While Case R1 was overturned on appeal (after further evidence established that a bare trust did not exist: Union Corporate Services Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,151 (HC)), Case R1 makes it clear that, had a bare trust existed, it is the beneficiary of the trust who would have been the person carrying on the taxable activity and receiving the supply in question. In Campbell Investments, a syndicate of three taxpayers carried on the taxable activity of renting commercial properties . One member of 4 Classified Public the syndicate held the legal title to the properties on trust for the syndicate. The trustee later transferred the legal title to the properties to the members of the syndicate. Wild J held that there was no supply as the beneficial owners already owned the properties and were entitled to have legal title transferred to them on request. He considered that the transfer of their share of the legal title to the properties from one syndicate member to the other members was “irrelevant” to the carrying on of the syndicate’s taxable activity. He noted that the syndicate’s taxable activity had previously been carried on without issue while one syndicate member held legal titl e to the properties . Conclusion 24. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the beneficiary (rather than the trustee) remains the person entitled or required to register for GST. In most cases, this will be because the agency provisions of the Act apply to put the position beyond doubt. In situations where agency principles do not apply, case law supports the position that the beneficiary carries on the taxable activity and makes and receives any supplies. Does s 57(2) apply to a bare trust? 25. Section 57(2) contains special rules that apply when unincorporated bodies such as trusts are registered for GST purposes. Section 57(2) deems any supplies made or received in the course of carrying on the body's taxable activity to be made or received by the body (and not the members of the body). The section also confirms that the members of the body are not liable to register for GST. The Commissioner considers that s 57(2) does not apply to the trustees of a bare trust because it will be the beneficiary under a bare trust who carries on any taxable activity and is therefore the person entitled or required to register for GST (unless the trustee and the beneficiary agree otherwise in writing under s 60(1B)). 26. However, there may be more than one beneficiary under a bare trust (like the syndicate members in Campbell Investments). Given that the Commissioner considers it is the beneficiaries under a bare trust who make supplies and therefore conduct any taxable activity, that group of beneficiaries may be an unincorporated body for the purposes of s 57(2). Whether the beneficiaries are an unincorporated body must be determined on the facts of each case by considering whether there is sufficient comity, agreement (formal or otherwise), or actions indicating a joint endeavour for the beneficiaries to be an unincorporated body: Newman & Ors v CIR, Holdsworth & Ors v CIR, Hair & Ors v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,666 (HC); Case P70 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,469; Case T40 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,267; Case U19 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,186. What about a bare trustee’s transfer of trust property to the beneficiary? 27. A bare trustee’s transfer of trust property to the beneficiary is not a supply, as the beneficiary already owns the property beneficially and is entitled to have legal title transferred to them on request: Campbell Investments. What if the bare trustee is registered for GST instead of the beneficiary? 28. If you think you may have taken a tax position in past tax years that is different from the Commissioner’s position in this Question We’ve Been Asked, discuss the matter with your tax advisor, or Inland Revenue, and consider making a voluntary disclosure. 5 Classified Public Examples 29. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Example 1 – Bare trustee enters into lease agreements on behalf of beneficiaries 30. Starlight Nominees Ltd is the legal owner of three commercial rental properties as bare trustee on behalf of two business partners, Greg and Rhonda. Greg and Rhonda take care of the day-to-day activities of the rental business and instruct Starlight to enter into all leases and other contracts as required. There is no written agreement between Starlight and Greg and Rhonda under s 60(1B). In this case, Starlight is both bare trustee and agent for Greg and Rhonda. The supply of the properties for rent is treated as a supply made by Greg and Rhonda: s 60(1), Case R1 and Campbell Investments. Example 2 – Bare trustee transfers trust property to third party 31. Greg and Rhonda decide to sell one of the properties and instruct Starlight to enter into an agreement for sale and purchase of real estate with the purchaser and to transfer the property to the purchaser on settlement. In this case also, Starlight is both trustee and agent for Greg and Rhonda. The supply of the property to the purchaser is treated as a supply made by Greg and Rhonda: s 60(1), Case R1 and Campbell Investments. Example 3 – Bare trustee transfers properties to beneficiaries 32. Greg and Rhonda now decide to hold the legal title to the remaining properties in their own names. They instruct Starlight to transfer the legal title in the properties to them. The transfer of the legal title to Greg and Rhonda is not a supply to them for GST purposes, because Greg and Rhonda already own the properties beneficially.

1 Classified Public QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 16/04 GOODS AND SERVICES TAX – GST TREATMENT OF PARTNERSHIP CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. References to the PA are to the Partnership Act 1908. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about ss 8 and 57. Question 1. Is a GST registered partnership required to account for output tax on a capital contribution made by a partner? Answer 2. No. If there is any supply of goods and services in return for the capital contribution, then it is a supply made by a partner or partners, not the partnership. 3. The transfer of a partnership interest by an existing partner is the supply of a service, namely a chose in action consisting of a fractional interest in the future profits of the partnership business and in any surplus of assets over liabilities on winding up. 4. Where a partnership capital contribution is made in return for the transfer of a partnership interest from an existing partner, the supply of the partnership interest is made by the existing partner. The partnership interest is not supplied by the partnership. The supply of a partnership interest by a partner is made in their capacity as a partner of the partnership. 5. However, not all partnership capital contributions will necessarily involve the supply of a partnership interest. Where there is no supply of a partnership interest, no supply of any goods and services is made by the partnership. 6. The deeming provisions in ss 57(2)(b) and 57(2)(c) do not apply to the supply of a partnership interest by a partner in consideration for partnership capital contributions. That is, the supply of a partnership interest by a partner in return for a capital contribution is not deemed to be made by the partnership for GST purposes. This is because the supply of the partnership interest will not have been made in the course of the partnership’s taxable activity. 7. Consequently, no GST is charged by the partnership on the supply of a partnership interest that is transferred in return for a partnership capital contribution. Explanation Background 8. QB 14/03: “GST – transfer of interest in a partnership”, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 5 (June 2014): 57, considered the transfer of partnership interests by individual partners, where any payment by the recipient was made to the individual partner(s) who transferred their interests. This item considers situations when a new or existing partner in a partnership contributes capital to the partnership, as opposed to transferring it to an individual partner. 2 Classified Public Analysis Introduction 9. For GST purposes, a “partnership” has the meaning set out in the Partnership Act 1908 (PA) (definition of “partnership” in s 2(1)). Under s 4(1) of the PA, a “partnership” is “the relation which subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view to profit”. The nature of the relationship between the partners is contractual. That is, the partners have agreed to enter into a legally binding contractual relationship with each other (Pooley v Driver (1876) 5 Ch D 458 at 472). A partnership is not a legal entity separate from its partners (Sadler v Whiteman \[1910\] 1 KB 868 (CA) at 889; R v Holden \[1912\] 1 KB 483 (CA) at 487; Meyer & Co v Faber (No 2) \[1923\] 2 Ch 421 (CA); Mephistopheles Debt Collection Service v Lotay \[1995\] 1 BCLC 41 (CA)). 10. For GST purposes, a partnership is an “unincorporated body”. Despite a partnership not being a separate legal entity under ordinary law, there are special GST rules in the Act in relation to unincorporated bodies, including partnerships. These are set out in s 57 and allow the unincorporated body to be registered when carrying on a taxable activity. For partnership capital contributions, only s 57(2) is of direct relevance. 11. Where a partnership carries on any taxable activity and is registered for GST purposes (preliminary words of s 57(2)):  the partnership shall be registered under the name of the partnership (s 57(2)(d));  the partners shall not be registered (or liable to be registered) in relation to the carrying on of that taxable activity (ie, the taxable activity carried on by the partnership) (s 57(2)(a));  the partnership is deemed to supply any goods and services supplied in the course of carrying on that taxable activity (and the partners are deemed not to have supplied them) (s 57(2)(b));  any goods and services supplied to, or acquired by, the partners (acting in their capacity as members of the partnership) in the course of carrying on that taxable activity, not being goods or services to which s 57(2)(b) applies, are deemed to be supplied to, or acquired by, the partnership (and are deemed not to be supplied to, or acquired by, the partners) (s 57(2)(c));  any change of members of the partnership has no effect for GST purposes (s 57(2)(e)). 12. For s 57(2) to apply to partnership capital contributions, the following questions need to be answered:  Is the partnership capital contribution consideration for a supply of goods and services? If it is, then: o Is the supply of goods and services made to, or acquired by, a partner acting in their capacity as a member of the partnership under s 57(2)(c)? o Is the supply made in the course of carrying on the partnership’s taxable activity under s 57(2)(b) or s 57(2)(c)?  Is the partnership capital contribution ignored under s 57(2)(e) because it relates to a change of partners in the partnership? 3 Classified Public Is the partnership capital contribution consideration for a supply of goods and services? 13. If there is a supply of goods and services when a partnership capital contribution is made, it will be a supply of a partnership interest. A partnership interest is a partner’s share in the partnership property. It is the proportion of the partnership assets to which the partner would be entitled if the partnership was dissolved (Re Bainbridge (1878) 8 Ch D 218 at 223). 14. Richardson J described the nature of a partnership interest in Hadlee and Sydney Bridge Nominees Ltd v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,116 (CA) at 8,126: A share in a partnership is a chose in action. It is a fractional interest in the future profits of the partnership business and in a surplus of assets over liabilities on a winding up. The partner does not have title to specific partnership property but has a beneficial interest in the entirety of the partnership assets and in each and every particular asset of the partnership (Lindley on Partnership 15th ed, 516; Maw v Maw \[1981\] 1 NZLR 25). \[Emphasis added\] 15. In the same case at 8,118–8,119, Cooke P described the nature of a partnership interest in this way: As noted in this Court in Maw v Maw \[1981\] 1 NZLR 25, the expression “share in a partnership”, which is commonly used and was used on the deed of assignment in the present case, is a somewhat loose one. The true position, so far as now relevant, is that the partners have proprietary interests in equity in all the assets, including the gross income. ... All these proprietary interests of partners are assignable in equity. ... ... As between the assignor and a trustee to whom he has assigned his “share” in the partnership, the section \[s 34(1) of the PA\] in no way limits the effect of the assignment. The assignor has divested himself of the beneficial proprietary interest to the extent that he has assigned it, and there is no restriction on his power to do so. In this case the references in the deed of assignment to the share of the profits and to accounts on dissolution are expressed to be without limiting the generality of the absolute assignment of “the Property”, being “... the percentage of the Partner’s share in the partnership ... represented by the number of units specified in the Second Schedule ...” In equity the manifest intention is entitled, I think, to full effect. As to 12.8 of the units the assignor has deprived himself of any beneficial interest, whether in capital or in income. In equity the entire beneficial interest in that (undivided) 40 per cent of his share, including the same proportion of any gross partnership income as and when received, vests in the family trust. \[Emphasis added\] 16. Because a partnership interest is a chose in action, a supply of a partnership interest is a supply of services (definition of “services” in s 2(1)). 17. Under ordinary law, any supply of a partnership interest will necessarily be a supply made by a partner to another partner (either existing or new). The transfer of partnership interests is made by the partners because the partnership is a not a legal entity separate from the partners such that it could itself supply partnership interests. 18. In practical terms, a retiring partner may transfer their interest in the partnership to a new partner or when an additional partner joins the partnership, the existing partners must give up some of their partnership interests to the newcomer for that person to become a partner. A simple example would be where the partners in a two person partnership invited a third person to become a partner. Previously the two partners each had a 50% partnership interest but now some of their interests are transferred to the third person. 19. This is consistent with the conclusions drawn in QB 14/03, where the payment by the recipient was made to the individual partner(s) who transferred their interests. Therefore, whether the payment by the incoming partner is made to an individual partner or partners, or is made as a partnership capital contribution, is irrelevant. In either case, any supply of a partnership interest will necessarily be a supply made by a partner to another partner (either existing or new). 4 Classified Public 20. However, not all partnership contributions will necessarily involve the supply of a partnership interest. For example, where the existing partners make contemporaneous capital contributions in proportion to their existing partnership interests (eg, two partners, each holding a 50% partnership interest, each contribute an additional $10,000), the partnership interest of each partner does not change. A second example relates to the capital contributions made by the partners of a newly created partnership. In this case, there are no existing partnership interests to be supplied. Rather, the partnership interests are created as a matter of law by the formation of the partnership. A third example relates to capital contributions made by existing partners where the default provisions of the PA apply (s 27(a) of the PA). Section 27(a) of the PA reads as follows: 27 Rules as to interests and duties of partners subject to special agreement The interests of partners in the partnership property, and their rights and duties in relation to the partnership, shall be determined, subject to any agreement (express or implied) between the partners, by the following rules: (a) all the partners are entitled to share equally in the capital and profits of the business, and must contribute equally towards the losses, whether of capital or otherwise, sustained by the firm: 21. Where the default provisions of the PA apply, the partnership interest of an existing partner who makes a capital contribution will remain unchanged. Consequently there will be no supply of a partnership interest. Is the supply of the partnership interest made to, or acquired by, a partner acting in their capacity as a member of the partnership? 22. Even if there is a supply of a partnership interest by a partner or partners when a partnership capital contribution is made, s 57(2)(c) will only apply if the partner(s) made the supply in their capacity as a member of the body. “Member” is defined in s 2(1) as including “a partner”. So, in other words, the supply must be made by the partner acting in their capacity as a partner. 23. The supply of a partnership interest involves the supply of a share of the partner’s beneficial interest in the partnership assets (Hadlee at 8,126). Without the consent of the other partners, no partner may deal with partnership property. This is according to s 23(1) of the PA, which reads as follows: All property and rights and interests in property originally brought into the partnership stock, or acquired (whether by purchase or otherwise) on account of the firm or for the purposes and in the course of the partnership business, are called in this Act partnership property, and must be held and applied by the partners exclusively for the purposes of the partnership and in accordance with the partnership agreement. 24. This is consistent with the nature of the relationship between the partners, namely that they have agreed to enter into a legally binding contractual relationship with each other (Pooley v Driver at 472). 25. Therefore, a partner only has a partnership interest because of the partnership relationship. They cannot deal with it without the consent of the other partners. In this light, the Commissioner considers that a partner who transfers part or all of their partnership interest when a partnership capital contribution is made by another person will have made that supply in their capacity as a partner. The partner making the supply of their partnership interest could not be acting in any other capacity given the nature of what is supplied and the nature of the relationship with the other partners. Is the supply of the partnership interest made in the course of carrying on the partnership’s taxable activity? 26. Sections 57(2)(b) and 57(2)(c) will only apply when the supply is made by, or to, the partner “in the course of carrying on the taxable activity”. This is a different 5 Classified Public test from the general supply test under s 8(1) which refers to supplies made “in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity”. The phrase “in the course of” is not defined in the Act. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12 th ed, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2011) defines the phrase “in the course of” as follows: in (the) course of 1 undergoing (the specified process). 2 during (the specified period). 27. In Public Trustee v Henderson & Pollard, Limited \[1956\] NZLR 180 (Compensation Court), Dalglish J considered the meaning of “in the course of” in the context of the phrase “arising out of or in the course of the employment” as used in the Workers’ Compensation Act 1922. At 184–185, he stated: In various cases, the Courts have framed tests which must be satisfied in order to bring an accident within the course of a worker’s employment. Thus, in St Helen’s Colliery Co Ltd v Hewitson \[1924\] AC 59; 16 BWCC 230, Lord Atkinson said: “A workman is acting in the course of his employment when he is engaged ‘in doing something he was employed to do’. Or what is, in other and I think better words, in effect the same thing— namely, when he is doing something in discharge of a duty to his employer, directly or indirectly, imposed upon him by his contract of service. The true ground upon which the test should be based is a duty to the employer arising out of the contract of employment, but it is to be borne in mind that the word ‘employment’ as here used covers and includes things belonging to or arising out of it” (ibid 71; 238). This lastmentioned statement of the law was expressly approved in Newton v Guest, Keen & Nettlefolds, Ltd (1926) 19 BWCC 119, 125. \[Emphasis added\] 28. At 185–186, Dalglish J stated that “in the course of” an activity also includes “natural incidents” of that activity or things “necessarily incidental” to that activity. 29. At 185, Dalglish J rejected the view that “in the course of” was equivalent to “during”. While something that occurred “in the course of” employment would occur during the time that someone was employed, something more was required. The event must have happened while the person was doing something that they were employed to do (or while doing something that was naturally or necessarily incidental to their employment). Consequently, the Commissioner considers that the second dictionary definition noted in \[26\] above, in the absence of something more, is not sufficient for a supply to have been made in the course of carrying on the partnership’s taxable activity. Rather, as indicated in the first dictionary definition and in Henderson & Pollard, the supply must be made as part of carrying on the partnership’s taxable activity while undergoing that taxable activity. That is, the supply must belong to or arise out of the taxable activity or it must be a natural or necessary incident of the taxable activity. 30. Examples of supplies made in the course of carrying on a taxable activity can be seen from the facts in Case M129 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,839 at 2,845 and Case S41 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,280. In Case M129, Judge Barber held that hiring staff was a “normal incident” of running a drapery taxable activity and was therefore undertaken in the course of that taxable activity. In Case S41, an agreement entered into by a professional partnership to lease office premises was in the course of the partnership’s taxable activity. 31. As noted above, the phrase used in s 57(2) – “in the course of” – differs from the phrase commonly used in the Act, namely “in the course or furtherance of”. The term “furtherance” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary as: furtherance n. the advancement of a scheme or interest. 32. In Case N43 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,361, Judge Bathgate held that the purchase and relocation of dwellings on to land that was being subdivided and sold was in the furtherance of the taxpayer’s taxable activity. This was because it was for the purpose of enhancing the sale prospects of the subdivided land. At 3,366, Judge Bathgate distinguished “in the furtherance of” from “in the course of”: 6 Classified Public An act done for the purpose or object of furthering the taxable activity, or achieving its goal, can be to help, achieve, or advance, and thus a “furtherance” of a taxable activity, although it may not necessarily be always in the course of that taxable activity. 33. In summary then, something done in the course of a taxable activity will be something belonging to, or arising out of, that taxable activity. It will include anything that is a necessary or natural incident of the taxable activity. Where something is not done in the course of a taxable activity, it may nevertheless be in the furtherance of the taxable activity if it advances it or helps to achieve its goals. 34. Consistent with the use of the phrase “in the course of” in the Act, the Commissioner considers that a direct connection or nexus is needed between the supply of goods and services and the operation or carrying on of the taxable activity for the supply to have been made “in the course of” carrying on that activity. This is consistent with Case S84 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,526 at 7,533 where Judge Barber stated that s 57(2) was intended to apply to “day to day supplies”: ... in my view, s 57(2) was meant to apply to the day to day supplies to or from an unincorporated group by making it clear that, where members make or receive supplies, they are deemed to be doing so on behalf of the partnership. I suggested that the aim of s 57(2) is to make it clear that where people operate an unincorporated body (eg a partnership), then they can register the body for GST purposes and do not need to register each member of it; and supplies (outputs) in the course of the body’s activity, made by one or more members of the body (or their agents), are deemed made by the body and not by the member; similarly with inputs regarding supplies to a member of the body for the body. \[Emphasis added\] 35. On the basis of the above discussion, the Commissioner considers that Parliament deliberately chose to restrict the application of ss 57(2)(b) and 57(2)(c) to when the goods and services are supplied “in the course of carrying on \[the partnership’s\] taxable activity”. This means that these paragraphs will not apply to supplies of goods and services merely made in the furtherance of the partnership’s taxable activity. 36. In the context of the supply of a partnership interest by a partner in return for a partnership capital contribution, the Commissioner considers that the supply of partnership interests relates to the ownership structure of the taxable activity, rather than to the operation or carrying on of the taxable activity. That the ownership structure is not directly related to the carrying on of the taxable activity can be seen from the fact that a different ownership structure would have no impact on the operation of the taxable activity. It could equally be carried on by a sole trader or by a company, for example. Therefore, the supply of a partnership interest will not be made in the course of the partnership’s taxable activity. Consequences 37. It has been concluded that:  The transfer of a partnership interest by an existing partner is the supply of a service, namely a chose in action consisting of a fractional interest in the future profits of the partnership business and in any surplus of assets over liabilities on winding up.  Where a partnership capital contribution is made in return for the transfer of a partnership interest from an existing partner, the supply of the partnership interest is made by the existing partner. The partnership interest is not supplied by the partnership. The supply of a partnership interest by a partner is made in their capacity as a partner of the partnership. 7 Classified Public  However, not all partnership capital contributions will necessarily involve the supply of a partnership interest. Where there is no supply of a partnership interest, no supply of any goods and services is made by the partnership.  The deeming provisions in ss 57(2)(b) and 57(2)(c) do not apply to the supply of a partnership interest by a partner in consideration for partnership capital contributions. That is, the supply of a partnership interest by a partner in return for a capital contribution is not deemed to be made by the partnership for GST purposes. This is because the supply of the partnership interest will not have been made in the course of the partnership’s taxable activity.  Consequently, no GST is charged by the partnership on the supply of a partnership interest that is transferred in return for a partnership capital contribution. 38. Section 57(2)(a) states that the partners shall not be registered in relation to the carrying on of the partnership’s taxable activity. Consequently, supplies of partnership interests by partners in return for a partnership capital contribution will only be subject to GST if one or more partners carry on a separate taxable activity that involves the supply of partnership interests (and that supply is not an exempt supply of a “participatory security” (discussed in detail in QB 14/03)). 39. These conclusions are consistent with those drawn in QB 14/03. That item considered the GST treatment of the transfer of a partnership interest from one partner to a new or existing partner where there was no consequent capital contribution to the partnership. Is the partnership capital contribution ignored under s 57(2)(e) because it relates to a change of partners in the partnership? 40. Under s 57(2)(e), “any change of members” of a partnership has no effect for GST purposes. The supply of a partnership interest by a partner in return for a partnership capital contribution may involve a change in members, although this is not always the case. But even if there is a corresponding change in members, how s 57(2)(e) applies to the supply of partnership interests (if it applies at all) must be determined. 41. In this regard, unless the partner’s taxable activity involves the supply of partnership interests (something that, although possible, would be out of the ordinary), it has been concluded that no GST is chargeable on the supply of a partnership interest in return for a partnership capital contribution. 42. The Commissioner has identified two possible interpretations of s 57(2)(e). The first is that the provision only determines that there are no GST implications arising from a change of members of a partnership. That is, changing partners in itself does not give rise to any GST implications. This interpretation still means that a supply of a partnership interest by one partner to another could, potentially, be subject to GST if the right circumstances existed. In the discussion that follows, this is referred to as the “narrow approach”. 43. Alternatively, a “wider approach” is to interpret the provision to mean that whenever there is a change in members of a partnership – which can only ever occur by virtue of one or more partners supplying their partnership interest to a new or existing partner – then there is no effect for GST purposes at all. Adopting this approach would mean that s 57(2)(e) applies to both the change in composition of the partnership and the mechanism by which that is achieved (ie, the supply of the partnership interest). 8 Classified Public 44. In the Commissioner’s view, the reference to a change of members, rather than to changes of membership interests, indicates the intended scope of the provision. For GST purposes, a registered unincorporated body, including a partnership, is treated as continuing to be the same body despite a change of members. For example, if a partnership has 25 partners and two retire and one new partner joins, the change of members does not create a new unincorporated body for GST purposes. The partnership is treated as being the same registered person before and after the change of members. It is noted that a partnership that reduces to one partner (and, therefore, is no longer a partnership at general law) will also no longer be an “unincorporated body of persons” or a partnership for GST purposes. 45. This interpretation is consistent with the narrow approach outlined above that s 57(2)(e) is limited to ensuring the continuity of an unincorporated body. There is nothing to suggest that Parliament intended this paragraph to be interpreted more widely so that the supply of a partnership interest is not a supply for GST purposes. However, the supply will not be a taxable supply unless the partnership interest is supplied in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the partner who makes the supply. As noted earlier, this would be possible but uncommon. 46. Therefore, s 57(2)(e) only appears to apply to the registration and cancellation of registration provisions. That is, s 57(2)(e) means that a partnership is not required to cancel its registration when its members change and then re-register the new partnership. This will reduce the compliance costs and GST recovery issues of a change in members. Correct GST treatment of partnership capital contributions 47. Where a partnership capital contribution involves the transfer of a partnership interest from an existing partner, there will be a supply of services, namely a chose in action. However, not all partnership capital contributions will necessarily involve such a supply. 48. A partner who transfers part or all of their partnership interest when a partnership capital contribution is made by another person will have made that supply in their capacity as a partner. The Commissioner considers that the partner making the supply of their partnership interest could not be acting in any other capacity given the nature of the services supplied. 49. The deeming provisions in ss 57(2)(b) and 57(2)(c) do not apply to the supply of partnership interests by partners in consideration for partnership capital contributions. This is because the supply of a partnership interest will not be made in the course of the partnership’s taxable activity. 50. The non-application of ss 57(2)(b) and 57(2)(c) means that the supply of a partnership interest by a partner in return for a partnership capital contribution is not deemed to be made by the partnership for GST purposes. Consequently, the supply of a partnership interest by a partner in return for a capital contribution will only be subject to GST if the partner is required to charge GST under s 8(1). Under s 57(2)(a), the partners shall not be registered in relation to the carrying on of the partnership’s taxable activity. Therefore, the supply of a partnership interest by a partner in return for a partnership capital contribution will only be subject to GST if the partner carries on a separate taxable activity that involves the supply of partnership interests. 9 Classified Public 51. The Commissioner considers that s 57(2)(e) only applies to the registration and cancellation of registration provisions. That is, s 57(2)(e) means that a partnership is not required to cancel its registration when its members change and then re-register the new partnership.

1 Classified Public QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 16/05 INCOME TAX – DONEE ORGANISATIONS AND GIFTS The purpose of this QWBA is to provide guidance about when a donee organisation may issue a donation receipt for payments made to them by individual supporters. The QWBA includes some examples of common fundraising activities. Donee organisations include organisations like charities, schools, religious, sporting and cultural organisations that are not carried on for private financial gain of any individual and that meet certain other requirements. The Commissioner understands donee organisations and individuals/natural persons who support these organisations (referred to as “supporters” in this QWBA) need more certainty on when payments are gifts for income tax purposes. This is important for donee organisations when issuing donation receipts, and for their supporters when claiming donation tax credits. While ultimately it is the Commissioner’s decision whether a supporter receives a donation tax credit for a particular payment to a donee organisation, it is important to understand the circumstances in which donee organisations may issue donation receipts. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act) unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about ss LD 1 to LD 3. This item updates and replaces the previous statements made by the Commissioner in “Charitable Donations: Fund Raising Functions and Sponsorship” in Public Information Bulletin No 125 (March 1984): 2 and “Cost of Function Ticket: When Charitable Portion Can Qualify for Rebate” in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 2 (August 1994): 18. Question 1. When may a donee organisation issue a donation receipt to a supporter so the supporter is able to claim a donation tax credit? Answer 2. A donee organisation may issue a donation receipt for donation tax credit purposes when a supporter makes a “charitable or other public benefit gift” to the organisation of $5 or more. 3. The term “donee organisation” refers to an organisation not carried on for the private pecuniary profit (personal financial/monetary gain) of any individual and that meets one of the descriptions in s LD 3(2). “Donee organisation” is a broad term and may include, but is not limited to, charitable entities registered under the Charities Act 2005. It also includes organisations listed in sch 32 to the Act. 2 Classified Public 4. A “charitable or other public benefit gift” is a gift of money, or a subscription, of $5 or more paid to a donee organisation (as long as that subscription provides no rights arising from membership). It does not include testamentary gifts (ie , a gift made in a will). 5. A gift is a payment made voluntarily by a supporter to a donee organisation by way of benefaction in return for which the supporter receives no material benefit or advantage. If a supporter buys something from a donee organisation, such as a ticket to an event or goods the donee organisation is selling, the payment is not a gift. Explanation 6. The purpose of this QWBA is to provide guidance to donee organisations on when they may issue donation receipts to individuals who support the organisation by making one-off or regular payments to the organisation. These individuals are referred to as “supporters” in this QWBA. Additionally, this QWBA aims to assist supporters to understand when they can successfully claim a donation tax credit if they have received a donation receipt. What is a donation tax credit? 7. Part L of the Act contains the rules about tax credits and how they may be used for meeting tax obligations. Subpart LD sets out the rules for donation tax credits (ss LD 1 to LD 3). 8. A donation tax credit is available for a charitable or other public benefit gift made by a supporter to a donee organisation if the requirements in ss LD 1 to LD 3 are met. Donation tax credits are refundable credits. 9. Section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) sets out the requirements for claiming a donation tax credit. An individual taxpayer may complete an IR526 - Tax credit claim form, detailing any charitable or other public benefit gifts made in a tax year. The Commissioner requires this claim to be supported by relevant receipts, each from a donee organisation and each with “donation” written on it. The Commissioner considers the application and then notifies the individual of the amount of tax credit that will be allowed. 10. The sum of charitable or other public benefit gifts made by an individual taxpayer in a tax year must not exceed their taxable income for that year. If the sum does exceed the taxpayer’s taxable income, the Commissioner must reduce the total amount of charitable or other public benefit gifts so the taxable income is not exceeded (ss 41A(3) and (4) of the TAA). Who may issue a donation receipt for donation tax credit purposes? 11. A “donee organisation” may issue a donation receipt for donation tax credit purposes. A donee organisation is defined in s YA 1 as an organisation that fits one of the descriptions in s LD 3(2) or is listed in sch 32 to the Act. 12. Donee organisations must not be carried on for the private pecuniary profit (personal financial/monetary gain) of any individual. Subject to that requirement, the types of organisations that may be able to issue donation receipts are:  a society, institution (including a public institution), association, organisation, or trust whose funds are applied wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand; 3 Classified Public  a fund (including a public fund) established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money to such donee organisations;  a community housing entity that meets the requirements of s CW 42B;  a Board of Trustees constituted under Part 9 of the Education Act 1989; and  a tertiary education institution. 13. In addition, some organisations may seek approval to be donee organisations, even though they do not meet the requirements of s LD 3(2). These organisations are listed in sch 32. Schedule 32 organisations are organisations Parliament has agreed to recognise as donee organisations. 14. As seen from the list in \[12\] above, donee organisations may include, but are not limited to, organisations registered as charitable entities under the Charities Act 2005. Donee organisations may also include organisations with benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand, and which meet the requirements of s LD 3(2). 15. A searchable list of organisations whose donee organisation status has been confirmed by Inland Revenue for the purposes of s LD 1 is available at http://www.ird.govt.nz/donee-organisations/. Who may claim a donation tax credit? 16. Individual taxpayers may claim donation tax credits (s LD 2). Companies and Māori authorities cannot claim donation tax credits even if they hold a donation receipt from a donee organisation. This is because other provisions in the Act (ie, the deduction provisions) apply to gifts made by them (see ss DB 41 and DV 12). Other types of taxpayers (eg, absentees (as defined in s YA 1), unincorporated bodies, partnerships and trustees) are excluded from claiming donation tax credits. What is a “charitable or other public benefit gift”? 17. The phrase “charitable or other public benefit gift” is defined in s LD 3(1). It means a monetary gift of $5 or more paid to a donee organisation. It also includes a subscription of $5 or more paid to a donee organisation, but only if the subscription provides no rights arising from membership in that donee organisation or any other society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund (see s LD 3(1)(b)). It does not include testamentary gifts (ie, gifts made through a will). 18. To qualify as a monetary gift, the gift needs to be money of $5 or more paid to a donee organisation. For example, payment may be by cash, cheque, direct debit, credit card or debit card. However, a charitable or other public benefit gift does not include transfers of value, ie, money’s worth. For example, a charitable or other public benefit gift does not include the making of a loan to a donee organisation, the forgiving of a loan made to the donee organisation or the transfer of other types of property (eg, art works) or money’s worth (eg, free services) to a donee organisation. What is a gift? 19. The term “gift” is not defined in the Act. In the absence of a definition, the Commissioner considers “gift” should be given its ordinary meaning. This is consistent with the Court of Appeal’s decision in Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154. 4 Classified Public 20. However, New Zealand case law on the ordinary meaning of “gift” is limited. In contrast, the Australian and Canadian courts have considered the ordinary meaning of the term “gift” on a number of occasions. In the absence of New Zealand case law, the Commissioner considers it appropriate to take guidance from the overseas case law. 21. The key principles on the meaning of “gift” taken from case law, are:  For a payment to be a “gift” it must be made voluntarily and no advantage of a material character may be received by the giver in return for the payment (FCT v McPhail (1968) 117 CLR 111 (HCA), The Queen v Zandstra \[1974\] 2 FC 254).  A payment is not generally regarded as being made voluntarily if it is made under a contractual or some other legal obligation. (Although there may be some limited circumstances where a contractual payment may still be described as voluntary.) (Leary v FCT (1980) 80 ATC 4,438 (FCA))  A payment is voluntary even if made under a sense of moral obligation (Leary).  Gifts do not need to be for benevolent reasons, but an essential element of a gift is that it is made by way of benefaction. Benefaction involves the concept that the recipient is advantaged to the extent of the payment. A gift ordinarily proceeds from a detached and disinterested generosity (Leary).  A gift will not be made by way of benefaction if the giver (or someone else) receives an advantage of a material character in return for making the payment (Leary, Klopper v FCT (1997) 97 ATC 4,179 (FCA)).  A payment that places the recipient under an obligation to do or provide something in return for the payment is not a gift (Leary).  A material benefit or advantage to the giver will prevent a payment from being a gift if it is provided in return for the payment, ie a sufficient nexus or connection exists between the payment made and the relevant benefit or advantage (Leary, Coleman v The Queen (2010) TCC 109, DTC 1,096).  Only material advantages gained in return for a payment should be relevant when deciding whether a gift has been made (Leary).  Fame or honour gained by a supporter from making gifts is not an advantage of a material character (Leary).  Moral benefit or favourable tax treatment (such as the ability to claim a donation tax credit in New Zealand) are not advantages of a material character (The Queen v Friedberg ( 1991) 92 DTC 6,031 (FCA Canada)).  A supporter being relieved of a liability as a result of making the payment is a material advantage (Klopper). 22. The Commissioner considers the New Zealand courts, as the Canadian courts have done, would likely adopt the approach taken by the Australian courts in McPhail and Leary (and subsequent decisions, such as Klopper) on the meaning of “gift” in the context of ss LD 1 to LD 3. When will the Commissioner consider a payment to be a gift? 23. Based on the above case law, the Commissioner considers a “gift” in s LD 3(1) to be a payment of money of $5 or more:  made voluntarily,  by way of benefaction, and 5 Classified Public  in return for which the supporter receives no material benefit or advantage. 24. When deciding if a payment to a donee organisation is a gift, the true nature of the payment is to be determined by considering the overall arrangements and transactions giving rise to the payment. 25. Firstly, the payment must be made voluntarily. This means something more than that the payment was made freely by choice. A supporter’s payment is not voluntary if it is made under an arrangement (contractual or otherwise) where the payment is made in return for a material benefit or advantage. This is the case even when the arrangement is entered into freely or for benevolent reasons. 26. Generally, payments under a contract are not voluntary, but the presence or absence of a contract does not always indicate whether a payment is “made voluntarily”. The mere existence of a contract may not disqualify a payment from being a gift if there is no nexus or link between the contract and the payment. For example, there may still be a gift if A and B agree to make donations to a donee organisation, or if A agrees with B to match any gift made by B to a donee organisation. 27. On the other hand, the absence of a contract does not always mean a payment is made voluntarily. A payment is unlikely to be a gift in situations where there is some agreement or understanding in place between the donee organisation and the supporter where the supporter is to receive a material benefit or advantage. Similarly, a payment may not be a gift where there is some agreement or understanding that the donee organisation is to do or provide something in return for the payment. For example, a supporter intends to make a gift of a car to a donee organisation but instead of gifting the car (which would not qualify for a tax credit) the person arranges to make a gift of money to the organisation. The donee organisation then uses the gifted money to purchase the car from the supporter. See Revenue Alert 11/01. 28. Secondly, the requirement that a gift is made voluntarily is connected with the concept of benefaction and the belief that gifts usually proceed from a detached and disinterested generosity. Benefaction is the idea that a gift is made to provide an advantage to, or to do good for , the recipient. Benefaction is an important element of a gift in its ordinary sense; when it is absent there can be no gift (Leary). 29. Conversely, the existence of benefaction does not, by itself, establish that a payment is a gift. For example, benefaction does not qualify a payment as a gift if the payment was not made voluntarily or there is a material benefit or advantage for the supporter in return for making the payment. 30. Thirdly, to be a “gift” the supporter must receive no material benefit or advantage in return for the payment. This is discussed below in more detail. When will the Commissioner consider a payment is not a gift? 31. The Commissioner considers a payment will not be a “gift” where:  the supporter’s payment is made in return for a material benefit or advantage, or  the donee organisation is placed under a material obligation to do or provide something in return for the supporter making the payment. 6 Classified Public 32. A material benefit or advantage does not need to come directly from the donee organisation and does not need to be received directly by the supporter who made the payment (eg, someone else may deliver or receive the benefit) so long as under the arrangement the material benefit or advantage to the supporter is in return for making the payment. Material benefit or advantage 33. A benefit or advantage will be considered “material” if it is of substance and can be valued and/or owned. (Sometimes these benefits are referred to as pecuniary or proprietary benefits.) In this context, determining if a benefit or advantage is material is not a comparative materiality test (as is used in accounting practice). Rather, the question is whether the benefit has some value that is able to be objectively ascertained. An example of a material benefit would be a book sold by an organisation in their gift shop given to a supporter in return for making a payment to a donee organisation. Another example would be the offer of a 10% discount on a purchase from the organisation’s gift shop in return for a payment. (In the case of a discount, it does not matter whether the supporter takes advantage of the offer; it is the availability/provision of the discount in return for the supporter’s payment that is the material benefit (unless the maximum value of the discount is in itself trivial (de minimis).) 34. A benefit or advantage will not be material if it is intangible and cannot be valued or owned. This includes benefits or advantages that might give a supporter a good feeling, bring them public recognition or make them happy. Non-material advantages include such things as public acknowledgement - for example, when an individual supporter’s name is printed in a donee organisation’s newsletter as a way of acknowledging their gift. This acknowledgment might make the supporter feel proud, but that benefit has no objectively ascertainable value. On the other hand, if a supporter is in business and is given public recognition by a donee organisation for commercial advertising purposes, that will be a material benefit. Sponsorship of donee organisations by businesses generally fall into this category. In such a case, although a donation tax credit will not be available, the supporter may be entitled to an income tax deduction for the cost of sponsoring a donee organisation. 35. Sometimes a benefit or advantage may have a value in the eyes of the donee organisation or the supporter, but that value is not of substance and cannot be objectively ascertained. In that case, the benefit will not be “material”. For example, meeting the conductor after a concert might be a valuable and enjoyable experience for an enthusiastic orchestra supporter. However, if the experience is usually given for free, it is likely it will have no objectively ascertainable value and will not be a material benefit. 7 Classified Public Sufficient link between payment and benefit or advantage 36. Not every material benefit or advantage will necessarily disqualify a payment from being a gift. A payment will not be a gift where there is a sufficient link between the supporter’s payment and any material benefit or advantage gained in return. The strength of the link between the supporter’s payment and the benefit determines whether the payment is a gift. This can usually be determined from the circumstances surrounding the gift. For example, a sufficient link to disqualify a payment as a gift will exist where:  the supporter knowingly seeks the benefit in return for making the payment, or  the donee organisation offers the benefit as an inducement for the payment. 37. An example of a material benefit provided in return for a supporter’s payment is the offer of a free ticket to a concert in return for a minimum donation amount. Another example is where a supporter makes a payment to a donee organisation in return for an invitation to a dinner with a guest celebrity speaker. 38. Sometimes a payment may be a gift even if the supporter obtains a material benefit. This happens when the connection between the payment and the benefit is too remote to prevent the payment from being a gift. An example of a material advantage not having a sufficient link to a payment is where an arthritis sufferer makes a $50 donation to a national arthritis drug research charity. While the arthritis sufferer may ultimately obtain a material benefit in the form of a new treatment, the connection between the benefit and the payment is too remote for the benefit to prevent the payment from being a gift (Coleman). 39. Depending on the circumstances, other factors might have a bearing on the strength of link between a supporter’s payment and a benefit, including such things as the relationship between the supporter, the donee organisation or any ultimate recipient, any conditions attached to the payment, and the parties’ expectations of how the payment will be used (Coleman). When deciding if a payment to a donee organisation is a gift, the true nature of the supporter’s payment is to be determined by considering the overall arrangements and transactions that gave rise to the payment. In considering all the circumstances, it is important to remember that gifts ordinarily proceed from a detached and disinterested generosity (Leary). Can a benefit obtained by the supporter ever be overlooked? Stewardship 40. Sometimes organisations will thank and acknowledge their supporters’ generosity by inviting them to a function or by giving them a token of appreciation. This is often referred to as “stewardship”. In those situations, a benefit provided to a supporter by a donee organisation, even if material, may not disqualify a supporter’s payment from being a gift. 41. Stewardship activities are not part of any agreement or arrangement between the donee organisation and the supporter, and will often be unplanned and based on opportunity. A supporter has no expectation of being invited to participate in stewardship activities when making a payment to a donee organisation. In these circumstances there is an insufficient link or connection between the supporter’s payment to the donee organisation and the stewardship activity such that it cannot be said that the supporter’s payment is made in return for any benefit. 8 Classified Public Accordingly, the provision of true stewardship benefits by a donee organisation will not usually prevent supporters’ payments being gifts. Minimal benefit or advantage 42. Occasionally, benefits or advantages obtained by a supporter in return for making a payment to a donee organisation will be so minimal or trivial they can be overlooked, in accordance with de minimis principles. 43. To be overlooked under de minimis principles, the benefits must be minimal or trivial both in their own right and when compared with the payment made. For example, a supporter makes a donation of $50 and is promised in return and receives a plastic key ring with the donee organisation’s logo printed on it. Although the supporter obtained a “benefit” in return for the $50 payment, the plastic key ring is too trivial in its own right, and in comparison to the amount of the payment, to prevent the payment from being a gift in those circumstances. Can a gift be for a specific purpose? 44. Sometimes gifts are paid by supporters to a donee organisation for a specific purpose or project, for example, to a church for a new church building or to a hospital for a new baby incubator. The fact that an organisation seeks donations for a specific project will not, in itself, prevent the payment being a gift. In the Commissioner’s view, a gift made for a specific purpose will not cease to be a gift so long as it has the attributes of a gift and there is no material benefit or advantage provided in return for the supporter making the payment. Further, the fact that the supporter, or people close to the supporter, may be among those who ultimately benefit from a project (eg, the supporter’s family attends the church receiving the payment or is within the area served by the hospital receiving the payment) may not disqualify the payment from being a gift. However, the stronger the connection between the supporter’s payment and any material benefit or advantage obtained in return, the less likely it is that the payment will qualify as a gift. Can part of a payment be a gift? 45. The Commissioner considers a supporter’s payment cannot be split into a gift component and a non-gift component where a supporter receives a material benefit or advantage in return for making that payment. 46. The term “gift” describes a particular transaction. The legal arrangements entered into and carried out by the parties establish the nature of that transaction. If a supporter’s payment is not a gift at common law, it is not open to the parties to then describe the payment as comprising two separate payments – one for consideration (eg, a sale) and one made voluntarily for no consideration (a gift). For example, if the price paid for an item at a charity auction to raise funds for a donee organisation exceeds the value of the item, the amount paid in excess of its value cannot be treated as a gift. No donation receipt may be issued in that situation. 47. However, a donation receipt may be able to be issued where a supporter makes two payments contemporaneously to a donee organisation. For example, if a supporter purchases tickets to an event being hosted by a donee organisation and at the same time voluntarily supports the donee organisation by making an additional payment, the additional voluntary payment may be a gift. For the additional payment to be a gift, the supporter must be able to attend the event regardless of whether any additional payment is made – ie, the ticket purchase must not be dependent on the supporter making an additional payment. In that 9 Classified Public situation, the donee organisation may choose to issue a single invoice to the supporter, so long as it clearly identifies the two separate payments (the ticket sale and the gift), and a donation receipt may be issued for the gift made by the supporter. Examples 48. The following examples are provided to illustrate the Commissioner’s view on when certain common fundraising activities may or may not involve gifts. Example 1 – Charity dinner and dance 49. Sally purchases a ticket to a dinner and dance being put on as a fundraising event by her favourite dog refuge charity, which is a donee organisation. The ticket costs her $150 and entitles her to attend the event. The charity calculates it will raise approximately $90 from each ticket sold to help feed and re-house stray dogs. None of the ticket price paid by Sally is a gift. The charity has sold the ticket to Sally for $150. The charity should not issue a donation receipt to Sally for any portion of the ticket price. 50. In contrast, if the charity sold each ticket for $100 and at the same time asked ticket purchasers to consider making a donation to the charity of $20, $50, $100 or any other amount chosen by the supporter, and Sally opted to buy a ticket and make a $50 donation, the charity may issue a donation receipt to Sally for the $50. 51. While at the charity dinner, Sally is asked if she would like to contribute towards the cost of a new kennel block at the dog refuge. She agrees to make a donation of $500. The charity is very grateful and they advise Sally she will be acknowledged in their next newsletter. The charity may issue a donation receipt to Sally for $500. The public acknowledgement of her generosity is not a material benefit. Example 2 – Charity auction 52. Simon has purchased tickets to attend a dinner and charity auction to raise funds for a local community group supporting children in need. The community group qualifies as a donee organisation. 53. Before the auction night, the community group asks local people to contribute “prizes” that it can auction off to raise funds. Clare, a local artist, donates a painting. The painting would ordinarily sell at one of Clare’s exhibitions for $300. The painting sells at the auction for $500. Although Clare has donated the painting to the community group, she should not be given a donation receipt as she has not made a gift of money to a donee organisation. 54. On the night of the auction, after an enjoyable dinner, various donated items are sold by auction to the guests to raise funds for the charity. Simon bids on a signed rugby jersey. A similar jersey recently sold in an online auction for $200. Simon is keen to support the charity and so he bids $800 for the signed jersey and wins the auction. Although Simon may have purchased the jersey for well in excess of the recent online auction price, no amount of the purchase price he paid is a gift. The charity should not issue a donation receipt to Simon. Example 3 – Supporter package for dramatic society 55. Bruce loves going to the theatre and he likes to support his local dramatic society, which is a donee organisation. To help with its funding, the society offers a variety of supporter packages for different levels of financial support. A supporter makes 10 Classified Public a specified cash “donation” and in return receives the package of benefits associated with that level of payment. This year Bruce selects a Silver package for $150. The benefits of the Silver Package include two tickets, an opportunity for a private “behind the scenes” visit before a performance, and acknowledgement as a Silver supporter in the next season’s programme. 56. No amount of Bruce’s $150 payment is a gift. The dramatic society has sold Bruce a package that he has purchased for an agreed amount. While Bruce has voluntarily purchased the package, knowing it will help the society, he has not made a gift because he obtains material benefits in return for the payment (the tickets are a material benefit). The dramatic society should not issue a donation receipt to Bruce. Example 4 – Supporter package for performing arts centre 57. The Pohutukawha Performing Arts Centre, a donee organisation, decides to offer its patrons a new range of supporter packages. Patrons who purchase performance tickets are given the option of making a donation at different levels – Crimson ($100), Silver ($250), Gold ($1,000) and Platinum (>$1,000). Sylvia chooses to become a Crimson supporter. Sylvia purchases two performance tickets and makes a donation of $100. In return for her donation Sylvia will be acknowledged as a Crimson supporter in the next season’s programme and she will be invited to meet the cast of the current production. 58. In this case, there are two separately identifiable amounts paid to the donee organisation, the ticket price and the $100 donation by Sylvia to become a Crimson supporter. The $100 donation is a gift because Sylvia has voluntarily chosen to make the donation, and while she does receive benefits in return, they are not material benefits. The public recognition of an individual supporter by a donee organisation is not a material benefit. The invitation to meet the cast, while exciting for Sylvia, in this case has no objectively ascertainable value, as the cast do not usually meet the public and so do not ordinarily charge for the opportunity. The tickets were purchased separately and were not provided in return for the donation. The centre may issue Sylvia a donation receipt for $100. Example 5 – Hospice afternoon tea 59. Matt makes regular donations to the hospice, which is a donee organisation. In recognition of his on-going support and generosity (and to keep him engaged with the organisation), the hospice invites Matt to a “Friends of the Hospice” afternoon tea where the hospice takes the opportunity to thank all its regular donors and explain its plans for the coming year. 60. The afternoon tea was not planned when Matt made his donations and was not part of any package offered to Matt by the hospice to encourage him to make donations. It is a stewardship activity. The invitation to the afternoon tea does not stop the payments Matt has made (and hopefully will continue to make) from being gifts. The benefit of the afternoon tea is not in return for the payments Matt makes to the hospice. Example 6 – Christmas cards and donation 61. Felicity received a letter from a donee organisation, which is also a registered charity, offering her the opportunity to purchase a pack of 10 hand-painted Christmas cards for $20. On the order form, Felicity could also choose to add a donation. She chose to purchase one pack of cards and to make a donation of $30. She sent the card order away with her credit card details authorising a payment of $50. 11 Classified Public 62. The charity then sent her the ordered cards and a donation receipt for $30. This is correct. Felicity’s $50 payment comprised two separately identifiable amounts paid to the charity - $20 to purchase the cards and the $30 donation. The donation portion was made voluntarily, and Felicity sought no material advantage in return for making the additional payment. The cards Felicity obtained were not conditional on her payment of the additional $30. Example 7 – Friend of the Surf Lifesaving Club 63. Hoani is an active member of his local surf lifesaving club, which is a donee organisation. As a way for members to contribute to the club’s financial wellbeing, the club offers members the option of becoming Friends of the Surf Club by making a donation of $500 or more. By being a Friend of the Surf Club, Hoani is not entitled to any special benefits beyond being named on the Friends board in the clubrooms and receiving a Friend bumper sticker for his car. Hoani donates $500 to the surf lifesaving club. The club may issue Hoani with a donation receipt. This is because he receives no material benefit in return for his payment. Being named on the Friends board is not a material benefit and therefore will not prevent the payment from being a gift. The benefit of the bumper sticker is insignificant, both in its own right and in comparison to Hoani’s payment, so it may be overlooked. Example 8 – Payments to a Local Football Club 64. Jill's two children are junior members of the local football club, which is a community-focused sports club that qualifies as a donee organisation. Jill pays membership fees to the club for her two children, with membership giving her children the entitlement to train and play in their respective age-group football teams. The club has also recently been fundraising for five new sets of goals for the club's 30 junior teams, and Jill makes a $100 donation to the club as part of this fundraising. 65. The membership fees paid by Jill are not gifts, and they are not "subscriptions" that qualify as gifts because junior membership rights are provided in return for the fees. However, the club may issue Jill with a donation receipt for her $100 donation. 66. In this case, the fact that Jill's children, as junior members of the club, may benefit from the club's fundraising activities does not disqualify her payment from being a gift. This is because any benefit or advantage in this context is too remote and therefore is not in return for Jill's payment to the club. 12 Classified Public References Subject references Charitable or other public benefit gift Gift Tax credits Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007, ss LD 1 to LD 3, YA 1 (definition of “charitable or other public benefit gift”) Tax Administration Act 1994, s 41A Cases cited Coleman v The Queen (2010) TCC 109, DTC 1,096 FCT v McPhail (1968) 117 CLR 111 (HCA) Klopper v FCT (1997) 97 ATC 4,179 (FCA) Leary v FCT (1980) 80 ATC 4,438 (FCA) Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154 (CA) The Queen v Friedberg (1991) 92 DTC 6,031 (FCA Canada) The Queen v Zandstra \[1974\] 2 FC 254
Classified Public 1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 16/06 INCOME TAX – LAND ACQUIRED FOR A PURPOSE OR WITH AN INTENTION OF DISPOSAL This QWBA provides guidance about when proceeds from the disposal of land acquired with a purpose or intention of disposal are taxable under s CB 6 – one of the land taxing provisions. The QWBA explains how s CB 6 applies, and its relationship with the 2-year bright-line test (another land taxing provision). The QWBA also discusses some common misconceptions about s CB 6, and includes examples to illustrate when it will apply. One of Inland Revenue’s focuses is compliance with the land taxing provisions (including s CB 6 and the 2-year bright-line test), and as part of this work Inland Revenue conducts a range of activities to identify and address non-compliance with those rules. There is more information about the land taxing provisions and rules at http://www.ird.govt.nz/property/, including a tool (the “property tax decision tree”) to help you work out if any of the land provisions apply to you. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about s CB 6. Question 1. If I buy land for a purpose or with an intention of selling it, do the proceeds of the sale need to be included as income for tax purposes? Answer 2. Yes. If you buy land for a purpose or with an intention of selling it, the proceeds of the eventual sale, whenever that occurs, will be income under s CB 6 unless one of the exclusions from that rule (for residential land and business premises) applies. Explanation What is the relevant taxing provision? 3. Section CB 6(1) provides that: CB 6 Disposal: land acquired for purpose or with intention of disposal Income (1) An amount that a person derives from disposing of land is income of the person if they acquired the land— (a) for 1 or more purposes that included the purpose of disposing of it: (b) with 1 or more intentions that included the intention of disposing of it. 4. As s CB 6 says, an amount that you derive on the disposal of land will be income if you acquired the land for a purpose or with an intention of disposing of it. Disposal does not have to be your dominant purpose or intention. Disposal does not just mean sale; it also includes, for example, gifting or settling on trust. 5. There are two exclusions from this – for residential land and for business premises. Even if you acquired the land for a purpose or with an intention of Classified Public 2 disposing of it, you will not be taxed on the proceeds on sale if one of those exclusions (discussed further below at \[7\]) applies. 6. If s CB 6 does not apply, you may need to consider the other land provisions in the Act, including the 2-year bright-line test (see further from \[8\]). There are different exclusions depending on which of the land provisions is being considered, and they have different criteria. So you should not presume that because you can use an exclusion from one taxing provision other taxing provisions will also not apply. For example, you might potentially fall within the “residential exclusion” from s CB 6, but not within the “main home exclusion” from the 2-year bright-line test. What are the exclusions from s CB 6? 7. As noted above, if you acquired land for a purpose or with an intention of disposing of it you will not be taxed under s CB 6 if you satisfy one of the two exclusions from that provision – for residential land (s CB 16) and for business premises (s CB 19). The requirements for those exclusions are set out below. Residential land exclusion from s CB 6 Section CB 16 sets out the residential land exclusion from s CB 6. If the land has a house on it, or you build one, and you occupy the house mainly as a residence, you will not be taxed under s CB 6 on the proceeds from selling the property. This also applies if you are trustee of a trust, and a beneficiary of the trust occupies the house mainly as a residence. The house has to be acquired and occupied, or built and occupied, mainly as a residence. This means your occupation of the house cannot be incidental to another more significant purpose, eg, sale (see for example Case G76 (1985) 7 NZTC 1,348, Case K21 (1988) 10 NZTC 218 and Case M102 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,634). To use this exclusion, the area of the land has to be 4,500 square metres or less, or if it is bigger, the larger area has to be required for the reasonable occupation and enjoyment of the house. Please note that you cannot use this exclusion if you have a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of houses, or building and disposing of houses. Again, remember that this residential exclusion is different from the main home exclusion from the 2-year bright-line test, and has different requirements. The information published by Inland Revenue about how the main home exclusion from the bright-line test works is only relevant to considering that exclusion. Business premises exclusion from s CB 6 Section CB 19 sets out the business premises exclusion from s CB 6. The exclusion will apply for business premises that you acquired and occupied or built and occupied mainly to carry on a substantial business from them. If the exclusion applies, you will not be taxed under s CB 6 on the proceeds from selling the property. A property mainly used for investment (eg, being rented out) is not premises acquired and occupied mainly to carry on substantial business from, so would not fall within the exclusion (see for example Case D20 (1979) 4 NZTC 60,558). To use this exclusion, the land and the premises have to be reserved for the use of the business, and the area of the land can be no greater than that required for the reasonable occupation of the premises and the carrying on of the business. Classified Public 3 Please note that you cannot use this exclusion if you have a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of, or building and disposing of, premises for businesses. Remember that this exclusion has its own specific requirements. The information published by Inland Revenue about what “business premises” are for the bright- line test is only relevant to considering if the bright-line test applies. How does the purpose or intention rule relate to the 2-year bright-line test? 8. The 2-year bright-line test came into force on 1 October 2015, and can potentially apply if you first acquired an estate or interest in land on or after that date (the normal rules about when you first have an interest in land will determine this). 9. The 2-year bright-line test may apply to tax any gains from residential land if you sell the land within two years of when you are treated as acquiring it for the purposes of this test. The 2-year bright-line test is in addition to the other land sale rules (including s CB 6) that have been in New Zealand’s tax law for many years. It can apply if none of sections CB 6 – CB 12 apply. 10. Because the 2-year rule can only apply if none of sections CB 6 to CB 12 apply, you need to consider the application of those provisions first. If you acquired land for a purpose or with an intention of disposing of it and none of the exclusions apply, you will be taxed under s CB 6 rather than s CB 6A, even if the disposal is within two years. 11. If none of ss CB 6 – CB 12 apply, the 2-year bright-line test (s CB 6A) may tax any gains from residential property if the “bright-line date” 1 for your disposal is within two years of when you acquired the property. Your purpose or intention is not relevant to the 2-year bright-line test. 12. There are special rules about when you are treated as acquiring the land for the 2-year bright-line test, which differ from when you are treated as acquiring the land for the other land sale rules. In a typical land purchase situation, the 2-year period for the bright-line test will start when the title is registered to you. There are some exclusions from the 2-year bright-line test, including an exclusion for your main home. When will the proceeds of a land sale be income under s CB 6? 13. As noted above, an amount that you derive on the disposal of land will be income under s CB 6 if you acquired the land for a purpose or with an intention of disposing of it. But remember that there are exclusions for residential land and business premises that might apply (see \[5\]). 14. The key things to bear in mind in deciding if s CB 6 applies are:  What matters is your purpose or intention when you acquired the land.  A purpose or intention of disposing of the land does not need to be the only purpose or intention you had when you acquired the land. It also does not need to be your dominant or main purpose or intention. It is enough if disposal is one of your purposes or intentions.  Disposing of the land has to be more than a vague idea or just a possibility or option in the future. You have to have a firm purpose or intention of disposing of the land. 1 This is the date you are essentially treated as disposing of the land for the purposes of the 2-year bright-line test. It is not usually the same date that you dispose of the land for the purposes of the other land sale rules. In a typical sale of land, it will be when you enter into a binding agreement to sell the land. Classified Public 4  The test of whether you had a purpose or intention of disposing of the land is subjective. But what you say your purpose or intention was will be assessed against all of the evidence.  Evidence of what your purpose or intention was before you acquired the land (eg, during the whole acquisition process) can be taken into account.  The extent of commitments you make or steps you take shortly after you acquired the land may also be relevant in testing what your subjective purpose or intention was when you acquired the land (eg, if these things contradict what you say your purpose or intention was).  The length of time you held the land may also be taken into account, and if you have a pattern of acquiring and disposing of land within relatively short timeframes, that is likely to be relevant.  It is up to you to show that you did not acquire the land for a purpose or with an intention of disposing of it. (See for example: CIR v Boanas (2008) 23 NZTC 22,046 (HC), Case N59 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,457, Harkness v CIR (1975) 2 NZTC 61,017 (SC), Anzamco Ltd (in liq) v CIR (1983) 6 NZTC 61,522 (HC), Case Y3 (2007) 23 NZTC 13,028 and Jurgens & Doyle v CIR (1990) 12 NZTC 7,074 (HC).) When do you test what my purpose or intention was? 15. As noted above, it is your purpose or intention when you acquired the land that is relevant. 16. The rules in s CB 15B establish when you are treated as acquiring land for the purposes of the land provisions (except the 2-year bright-line test). 2 In a typical land sale, this will be when you enter into a binding contract to purchase the land, even if there are some conditions that need to be met. \[The time of acquisition may be different in some circumstances, for example, if you acquired the land through exercising an option (s CB 15B(3)), or if a company obtains land under an agreement entered into before it was formed (s CB 15B(2)).\] What if I did not have any firm intention when I bought the land? 17. If at the time you acquired the land you did not have a firm purpose or intention of disposing of it, you will not be taxed on the proceeds of its eventual sale under s CB 6. 18. However, if the Commissioner questions whether you acquired the land with a purpose or intention of disposal, you must be able to show that you did not. What you say your purpose or intention was will be assessed against all of the evidence. As to what evidence may be relevant, see from \[34\]. What if my intention changes and I decide not to sell the land? 19. The only thing that is relevant is your purpose or intention when you acquired the land. If you acquired the land with a purpose or intention of disposing of it, but change your mind and decide to do something else (eg, rent the property out), you will still be taxed on the proceeds if you eventually sell it. 2 These rules about when land is acquired apply for disposals of land on or after 22 November 2013. Classified Public 5 What if I own the land for more than 10 years before I sell it? 20. A common misconception is that if you hold the land for more than 10 years you will not be taxed on the sale proceeds. This is not true. If you acquired the land with a purpose or intention of disposal, s CB 6 will apply to tax the proceeds whenever you eventually sell the land (subject to the exclusions discussed at \[7\]). What if I have rented out the property and paid tax on the rental income? 21. As noted above, if you acquired the land with a purpose or intention of disposing of it, it does not matter if you rent it out in the meantime (whether because you always planned to rent the property out before selling it, or because you changed your mind and decided to rent the property out instead of selling it straight away). You will still be taxed on the proceeds when you eventually sell the land. This is the case even though the rental income will have been subject to tax. The rental income and any profit on the sale are both taxed under the Act (see s CC 1). What if I only sell some of the land? 22. If you acquired the land with a purpose or intention of disposing of it, it does not matter if you divide the land and sell only some of it at any one time – you will still be taxed on the proceeds of all of the land whenever it is sold. Similarly, it does not matter if you sell the land you acquired together with some other land. The proceeds on the sale of the original piece of land you acquired with a purpose or intention of disposal will be taxed under s CB 6 irrespective of what you subsequently do with the land or its boundaries (see ss CB 6(3) and CB 23B). 23. If you divide land, there are other provisions that could also be relevant to whether you are taxed on the disposal of the land – for example s CB 12 (Disposal: Schemes for development or division begun within 10 years) or s CB 13 (Disposal: Amount from major development or division and not already in income). What if I buy some land intending to subdivide it and sell some and keep some? 24. If you acquire land intending to sell some and keep some, you will only be taxed on the disposal of the part you acquired to sell. You would need to have satisfactory evidence to show how much of the land or what part of the land you did not acquire for a purpose or with an intention of disposal. (See for example: Bedford Investments Limited v CIR \[1955\] NZLR 978 (SC), Harkness v CIR (1975) 2 NZTC 61,017 (SC) and Church v CIR (1992) 14 NZTC 9,196 (HC).) What if I buy the land through a trust, company or partnership? 25. Section CB 6 can apply regardless of whether the property is acquired by an individual person or an entity such as a trust, partnership or company. If the owner is a trust or company, it is generally the purposes or intentions of the trustees or directors that are relevant in deciding if s CB 6 applies. (See for example: CIR v National Distributors Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346 (CA), Trustees of the B Trust v C of IR \[2013\] NZTRA 5, FC of T v Whitfords Beach Pty Ltd 82 ATC 4031 (HCAFC), Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v FC of T 83 ATC 4015 (SCNSW), and Aotea Group Securities Ltd v C of IR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,052 (HC).) If the owner is a partnership, it is the purpose of the partnership that is relevant. (See s HG 2(1) and CIR v Boanas (2008) 23 NZTC 22,046 (HC).) Classified Public 6 Does s CB 6 only apply to sales of freehold land? 26. No. “Land” is defined in the Act as including any estate or interest in land, and as including an option to acquire land or an estate or interest in land. You could be taxed under s CB 6 if you dispose of any land interest, not just the freehold estate. For example, you could be taxed if you dispose of a leasehold, unit title or cross-lease interest, an option to acquire land, or an equitable interest in land (eg, by transferring the right to acquire land under a sale and purchase agreement to someone else). However, the expiry of an interest in land is not a disposal – for example the expiry of a lease or the expiry of an option. Can I gift the land instead so I do not have to pay tax? 27. No. Property cannot be gifted (this includes settling it on a trust) to get around paying tax on its sale. The Act would treat a gift of land you acquired with a purpose or intention of disposal as being made at market value. You would be subject to tax on that amount, less any allowable deductions (see ss FC 1 and FC 2). What if I did not buy the land, or if I got it from someone I was associated with? 28. If you received the land passively, eg, by way of gift, you would generally not be taxed under s CB 6, because you would not have acquired it with a purpose or intention of disposal (see for example A G Healing and Co Ltd v CIR \[1964\] NZLR 222 (SC) and McClelland v FCT (1970) 120 CLR 487 (PC)). However, you might be taxed on the disposal of land you received passively from someone you were associated with. 29. If you obtain land (passively or otherwise) from someone you are associated with, you may potentially be taxed under s CB 6 (or one of the other land provisions) when you dispose of it. This may be the case if the person you acquired the land from would have been taxed under s CB 6 if they had kept the land and disposed of it when you did (see s CB 15). The person you acquired the land from may already have been taxed under s CB 6 when they transferred the land to you. But you would also be potentially subject to tax under s CB 6 on the difference between your cost base for the land and what you derive when you dispose of it. 30. You may also be taxed under s CB 6 on a similar basis in other circumstances – for example if you received the land under a relationship property agreement and the transferor is subject to tax under s CB 6, or from a deceased person’s estate if the person would have been subject to tax under s CB 6. 31. There are also special rules that might apply if you received the land by way of a distribution from a company (s FC 1), or if an amalgamated company receives it as part of certain amalgamations (s FO 17). Can I get any tax deductions? 32. Yes. If s CB 6 taxes you on the proceeds of selling land, you will get a deduction for the cost of the land and any capital improvements you make to it, to the extent that those costs are incurred in deriving the income and are not private in nature (ss DB 23, DA 1 and DA 2(2)). The deduction is taken in the income year in which you dispose of the land (see s EA 2). \[There is a different timing rule for deductions for the cost of revenue account property that ceases to exist (s EA 2). So, for example, if you had a revenue account leasehold interest or option and it expired or (in the case of an option) Classified Public 7 was exercised, you may still get a deduction even though the land may not have been disposed of – see further QB 15/13.\] 33. You may also be able to deduct other expenditure, such as interest on money borrowed to purchase the land, insurance premiums, and repairs and maintenance costs (to the extent those costs are not capital). Deductions for these expenses will be allowed to the extent that they are incurred in deriving the income and are not private in nature (ss DA 1, DA 2 and DB 6). What evidence would be relevant to show that I did not have a purpose or intention of disposal when I acquired the land? 34. Any evidence that shows you did not have a purpose or intention of disposing of the land when you acquired it will be considered. For example, records about why you acquired the property made by the financial institution that provided finance for the purchase or by the real estate agent, proof of a change in your circumstances that led to the sale, minutes of board meetings, resolutions of directors or trustees, or anything else that shows what your purposes or intentions in acquiring the property were. 35. Remember that if s CB 6 applies, it does not matter when you sell the property. So you should keep any relevant documentary evidence about what your purpose or intention in acquiring property was, even beyond the normal seven-year timeframe for keeping tax records. Other taxing provisions that could apply if s CB 6 does not 36. If s CB 6 (see from \[13\]) does not apply to you, there are a number of other land sale rules in the Act that may tax you on the sale proceeds. The other provisions you might be taxed under could apply if:  you acquired the land for the purpose of a business (carried on by you or by an associated person) of dealing in land, developing land, dividing land into lots, or erecting buildings (s CB 7);  you dispose of the land within 10 years of acquiring it, if at the time you acquired it you were (or were associated with someone who was) in the business of dealing in land, or developing or dividing land (ss CB 9 and CB 10);  you dispose of the land within 10 years of completing improvements to it, if at the time the improvements were begun you were (or were associated with someone who was) in the business of erecting buildings (s CB 11);  the land was part of an undertaking or scheme, meeting certain criteria, that involved the development of land or the division of land into lots (ss CB 12 and CB 13);  the land was used as landfill (s CB 8);  you dispose of the land within 10 years of acquiring it and 20% or more of the increase in its value arises from any of various factors such as a change to the rules of a district plan, the granting of a consent, or a decision of the Environment Court under the Resource Management Act 1991 (s CB 14); 3  you received the land from someone you were associated with (s CB 15); or 3 See s CB 14(2) for the full list of factors. Classified Public 8  none of sections CB 6 – CB 12 apply, the land is residential land, and the “bright-line date” for your disposal of the land is within two years of when you acquired it (s CB 6A). 4 37. There are exclusions from each of these rules that might be relevant to you. What if I have possibly taken an incorrect tax position for past property sales? 38. If you think you may have taken a tax position for property sales in past tax years that is different from the Commissioner’s position on how these provisions apply, you should discuss the matter with your tax advisor, or Inland Revenue, and consider making a voluntary disclosure. Examples 39. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of s CB 6, and are aimed at dispelling common misconceptions that Inland Revenue encounters in its property compliance activity. The examples do not consider the criteria for the exclusions to s CB 6 in any great detail, as they clearly do not apply in any of the circumstances considered. The examples do not consider whether any of the other land sale rules in the Act apply. Example 1 – Change of purpose or intention between contract and settlement 40. On 10 September 2015, Tabitha and Jono entered into a sale and purchase agreement to buy a house for $2m. They planned to move into the house with their three children. On 21 September 2015, before settlement of the purchase, Tabitha and Jono were approached with an unsolicited offer to purchase the property for $2.25m. Tabitha and Jono decided that this offer was too attractive to turn down, confident they could find another equally desirable family home for that amount. Tabitha and Jono therefore accepted the offer on 23 September 2015, entering into a sale and purchase agreement to sell the house. Tabitha and Jono’s purchase of the property was settled on 25 September 2015, and their sale of the property was settled the following week. 41. For the purposes of s CB 6, Tabitha and Jono acquired the land on 10 September 2015, when they entered into the sale and purchase agreement to buy the property. At that time, their intention was for the house to be their family home. It does not matter that by 25 September 2015, when their purchase of the property was settled, they intended to dispose of it, and indeed had already entered into a sale and purchase agreement to do so. It was only because of an attractive, unsolicited offer that Tabitha and Jono changed their minds about living in the property and decided to dispose of it instead. At the date they acquired the property (10 September 2015), they did not intend to dispose of it. The extent of commitments made or steps taken shortly after land is acquired may be relevant in testing what someone’s purpose or intention was. In this case, if Tabitha and Jono can provide evidence that the offer was unsolicited, the fact that they entered into a contract to sell the land shortly after they entered into the contract to buy it is not inconsistent with their stated purpose at the time they entered into the contract to buy the land. 42. The proceeds on the sale are therefore not income to Tabitha and Jono under s CB 6. 4 “Residential land” is defined in s YA 1. As noted above, for the purposes of this rule (known as the 2-year bright-line test), the 2-year period generally does not start at the date you acquire land for the purposes of the other land provisions in the Act. In a standard purchase of land situation, the 2-year period will start on the date the land transfer is registered to you. The “bright-line date” for a disposal of land is typically the date you enter into an agreement for the disposal, but may be different in different circumstances (see s CB 6A(7)). Classified Public 9 43. It is presumed that none of sections CB 7 to CB 12 apply. 44. The 2-year bright-line test does not apply to Tabitha and Jono’s sale of the land, because they first acquired an estate or interest in it before 1 October 2015. 5 Example 2 – Change of purpose or intention after acquisition, and property held for over 10 years 45. On 11 October 2005, Laura and Connor entered into a sale and purchase agreement to purchase a property that they intended to renovate and on-sell. They advised their bank of this, as they needed to borrow sufficient funds to pay for the renovations. The purchase of the property was settled on 30 October 2005, and Laura and Connor started the renovations. After the renovation work was complete, Laura and Connor decided not to sell the property at that time, but to rent it out instead. Laura and Connor have paid tax on the rental income. In 2015, Laura and Connor decided to sell the property, and they did so on 4 December 2015. 46. For the purposes of s CB 6, Laura and Connor acquired the land on 11 October 2005, when they entered into the sale and purchase agreement to buy the property. At that time, their intention was to renovate the house and sell it. It does not matter that Laura and Connor subsequently changed their minds and decided to rent the property out instead of selling it. At the date they acquired the property, their purpose or intention was to dispose of it. 47. Neither the residential exclusion (s CB 16) nor the business exclusion (s CB 19) apply, because Laura and Connor did not live in the property or carry on a business from it. 48. The proceeds on the sale of the property are therefore income to Laura and Connor under s CB 6. 49. It is not relevant that the rental income was subject to tax – the Act taxes rental income as well as the proceeds on the sale of the property. 50. It is not relevant that Laura and Connor held the property for more than 10 years before selling it. If land is acquired with a purpose or intention of disposal, the proceeds will be taxed whenever the property is eventually sold. 51. Laura and Connor can get a deduction against the sale proceeds for the amount they paid to acquire the property and for the cost of any renovations that were capital in nature. 52. Laura and Connor are also allowed deductions for the interest on the money they borrowed to purchase the property and undertake the renovations, the cost of insurance on the property, and the cost of any repairs and maintenance on the property that are not capital in nature. Example 3 – Purpose or intention to be assessed against all of the evidence As noted above, the examples in this QWBA do not consider whether any of the land sale rules other than s CB 6 apply. More specifically, it is noted that this example is not considering whether Taj is carrying on a business relating to land, so s CB 7 is not considered. 53. Taj acquired 10 properties over a 10-year period – all before 1 October 2015. Eight of those properties have been sold to date. Taj considers that none of those sales give rise to income under s CB 6, stating that all of the properties were 5 Section 4(2) of the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Act 2015. Classified Public 10 acquired for long-term rental. Taj states that the eight properties in question were only sold due to financial pressure, the cost of servicing the mortgages, difficult tenants, or because of unsolicited offers to purchase the properties. Taj states that any renovation work done on the properties was for the purpose of deriving higher rental income. 54. However, all of the eight properties were on-sold within relatively short periods after their acquisition, most of them after some renovation work. The average time the properties were held is approximately one year. Three of the properties were held for less than six months. After each of the eight properties was sold, a new property was purchased within an average of six months. Taj has only returned rental income from two of the properties. 55. The test of whether a taxpayer had a purpose or intention of disposing of land when they acquired it is subjective. However, a person’s stated purpose or intention needs to be assessed against all of the evidence. 56. In this case, Taj’s explanations for each of the sales are not supported by the evidence as a whole. None of the properties were held for long-term rental purposes, which is what Taj says they were acquired for. Indeed, rental income was only returned (for a brief period) from two of the properties. The explanations for each of the sales are not supported by the evidence – including for the properties that were briefly rented out. The fact that new properties were purchased within an average of six months after each sale undermines Taj’s assertion that the sales were due to financial pressure and the cost of servicing the mortgages. The pattern of purchases, renovation (in most cases) and relatively fast re-sale of the properties without them having been rented out (for the most part) indicates that Taj acquired the properties with a purpose or intention of disposing of them. Taj must be able to show that he did not acquire each of the properties with a purpose or intention of disposing of them, and he has not done this. 57. Neither the residential exclusion (s CB 16) nor the business exclusion (s CB 19) apply to any of the properties, because Taj did not live in any of them or carry on a business from any of them. 58. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the proceeds on the sales of the eight properties in question are income to Taj under s CB 6. 59. Taj can get a deduction against the sale proceeds for the amounts he paid to acquire the properties and for the cost of any renovations that were capital in nature. 60. Taj is also allowed deductions for the interest on the money he borrowed to purchase the properties and undertake the renovations, the cost of insurance on the properties, and the cost of any repairs and maintenance on the properties that are not capital in nature. Example 4 – It is for the taxpayer to show that land was not acquired with a purpose or intention of disposal 61. Hugh and Meg purchased five residential properties in 2014. They renovated the properties, and sold them in 2015 for a total profit of $2.2m. Hugh and Meg have stated that they have relatives overseas who had applied for New Zealand residency and who intended to live in the properties indefinitely once they came to New Zealand. Hugh and Meg assert that the properties were only sold in 2015 because the residency applications were unsuccessful. Hugh and Meg have not provided any evidence that any relatives overseas had applied for New Zealand residency and had those applications rejected. Classified Public 11 62. If the Commissioner forms the view that you acquired the land with a purpose or intention of disposal, it is up to you to show that you did not. 63. Hugh and Meg purchased five properties that they renovated and sold for a profit in a short space of time. They have not provided any evidence that any relatives overseas had applied for New Zealand residency and had those applications rejected. In these circumstances, the Commissioner is not satisfied that Hugh and Meg did not acquire the properties with a purpose or intention of disposal. There is no evidence to support their stated purpose of acquiring the properties as future homes for relatives seeking residency. 64. Neither the residential exclusion (s CB 16) nor the business exclusion (s CB 19) apply to any of the properties, because Hugh and Meg did not live in any of them or carry on a business from any of them. 65. The Commissioner therefore considers that the proceeds on the sales of the properties are income to Hugh and Meg under s CB 6. 66. Hugh and Meg can get a deduction against the sale proceeds for the amounts they paid to acquire the properties and for the cost of any renovations that were capital in nature. 67. Hugh and Meg are also allowed deductions for the interest on the money they borrowed to purchase the properties and undertake the renovations, the cost of insurance on the properties, and the cost of any repairs and maintenance on the properties that are not capital in nature. Example 5 – More than one purpose or intention 68. Chris purchased a property in August 2012. The property was marketed as being an attractive investment – ideal as a rental property, and expected to have “great annual capital growth”. Chris decided to buy the property to rent it out for three to five years, by which stage he expected to be able to realise the capital gain he sought to make on the property. Chris has paid tax on the rental income. He sold the property in October 2015 for a sizeable profit. 69. An amount that a person derives on the disposal of land will be income under s CB 6 if they acquired the land for a purpose or with an intention of disposing of it. A purpose or intention of disposing of the land does not need to be the only purpose or intention the person had when they acquired the land. It also does not need to be their dominant or main purpose or intention. It is enough if disposal is one of their purposes or intentions. 70. The suggestion in the marketing material that the property was expected to have great annual capital growth and could be rented out in the meantime does not determine Chris’s purpose or intention in buying the property. However, Chris acknowledges that he purchased the property with a short-medium term investment horizon in mind, after which he anticipated selling it to realise the capital gain he expected to make. 71. It does not matter that Chris acquired the property for more than one purpose, and disposal was only one of those purposes. When he acquired the property, Chris had a firm purpose of disposing of it in three to five years, though it was to be rented out in the interim. 72. Neither the residential exclusion (s CB 16) nor the business exclusion (s CB 19) apply, because Chris did not live in the property or carry on a business from it. 73. The proceeds on the sale of the property are therefore income to Chris under s CB 6. Classified Public 12 74. It is not relevant that the rental income was subject to tax – the Act taxes rental income as well as the proceeds on the sale of the property. 75. Chris can get a deduction against the sale proceeds for the amount he paid to acquire the property and for the cost of any capital improvements he made to the property. 76. Chris is also allowed deductions for the interest on the money he borrowed to purchase the property, the cost of insurance on the property, and the cost of any repairs and maintenance on the property that are not capital in nature.

QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 16/07 INCOME TAX – LAND SALE RULES – MAIN HOME AND RESIDENTIAL EXCLUSIONS – REGULAR PATTERN OF ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING, OR BUILDING AND DISPOSING The purpose of this Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) is to provide guidance about when someone will have a “regular pattern” of transactions that means they cannot use the residential exclusion from ss CB 6 to CB 11, and when someone will have a “regular pattern” of transactions that means they cannot use the main home exclusion from the 2-year bright-line test. Before the issue of whether there is a “regular pattern” arises, one of the taxing provisions in ss CB 6A to CB 11 has to potentially apply, and the residential exclusion or the main home exclusion has to potentially apply (see the flowchart at \[10\]). This QWBA briefly sets out the criteria for those taxing provisions and exclusions, but the focus is on when there will be a “regular pattern” of transactions that means the relevant exclusion cannot be used. In this QWBA, we use the term “house” for ease of reference. The term in the residential exclusion from ss CB 6 to CB 11 is “dwellinghouse”, and the term in the exclusion from the 2-year bright-line test is a “dwelling”. Those terms could include other dwellings that are not houses (eg, a unit or an apartment). All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This QWBA is about ss CB 16 and CB 16A. Question 1. One of the land sale rules in ss CB 6 to CB 11 or the 2-year bright-line test in s CB 6A potentially applies to the sale of my house. I might qualify for exclusions from those rules for my residence or for my main home, but those exclusions may not apply if I have a “regular pattern” of transactions. When will I have a “regular pattern” of transactions that means I cannot use the exclusions for my residence or for my main home? Answer 2. There are a number of land sale rules in the Act that might tax you on the proceeds of land that you sell or otherwise dispose of. But the provisions that might apply if you are selling your house have exclusions you might be able to use, which would mean you are not taxed. There are different exclusions depending on which provision you could be taxed under. 3. There is an exclusion (in s CB 16) called the “residential exclusion” which is relevant if you might be taxed under ss CB 6 to CB 11. If that exclusion applies, you will not be taxed under those provisions. But you will not be able to use that exclusion if you have a “regular pattern” of acquiring and disposing of or building and disposing of houses that you occupied mainly as residences. 4. There is an exclusion (in s CB 16A) called the “main home exclusion” which is relevant if you might be taxed under the 2-year bright-line test in s CB 6A. If that exclusion applies, you will not be taxed under the bright-line test. But you will not be able to use that exclusion if you have already used the main home 2 Classified Public exclusion twice in the last two years or if you have a “regular pattern” of acquiring and disposing of residential land that had your main home on it. 5. Whether you have a “regular pattern” of transactions that will mean you cannot use the relevant exclusion will depend on the number of similar transactions and the intervals of time between them. It will be a matter of fact and degree whether you have a regular pattern of such transactions. 6. There is no hard and fast rule about the number of times or how frequently you can buy and sell, build and sell, or renovate and sell houses that you live in and not be taxed. However, generally at least three prior transactions would be needed for there to be a regular pattern. 7. For there to be a “pattern” there has to be a similarity or likeness between the transactions. The reason or purpose for each transaction is irrelevant; it is the similarity of the transactions that is important. For a pattern to be “regular” the transactions must occur at sufficiently uniform or consistent intervals. 8. The transaction being considered as potentially subject to tax is not taken into account in deciding whether you have a regular pattern of such transactions. 9. As mentioned at \[4\], there is also a cap on how frequently you can use the main home exclusion from the 2-year bright-line test. You are not able to use that exclusion if you have already used it twice in the two years before the “bright- line” date for land you are selling. This cap applies even if you do not have a “regular pattern” of acquiring and disposing of residential land.

The following flowchart shows the main taxing provisions that could apply if you sell your house, the requirements for the residential exclusion and for the main home exclusion that you might be able to use because it was your house, and when you cannot use those exclusions.

There are a number of land sale rules in the Act. These rules might tax you on the proceeds of land you sell or otherwise dispose of. You might be taxed on the proceeds of disposing of land if:  you acquired the land for a purpose or with an intention of disposing of it (s CB 6);  you acquired the land for the purpose of a business (carried on by you or by an associated person) of dealing in land, developing land, dividing land into lots, or erecting buildings (s CB 7);  you dispose of the land within 10 years of acquiring it, if at the time you acquired it you were (or were associated with someone who was) in the business of dealing in land, or developing or dividing land (ss CB 9 and CB 10);  you dispose of the land within 10 years of completing improvements to it, if at the time the improvements were started you were (or were associated with someone who was) in the business of erecting buildings (s CB 11);  the land was part of an undertaking or scheme, meeting certain criteria, that involved the development of land or the division of land into lots (ss CB 12 and CB 13);  the land was used as landfill (s CB 8);  you dispose of the land within 10 years of acquiring it and 20% or more of the increase in its value arises from any of various factors such as a change to the rules of a district plan, the granting of a consent, or a decision of the Environment Court under the Resource Management Act 1991 (s CB 14); 1  you received the land from someone you were associated with, who would have been taxable if they had retained and disposed of the land (s CB 15); or  none of sections CB 6 to CB 12 apply, the land is residential land, and the “bright-line date” for your disposal of the land is within two years of when you acquired it (s CB 6A). 2 But I am not taxed if I lived in the property, am I? 12. There are a number of exclusions from each of the above rules that might be relevant to you. If one of those exclusions applies, you will not be taxed on the sale proceeds. 13. There are exclusions from most of the land provisions for your residence, and there is an exclusion from the 2-year bright-line test for your main home. 14. Section CB 16 is the residential exclusion from ss CB 6 to CB 11, s CB 17 is the residential exclusion from ss CB 12 and CB 13, and s CB 18 is the residential exclusion from s CB 14. Section CB 16A is the main home exclusion from the 2- year bright-line test. Each of those exclusions has different requirements. 1 See s CB 14(2) for the full list of factors. 2 “Residential land” is defined in s YA 1. For the purposes of this rule (known as the 2-year bright-line test), the 2-year period generally does not start at the date you acquire land for the purposes of the other land provisions in the Act. In a standard land purchase situation, the 2-year period will start on the date the land title is registered to you. The “bright-line date” for a disposal of land is typically the date you enter into an agreement for the disposal, but may be different in different circumstances (see s CB 6A(7)). 5 Classified Public 15. This QWBA is about one of the criteria of the residential exclusion from ss CB 6 to CB 11 (which is in s CB 16) and the main home exclusion from the 2-year bright- line test (which is in s CB 16A). Both of those exclusions have a requirement that you do not have a regular pattern of transactions. If you do have a regular pattern of the relevant transactions, you cannot use the residential exclusion or the main home exclusion (as the case may be), even though you lived at the property. 16. Note that the residential exclusions in ss CB 17 (relevant for ss CB 12 and CB 13) and CB 18 (relevant for s CB 14) do not have a requirement that there is no “regular pattern”. 17. This QWBA explains when a “regular pattern” of transactions will prevent you from being able to use the residential exclusion in s CB 16, and when a “regular pattern” of transactions will prevent you from being able to use the main home exclusion in s CB 16A. What are the requirements for the residential exclusion from ss CB 6 to CB 11? 18. The residential exclusion in s CB 16 is the relevant exclusion if the proceeds from the sale of your house might be taxed under any of ss CB 6 to CB 11 (those provisions include the purpose or intention provision, and the dealer, developer, subdivider and builder provisions). 3 19. To qualify for the exclusion in s CB 16, you have to meet all of the following requirements:  You acquired the land with a house on it, or built one on it.  The house has been occupied mainly as a residence by you and any member of your family living with you or, if you are a trustee of a trust, by one or more of the beneficiaries of the trust. This means your occupation of the house cannot be incidental to another more significant purpose such as sale (see, for example, Case G76 (1985) 7 NZTC 1,348, Case K21 (1988) 10 NZTC 218 and Case M102 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,634).  If there is any land related to the land with the house on it, the total area of the related land has to be 4,500 square metres or less. If it is larger than that, the larger area has to be required for the reasonable occupation and enjoyment of the house.  You have not engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of houses, or building and disposing of houses, that you occupied mainly as residences (discussed from \[31\]). 20. As can be seen, one of the requirements of the residential exclusion in s CB 16 is that you do not have a “regular pattern” involving the disposal of land with a house on it. The “regular pattern” has to be either of acquiring and disposing of houses that you occupied mainly as residences, or of building and disposing of houses that you occupied mainly as residences. It does not matter if you have any other regular pattern involving acquiring and disposing of land, such as industrial land, or residential land that you did not live on. 3 Which also apply if you are associated with a dealer, developer, subdivider or builder, even if you are not one yourself. 6 Classified Public What are the requirements for the main home exclusion from the 2-year bright- line test? 21. If you acquire residential land and sell it (or otherwise dispose of it) within two years of when you are treated as acquiring it, any gains may be taxed under the 2-year bright-line test (s CB 6A). This test can only apply if none of ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply. 22. There are special rules about when you are treated as acquiring the land for the 2-year bright-line test, which differ from when you are treated as acquiring the land for the other land sale rules. In a typical land purchase situation, the 2-year period for the bright-line test will start when the land title is registered to you. 23. Your main home may be excluded from the 2-year bright-line test. To qualify for that exclusion (which is in s CB 16A) you have to meet all of the following requirements:  The land has been used predominantly, for most of the time you owned it, for a dwelling that was your main home. 4  You have not already used the main home exclusion twice within the two years immediately before the “bright-line date” 5 for the land in question.  You have not engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of residential land that had your main home on it (discussed from \[31\]). 24. If you have a “regular pattern” of acquiring and disposing of residential land that had your main home on it, you will still be taxed on the proceeds of the sale of the land even if you have not already used the main home exclusion twice in the two years before the “bright-line date”. 25. The “regular pattern” has to be of acquiring and disposing of residential land that had your main home on it (see further from \[27\]). It does not matter if you have a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of other land, such as farmland, land that a dwelling cannot be built on under the relevant district plan (eg, industrial land), or residential land that you did not live on. 26. The 2-year bright-line test can only potentially apply to a disposal of land if you first acquired an estate or interest in the land on or after 1 October 2015. However, if the first interest in the land was acquired on or after 1 October 2015, you must take into account acquisitions and disposals before that date in deciding whether you have a “regular pattern” of acquiring and disposing of residential land that had your main home on it. Requirement that the regular pattern relates to land that you occupied mainly as a residence, or that had your main home on it 27. As noted above, for a “regular pattern” to prevent the relevant exclusion from applying, it has to be a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of land that you occupied mainly as a residence (in the case of the land sale rules that the exclusion in s CB 16 is relevant to), or that had your main home on it (in the case of the 2-year bright-line test). 28. While the legislation does not expressly state that the regular pattern has to be of acquiring and disposing of land that you occupied mainly as a residence, or that 4 Note, if you are a trustee of a trust, the exclusion can apply if the dwelling was the main home of a beneficiary of the trust. This is as long as a principal settlor of the trust does not have a main home or, if they do, it is the property you are disposing of. 5 In a typical land sale situation, this will be the date that you enter into an agreement for the disposal of the land. But your “bright-line date” could be a different date, depending on how you dispose of the land (see s CB 6A(7)). 7 Classified Public had your main home on it, the Commissioner considers this is the correct interpretation. 29. In terms of the s CB 16 exclusion, the Commissioner considers this interpretation to be correct because of the way the legislation was worded before the Act was re-written for simplicity. There was no intention to narrow the scope of the exclusion when the Act was re-written. It is also supported by the fact that if the pattern did not need to relate to land that you occupied mainly as a residence, people who are in the business of dealing in land would likely not be able to use the exclusion in s CB 16. However, it was clearly intended that they could, because s CB 16 is an exclusion from all of ss CB 6 to CB 11, including the dealer, builder and developer provisions. 30. Similarly, the Commissioner considers that the regular pattern has to be of acquiring and disposing of land that had your main home on it for you to be prevented from using the main home exclusion from the 2-year bright-line test. This is because the wording of the main home exclusion was based on the wording of the residential exclusion in s CB 16, and because of what the context of the land provisions as a whole and the ordering of the different land sale rules suggest about how the provisions are intended to operate. It is also supported by comments in the special report Bright-line Test for Residential Land ( Inland Revenue, Wellington, 2015). So what is a “regular pattern” of acquiring and disposing or building and disposing? 31. The High Court and the Taxation Review Authority have considered a number of cases that required looking at whether there was a “regular pattern” of acquiring and disposing of houses or building and disposing of houses, which would mean the residential exclusion in s CB 16 could not be used. The same principles are relevant when considering whether there has been a “regular pattern” of acquiring and disposing of residential land for the purposes of the main home exclusion from the 2-year bright-line test. 32. In Parry v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,820 (HC), the High Court made the following comments about the meaning of “regular pattern” in what is now s CB 16 (at 61,824): I commence with the phrase “a regular pattern of such transactions”. In my view, in the context in which it is used, “pattern” denotes a similarity or likeness in the transactions. The transactions relied on must bear a similarity or likeness each to the others. In the same context the word “regular” is used in the sense of recurring at uniform or near uniform intervals. There must therefore be a sufficient degree of uniformity or at least consistency of occurrence. So in considering whether there has been a regular pattern of erecting dwellinghouses and subsequent sale, the Court must consider each transaction to assess the degree of similarity each to the others. This involves considering factors such as the type and location of the sections, the type of the dwellinghouses, the method of erection, the use to which the dwellinghouses were put and, in particular, whether occupied by the objector, and any other characteristics of the transaction that may be relevant in assessing similarity. The Court must also consider the number of transactions and the intervals of time between each, thereby assessing the degree of uniformity or consistency of occurrence. In the end it will have to determine as a matter of fact and degree whether the events that occurred demonstrate a regular pattern of such transactions. On this approach it does not seem to me to be relevant to consider the reason or purpose for each transaction. It is the similarity of the transactions that is significant, not any similarity in the reason, purpose or intention for entering into each transaction. 33. The court also noted that the regular pattern has to exist independently of and before the transaction in question. 8 Classified Public 34. In deciding whether there is a “regular pattern” for the purposes of the residential exclusion in s CB 16, the key things to bear in mind are:  For there to be a “pattern”, there has to be a similarity or likeness between the transactions.  The reason or purpose for each transaction is irrelevant; it is the similarity of the transactions that is important.  Assessing the similarity between the transactions involves considering factors such as the type and location of each of the sections of land, the type of dwellinghouses, the method of erection, the use to which the dwellinghouses were put (in particular whether you occupied them), 6 and any other relevant characteristics of the transactions.  For a pattern to be established, there must be more than one transaction. The greater the number of similar transactions, the more likely there is a pattern.  For a pattern to be “regular”, the transactions must occur at sufficiently uniform or consistent intervals.  The number of similar transactions and the intervals of time between them must be assessed, and it is a matter of fact and degree whether there is a regular pattern of such transactions.  There must be at least two similar transactions for there to potentially be a regular pattern (Case C9 (1977) 3 NZTC 60,058). But the Commissioner accepts that generally at least three prior transactions would be needed for there to be a regular pattern.  You must have engaged in a regular pattern of the relevant type of transactions independently of and before the transaction in question. The transaction being considered as potentially subject to tax is not taken into account in deciding whether there is a regular pattern of transactions. (See also Case 5/2013 \[2013\] NZTRA 05 (2013) 26 NZTC 2,004, Case M102 and Case C9.) 35. As noted above, the type of “regular pattern” that will mean you cannot use the exclusion for your house is: in the case of any of the land sale rules in ss CB 6 to CB 11: a “regular pattern” of acquiring and disposing of houses that you occupied - mainly as residences; or a “regular pattern” of building and disposing of houses that you occupied - mainly as residences; and in the case of the 2-year bright-line test (s CB 6A): a “regular pattern” of acquiring and disposing of residential land that had - your main home on it. 36. If you have any other pattern involving acquiring or disposing of land, it will not prevent you from relying on the exclusion for your house. For example, if you have a pattern of speculative buying and selling of land you have not lived on, or if, as part of your business, you buy and sell land you have not lived on. 6 As discussed from \[27\], the regular pattern has to be of acquiring and disposing of land that you occupied mainly as a residence, or that had your main home on it. As such, whether, and the extent to which, you occupied any particular property is important in terms of the relevance of that transaction to deciding whether you have a regular pattern. 9 Classified Public Is it true that I can renovate and sell a house every year or two and not be taxed, as long as I lived in the house? 37. A common misconception is that you can renovate and sell a house every year or two and not be taxed on the sale proceeds, as long as you lived in the house. This is not true. Whether you are taxed on the sale proceeds of a house you have lived in depends on whether there is a taxing provision you might be caught by (these are listed at \[11\]), and then whether you meet the requirements for an exclusion from that provision. 38. As noted above, the exclusions for a person’s house cannot be used if you have:  a “regular pattern” of acquiring and disposing or building and disposing of houses that you occupied mainly as residences (in the case of the provisions in ss CB 6 to CB 11 – which include the purpose or intention provision, and the dealer, developer, subdivider and builder provisions); or  a “regular pattern” of acquiring and disposing of residential land that had your main home on it (in the case of the 2-year bright-line test (s CB 6A)). 39. If you renovated and sold your house every year, you would establish a regular pattern that would prevent you from being able to use the residential exclusion from ss CB 6 to CB 11 or the main home exclusion from the 2-year bright-line test. 40. Note that even if you do not have a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of residential land that had your main home on it, you would not be able to use the main home exclusion from the 2-year bright-line test if you had already used it twice in the two years before the “bright-line date” for land you are selling. 41. If you renovated and sold houses that you lived in less frequently, for example every two or more years, you would at some stage establish a regular pattern. If one of the land sale rules in ss CB 6 to CB 11 was potentially applicable (for example, if you purchased the land with a purpose or an intention of disposing of it, or if you or someone you are associated with is a land dealer, developer, subdivider or builder), your regular pattern may mean that you cannot use the residential exclusion and might be taxed on the sale of a house you lived in. 42. You could also potentially be taxed under one of the undertaking or scheme provisions (s CB 12 in particular) if your renovations involved more than minor development or division work. As noted above, the undertaking or scheme provisions have their own separate residential exclusion, which does not have a requirement that there is no “regular pattern” involving the disposal of land. But there are a number of requirements that must be met for you to be able to use that exclusion, so you would need to consider whether those requirements were met. 43. Even if you sell a property that you live in without renovating it, one of the land sale rules could apply to you, so you may need to consider whether you have a regular pattern involving disposal of property that you lived in. 44. There is no hard and fast rule about the number of times or how frequently you can buy and sell, build and sell, or renovate and sell houses and not be taxed. 10 Classified Public What if I have to sell a number of houses because of circumstances outside my control? 45. The reason or purpose for buying and selling or building and selling is irrelevant in deciding whether you have a “regular pattern” of transactions – even if the reason or purpose for the sale is outside your control. What matters is whether you have engaged in a regular pattern of transactions of the relevant type. 46. If you sold one or two houses that you lived in, you would not be taxed on the sale proceeds (as long as you meet the other criteria for the residential exclusion or the main home exclusion), as you would not have a “regular pattern” involving disposal at that point. If you sold more than that, for whatever reason, there may be a question of whether you have a regular pattern. As noted above, this would involve considering the number of similar transactions and the intervals of time between them. Generally, at least three prior transactions would be needed for there to be a regular pattern. If I cannot use the residential exclusion or the main home exclusion and have to pay tax on a land sale, can I get any tax deductions? 47. Yes. If one of the land sale rules applies to tax you on the proceeds of selling land, you will get a deduction for the cost of the land and any capital improvements you make to it, to the extent that those costs are incurred in deriving the income and are not private in nature (ss DB 23, DA 1 and DA 2(2)). The deduction is taken in the income year in which you dispose of the land (see s EA 2). 48. You may also be able to deduct other expenditure, such as interest on money borrowed to purchase the land, insurance premiums, and the cost of repairs and maintenance. Deductions for these expenses will be allowed to the extent that they are incurred in deriving the income and are not private in nature (ss DA 1, DA 2 and DB 6). Examples 49. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. The focus of the examples is on the “regular pattern” aspect of both the residential exclusion from ss CB 6 to CB 11 and the main home exclusion from s CB 6A. The examples are therefore premised on the other criteria for the relevant exclusion being satisfied. The examples are also premised on the relevant taxing provision being applicable, subject to the potential availability of the residential exclusion or the main home exclusion. 11 Classified Public Example 1 – A “regular pattern” of transactions established 50. Melody and David are keen house renovators and have purchased a number of properties to improve and sell at a profit. These purchases and sales are shown in the following table. Property Date acquired Land / activity Date sold 1 (N Road) June 2006 Cottage in inner-city Wellington suburb purchased. Renovations undertaken over the period of ownership, while Melody and David lived in the house. May 2008 2 (P Street) May 2008 Bungalow in Wellington suburb purchased. Renovations and landscaping undertaken over the period of ownership, while Melody and David lived in the house. July 2010 3 (E Place) July 2010 House in Wellington suburb purchased. Off-street parking built during the period of ownership, while Melody and David lived in the house. February 2011 4 (J Avenue) January 2011 Larger family home in Wellington suburb purchased, as Melody and David had started a family. Some minor redecorating undertaken during the period of ownership, while Melody and David lived in the house. March 2013 51. Melody and David purchased the properties for a purpose and with an intention of selling them after they had completed some improvements. Their aim was to renovate the properties while they lived in them and sell them at a profit, enabling them to move up the property ladder. As such, the proceeds from the sales may be subject to tax under s CB 6 – the purpose or intention provision. This depends on whether Melody and David can rely on the residential exclusion in s CB 16. 52. Melody and David acquired the properties with houses on them, and it is assumed that they occupied the houses mainly as their residences. It is also assumed that the area of each property was 4,500 square metres or less. Therefore, the only issue is whether Melody and David are precluded from using the residential exclusion, which they will be if they have engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of houses that they occupied mainly as residences. 53. When the first three properties (N Road, P Street and E Place) were sold, Melody and David did not yet have a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of houses. A regular pattern has to exist independently of the transaction being considered. By the time E Place was sold, there had only been two prior acquisitions and sales. The Commissioner accepts that generally at least three transactions would be needed for there to be a regular pattern. 54. By the time the J Avenue property was sold, Melody and David had previously acquired and disposed of three houses that they had lived in. The question is whether those three transactions amount to a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of houses that were occupied by the couple mainly as residences. If 12 Classified Public they do amount to such a regular pattern, Melody and David will not be able to rely on the residential exclusion for the sale of the J Avenue property. 55. For there to be a pattern, there has to be a similarity or likeness between the transactions. In this case, there is. The N Road, P Street and E Place properties were all residential properties in Wellington acquired, occupied, renovated and sold by Melody and David. It does not matter that the nature of the renovations done to each property was different. The pattern only needs to involve acquiring and disposing of houses that have been occupied mainly as residences. 56. For a pattern of acquisition and disposal to be regular, the transactions need to occur at sufficiently uniform or consistent intervals. In this case, the properties were held for 1 year 11 months, 2 years 2 months, and 7 months, respectively. Three properties were acquired and disposed of in a period of 4 years 8 months. The Commissioner considers that the intervals between the transactions are consistent enough for this to be a regular pattern. The intervals between the transactions do not need to be identical. 57. Because Melody and David have engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of houses that they occupied mainly as residences, they cannot use the residential exclusion in s CB 16. Therefore, the proceeds from the sale of the J Avenue property will be income to Melody and David under s CB 6. Melody and David can deduct the costs of the property and the redecorating, to the extent that those costs are not private in nature. 58. The 2-year bright-line test does not apply to the sales of the N Road, P Street or E Place properties, because they were all acquired before 1 October 2015 (and in the case of the P Street property, the land was held for over two years, in any event). 13 Classified Public Example 2 – A “pattern” of transactions, but not a “regular pattern” 59. Enzo, who is in the business of dealing in land, has purchased and sold dozens of residential properties over the last decade as part of his business. In that time, he has also sold four properties that he lived in, as shown in the following table. Property Date acquired Land / activity Date sold 1 (Q Street) February 2006 Apartment in Auckland CBD purchased. Lived in by Enzo, and then subsequently by his partner too. June 2007 2 (M Place) July 2007 House on the North Shore purchased, as Enzo and his partner decided to adopt a child. Lived in by the family for the period of ownership. December 2012 3 (G Road) December 2012 Larger house in Auckland purchased to accommodate the expanding family. Lived in by the family for the period of ownership. October 2015 4 (T Road) October 2015 House on a small lifestyle property outside of Hamilton purchased. Lived in by the family until early January 2016, when Enzo’s partner accepted an exciting job offer in Sydney and the family decided to move there. The sale of the house was settled at the end of January 2016. January 2016 60. Because Enzo is in the business of dealing in land and all of the above properties were sold within 10 years of being acquired, Enzo (and his partner, where relevant) may be taxed on the proceeds of the sales under s CB 9. However, this depends on whether Enzo and his partner can rely on the residential exclusion in s CB 16. 61. Enzo (and his partner, where relevant) acquired the properties with houses on them, and it is assumed that they occupied the houses mainly as their residences. It is also assumed that the area of each property was 4,500 square metres or less. Therefore, the only issue is whether Enzo and his partner are precluded from using the residential exclusion, which they will be if they have engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of houses that they occupied mainly as residences. 62. The numerous residential properties Enzo has purchased and sold as part of his business are not relevant to deciding whether there is a regular pattern of the type that would prevent Enzo and his partner from relying on the residential exclusion. 63. When the first three properties (Q Street, M Place and G Road) were sold, Enzo and his partner did not yet have a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of houses that they occupied mainly as residences. A regular pattern has to exist independently of the transaction being considered. By the time the G Road property was sold, there had only been two prior acquisitions and sales. The Commissioner accepts that generally at least three transactions would be needed for there to be a regular pattern. 14 Classified Public 64. By the time the T Road property was sold, Enzo (and his partner, where relevant) had previously acquired and disposed of three houses that they lived in. The question is whether those three transactions amount to a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of houses that were occupied by the couple mainly as residences. If they do amount to such a regular pattern, Enzo and his partner will not be able to rely on the residential exclusion for the sale of the T Road property. 65. For there to be a pattern, there has to be a similarity or likeness between the transactions. In this case, there is. The Q Street, M Place and G Road properties were all residential properties in Auckland acquired, occupied, and sold by Enzo and his partner. 66. For a pattern of acquisition and disposal to be regular, the transactions need to occur at sufficiently uniform or consistent intervals. In this case, the properties were held for 1 year 4 months, 5 years 5 months, and 2 years 10 months, respectively. Three properties were acquired and disposed of in a period of 9 years 8 months. The Commissioner considers that the intervals between the transactions are not consistent enough for this to be a regular pattern. 67. Because Enzo and his partner have not engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of houses that they occupied mainly as residences, they can use the residential exclusion in s CB 16. As noted at \[61\], it is assumed that the other requirements for the exclusion are met. Enzo and his partner will, therefore, not be taxed under s CB 9 on the proceeds of the sale of the T Road property. 68. However, the T Road property was acquired on or after 1 October 2015, sold within two years, and is “residential land” for the purposes of the 2-year bright- line test. This is because it has a dwelling on it, and it is not used predominantly as business premises and is not farmland. (It is not “farmland” as defined in the Act because, due to its size, it is not capable of being worked as a farming or agricultural business.) As such, it is also necessary to consider whether the proceeds of the sale of the T Road property are taxed under the 2-year bright-line test. This comes down to whether Enzo and his partner can rely on the main home exclusion in s CB 16A. 69. Enzo and his partner used the house on the T Road property predominantly, for most of the time they owned it, as their main home. Therefore, the only issue is whether Enzo and his partner are precluded from using the main home exclusion, which they will be if they have either:  already used the main home exclusion twice within the two years immediately before the “bright-line date” 7 for the T Road property, or  engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of residential land that had their main home on it. 70. Enzo and his partner have not used the main home exclusion at all before, so they will only be precluded from using the main home exclusion if they have engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of land that was their main home. 71. As with the residential exclusion from the land dealer provision, the numerous properties Enzo has purchased and sold as part of his business are not relevant to deciding whether there is a regular pattern of the type that would prevent Enzo and his partner from relying on the main home exclusion from the 2-year bright- line test. 7 In this case, the date that Enzo and his partner entered into the contract to sell the T Road property. 15 Classified Public 72. Therefore, the only transactions that are relevant are the purchases and sales of the Q Street, M Place and G Road properties. Although the 2-year bright-line test only potentially applies to disposals of land acquired on or after 1 October 2015, acquisitions and disposals of residential land before then are relevant in deciding whether there is a “regular pattern” that means the main home exclusion cannot be used. 73. As with the residential exclusion from the land dealer provision, the Commissioner considers that the acquisitions and sales of the Q Street, M Place and G Road properties do not make up a regular pattern. 74. Because Enzo and his partner have not used the main home exclusion before and have not engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of residential land that had their main home on it, they can use the exclusion when they sell the T Road property. Therefore, Enzo and his partner will not be taxed on the proceeds of the sale of the T Road property under the 2-year bright-line test (s CB 6A). 16 Classified Public Example 3 – Transactions not similar enough to be a “pattern” 75. Hemi and Kirrily have acquired and sold a number of properties since they married five years ago, as shown in the following table. Property Date acquired Land / activity Date sold 1 (C Road) May 2011 Investment property purchased before Hemi and Kirrily went overseas on their “OE”, so they could get a foot on the property ladder. Property rented out from when purchased until when sold. November 2013 2 (A Street) November 2013 House purchased upon Hemi and Kirrily’s return to NZ and the sale of their investment property. Lived in for the period of ownership. October 2015 3 (H Street) September 2015 Inherited Kirrily’s father’s unit upon his death. Listed for sale soon after, and never lived in by the couple. October 2015 4 (K Avenue) November 2015 When Kirrily and Hemi inherited the H Street property, they decided to sell it and the A Street property and buy a larger house (the K Avenue property) and a holiday bach (the B Esplanade property). The K Avenue property was lived in by the couple for the period of ownership. February 2016 5 (B Esplanade) November 2015 Seaside bach purchased with the proceeds of the A Street and H Street properties. The couple stayed in the bach most weekends during the period of ownership. The bach (the B Esplanade property) and the K Avenue property were both sold when Kirrily was diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, and the couple decided to use their equity to fund experimental medical treatment in Germany. February 2016 76. The C Road, A Street and H Street properties are not potentially subject to tax under any of the land provisions in the Act. 77. However, the K Avenue and B Esplanade properties were both acquired after 1 October 2015, sold within two years, and are both “residential land” for the purposes of the 2-year bright-line test. This is because those properties both have dwellings on them, are not used predominantly as business premises, and are not farmland. As such, it is necessary to consider whether the proceeds of the sales of the K Avenue and B Esplanade properties are taxed under the 2-year bright-line test. This comes down to whether Hemi and Kirrily can rely on the main home exclusion in s CB 16A. 17 Classified Public 78. Hemi and Kirrily used the K Avenue property predominantly, for most of the time they owned it, as their main home. Therefore, the only issue is whether Hemi and Kirrily are precluded from using the main home exclusion, which they will be if they have either:  already used the main home exclusion twice within the two years immediately before the “bright-line date” 8 for the K Avenue property; or  engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of residential land that had their main home on it. 79. Hemi and Kirrily have not used the main home exclusion at all before, so they will only be precluded from using the main home exclusion for the sale of the K Avenue property if they have engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of land that was their main home. 80. By the time the K Avenue property was sold, Hemi and Kirrily had previously acquired and disposed of three residential properties – the C Road, A Street and H Street properties. The question is whether those three transactions amount to a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of houses that were occupied by the couple mainly as residences. In this case, they clearly do not. This is because, for there to be a pattern, there has to be a similarity or likeness between the transactions. That is not the case here. The C Road, A Street and H Street properties were all residential properties, but one (the C Road property) was an investment property, one (the H Street property) was inherited by the couple, and one (the A Street property) was their home. The acquisitions and sales of those properties are not sufficiently similar to amount to a “pattern”. 81. Because Hemi and Kirrily have not used the main home exclusion before and have not engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of residential land that had their main home on it, they could use the exclusion when they sold the K Avenue property. Therefore, Hemi and Kirrily were not taxed on the proceeds of the sale of the K Avenue property under the 2-year bright-line test (s CB 6A). 82. However, Hemi and Kirrily did not use the house on the B Esplanade property as their main home. Therefore, they could not use the main home exclusion when they sold that property, and the proceeds of the sale of the property were income to them under the 2-year bright-line test (s CB 6A). Hemi and Kirrily could deduct the cost of the B Esplanade property and any other expenditure that was incurred in deriving the income, to the extent that those costs were not private in nature. 8 In this case, the date that Hemi and Kirrily entered into the contract to sell the K Avenue property. 18 Classified Public References Subject references Income tax, sale of land, main home exclusion, residential exclusion, regular pattern involving disposal Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007 – ss CB 6A, CB 6, CB 7, CB 9, CB 10, CB 11, CB 12, CB 13, CB 16A, CB 16, CB 17, DA 1, DA 2(2), DB 6, DB 7, DB 23 and EA 2 Case references Case 5/2013 \[2013\] NZTRA 05, 26 NZTC 2,004 Case C9 (1977) 3 NZTC 60,058 Case G76 (1985) 7 NZTC 1,348 Case K21 (1988) 10 NZTC 218 Case M102 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,634 Parry v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,820 (HC) Other references Bright-line Test for Residential Land (Inland Revenue, Wellington, 2015)
1 Classified Public QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 16/08 INCOME TAX – DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE COSTS OF OBTAINING A DETAILED SEISMIC ASSESSMENT OF A BUILDING All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about ss DA 1(1) and DA 2(1). The risk of earthquakes is an ongoing reality in New Zealand. Since the Canterbury earthquakes and the introduction of the Building (Earthquake-prone Buildings) Amendment Act 2016, taxpayers are trying to determine how their buildings are likely to cope in an earthquake. One means of doing this is to obtain a detailed seismic assessment. Question 1. Is the cost of obtaining a detailed seismic assessment (DSA) of a building deductible to a business? Answer 2. With one exception, the costs incurred in obtaining a DSA (DSA costs) in the situations identified at \[7\], \[9\] and \[10\] are deductible. The exception is where a DSA is obtained as part of a capital project. In this case, the DSA costs take their nature from that project and are non-deductible capital expenditure. Explanation Introduction 3. A DSA is an engineering assessment that provides a detailed assessment of the seismic performance of a building. The focus of the DSA is on the likely behaviour of the building and its components in an earthquake. A DSA should identify any vulnerabilities in the building and give an earthquake rating (expressed as a percentage of the new building standard). It may also identify possible ways of mitigating the vulnerabilities and estimate the mitigation costs, depending on the owner’s instructions. 4. This item covers DSA costs incurred by taxpayers who:  are in the business of renting out commercial or residential buildings;  own buildings used for their own businesses;  get DSAs on someone else’s building where the safety of that building may impact on the taxpayer’s business. 5. The Commissioner considers that the same considerations and conclusions apply to the costs of other less detailed seismic assessments (including initial seismic assessments) when they are obtained by taxpayers in the same situations as those identified in this item. Less detailed seismic assessments may be obtained as a less costly alternative to DSAs. 6. A DSA can be obtained in a variety of situations and for varying reasons. This item addresses the deductibility of DSA costs in the most commonly occurring situations. It does not address the deductibility of DSA costs incurred when buying a building. 7. A DSA is most commonly obtained when a city or district council has identified a building as potentially earthquake prone (more fully discussed at \[8\]). An 2 Classified Public earthquake-prone building is often described as one that has an earthquake rating of less than 34% of the new building standard. 8. The Earthquake-prone Buildings Amendment Act 2016 requires city and district councils to actively identify and require owners to take action on earthquake- prone buildings. The process for doing this can generally be described as follows:  Identify potentially earthquake-prone buildings – The council makes a high-level assessment of a building to determine whether the building is potentially earthquake prone.  Obtain further information – For buildings identified as potentially earthquake prone, the building owner must obtain further information to determine whether the building is earthquake prone. This may involve the owner obtaining a DSA, because it provides a reliable and detailed assessment of the seismic performance of a building.  Take action on earthquake-prone buildings – If a building is confirmed as earthquake prone, the building owner and the council may discuss the available options and develop an agreed approach for the building. 9. A DSA may also need to be obtained when a building consent is required under the Building Act 2004 to alter a building (s 112 of the Building Act 2004). It may also be required when the use of a building changes (s 115 of the Building Act 2004). 10. Taxpayers may also choose to obtain a DSA:  as part of a project to seismically strengthen a building;  to satisfy existing or potential tenants of a building’s safety;  to get insurance or to reduce insurance premiums;  to identify possible damage after an earthquake;  to evaluate the safety of someone else’s building where the safety of that building may impact on the taxpayer’s business. 11. This item briefly sets out the relevant principles of deductibility under the Income Tax Act 2007, being the general permission and the capital limitation. It then considers whether DSA costs incurred in the situations identified in this item are deductible. Principles of deductibility General permission 12. Expenditure must first satisfy the general permission under s DA 1 to be deductible. Therefore, to be deductible, DSA costs must be incurred either in deriving income (s DA 1(1)(a)) or in the course of carrying on a business to derive income (s DA 1(1)(b)). 13. Section DA 1(1)(b) applies only to taxpayers who carry on a business. As set out in \[4\], this item applies to DSA costs incurred by taxpayers in business. In contrast to s DA 1(1)(a), under s DA 1(1)(b) expenditure need not be directly related to the derivation of income but is deductible when incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving income. This allows a broader approach:  To be expenditure incurred in carrying on a business, the expenditure must be incurred as part of the taxpayer’s business operations to obtain assessable income: FCT v Wells 71 ATC 4,188 (HCA); John Fairfax and Sons Pty Ltd v FCT (1959) 101 CLR 30 (HCA). 3 Classified Public  Whether expenditure has a sufficient relationship to the taxpayer’s business operations is usually determined from objective matters. However, subjective matters may be relevant where the expenditure was incurred by choice and the relationship between the expenditure and the business operations is more indirect and remote: CIR v Banks \[1978\] 2 NZLR 472 (CA) at 477; Magna Alloys & Research Pty Ltd v FCT 80 ATC 4,542 (FCAFC) at 4,548, 4,558– 4,559; Fletcher v FCT 91 ATC 4,950 (HCA) at 4,957; Putnin v FCT 91 ATC 4,097 (FCAFC); Schokker v FCT 99 ATC 4,504 (FCAFC).  Longer-term objectives can be considered. A deduction is allowed for expenditure incurred to protect or advance a business or to avoid or reduce costs: Europa Oil (NZ) Ltd (No 2) v CIR (1974) 1 NZTC 61,169 (CA) at 61,196–61,197; Cox v CIR (1992) 14 NZTC 9,164 at 9,168. 14. The Commissioner’s Interpretation Statement “IS 14/04: Income tax — Deductibility of company administration costs”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 7 (August 2014): 5, at \[26\]–\[28\] discusses the principles of deductibility under s DA 1 in more detail. Capital limitation 15. The capital limitation in s DA 2(1) may override the general permission. The capital limitation denies deductions for capital expenditure or losses. General principles 16. Two general principles form the basis for the distinction between capital and revenue expenditure. Dixon J formulated these principles in Hallstroms Pty Ltd v FCT (1946) 72 CLR 634 (HCA) at 647: ... the contrast between the two forms of expenditure corresponds to the distinction between the acquisition of the means of production and the use of them; between establishing or extending a business organization and carrying on the business; between the implements employed in work and the regular performance of the work in which they are employed; between an enterprise itself and the sustained effort of those engaged in it. And at 648: What is an outgoing of capital and what is an outgoing on account of revenue depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical or business point of view rather than on the juristic classification of any legal rights secured, employed or exhausted in the process. 17. In Commissioner of Taxes v Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines \[1964\] AC 948 the Privy Council applied the distinction between capital and revenue drawn in Hallstroms. Viscount Radcliffe stated at 960: Again courts have stressed the importance of observing a demarcation between the cost of creating, acquiring or enlarging the permanent (which does not mean perpetual) structure of which the income is to be the produce or fruit and the cost of earning that income itself or performing the income earning operations. Probably this is as illuminating a line of distinction as the law by itself is likely to achieve ... BP Australia factors 18. The Privy Council further developed these principles in BP Australia Ltd v FCT \[1965\] 3 All ER 209. The Privy Council set out several “factors” for helping to determine whether expenditure is revenue or capital under the general principles. These factors can be useful where the classification of expenditure as capital or revenue is unclear. The BP Australia factors, as applied and developed in later cases, are:  the need or occasion that calls for the expenditure; 4 Classified Public  whether the expenditure is recurrent in nature;  whether the expenditure is on the business structure or whether it is part of the income-earning process;  whether the expenditure creates an identifiable asset;  whether the expenditure is of a once and for all nature producing assets or advantages of an enduring benefit;  whether the expenditure is sourced from fixed or circulating capital; and  how the expenditure is treated under ordinary principles of commercial accounting. 19. The Commissioner’s Interpretation Statement “IS 12/03: Income tax — deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure — general principles”, Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 24, No 7 (August 2012): 68, at \[107\] discusses the BP Australia factors in more detail. 20. In BP Australia, the Privy Council stated that it is not appropriate to determine the issue under any rigid test or description. It has to be determined from many aspects of the whole set of circumstances, some of which may point in one direction, some in the other. Many of the above factors will overlap, and some factors will carry more weight than others on particular facts: BP Australia at 264. 21. The Privy Council’s approach in BP Australia has been recognised and applied in New Zealand cases, including:  CIR v McKenzies New Zealand Ltd (1988) 10 NZTC 5,223 (CA);  CIR v LD Nathan and Co Ltd \[1972\] NZLR 209 (CA); and  Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA). Costs incurred as part of one overall project 22. In addition to the general principles and the BP Australia factors, the courts have suggested that costs incurred as part of one overall capital project will likely take their nature from that project. It is not appropriate to separate out the different costs of the project for tax purposes where that project is capital in nature. This is regardless of whether that project concerns work done on a single asset or a group of assets: Colonial Motor Co Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,361 (in the context of a seismic strengthening project) and followed in Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,685 and Case X26 (2006) 22 NZTC 12,315. Whether a DSA is obtained as part of a capital project is a question of fact in each case. (See Interpretation Statement IS 12/03 at \[185\]–\[208\] and examples 17, 19 and 20 for further discussion of the tax treatment of costs incurred as part of one overall project.) Consideration of the capital or revenue issue in Trustpower 23. The Supreme Court recently considered a capital or revenue issue in Trustpower Ltd v CIR \[2016\] NZSC 91. The issue was whether expenditure incurred on obtaining resource consents for four proposed electricity generation projects was on revenue or capital account. The expenditure was described as feasibility expenditure on the basis that it was incurred to assist Trustpower to determine whether to complete the four generation projects. 24. The Supreme Court stated that the general rule is that expenditure referable to a proposed capital project will be capital. The court went on to acknowledge that early-stage feasibility expenditure referable to proposed capital projects may, nevertheless, sometimes be deductible. However, it considered that this would 5 Classified Public not extend to costs that are intended to (or do) materially advance the capital projects in question. Deductibility of DSA costs General permission 25. It is part of a business’s normal costs to keep important business structures in good working order. Buildings need to be checked throughout their lives to make sure they are performing and will continue to perform as required. Sometimes buildings need to be checked because of an external risk. The Commissioner considers that a building’s possible earthquake-prone status is such a risk. It is an abnormal event resulting in DSA costs being incurred in carrying on a business. The DSA costs can be reasonably regarded as unavoidable and for the purpose of the business generally: John Fairfax. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that these DSA costs satisfy the general permission in s DA 1(1)(b). Such DSA costs are costs a prudent business incurs to ensure its ongoing ability to earn income. 26. However, as stated, the capital limitation in s DA 2(1) may override the general permission. Therefore, the rest of this item focuses on whether the capital limitation applies to deny a deduction for the DSA costs incurred in the situations identified at \[7\], \[9\] and \[10\]. Capital limitation 27. Considerable case law exists on the distinction between capital and revenue expenditure. According to Dixon J at 648 in Hallstroms, deductibility “depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical or business point of view”. BP Australia sets out factors for helping to determine whether a particular expense is capital or revenue. The fact that expenditure relates to a capital asset does not of itself mean it is capital in nature and, therefore, not deductible. For example, expenditure on repairs and maintenance on a building, rates and building warrants of fitness are all deductible despite relating to what is generally a capital asset for most businesses (that is, the building). 28. While Trustpower adds to that case law, the Commissioner considers that Trustpower is not relevant to the situations identified and considered in this item. This is because the DSA costs are incurred in relation to an existing capital asset (that is, a building). In Trustpower, the expenditure was incurred on projects that, if they came to fruition, would result in the acquisition or development of new capital assets. Those capital assets did not exist when the expenditure on the resource consents was incurred. Therefore, the following paragraphs consider the deductibility of these DSA costs under the general principles formulated in Hallstroms and applied and developed in Nchanga. 29. The starting point is to determine what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical or business point of view. The following paragraphs consider the BP Australia factors as a means of assisting in addressing this question. 30. In some situations, such as where a DSA is obtained when a building has been identified as requiring earthquake strengthening, the need or occasion for incurring the DSA costs is, arguably, to determine the extent of the strengthening work required on the building. This supports a capital outcome. 31. However, other instances may support a revenue outcome. An example is where a DSA is obtained to satisfy potential tenants of a building’s safety. Arguably, in such cases the need or occasion for the DSA is to attract tenants or justify the rental charged. Similarly, where a DSA is obtained to get insurance or to reduce insurance premiums – the need or occasion is, arguably, to secure insurance or 6 Classified Public reduce premiums. This also suggests the expenditure was incurred as part of ordinary business operations. 32. Where a DSA is obtained following the council identifying the building as potentially earthquake prone, it might be argued that the expenditure is necessary to satisfy the legal requirement arising from the council identifying the building as potentially earthquake prone, so is revenue in nature. However, the existence of a statutory obligation to incur expenditure does not necessarily mean that expenditure incurred in complying with the obligation is deductible: FCT v The Swan Brewery Co Ltd 91 ATC 4,637 (FCAFC)). On the other hand, it is arguable that the need or occasion for the DSA costs in this situation is to show whether the building is in fact earthquake prone (and by how much it fails or exceeds the required standard). From a practical or business point of view, the expenditure is incurred to determine whether any further action needs to be taken. This is so regardless of the outcome of the DSA (ie, that the building is or is not earthquake prone). While the expenditure relates to a capital asset, that does not preclude it from being deductible. This factor, which the Commissioner considers important in the context of DSA costs, supports a revenue outcome. 33. DSA costs incurred in any of the situations identified in this item are likely to be one-off expenses rather than recurrent in nature. However, simply because an expense is one off does not necessarily mean it is capital in nature. While obtaining a DSA to find out whether a building is earthquake prone may be a one- off occurrence, owners may regularly consider the viability of their buildings (for example, by obtaining an annual building warrant of fitness). Ensuring the ongoing usefulness of its building is likely to be a regular part of a business’s undertaking. This would support the DSA costs being a revenue expense. 34. The next BP Australia factor is whether DSA costs are part of the income- earning process or incurred on the business structure. In the Commissioner’s view, this is a significant factor in the context of DSA costs. Obtaining a DSA to attract tenants or justify the rental charged may be argued to be like a marketing expense, which is expenditure on the income-earning process. Also, DSA costs incurred to reduce insurance premiums are incurred to reduce an otherwise deductible expense. This is often argued to be part of the income-earning process and therefore deductible. Similarly, it is arguable that finding out whether a building is earthquake prone does not add anything to the business structure. This is also true where a DSA is obtained on someone else’s building. Conversely, it might be said that gaining information about the structure of a building (a capital asset) is fundamentally a matter of capital. However, as stated at \[27\], the fact that expenditure relates to a capital asset does not of itself mean it is capital in nature and therefore not deductible. The result is that in most of the scenarios considered, the DSA costs more closely relate to the income-earning process than the business structure. 35. Turning now to whether the DSA costs create an identifiable asset or produce assets or advantages of an enduring benefit, the first point to note is that the Commissioner considers that the DSA itself is not a capital asset. In the scenarios set out above, a DSA will simply provide the building owner with information. Finding out whether a building is earthquake prone does not create an identifiable asset or produce assets or advantages of an enduring benefit. This is because nothing is being done to the building. It is what the business does with that information that can result in an enduring benefit. However, where a DSA is obtained as part of a capital project (such as a capital project to seismically strengthen a building), it may be part of a project specifically intended to produce an enduring benefit. 7 Classified Public 36. Finally, whether the DSA costs are sourced from fixed or circulating capital and how they are treated under ordinary principles of commercial accounting are not helpful in this case. These factors are not determinative, and the courts have rarely given them much weight. However, to the extent that it may be relevant, DSA costs are generally expected to be funded from circulating capital and expensed for accounting purposes. Summary 37. DSA costs are incurred in a variety of situations as set out above. Correctly characterising what the DSA costs are calculated to effect from a practical or business point of view is important across the variety of situations. However, it is a matter on which different views can reasonably be held. The BP Australia factors have been considered as a means of assisting with this enquiry. The Commissioner considers that the BP Australia factors that should be given the most weight in the context of the deductibility of DSA costs all support a revenue outcome:  The need or occasion for the DSA costs – the need or occasion for the DSA costs, while different from scenario to scenario, suggests that in the situations identified above the DSA costs are incurred as part of ordinary business operations.  Whether DSA costs are part of the income-earning process or on the business structure – in the scenarios considered, a significant connection exists between the DSA costs and the income-earning process. Simply finding out whether a building is earthquake prone does not add anything to the business structure.  Whether the DSA costs create an identifiable asset or produce assets or advantages of an enduring benefit – the DSA costs do not create an identifiable asset or produce assets or advantages of an enduring benefit. The DSA is not a capital asset, it simply provides the building owner with information about whether the building is earthquake prone. Nothing is being done to the building. It is what the building owner does with that information that can result in an enduring benefit. 38. The exception is where DSA costs are incurred as part of a capital project (such as the seismic strengthening project in Colonial Motor). The Commissioner considers that, as set out at \[22\], these DSA costs would be capitalised into the project and not deducted for tax purposes: Colonial Motor, Hawkes Bay Power and Case X26. Conclusion 39. The Commissioner considers that, from a practical or business point of view, expenditure on a DSA in the situations identified in this item is incurred to obtain information so as to determine whether a building is earthquake prone (and by how much it fails or exceeds the required standard). Such expenditure should be treated as revenue in nature and deductible. This outcome is consistent with increasing certainty and reducing compliance costs. 40. However, where the DSA costs are incurred as part of a capital project they will be capital in nature and non-deductible. 8 Classified Public References Subject references capital limitation detailed seismic assessment earthquake strengthening seismic strengthening Legislative references Building Act 2004 Building (Earthquake-prone Buildings) Amendment Act 2016 Income Tax Act 2007 – ss DA 1 and DA 2(1) Case references BP Australia Ltd v FCT \[1965\] 3 All ER 209 (PC) Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA) Case X26 (2006) 22 NZTC 12,315 CIR v Banks \[1978\] 2 NZLR 472 (CA) CIR v LD Nathan and Co Ltd \[1972\] NZLR 209 (CA) CIR v McKenzies New Zealand Ltd (1988) 10 NZTC 5,223 (CA) Colonial Motor Co Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,361 (CA) Commissioner of Taxes v Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines \[1964\] AC 948 (PC) Cox v CIR (1992) 14 NZTC 9,164 Hallstroms Pty Ltd v FCT (1946) 72 CLR 634 (HCA) Europa Oil (NZ) Ltd (No 2) v CIR (1974) 1 NZTC 61,169 (CA) FCT v The Swan Brewery Co Ltd 91 ATC 4,637 (FCAFC) FCT v Wells 71 ATC 4,188 (HCA) Fletcher v FCT 91 ATC 4,950 (HCA) Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,685 John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd v FCT (1959) 101 CLR 30 (HCA) Magna Alloys & Research Pty Ltd v FCT 80 ATC 4,542 (FCAFC) Putnin v FCT 91 ATC 4,097 (FCAFC) Schokker v FCT 99 ATC 4,504 (FCAFC) Trustpower Ltd v CIR \[2016\] NZSC 91 Other references “IS 14/04: Income tax — Deductibility of company administration costs”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 7 (August 2014): 5 “IS 12/03: Income Tax — Deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure — general principles”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 7 (August 2012): 68
1 UNCLASSIFIED QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 17/02 INCOME TAX – DATE OF ACQUISITION OF LAND, AND START DATE FOR 2-YEAR BRIGHT-LINE TEST All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act) unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) is about ss CB 6A and CB 15B. Some of the land provisions in the Act (ss CB 6, CB 7, CB 9, CB 10, CB 12, CB 14 and CB 19) require identification of the date that someone acquired land. This can be relevant to the provisions that:  involve 10-year timeframes;  might apply if at the time the person acquired the land they were, or were associated with, someone in the business of dealing in land, developing or subdividing land, or building; and  might apply depending on the person’s intended use of the land, or their purpose or intention at the time they acquired the land. This QWBA explains when someone acquires land for the purposes of those provisions. It also sets out when the 2-year period starts for the bright-line test in s CB 6A. The date of acquisition and the start date for the 2-year period are usually different dates. This QWBA updates the Commissioner’s previously published views in two respects.  It qualifies a statement in the item “Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Act 2015” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 1 (February 2016): 78. That item suggests that the date someone acquires their first estate or interest in land (relevant to whether the bright-line legislation potentially applies to them) is the same as when they acquire land under s CB 15B. While that is true in most cases (ie, in a typical land purchase), there are some exceptions. See \[27\] on this point.  It supersedes “Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Act 2015” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 1 (February 2016): 78 in relation to the application of the bright-line test to nominations. See from \[46\] on this point. Question 1. On what date is a person treated as acquiring land for the purposes of the land sale rules in ss CB 6 to CB 14? And when does the 2-year period for the bright- line test in s CB 6A start? Answer 2. Table 1 shows the date on which land is acquired in different situations, for the purposes of the land sale rules in ss CB 6 to CB 14. Table 2 shows the date on which the 2-year period for the bright-line test in s CB 6A starts in different situations. 2 UNCLASSIFIED Table 1 – When land is acquired for the purposes of the land sale rules in ss CB 6 to CB 14 Circumstance When land is acquired for tax purposes (other than the 2- year bright-line test) Standard purchase of land. When a binding contract to purchase the land is formed (even if some conditions still need to be met – see further from \[42\]). Land other than freehold (eg, a leasehold estate, an equitable interest in land, or an option to acquire land). The date on which the person first had an interest in the land (subject to the rest of the rules in this table). Land acquired from the exercise of an option. When the person exercised the option. Agreement for acquisition of land on behalf of a company not yet formed. The date the agreement was entered into. Land that a person subdivides. The date the person acquired the original undivided piece of land. Land acquired from an associated person. The date the associated person acquired the land (relevant for only ss CB 7 to CB 12 and CB 14).  Special rules (see \[86\] and \[87\]) about when land is treated as acquired might apply if a person acquired the land by way of a: - settlement of relationship property; - distribution on someone’s death; - distribution from a trust; - transfer of value from a company; - gift; or - resident’s restricted amalgamation. 3 UNCLASSIFIED Table 2 – When the 2-year period for the bright-line test starts (relevant if the first interest in the land was acquired on or after 1 October 2015 – see further from \[22\]) 3. Some of the land provisions require identification of the date that someone acquired land (see further at \[ 12\]). The main rules about when a person is treated as acquiring land for tax purposes are set out in s CB 15B (see Table 1 and from \[36\]). 4. There are special rules about when the 2-year period for the bright-line test in s CB 6A starts (see Table 2 and from \[27\]). This date is generally not the same as when the person acquires land for the other tax provisions. Circumstances Start of the 2-year period Standard purchase of land. When the land transfer is registered and the person gets the legal title. (If the land is held in a trust, transfers because of a change of trustee(s) will not reset the start date. The start date is the date of registration of the transfer of the land into the trust.) If a person had an agreement to acquire freehold land on the completion of a development or subdivision, and they subsequently acquired the land (discussed at \[32\]). The date the person entered into the contract to acquire the land. If a person acquired land and subsequently subdivided it. The date of registration of the transfer of the original undivided piece of land to the person. (If the land is held in a trust, transfers because of a change of trustee(s) will not reset the start date. The start date is the date of registration of the transfer of the original undivided piece of land into the trust.) OR If the title for the undivided land was not registered to the person before they dispose of the divided land, the start date will be the date they acquired an estate or interest in the original undivided piece of land. This is determined under the standard rules discussed in this QWBA. Lease with perpetual right of renewal converted into freehold title. The date the person was first granted the leasehold estate. Settlement of relationship property. The date the transfer of the land to the transferor under the settlement was registered (or the date they acquired it, if there was no registered transfer to them). Where no title is registered to a person before the earliest of the date they have an agreement to dispose of the land or the date they in fact dispose of it. When the person acquired an estate or interest in the land they are disposing of. This is determined in the same way as for the general rule in s CB 15(1) – see from \[42\]. For these purposes, the special rules about when land is acquired do not apply (ie, the rules for land acquired from the exercise of an option, land acquired under an agreement for the acquisition of land on behalf of a company not yet formed, land acquired from an associated person, and the special rules mentioned at \[86\] and \[87\]). 4 UNCLASSIFIED 5. The general rule in s CB 15B is that someone acquires land on the date that they first have an estate or interest in the land or first have an option to acquire the land (the “first interest”). 6. A person will often acquire different interests (each being “land”) in the same piece of underlying physical land at different times. For example, in a typical purchase of land situation, the purchaser acquires an equitable interest in the estate when a binding contract to purchase the land is formed, which is before they acquire the legal interest (when the land is transferred to them). What is relevant is when they acquired their first interest in the land (ie, the particular estate) that they are disposing of. This will typically be when a binding contract to purchase the land is formed, even if some conditions still need to be met (such as obtaining finance, a building report or a Land Information Memorandum (LIM)) – see further from \[42\]. 7. Any other interests the person has had in the same underlying physical land will not be relevant. For example, if they might be taxed on the sale of a freehold estate and the date of acquisition is relevant to that, the fact they previously had a leasehold interest in the land will not be relevant. They are treated as acquiring the freehold estate on the date they first had an interest in that estate. 8. Where someone acquires land by way of an option, the date of acquisition will be the date they exercised the option. 9. Where a company acquires land under an agreement entered into on its behalf before it was formed, the company is treated as acquiring the land when the agreement was entered into (see further from \[83\]). 10. If someone acquires land from an associated person, for the purposes of some provisions (ss CB 7 to CB 12 and CB 14) they are treated as acquiring it on the date that the associated person acquired it (s CB 15(2)). 11. A person may be treated as having a different date of acquisition than the date under s CB 15B in some other situations; for example, if they acquired the land on a settlement of relationship property, on a distribution on someone’s death, on a distribution from a trust, on a transfer of value from a company, or as a gift (see subparts FB and FC), or on a resident’s restricted amalgamation (see s FO 17). Explanation Relevance of the date of acquisition of land 12. Some of the land provisions require identification of when a person acquired land. The date someone acquired land is relevant to the following provisions: Section CB 6  If a person acquired land for the purpose of disposing of it, or with the intention of disposing of it, the amount they derive on the disposal of the land will be income (if no exclusion applies). Therefore, it is necessary to look at what the person’s purposes and intentions were when they acquired the land. Sections CB 7, CB 9, CB 10, CB 12, CB 14 and CB 19  The date of acquisition is relevant to these provisions because: - in some circumstances, if a person disposes of land or commences an undertaking or scheme within 10 years of when they acquired the land, the sale proceeds will be income; or 5 UNCLASSIFIED - it is necessary to identify whether at the time a person acquired land they were, or were associated with, someone in the business of dealing in land, developing or subdividing land, or building (which may mean certain taxing provisions apply); or - the person’s intended use of the land at the time they acquired it is relevant. Start date for the 2-year bright-line test 13. If none of ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply, the 2-year bright-line test (in s CB 6A) may tax any gains from residential land if someone sells or disposes of the land within two years of their bright-line start date. It is necessary to identify when the 2-year period for the bright-line test in s CB 6A starts, so the person can determine if they are potentially taxed under that provision. As noted at \[4\], there are special rules about when the 2-year period starts, and this date is generally not the same as when the person acquires land for the other tax provisions. The start date for the 2-year bright-line test is discussed from \[27\]. Why we have been asked to clarify the date of acquisition of land 14. Section CB 15B was enacted to clarify when land is acquired for tax purposes. Section CB 15B applies for the land provisions in subpart CB, except the 2-year bright-line test. It was suggested that some explanation about how s CB 15B operates would be useful. In particular, the Commissioner has been asked to confirm when a person will acquire an estate or interest in land for the purposes of s CB 15B, and to provide examples of the date of acquisition of land in different scenarios. 15. Because in most cases the 2-year period for the bright-line test in s CB 6A does not start on the date land is acquired under s CB 15B, this QWBA also sets out when the bright-line period starts in different situations. Date of disposal of land 16. In most cases, the date that land is acquired for the purposes of the land provisions will not be the date it is disposed of by the vendor or transferor. This QWBA does not consider the date of disposal of land. Definition of “land” 17. “Land” is defined in s YA 1 as including any estate or interest in land, and as including an option to acquire land or an estate or interest in land: YA 1 Definitions In this Act, unless the context requires otherwise,— ... land— (a) includes any estate or interest in land: (b) includes an option to acquire land or an estate or interest in land: (c) does not include a mortgage: ... \[Emphasis added\] 18. “Estate”, “interest”, “estate or interest in land” and similar terms are defined as meaning: YA 1 Definitions 6 UNCLASSIFIED In this Act, unless the context requires otherwise,— ... estate in relation to land, interest in relation to land, estate or interest in land, estate in land, interest in land, and similar terms — (a) mean an estate or interest in the land, whether legal or equitable, and whether vested or contingent, in possession, reversion, or remainder; and (b) include a right, whether direct or through a trustee or otherwise, to— (i) the possession of the land (for example: a licence to occupy, as that term is defined in section 121A(1) of the Land Transfer Act 1952): (ii) the receipt of the rents or profits from the land: (iii) the proceeds of the disposal of the land; and (c) do not include a mortgage 19. Any estate or interest in land (whether legal or equitable, and whether vested or contingent) is “land”, and an option to acquire land or an estate or interest in land is also “land”. 20. The land sale rules in the Act can apply to the disposal of any estate or interest that is “land” as defined. The 2-year bright-line test 21. As noted at \[13\], the 2-year bright-line test can only potentially apply if none of the land sale rules in ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply. While it is necessary to consider the application of ss CB 6 to CB 12 before considering the 2-year bright-line test, the following discussion looks at the start date for the bright-line test before going on to consider when land is acquired for the purposes of the other land sale rules. This is because the examples throughout the discussion of the date of acquisition rules also note when the bright-line start date would be. Application of the 2-year bright-line legislation 22. The 2-year bright-line test came into force on 1 October 2015. It can only potentially apply when someone disposes of land if they first acquired an estate or interest in that land on or after 1 October 2015. 1 23. In a typical land purchase, the purchaser will first acquire an interest in the land when a binding contract to purchase the land is formed (even if some conditions still need to be met). And, if that date is on or after 1 October 2015, the bright- line legislation could potentially apply to their disposal of the land. 24. In most cases, the date on which someone first acquires an estate or interest in land (which is what is relevant to whether the bright-line legislation can apply to them) is the same as the date they are treated as acquiring the land for the purposes of the land provisions in ss CB 6 to CB 14. This is the case in a typical land purchase. 25. But, in some situations, the date on which someone first acquires an estate or interest in land will not be the same date as when they are treated as acquiring land for the purposes of the land provisions in ss CB 6 to CB 14. For example, if they acquire land through the exercise of an option, their date of acquisition for ss CB 6 to CB 14 will be the date they exercise the option. But the relevant date for determining if the bright-line legislation potentially applies is the date that they first acquired an interest in the land. In most situations, this would be when the option was granted to them. In a situation where the person had a “first right 1 Section 4(2) of the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Act 2015. 7 UNCLASSIFIED option” to acquire the land (eg, a right of first refusal or a right of first offer), they would typically first acquire an interest in the land when the owner makes an offer in accordance with the “first right option” (see Motor Works Ltd v Westminster Auto Services Ltd \[1997\] 1 NZLR 762 (HC)). Similarly, the date of acquisition and the date someone first acquires an estate or interest in land will be different if they are a company that acquired land under an agreement entered into on its behalf before it was formed, or in the situations mentioned at \[11\]. In all of those situations it is necessary to consider land law principles to determine the point at which the person first acquired an interest in the land and, therefore, whether the bright-line legislation could apply to them (ie, if the date they first acquired an interest in the land was on or after 1 October 2015). 26. The item “Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Act 2015” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 1 (February 2016): 78 suggests that the date someone acquires their first estate or interest in land is the same as when they acquire land under s CB 15B. As noted at \[24\], while that is true in most cases (ie, in a typical land purchase), the situations mentioned at \[25\] are exceptions to that. This QWBA qualifies the Tax Information Bulletin item in this respect. Start of the 2-year bright-line period 27. If none of the land sale rules in ss CB 6 to CB 12 (see \[12\]) apply, the 2-year bright-line test (in s CB 6A) may tax any gains from residential land, if someone enters into an agreement to dispose of the land or in fact disposes of it within two years of their bright-line start date. It is necessary to identify when the 2-year period for the bright-line test in s CB 6A starts, so the person can determine if they are potentially taxed under that provision. (Note that in some situations the bright-line test will not apply; for example, if the person satisfies the main home exclusion (s CB 16A).) 28. The following paragraphs explain the special rules about when the 2-year period for the bright-line test starts in different situations. 29. If a document transferring the land to a person was registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952 2 on or before they sell or dispose of the land, the date of registration will be the start date for the 2-year bright-line test. In a typical land purchase, this will mean that the 2-year period starts when the land transfer was registered and the purchaser got the legal title. 30. If the land is held in a trust, transfers because of a change of trustee(s) will not reset the start date. The start date is the date of registration of the transfer of the land into the trust. But, if the land was transferred out of the trust and then back into the trust at a later date, the start date would be reset at that point. 31. If there was no registered transfer of the land to someone on or before the date they sell or dispose of the land, the 2-year period will start when they acquired the relevant estate or interest in land. This is determined under the standard rules, discussed from \[42\]. 32. If someone had an interest in relation to freehold land that was contingent on the completion of a development or subdivision, and they subsequently acquired the land when the development or subdivision was completed, the 2-year period will start on the date they acquired the contingent interest. For example, if someone entered into a contract to acquire land that was to be subdivided, there would not be a title for the specific land they were buying at the time they entered into the contract. Therefore, their interest in the land is contingent on the completion of the subdivision. This is referred to as buying land “off the plans”. If, after the 2 Or a similar foreign law if the land is outside New Zealand (ss CB 6A(1)(a)(ii) and CB 6A(2)(a)(ii)). 8 UNCLASSIFIED subdivision is completed, the sale is finalised and the title is transferred to the person, the 2-year period will start on the date that they entered into the binding contract, not the date the title was transferred to them. If the person sold or disposed of their contingent interest in the land and never obtained the title, this would be a disposal of land and the 2-year bright-line test could apply if none of ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply. The start date for the 2-year period in that situation would also be the date that they entered into the binding contract. 33. If someone acquired land and subsequently subdivided it, the 2-year period for each of the resulting lots will start on the date of registration of the transfer of the original undivided piece of land to them. The fact that separate new titles were issued is not relevant. If the title for the undivided land was not registered to them before they dispose of the divided land, the start date will be the date they acquired an estate or interest in the original undivided piece of land. This is determined under the standard rules, discussed from \[42\]. 34. If someone had a lease with a perpetual right of renewal that they converted into freehold land, the 2-year period starts when the leasehold estate was granted. 35. On the breakdown of a relationship, land may be transferred from one party to the other as part of the settlement of relationship property. In that situation, the transfer between the parties to the relationship property agreement will generally not give the party who is acquiring the land a new start date. The 2-year period for the person acquiring the land on the settlement will start on the date that the instrument transferring the land to the transferor under the settlement was registered (or the date the transferor acquired it, if there was no registered transfer to them). When land is acquired for the land provisions other than the 2-year bright-line test 36. Any estate or interest in land (whether legal or equitable, and whether vested or contingent) is “land”, and an option to acquire land or an estate or interest in land is also “land”. 37. Given this, a person will often acquire different estates or interests (each being “land”) in the same piece of underlying physical land at different times. For example, during the typical course of acquisition of a freehold estate in fee simple, a person will usually acquire an equitable interest in the estate before acquiring the legal interest in the estate. 38. However, while different interests that are each “land” in their own right may be acquired at different times, what is relevant is the date the land that is disposed of, and potentially subject to tax under one of the land provisions in subpart CB, was acquired. For example, if someone is disposing of a freehold estate in fee simple and the date of acquisition is relevant to a particular taxing provision, the question is – when did they acquire that land (ie, the freehold estate)? Any other interest they have had in the land (for example, a leasehold interest) is not relevant. The general rule 39. The general rule about when land is acquired for the purposes of the land provisions (except the 2-year bright-line test – discussed from \[27\]) is set out in s CB 15B(1), which says: CB 15B When land acquired General rule 9 UNCLASSIFIED (1) For the purposes of this subpart except section CB 6A, a person acquires an estate, interest, or option that is land (the land) on the date that begins a period in which the person has an estate or interest in, or an option to acquire, the land, alone or jointly or in common with another person. 40. Under this general rule, a person acquires land on the date that they first have an estate or interest in the land, or first have an option to acquire the land. When land is acquired, different interests will typically arise at different times, and then ultimately merge when the full title is conferred. The fact that s CB 15B refers to the date that “begins a period” in which the person has an estate or interest in the land, or an option to acquire it, indicates that it is the first estate or interest in the land in question that is relevant. 41. As the High Court noted in AAA Developments (Ormiston) Ltd v CIR (2015) 27 NZTC 22,026 (HC), under s CB 15B a person is treated as acquiring land at the stage in the process of acquisition when they have a right or an interest in the land and are entitled to apply to a court for protection of that right. When does someone first have an estate or interest in land under a sale and purchase agreement? 42. The legislation does not specify when someone is considered to first have an estate or interest in land. However, in Bevin v Smith \[1994\] 3 NZLR 648 (CA) it was held that a purchaser has an equitable interest in land from the time a binding contract exists, even if it is conditional. This is when equitable remedies are available to protect the purchaser’s rights under the contract, though specific performance in the strict sense (ie, for the transfer of title) would not yet be available. 43. The most common conditions in contracts for the sale and purchase of land (such as the need to obtain finance, a building report or a LIM) would not prevent there being a binding contract. But sometimes conditions that will mean that there is not in fact a binding contract yet, so the land is not considered to be acquired yet. For example, there may not be a binding contract if a condition requires the approval of a company’s directors or requires due diligence to be carried out. It is necessary to consider the terms of the particular contract and the nature of the conditions to determine whether there is a binding contract (see, for example, Fletcher Challenge Energy Ltd v Electricity Corporation of New Zealand Ltd \[2002\] 2 NZLR 433 (CA), Willetts v Ryan \[1968\] NZLR 863 (CA), and Barrett v IBC International Ltd \[1995\] 3 NZLR 170 (CA)). 44. As noted at \[40\], the date a person acquires land under s CB 15B is the date they first have an estate or interest in the land, or an option to acquire the land. In a typical land purchase, this will be the time at which a binding contract to purchase the land is formed (even if some conditions still need to be met). 45. This is supported by the extrinsic materials from the time of the introduction of s CB 15B. Those materials make it clear that a person is regarded as acquiring land at the time a binding agreement for the acquisition is formed, even if there are conditions that still need to be fulfilled. See, for example, Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Bill: Commentary on the Bill (Inland Revenue, Wellington, November 2013). 46. What is relevant is the time that the person acquires the first interest in the land in question – ie, the land they are disposing of and is potentially subject to tax under one of the provisions in subpart CB. Other interests in the same underlying physical land will not be relevant. For example, if the sale of a freehold estate may give rise to taxation and the date of acquisition is relevant, the fact that the 10 UNCLASSIFIED person previously had a leasehold interest in the land will not be relevant. The date on which their first interest in the freehold estate arose will be the date that land was acquired. 47. The following two examples illustrate when land is acquired under the general rule in s CB 15B(1). They also note when the 2-year period for the bright-line test starts. Example 1 – Binding sale and purchase (S&P) agreement Sally entered into a sale and purchase agreement to purchase some land (the freehold estate). The agreement was subject to Sally obtaining satisfactory LIM and building reports within a specified timeframe. Those conditions were fulfilled, and the sale was settled in due course. When Sally sold the property some time later, one of the land provisions in subpart CB potentially applied and the date that she acquired the land was relevant. For the purposes of the land sale provisions in subpart CB, other than the 2-year bright-line test, Sally acquired the land when she and the vendor entered into the binding sale and purchase agreement, even though that agreement was subject to conditions, because that was when Sally first had an equitable interest in the land. Because Sally first got an estate or interest in the land when she and the vendor entered into the binding sale and purchase agreement, that is also the relevant date for determining if the bright-line legislation potentially applies. If the agreement was entered into on or after 1 October 2015, the bright-line legislation can apply to Sally’s disposal of the land if none of ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply. The 2-year period for the bright-line test (which may apply if none of ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply) starts on the date the transfer of title was registered to Sally. Settlement / transfer of title registered Binding S&P agreement entered into S&P agreement unconditional Date the land is acquired for provisions other than the bright-line test The 2-year period for the bright-line test starts 11 UNCLASSIFIED Example 2 – Lease before acquisition of freehold Tony and Cleo were renting a house that the owner decided to sell. Before putting the property on the market, the owner asked Tony and Cleo if they were interested in purchasing the property. They were, so entered into a sale and purchase agreement for the property. The agreement was subject to finance. That condition was fulfilled, and the sale was settled in due course. When Tony and Cleo sold the property some time later, one of the land provisions in subpart CB potentially applied and the date that they acquired the land (the freehold estate) was relevant. For the purposes of the land sale provisions in subpart CB, other than the 2-year bright-line test, Tony and Cleo acquired the land (the freehold) when they and the vendor entered into the binding sale and purchase agreement, even though it was subject to finance, because that was when Tony and Cleo first had an equitable interest in the land. It is not relevant that they previously held another interest in the underlying physical land (ie, the leasehold interest). The potential taxing event was the disposal of the freehold estate, so the issue is when the freehold estate was acquired. Because Tony and Cleo first got an estate or interest in the land (the freehold) when they and the vendor entered into the binding sale and purchase agreement, that is also the relevant date for determining if the bright-line legislation potentially applies. If the agreement was entered into on or after 1 October 2015, the bright- line legislation can apply to Tony and Cleo’s disposal of the land if none of ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply. The 2-year period for the bright-line test (which may apply if none of ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply) starts on the date the transfer of title was registered to Tony and Cleo. Binding S&P agreement entered into Lease entered into Settlement / transfer of title registered Date the land is acquired for provisions other than the bright-line test S&P agreement unconditional The 2-year period for the bright-line test starts 12 UNCLASSIFIED Nominations, assignments of contractual rights, and novations of contracts – what is the difference, how do these arrangements affect determining the date of acquisition, and are there bright-line implications for these arrangements? 48. One nomination situation that can arise is where the named purchaser is acting on someone else’s behalf, and that person is subsequently nominated as the purchaser. 49. Another nomination situation that often occurs is where someone enters into a binding sale and purchase agreement to purchase land and that person “and/or nominee” are named as the purchaser. Before settlement, the person may then choose to nominate someone else (a nominee) to complete the purchase. A common situation where this occurs is where, after entering into the sale and purchase agreement, the purchasers decide to hold the property in a trust or other entity. 50. In this type of nomination situation, the nominee is able to enforce the contract through ss 4 and 8 of the Contracts (Privity) Act 1982, 3 but the original contracting party (the nominator) remains a party to the contract and may also enforce its terms. 51. It may also be that the named purchaser assigns their rights under the sale and purchase agreement to someone else. If there is an assignment of contractual rights, the assignor transfers their rights to the assignee, who is then entitled to the benefit of the contract and can enforce those rights against the other party to the contract. 52. There will be an assignment of the contractual rights under a sale and purchase agreement to purchase land if there is a deed or other signed document that shows that the intention is that the original named purchaser is transferring all of their rights under the sale and purchase agreement to the other person – whether absolutely, conditionally, or by way of charge. A common situation where there is an assignment of contractual rights is where someone purchases land off the plans and then on-sells it before settlement. Note that the document does not need to purport to be an assignment to be one. It may be that a document that is described as a nomination in fact amounts to an assignment of the contractual rights. That said, someone simply nominating a different person or entity as the purchaser would not inadvertently effect an assignment of the contractual rights, given the nature of the wording that would need to be used for there to be an assignment. 53. It is also possible for there to be a novation, in which case the original contract is discharged, and a new contract with a different purchaser entered into. This requires the vendor to consent to both the cancellation of the original contract and the creation of the new contract. Consent may be inferred from the behaviour of the vendor, but a normal nomination situation is unlikely to be regarded as a novation. See, for example, Karangahape Road International Village Ltd v Holloway \[1989\] 1 NZLR 83 (HC) and Stonne Ltd v Ronyx Holdings Ltd (2005) 7 NZCPR 18 (HC). Nominations 54. In the nomination situation where the named purchaser is acting on someone else’s behalf and that person is subsequently nominated as the purchaser, a special provision (s YB 21) will apply. Under that provision, because the named purchaser was acting on the other person’s behalf, the other person is treated as 3 See for example, Rattrays Wholesale Ltd v Meredyth-Young & A’Court \[1997\] 2 NZLR 363 (HC) and Laidlaw v Parsonage \[2010\] 1 NZLR 286 (CA). 13 UNCLASSIFIED having done what the named purchaser did (ie, enter into the contract), and holding the resulting rights. The person acting on the other’s behalf is ignored. Because of this, the person who the nominee is acting for will be treated as having acquired the land at the time the nominee first had an estate or interest in the land. In a standard purchase of land situation this will be when there is a binding contract between the vendor and the nominee to purchase the land. 55. As noted at \[49\], the other type of nomination situation is where the named purchaser is not acting on someone else’s behalf, but before settlement they nominate someone else to complete the purchase. In that situation, the nominee acquires the land under s CB 15B (relevant for the land provisions in subpart CB except the 2-year bright-line test) on the date they are nominated as the purchaser. This is when the nominee first has an equitable interest in the land. This is because the nominee is able to enforce the contract through ss 4 and 8 of the Contracts (Privity) Act 1982. While the original named purchaser remains a party to the contract, and may also enforce its terms (in addition to remaining liable for the performance of the burden of their promises under the contract), the nomination gives the nominee an equitable interest in the land too. 4 56. Usually, in this type of nominee situation, the nominator and nominee are associated. Where land is transferred between associated persons, s CB 15(2) alters the date of acquisition for the transferee for the purposes of most of the land provisions (ss CB 7 to CB 12, and s CB 14). Section CB 15(2) treats the transferee as having acquired the land on the date on which the transferor acquired it. However, s CB 15(2) will not apply to alter the date of acquisition for a nominee who is associated with the original named purchaser who nominated them. This is because the original named purchaser does not transfer their interest in the land to the nominee when they make the nomination. As noted at \[50\], they continue to have their rights under the contract and, therefore, their interest in the land. The nomination simply creates additional rights (for the nominee). 57. The nominee’s date of acquisition is, therefore, established under the general rule in s CB 15B(1). As noted at \[55\], this will be the date they are nominated as the purchaser. 58. The 2-year period for the bright-line test would start for the nominee on the date the transfer of title is registered to them (which typically happens on the settlement date). If there is no registered transfer of the land to the nominee on or before the date they sell or dispose of the land, the 2-year period will start on the date they were nominated as purchaser. 59. The nomination of someone else as purchaser will not give rise to any potential bright-line implications for the nominator (the original named purchaser). This is because, as noted above, the nominator does not transfer their interest in the land to the nominee when they make the nomination – there is no disposal. When the legal title transfers to the nominee (typically on the settlement date), the nominator’s interest in the land simply ceases to exist, it is not disposed of. This is somewhat analogous to the lapsing of an option to acquire land, which has been considered by the Taxation Review Authority not to be a disposition of land (Case M4 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,021 (TRA)). 60. The item “Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Act 2015” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 1 (February 2016): 78 included an example (at 82) showing how s CB 6A applies in a nominee situation. That example stated that a nomination was a disposal, so s CB 6A could apply to tax any increase in 4 Rivette v Atrax Group New Zealand Ltd (2010) 11 NZCPR 723 (HC). 14 UNCLASSIFIED the value of the property. This QWBA supersedes the Tax Information Bulletin item in this respect. Assignment of contractual rights 61. If what has occurred is an assignment of contractual rights (see \[51\] – \[ 52\]) and the parties are not associated, the assignee acquires the land under s CB 15B (so for the land provisions in subpart CB except the 2-year bright-line test) on the date of the assignment. This is when the assignee first has an equitable interest in the land. 62. If the assignor and assignee are associated, the assignee’s date of acquisition for the purposes of most of the land provisions (ss CB 7 to CB 12, and s CB 14) will be the date that the assignor first had their equitable interest in the land (ie, typically, the date they entered into the contract to purchase the land, even if some conditions still needed to be met). 63. This is because s CB 15(2) treats someone who acquires land from an associated person as having acquired it on the date the associated person did. That means that the assignee is treated as having acquired the equitable interest in the land that the assignor had at the date the assignor acquired it. If the assignee’s subsequent disposal of the estate in fee simple is potentially subject to tax and the date they acquired the land is relevant, the question in terms of s CB 15B is when did they first acquire an estate or interest in that land. Because they were associated with the assignor, so are treated as having acquired the equitable interest at the time the assignor did, they first had an interest in the estate in fee simple from that time. 64. The 2-year period for the bright-line test would start for the assignee on the date the transfer of title is registered to them (which typically happens on the settlement date). 65. If the land is residential land, the assignment of the contractual rights to someone else within two years of the sale and purchase agreement being entered into may mean any amount the assignor derives on the disposal (the assignment of the rights) is taxed under the bright-line test (if none of ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply). 66. If there is no amount paid for the assignment (or if the consideration is less than market value), the assignor would be treated as having derived an amount equal to the market value of the land that is disposed of (the equitable interest). The assignee would similarly be treated as having incurred expenditure of an amount equal to the market value of the land (the equitable interest). 67. The deeming of a market value amount being derived by the assignor and incurred by the assignee is because of s GC 1, which deals with disposals of trading stock at below market value. Section GC 1 would apply because the land is “trading stock” (as defined in s YA 1) for the purposes of s GC 1. For s GC 1 purposes, “trading stock” includes land, if the disposal of the land would produce income under any of the land provisions (including the bright-line test). Because the assignment of the contractual rights is within two years, it is a disposal of land that would produce income under the bright-line test, so the land is trading stock. 68. This deeming of a market value amount being derived by the assignor and incurred by the assignee means that even if there is no consideration for the assignment, there will be tax implications under s CB 6A if the market value of the land changes between the time an original named purchaser enters into the sale and purchase agreement and the time they assign their rights under that contract to someone else. It is important to bear in mind that as with any other 15 UNCLASSIFIED sale or disposal of land, there may be residential land withholding tax obligations if the assignor is an “offshore RLWT person” (defined in s YA 1). Novation of the contract 69. If what has occurred is a novation of the contract (see \[53\]), there will be no implications under the land sale rules for the original purchaser. This is because their interest in the land is not disposed of; it simply ceases to exist when the original contract is discharged. The purchaser under the new contract will acquire the land under the rules discussed in this QWBA, and their bright-line start date will be established as discussed in this QWBA. 70. The following two examples illustrate when land is acquired under s CB 15B where there is a nomination, and when there is an assignment of contractual rights. They also note when the 2-year period for the bright-line test starts. Example 3 – Acquisition of land where there is a nominee Alex and Angus entered into a sale and purchase agreement to buy a property they thought would be a great investment. They planned to hold the property in a trust, but had not yet settled a trust when they found the property they wanted to buy. The sale and purchase agreement named “Alex and Angus and/or nominee” as the purchaser. Alex and Angus subsequently settled a trust (the Jones Family Trust), and advised the vendor that they nominated the trustees of the Jones Family Trust to be the purchasers and take title at settlement. The sale and purchase agreement subsequently went unconditional when a satisfactory building report and LIM were obtained. The sale was concluded, and the title was registered in the names of the trustees of the trust. When the Jones Family Trust sold the property some years later, one of the land provisions in subpart CB potentially applied and the date that the trustees of the trust acquired the land was relevant. For the purposes of the land sale provisions in subpart CB, other than the 2-year bright-line test, the trustees of the Jones Family Trust acquired the land on the date Alex and Angus nominated the trustees as the purchasers. This was when they first had an equitable interest in the land. Alex and Angus nominate the trustees as purchasers Alex and Angus enter into a binding S&P agreement with the vendor Settlement / transfer of title to the trustees is registered S&P agreement unconditional The 2-year period for the bright-line test starts for the trustees The Jones Family Trust is settled Date the trustees acquire the land (the freehold) for provisions other than the bright-line test 16 UNCLASSIFIED Alex and Angus are each associated with the trustees of the trust, because they are settlors of the trust (see s YB 8). But s CB 15(2) does not apply in this case to treat the trustees of the Jones Family Trust as having acquired the land when Alex and Angus did. This is because the nomination did not give rise to a transfer of land from Alex and Angus to the trustees. Alex and Angus continued to hold their rights under the contract, and therefore their interest in the land. The nomination simply created additional rights (for the trustees). Because the trustees of the Jones Family Trust first got an estate or interest in the land when Alex and Angus nominated them as the purchasers, that is also the relevant date for determining if the bright-line legislation potentially applies. If the nomination was on or after 1 October 2015, the bright-line legislation can apply to the trust’s disposal of the land if none of ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply. For the trust, the 2-year period for the bright-line test (which may apply if none of ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply) starts on the date the transfer of title was registered to the trustees. The nomination of the trustees as purchaser will not give rise to any tax implications under the land rules for Alex and Angus. This is because, as noted above, Alex and Angus did not transfer their interest in the land to the trustees when they made the nomination – there was no disposal. On settlement, when the legal title transferred to the trustees, Alex and Angus’s interest in the land simply ceased to exist, it was not disposed of. Example 4 – Acquisition of land where there is an assignment of contractual rights to purchase the land Andrew entered into a sale and purchase agreement to buy a house, and paid a deposit of $60,000. Andrew subsequently received an unsolicited offer from a non- associated party, Bart, to buy the property. Andrew agreed to the sale and, as settlement had not yet occurred, Andrew and Bart decided that Andrew would assign his rights under the sale and purchase agreement to Bart in exchange for a fee of $110,000. This was recorded in a deed, which was signed two months after Andrew entered into the sale and purchase agreement with the vendor. The deed Andrew assigns his contractual rights under the S&P agreement to Bart Andrew enters into a binding S&P agreement with the vendor Settlement / transfer of title to Bart is registered Date Andrew acquires land (an equitable interest) for the purposes of the land provisions, and the 2-year period for the bright-line test starts for him The 2-year period for the bright-line test starts for Bart Date Bart acquires the land (the freehold) for provisions other than the bright-line test 17 UNCLASSIFIED was entitled “Deed of Nomination”, but it was clear from the words of the deed that the intention was that Andrew was transferring all of his rights under the sale and purchase agreement to Bart. Therefore, the transaction was an assignment of the contractual rights, not a nomination. The label the parties put on the document does not determine its legal effect. The sale was concluded with Bart as the purchaser. When Bart sold the property some years later, one of the land provisions in subpart CB potentially applied and the date that he had acquired the land was relevant. For the purposes of the land sale provisions in subpart CB, other than the 2-year bright-line test, Bart acquired the land on the date the deed that assigned the contractual rights to him was executed. This was when Bart first had an equitable interest in the land. Because Bart first got an estate or interest in the land when the deed that assigned the contractual rights to him was executed, that is also the relevant date for determining if the bright-line legislation potentially applies. If the assignment of the contractual rights was on or after 1 October 2015, the bright-line legislation can apply to Bart’s disposal of the land if none of ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply. For Bart, the 2-year period for the bright-line test (which may apply if none of ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply) starts on the date the transfer of title was registered to him. When Andrew entered into the sale and purchase agreement to buy the house, he acquired an equitable interest in the land (which is “land” as defined). If that was on or after 1 October 2015, the bright-line legislation could apply to Andrew’s disposal of his rights under the sale and purchase agreement to Bart, if none of ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply. When Andrew assigned the rights under the contract to Bart, he transferred his equitable interest to Bart. Because Andrew entered into an agreement to dispose of land before the registration of title, his start date for the bright-line test is the date he acquired the equitable interest – ie, the date the sale and purchase agreement was entered into. Because the land is residential land, and the assignment of the contractual rights to Bart was within two years of the sale and purchase agreement being entered into, the amount Andrew derived on the disposal ($110,000) is income under the bright-line test in s CB 6A (if Andrew entered into the sale and purchase agreement on or after 1 October 2015 and if none of ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply). The main home exclusion from the bright-line test (in s CB 16A) cannot apply because Andrew never lived in the house. Andrew would be able to deduct the cost of his acquisition of the equitable interest (ie, the amount of the deposit he paid, $60,000). What if someone acquires land by way of an option? 71. A special rule (s CB 15B(3)) applies if someone acquires land through the exercise of an option to acquire it. 72. An option to acquire land might be a right contained within a lease, or it might be granted separately. An option is essentially an offer to sell, together with a contract not to revoke the offer (see, for example, Alexander v Tse \[1988\] 1 NZLR 318 (CA), and DW McMorland, Sale of Land (3 rd ed, Cathcart Trust, Auckland, 2011) at 3.16). 73. Someone may also be granted what is known as a pre-emptive right or “first right option” to acquire land – eg, a right of first refusal or a right of first offer. Although these pre-emptive rights are not, strictly speaking, options, if someone acquires the land through the exercise of such a right, it will have become an option by that point. This means the special rule about acquiring land through 18 UNCLASSIFIED the exercise of an option will also apply if someone acquires the land through the exercise of a pre-emptive right. 74. Under the special rule for land acquired through the exercise of an option, the person is regarded as acquiring the land on the date that they exercised the option. As noted above, what is relevant is when they acquired the land in question (ie, the land they are disposing of). It is not relevant if they previously had a different interest in the same underlying physical land. For example, if a person had a leasehold interest in the land and an option to acquire the freehold, and they exercise the option, acquire the freehold and subsequently dispose of it, what is relevant is when they acquired the freehold. In that situation it would be the date that they exercised the option. Their prior leasehold interest is not relevant. 75. Another thing to note is that an option to acquire land (or an estate or interest in land) is also itself “land” as defined in the Act. Therefore, if someone disposes of an option to acquire land, the date the option was acquired may be relevant. On this point, see from \[78\]. 76. The following four examples illustrate when land is acquired under s CB 15B where an option or “first right option” is involved. They also note when the 2- year period for the bright-line test starts. Example 5 – Option to purchase land Sanjay purchased an option to buy some land for a specified sum. Sanjay exercised the option. By doing so, a binding contract for the sale and purchase of the land was created on the terms set out in the option contract. The sale was settled in due course. When Sanjay went to sell the land several years later, one of the land provisions in subpart CB potentially applied and the date that Sanjay had acquired the land (the freehold estate) was relevant. Because Sanjay acquired the freehold through the exercise of the option, the exception to the general rule (contained in s CB 15B(3)) applies. Under the special rule in s CB 15B(3), for the purposes of the land sale provisions in subpart CB, other than the 2-year bright-line test, Sanjay acquired the land (the freehold) when he exercised the option. However, because Sanjay first got an estate or interest in the land when he acquired the option, that is the relevant date for determining if the bright-line legislation potentially Option acquired Option exercised / binding S&P agreement entered into S&P agreement unconditional Settlement / transfer of title registered Date the land is acquired for provisions other than the bright-line test The 2-year period for the bright-line test starts 19 UNCLASSIFIED applies. If Sanjay acquired the option on or after 1 October 2015, the bright-line legislation can apply to Sanjay’s disposal of the land if none of ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply. The 2-year period for the bright-line test (which may apply if none of ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply) starts on the date the transfer of title was registered to Sanjay. Example 6 – Lease with option to purchase land Baymax Robotics Limited entered into a lease of business premises and at the same time acquired an option, exercisable within the next two years, to buy the premises for a specified sum. Baymax Robotics exercised the option. By doing so, a binding contract for the sale and purchase of the land was created on the terms set out in the option contract. The sale was settled in due course. Baymax Robotics used the land predominantly as business premises. When Baymax Robotics went to sell the premises, one of the land provisions in subpart CB potentially applied and the date that Baymax Robotics had acquired the land (the freehold estate) was relevant. Because Baymax Robotics acquired the freehold through the exercise of the option, the exception to the general rule (contained in s CB 15B(3)) applies. Under the special rule in s CB 15B(3), for the purposes of the land sale provisions in subpart CB, other than the 2- year bright-line test, Baymax Robotics acquired the land (the freehold) when it exercised the option. However, because Baymax Robotics first got an estate or interest in the land when it acquired the option, that is the relevant date for determining if the bright-line legislation potentially applies. If Baymax Robotics acquired the option on or after 1 October 2015, the bright-line legislation can apply to Baymax Robotics’ disposal of the land if none of ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply. Because Baymax Robotics used the land predominantly as business premises, the 2-year bright-line test would not apply to the sale, as the land would not be “residential land” as defined in the Act. Lease entered into and option acquired Settlement / transfer of title registered Option exercised / binding S&P agreement entered into S&P agreement unconditional Date the land is acquired for provisions other than the bright-line test 20 UNCLASSIFIED Example 7 – Lease and subsequent option to purchase land Scissorhands Sculpting Limited was leasing some land from which it operated its business. As the business became increasingly successful, Scissorhands Sculpting wanted to lock in the ability to purchase the land if things continued to go well. Scissorhands Sculpting entered into negotiations with the owner and, as a result, acquired an option, exercisable within a set period, to buy the land for an agreed sum. Scissorhands Sculpting exercised the option. By doing so, a binding contract for the sale and purchase of the land was created on the terms set out in the option contract. The sale was settled in due course. Scissorhands Sculpting used the land predominantly as business premises. When Scissorhands Sculpting went to sell the land, one of the land provisions in subpart CB potentially applied and the date that Scissorhands Sculpting had acquired the land (the freehold estate) was relevant. Because Scissorhands Sculpting acquired the freehold through the exercise of the option, the exception to the general rule (contained in s CB 15B(3)) applies. Under the special rule in s CB 15B(3), for the purposes of the land sale provisions in subpart CB, other than the 2-year bright-line test, Scissorhands Sculpting acquired the land (the freehold) when it exercised the option. It is not relevant that the company previously held another interest in the underlying physical land (ie, the leasehold interest). The potential taxing event was the disposal of the freehold estate, so the issue is when the freehold estate was acquired. However, Scissorhands Sculpting first got an estate or interest in the freehold land when it acquired the option. T hat is therefore the relevant date for determining if the bright-line legislation potentially applies. If Scissorhands Sculpting acquired the option on or after 1 October 2015, the bright-line legislation can apply to Scissorhands Sculpting’s disposal of the land if none of ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply. Because Scissorhands Sculpting used the land predominantly as business premises, the 2- year bright-line test would not apply to the sale, as the land would not be “residential land” as defined in the Act. Lease entered into Option acquired Option exercised / binding S&P agreement entered into S&P agreement unconditional Settlement / transfer of title registered Date the land is acquired for provisions other than the bright-line rule 21 UNCLASSIFIED Example 8 – Lease with “first right option” to purchase land Jimmy Chews Limited leased its restaurant premises and had a “first right option” (a right of first refusal) to purchase the land in the event the owner decided to sell it. As it transpired, the owner decided to sell the land during the term of the lease. The owner made an offer to Jimmy Chews, which Jimmy Chews accepted, and the parties entered into a sale and purchase agreement. The sale and purchase agreement was subject to finance and to the obtaining of satisfactory building and LIM reports. Those conditions were fulfilled, and the sale was settled in due course. Jimmy Chews used the land predominantly as business premises. When Jimmy Chews went to sell the land, one of the land provisions in subpart CB potentially applied and the date that Jimmy Chews acquired the land (the freehold estate) was relevant. When the previous owner made an offer to Jimmy Chews, the “first right option” became an option to acquire the freehold. Because Jimmy Chews acquired the freehold through the exercise of that option, the exception to the general rule (contained in s CB 15B(3)) applies. Under the special rule in s CB 15B(3), for the purposes of the land sale provisions in subpart CB, other than the 2-year bright-line test, Jimmy Chews acquired the land (the freehold) when it exercised the option by accepting the offer and entering into the binding contract for the sale and purchase of the land. It is not relevant that Jimmy Chews previously held another interest in the underlying physical land (ie, the leasehold interest). The potential taxing event was the disposal of the freehold estate, so the issue is when the freehold estate was acquired. However, Jimmy Chews first got an interest in the freehold land when the offer was made to him (as this is when Jimmy Chews had the option to acquire the land). 5 That is therefore the relevant date for determining if the bright-line legislation potentially applies. If the offer was made to Jimmy Chews on or after 1 October 2015, the bright-line legislation can apply to Jimmy Chews’ disposal of the land if none of ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply. Because Jimmy Chews used the land predominantly as business premises, the 2-year bright-line test would not apply to the sale, as the land would not be “residential land” as defined in the Act. 5 As discussed at \[25\], this is typically the case in a “first right option” situation. See further Motor Works Ltd v Westminster Auto Services Ltd. Settlement / transfer of title registered Lease with “first right option” entered into Binding S&P agreement entered into S&P agreement unconditional Date the land is acquired for provisions other than the bright-line test Offer for the sale of the land made 22 UNCLASSIFIED Subdivided land 77. If someone subdivides land, a new title might be issued. This does not reset the person’s date of acquisition of the land. Their date of acquisition for the new land will be whatever date they acquired the original undivided piece of land. (See for example Paul Stephens Construction Ltd v CIR (1990) 12 NZTC 7,192 (HC).) Acquisition of an option 78. As noted at \[19\], an option to acquire land or an estate or interest in land also falls within the definition of “land” in the Act. 79. Because options to acquire land or estates or interests in land are “land”, if someone disposes of an option to another party rather than exercising it, the amount they derive on disposing of the option may be income under one of the land provisions in subpart CB. Depending on which taxing provision is potentially relevant, the time at which the person acquired the option may be relevant. 80. Under s CB 15B, an option will be acquired when a binding agreement creating the option, or for the transfer of the option, is entered into. This is the time from which the holder or purchaser of the option has an interest in the option. 81. “Residential land”, which the bright-line test may apply to, includes land with a dwelling on it (or for which the owner has an arrangement relating to erecting a dwelling). As already noted, “land” includes an option to acquire land or an estate or interest in land. These definitions mean that “residential land” will include an option to acquire land or an estate or interest in land that has a dwelling on it (or for which the owner has an arrangement relating to erecting a dwelling). Therefore, if an option to acquire residential land is disposed of within the bright-line period, s CB 6A may apply. Because there will be no registered instrument of transfer for an option, the date an option is acquired for bright-line purposes will also be the date that a binding agreement creating the option, or for the transfer of the option, is entered into. 82. The following example illustrates when an option to acquire land is acquired under s CB 15B, and when the 2-year period for the bright-line test starts for an option. Example 9 – Acquisition of an option to purchase land ABC Dealing Limited, which carries on a business of dealing in land, entered into an option contract under which it had the right to purchase some residential land within a specified period, for a specified price. ABC Dealing Limited decided to sell the option, and did so. For the purposes of the land sale provisions in subpart CB, other than the 2-year bright- line test, ABC Dealing Limited acquired the land (the option) when the option contract was entered into. This is the time from which ABC Dealing Limited has an interest in the option. Because there was no registered transfer of land to ABC Dealing Limited, the 2- year period for the bright-line test also starts on the date the option contract was entered into. Acquisition of land on behalf of a company to be formed 83. Section CB 15B(2) provides that if a person on behalf of a company to be formed enters into an agreement under which the company will have land, the company is treated, for the purposes of subpart CB in relation to the land, as existing from when the person enters into the agreement. 84. Because the company is deemed to exist at the time the relevant agreement is entered into and the person entered into the agreement on behalf of the company, the date that the person entered into the agreement (that gave rise to 23 UNCLASSIFIED an interest in land) will be the date the company is treated as having acquired the land. 85. There are no bright-line test implications for a person who acquires land on behalf of a company yet to be formed where the company subsequently ratifies the contract for the acquisition of the land. This is because s 182 of the Companies Act 1993 allows for ratification of pre-incorporation contracts, and at common law an effective ratification constitutes the relationship of principal and agent retrospectively. 6 This means that the person who acquired the land on behalf of the company yet to be formed has not themselves acquired (and subsequently disposed of) a land interest. When there may be a different date of acquisition rule 86. Note that the date of acquisition rules in s CB 15B are overridden, for a particular transaction, by any relevant provision in either subpart FB or subpart FC. Those subparts deal with transactions such as transfers on settlements of relationship property, distributions on death, distributions from a trust, transfers of value from a company, and gifts of property. 87. Also, for the purposes of certain provisions, a person may be treated as acquiring land at a different date than the date under s CB 15, if they acquire land on an amalgamation (s FO 17) or, as noted at \[56\], from an associated person (s CB 15(2)). 6 See further in this regard: Laws of New Zealand Agency (online ed, accessed 28 March 2017) from \[42\]. 24 UNCLASSIFIED References Related rulings/statements “Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Act 2015” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 1 (February 2016): 78 Subject references Acquisition of land Legislative references Companies Act 1993, s 182 Contracts (Privity) Act 1982, ss 4 and 8 Income Tax Act 2007, ss CB 6A, CB 6, CB 7, CB 9, CB 10, CB 12, CB 14, CB 15, CB 15B, CB 16A, CB 19, FO 17, GC 1 and YB 21, subparts FB and FC, and the definitions of “estate” (in relation to land), “estate in land” “estate or interest in land”, “interest” (in relation to land), “interest in land”, “land”, “offshore RLWT person” and “trading stock” in s YA 1 Land Transfer Act 1952 Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Act 2015, s 4(2) Case references AAA Developments (Ormiston) Ltd v CIR (2015) 27 NZTC 22,026 (HC) Alexander v Tse \[1988\] 1 NZLR 318 (CA) Barrett v IBC International Ltd \[1995\] 3 NZLR 170 (CA) Bevin v Smith \[1994\] 3 NZLR 648 (CA) Case M4 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,021 (TRA) Fletcher Challenge Energy Ltd v Electricity Corporation of New Zealand Ltd \[2002\] 2 NZLR 433 (CA) Karangahape Road International Village Ltd v Holloway \[1989\] 1 NZLR 83 (HC) Laidlaw v Parsonage \[2010\] 1 NZLR 286 (CA) Motor Works Ltd v Westminster Auto Services Ltd \[1997\] 1 NZLR 762 (HC) Paul Stephens Construction Ltd v CIR (1990) 12 NZTC 7,192 (HC) Rattrays Wholesale Ltd v Meredyth-Young & A’Court \[1997\] 2 NZLR 363 (HC) Rivette v Atrax Group New Zealand Ltd (2010) 11 NZCPR 723 (HC) Stonne Ltd v Ronyx Holdings Ltd (2005) 7 NZCPR 18 (HC) Willetts v Ryan \[1968\] NZLR 863 (CA) Other references Laws of New Zealand Agency (online ed, accessed 28 March 2017) from \[42\] McMorland, DW, Sale of Land (3 rd ed, Cathcart Trust, Auckland, 2011) Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Bill: Commentary on the Bill (Inland Revenue, Wellington, November 2013)
1 UNCLASSIFIED QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 17/03 TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT 1994 - THE PERIOD FOR WHICH A PRIVATE OR PRODUCT RULING APPLIES All legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about ss 91EB(1)(b) and 91FB(1)(b). Question 1. We have been asked what the Commissioner’s practice is on the length of the term of a private or product ruling. Answer 2. While the binding rulings legislation in Part 5A recognises that a private or product ruling must state the period for which the ruling applies, the legislation does not specify what that period should be. This is left to the discretion of the Commissioner. The Commissioner considers that when exercising this statutory power, the relevant factors that should be taken into account include (depending on the relevant circumstances):  the nature of the arrangement that is the subject of the ruling application;  the taxation laws on which the ruling is sought;  the desire to provide certainty to the applicant;  consistency and fairness as between different ruling applicants;  the fiscal risk to the Crown if the ruling is later found to understate the correct tax liability;  the degree of certainty as to the legal correctness of the decision; and  the likelihood or risk of the Commissioner’s interpretation of the law changing over time. 3. In determining the period for which a ruling should apply, the Commissioner’s practice has been along the following lines: The binding rulings regime has operated for over 20 years. From time to time, the Commissioner will publish guidance about certain aspects of the regime that may be of wider interest. Over the years, Inland Revenue has developed internal policies concerning the period a private or product ruling will be issued for. This item sets out the Commissioner’s current practice on the period of the ruling, in the interests of informing ruling applicants and their agents. However, as a result of submissions received from public consultation on this item, the Commissioner will be recommending that issues regarding the period of a ruling (and whether there should be legislative change) be further considered as part of the broader changes to the binding rulings regime discussed in the recent discussion document Making tax simpler – Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act (December 2016). 2 UNCLASSIFIED a) Where an arrangement has a term or expected life of less than three years, such as a share repurchase that is planned on a particular day, the Commissioner will issue a ruling for a period that is the exact term or expected life of the arrangement. The Commissioner may, however, provide a ruling for a longer period if there is material uncertainty about either the date of implementation or the length of the term or expected life of the arrangement, in order to allow a reasonable period for the arrangement to be completed. b) Where an arrangement has a term or expected life of more than three years, the Commissioner will generally rule for a period of three years from the date of issue of the draft or final ruling. The Commissioner considers that a period of three years is a reasonable balance between the relevant matters set out above, particularly the desire to provide certainty to applicants and the risk of the Commissioner’s interpretation changing over time. c) If the arrangement was entered into before the date of issue of the draft or final ruling, the Commissioner will generally add the time that has elapsed since the arrangement was entered into to the three-year period (to the extent reasonable and permitted by legislation). d) The Commissioner will consider the applicant’s circumstances in determining the period of the ruling. If there are particular features of the arrangement that would make ruling for a period of three years undesirable (for example, if the arrangement has a fixed life of three years and six months, or where the parties have agreed to renegotiate the terms of the arrangement after four years), the Commissioner may agree to extend the period beyond three years. e) On a reissue of a ruling, where an arrangement has a remaining term or expected life of more than five years, the Commissioner will generally rule for a period of five years from the date the previous ruling ceased to apply, having regard to criteria such as: - the added certainty for the taxpayer if the ruling applies for a longer period, particularly if the arrangement is likely to be on-going for a substantial time; - whether the issues ruled on are likely to be affected by any new case law; and - whether any of the issues are potentially contentious. Otherwise, the reissue would be for a maximum of three years for on-going arrangements. f) Periods in excess of five years (for a new ruling or a reissue) will only be considered by the Commissioner in exceptional circumstances where, due to the special characteristics of the particular arrangement and the application of the taxation laws, a shorter period would not be sensible. This may include situations where: - the taxation law will not apply until a date in the future that would be outside a three- or five-year period (for example, if the ruling is on the application of the base price adjustment formula (s EW 31 of the 3 UNCLASSIFIED Income Tax Act 2007) and the financial arrangement is not expected to mature for 10 years); or - the taxation law must be applied over the life of the arrangement and it would not be possible or sensible to try to reverse out the tax treatment after three or even five years, such as a ruling in relation to the spreading method that applies to a rental prepayment over the life of a 15-year lease. In deciding whether to issue a ruling for a period in excess of five years, the Commissioner will take into account the same criteria that would be taken into account for a reissue. The value of the transaction or importance of the arrangement will not be a relevant factor. In these exceptional circumstances, the Commissioner may be willing to rule for the whole term or expected life of the arrangement. g) For a unilateral advanced pricing agreement (APA) that is issued in the form of a private ruling, the period of the ruling (for either a new APA or a reissue) will usually be five years. However, depending on the economic circumstances of the particular case, such as the relevant business cycle of the industry concerned, an APA may be issued for a longer period if agreed between the applicant and Service Delivery. Explanation 4. The binding rulings regime was introduced in 1995 to give taxpayers greater certainty regarding the Commissioner’s view of the tax implications of transactions and arrangements. A private ruling gives the Commissioner’s interpretation of the tax law as it applies to a specific taxpayer and a particular arrangement. A product ruling gives the Commissioner’s interpretation of the tax law as it applies to a particular “product” (where it is not practicable to identify the taxpayers who may enter into the arrangement). The Commissioner is required to apply the tax treatment prescribed in a private or product ruling for the duration of the ruling. 5. The binding rulings legislation (ss 91EB(1)(b) and 91FB(1)(b)) provides that a private or product ruling will apply “only for the period or tax year for which the ruling applies”. Sections 91EH(1)(d) and 91FH(1)(e) provide that a private ruling or product ruling must state the “period or tax year for which the ruling applies”. The term “tax year” is defined in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 as “a period starting on 1 April and ending on 31 March”. 6. The effect of these provisions is that the Commissioner is able to issue a private or product ruling that applies for either a particular “tax year” or for a specific “period”. 7. However, other than the reference to a “tax year”, the legislation does not specify the period a ruling should be issued for. The legislation does not, for example, set out any minimum or maximum periods for which a ruling can apply. As there is no legislative guidance on this issue, the Commissioner must decide what the appropriate period will be for each private or product ruling issued. This is a matter of reasonable administrative practice. 8. Where a private or product ruling applies, and has not ceased to apply under ss 91EB(2) or 91FB(2), the Commissioner is legally bound to apply the specified taxation law in the specified way for the period of the ruling if the taxpayer 4 UNCLASSIFIED applies the law as stated in the ruling (ss 91EA(1) and 91FA(1)). The only exception to this is where the taxpayer has issued the Commissioner with a notice of proposed adjustment to change the effect of a ruling previously applied by the taxpayer (ss 91EA(1A) and 91FA(1A)). This provides the taxpayer with certainty against changes in the Commissioner’s interpretation of the tax law during the relevant period. 9. However, there is a fiscal risk to the Crown that an applicant’s correct tax liability may be understated if the interpretation of the taxation law and how it applies to the arrangement is later found to be incorrect. This potential risk was recognised by the Government prior to the introduction of the binding rulings regime (in Binding Rulings on Taxation (A discussion document on the proposed regime) (Government discussion document, June 1994) (the Discussion Document)). 10. To minimise this risk, the Commissioner is not generally prepared to issue binding private or product rulings for an extended period. The Discussion Document noted that it was not intended that a private ruling would apply for an unspecified period as changing circumstances over time would make such an approach inappropriate. Issuing a binding ruling for a limited time allows the Commissioner to review any developments of the law and consider any implications for the ruling within a reasonable time frame. 11. When determining the appropriate period for which the Commissioner will issue a ruling, a balance must therefore be struck between a number of factors, including fairness to the applicant (who has invested time and money in applying for the ruling) and the appropriate level of risk if an incorrect or deficient ruling is issued for an extended period of time. 12. When deciding the appropriate period for a private or product ruling, the Commissioner will first consider the arrangement and the period requested by the applicant in their application. As noted in \[2\] above, the Commissioner will also take into account other factors, such as:  the nature of the arrangement that is the subject of the ruling application;  the taxation laws on which the ruling is sought;  the desire to provide certainty to the applicant;  consistency and fairness as between different ruling applicants;  the fiscal risk to the Crown if the ruling is later found to understate the correct tax liability;  the degree of certainty as to the legal correctness of the decision; and  the likelihood or risk of the Commissioner’s interpretation of the law changing over time.

1 UNCLASSIFIED QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 17/04 GOODS AND SERVICES TAX — WHETHER A RACING SYNDICATE CAN BE A REGISTERED PERSON All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the Act) unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about ss 6(1), 6(3) and 51. Question 1. Can a racing syndicate, whose activities are limited to the ownership (or leasing) of one or more horses to race and the racing of these horses, be registered for goods and services tax (GST)? 2. The scope of this question is the racing of horses as a standalone activity. The view expressed does not extend to activities where the horse racing is an aspect of a wider activity like horse selling, breeding or training. The question relates to horse racing carried on by a syndicate. However, the same principles will apply where the horse racing activity is carried on by an individual, a partnership, a trust, a company or any other entity. Answer 3. To be registered for GST, a taxpayer must be carrying on a “taxable activity”. A key requirement of a taxable activity is that the taxpayer must intend to make supplies for a consideration. The definition of “taxable activity” also expressly excludes any activity carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby. 4. Whether any syndicate is carrying on a taxable activity will always depend on an examination of the totality of the evidence. The determining factor in deciding whether there is a taxable activity of racing is the goal or the object of the taxpayer (in this case the syndicate). In deciding whether a racing syndicate is carrying on a private recreational pursuit or hobby, the activity must be treated as if it were carried on by a natural person. 5. In the Commissioner’s view the activity of horse racing (as a standalone activity) will not be carried on as a private recreational pursuit or hobby where the taxpayer can establish all of the following matters:  The syndicate is formed not for the personal interest or pleasure of the participants, but for the purpose of making a profit from the activity, and it is operated in that manner;  The activity of the syndicate is organised to achieve a pecuniary profit, and it operates in a systematic fashion that, on an objective assessment, appears to materially reduce the element that luck plays in whether any prize-money is won; and  A significant amount of time is involved in performing the activity undertaken by the manager of the syndicate (including acquiring and managing the 2 UNCLASSIFIED horses that are assisting in meeting financial imperatives and disposing of horses that are not). 6. The Commissioner’s view is that, in the absence of these circumstances, the racing of horses as a standalone activity by a racing syndicate is a private recreational pursuit or hobby. Therefore, it is excluded from the definition of taxable activity and the syndicate cannot be registered for GST. 7. This answer is based on the Commissioner’s view that, in the absence these particular circumstances, the activity of horse racing constitutes the participation in a sporting endeavour undertaken as a private pastime or pursuit carried on for the personal interest or pleasure of the person (or persons) concerned. The Commissioner considers that for a racing syndicate where the activity is limited to the ownership (or leasing) and racing of horses, the essence of the activity will most often be the personal interest or pleasure derived from seeing the horse compete in, and potentially win, races. 8. The view set out in this item is not applicable to those syndicates where horse racing is an aspect of a wider activity, for example, a horse breeding syndicate. However, the fact that a syndicate agreement provides for a race horse to be sold in certain circumstances will not, of itself, indicate that the taxpayer is carrying on a wider activity. It should also be noted that the Commissioner considers that if the horse racing activity is part of a wider activity, this does not preclude the wider activity of the syndicate being a recreational pastime or hobby. 9. Where a horse racing syndicate is incorrectly registered for GST, the view in this QWBA will be applied prospectively only. Consequently, those taxpayers will not be required to retrospectively deregister. Further information on the application of the QWBA to these taxpayers is set out in a separate operational position. Explanation 10. This item considers the GST status of a horse racing syndicate formed solely to own (or lease) one or more horses to race them. In particular, the item considers whether a racing syndicate is able to be a GST “registered person”. To address this matter the item will discuss whether the activity of a racing syndicate is a taxable activity. Racing Syndicate 11. A horse racing syndicate is a common form of multiple-person ownership used in both thoroughbred and harness racing to provide the means for the members to enjoy the benefits and share the costs involved in the ownership (or leasing) and racing of horses. Racing syndicates are a form of racing ownership recognised in the relevant rules of racing. Registration 12. Under s 8(1) of the Act, GST is charged on the supplies in New Zealand of goods and services made by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person. Deductions for input tax can generally be claimed for the GST charged on the acquisition of goods and services by the person. 13. Registration is a key ingredient of the GST system because the tax is charged on the supplies of a registered person. Section 2 provides that a “registered person” 3 UNCLASSIFIED means a person who is registered or is liable to be registered under the Act. A racing syndicate is a “person” for GST purposes, as that term is defined to include “an unincorporated body of persons”. 14. Section 51(1) states that any person carrying on a taxable activity is liable to be registered if the total value of supplies made in New Zealand in a 12-month period exceeds $60,000. Further, s 51(3) provides that a person under the $60,000 threshold may apply to be registered if they can satisfy the Commissioner that they are carrying on a taxable activity. Taxable activity 15. Section 6(1) sets out the meaning of “taxable activity” in the following terms: For the purposes of this Act, the term taxable activity means— (a) any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club: ... 16. Section 6(1) necessitates the organisation of an activity in some coherent way. The activity must be carried on continuously or regularly and involve (or be intended to involve) the supply of goods and services to any other person for consideration. The definition of a taxable activity is very broad and applies to any activity carried on continuously and regularly by any person, “whether or not for pecuniary profit”. This means that a taxable activity is not limited to a “business” as used, for example, in the income tax context of a profession, trade or undertaking carried on for profit. Section 6(1) includes any activity carried on in the form of a “business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club”. In the context of the section, these activities must be carried on with the goal of supplying goods and services to any person for a consideration. 17. It is not entirely clear whether a horse owner who carries on horse racing as a standalone activity makes any supplies for consideration. The Commissioner’s view is that, by entering a horse in a race, the owner is supplying a service to the race organiser. There do not appear to be any other possible supplies made by the horse owner. 18. Also uncertain is whether that supply is made for consideration. It could be argued that the payment of stake money is too contingent or remote to be consideration. However, the Commissioner’s position is that, due to the breadth of the “consideration” definition, stake money can be consideration for the supply of entering a horse into a race. This is consistent with the position taken by the Australian Tax Office in its Goods and Services Tax Ruling GSTR 2002/3 Goods and services tax: prizes. 19. The focus of this QWBA is on whether horse racing is excluding from being a taxable activity under s 6(3). Exclusion from taxable activity definition 20. Despite the breadth of s 6(1), not all activities will be a taxable activity. Section 6(3) sets out some exclusions from the term. It provides, relevantly: 4 UNCLASSIFIED Notwithstanding anything in subsections (1) and (2), for the purposes of this Act the term taxable activity shall not include, in relation to any person,— (a) being a natural person, any activity carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby; or (aa) not being a natural person, any activity which, if it were carried on by a natural person, would be carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby; or ... 21. The effect of s 6(3)(a) and (aa) is that, despite an activity meeting the requirements of s 6(1), it is not a “taxable activity” if the activity is carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby. Is horse racing a private recreational pursuit or hobby? 22. There is no New Zealand GST Court decision dealing directly with the application of s 6(3) in the context of horse racing as a standalone activity. The only New Zealand GST decision to consider this provision and a racing syndicate is Case N27 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,229. That case concerned a partnership of six people with a taxable activity stated to be “horse trading”. The Commissioner contended in that case that the taxpayer did not have a taxable activity as the activity carried on was essentially a private recreational pursuit or hobby. However, the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) found the taxpayer was involved in the purchase, racing, and sale of a horse and, on the facts, that was a taxable activity. 23. The TRA decided that for an activity to be carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby that activity must be “in essence” of such a nature. The TRA then considered the meaning of the phrase “private recreational pursuit or hobby” and stated at 3,240: I do not attempt to give an all-embracing or exclusive definition of the phrase “... essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby”, but observe that would seem to require, in essence, a private pastime or pursuit carried on for the personal refreshment, pleasure or recreation of the person (or persons) concerned. In the context of the Act it is not an activity of a business, organised in some coherent fashion to achieve a pecuniary profit. Whether an activity is essentially that of a private recreational pursuit or hobby, or not, is a question of fact in each case. It depends on the totality of the evidence. 24. The key distinguishing feature, therefore, concerns the “essence” of the form of the activity carried on. Where the essence of the activity involves the supply of goods and services for consideration carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association or club, then such an activity is a taxable activity. However, where the essence of the activity is a private pastime or pursuit carried on for the personal refreshment, pleasure or recreation of the person concerned, then the activity is a private recreational pursuit or hobby. 25. In deciding on the essence of an activity in the context of a private recreational pursuit or hobby, the courts begin their enquiry by asking: what is the object of the activity in the mind of the participating taxpayer? In other words, a key determining factor concerns the goal or the object in mind. 26. As previously noted, the definition of “taxable activity” does not require an activity to be carried on for a pecuniary profit. For this reason charities, for example, can carry on a taxable activity as they have a purpose that is neither profit-making, nor a private recreational pursuit. However, in the Commissioner’s view, horse racing can only be carried on either for the purpose of making a profit 5 UNCLASSIFIED (in which case, it is likely to amount to business) or as a private recreational pursuit or hobby. 27. Over time the courts have contrasted a private recreational pursuit or hobby with the activity of a business. In applying this distinction the courts have noted that the object of the activity of being in business or working in a trade is that it is an occupation by which the person intends to profit as a means of earning a living. The object of a business activity is contrasted with what has been called ”the pursuit of a pastime” in which, in essence, the activity is not organised towards the end of making a profit as a means of earning a living. Rather, the activity is undertaken for pleasure or enjoyment. 28. In some circumstances the distinction can seem difficult to draw. For example, the cost involved in “the pursuit of a pastime” can amount to many thousands of dollars. However, the object of the activity is not determined on the basis of cost. Also, a private recreational pursuit or hobby can be undertaken in a very organised, systematic and cost efficient manner. Therefore, it may be run in a business-like manner. However, despite how the activity is undertaken, the underlying object of a particular activity remains. The essence of the activity, as undertaken by the relevant taxpayer, is either business-like or a private recreational pursuit or hobby. 29. A racing syndicate is an “unincorporated body of persons” for GST purposes and is, accordingly, a “person”. Section 6(3)(aa) provides that where a person is not a natural person then the term “taxable activity” shall not include, in relation to that person, any activity which, if it were carried on by a natural person, would be carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby. In deciding whether horse racing (as a standalone activity) of a racing syndicate is being carried on as a private recreational pursuit or hobby, the activity must be treated as if it were carried on by a natural person. 30. The object of any activity is always a question of fact. There may be factors that point in either direction and accordingly it is not possible to be definitive (refer to the discussion on Case N27 above). 31. However, the Commissioner considers that for a racing syndicate where the activity is limited to the ownership (or leasing) and racing of horses, the essence of the activity will most often be the personal interest or pleasure derived from seeing the horse compete in, and potentially win, races. For GST purposes, this is an activity carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby and accordingly is not a taxable activity. The factors that lead to this conclusion are:  It is difficult to control or organise the activity of horse racing in a systematic fashion to achieve a pecuniary profit. This is because of the significant element that luck plays in whether any prize-money is won, given the effect of uncontrollable factors, the aspect of competition and the likelihood of winning. This has been noted by the courts (see, for example, Shepherd v FCT 75 ATC 4244). Purchasing a well-bred horse and employing a top trainer and jockey may increase the possibility of obtaining a profit from the activity. However, they will not, of themselves, be sufficient to demonstrate an intention to profit. It is acknowledged that an element of luck or risk is present in most businesses. However, the fact that luck plays such a significant part in whether any profit can be made from horse racing activities means that this is a relevant objective factor in determining the taxpayer’s purpose in carrying out the activity. 6 UNCLASSIFIED  The amount of time required to perform the activity undertaken by the racing syndicate, if that activity were undertaken by a natural person, is not sufficient to suggest that the object is to undertake a business.  The activity undertaken is associated with a sporting endeavour. Sport is usually undertaken for the personal pleasure of the participant.  The activity most often arises from the members of the syndicate seeking personal interest or pleasure from participating in the racing industry (following the industry itself promoting their participation on that basis, rather than promoting participation in a business). Deriving personal pleasure from an activity does not, of itself, mean that an activity is a hobby (many people obtain enjoyment from their business). Similarly, the fact that a person may hope to make a return from an activity does not convert it from a hobby into a taxable activity. The key factor is whether the taxpayer’s participation in the activity is driven by personal enjoyment or the desire to make a profit.  Racing horses may be undertaken in an organised or coherent fashion. However, despite this there is usually insufficient organisation in the activity to objectively demonstrate a profit-making purpose. This is because financial success is largely dependent on factors outside of the syndicate’s control. Generally people race horses for personal interest or the pleasure that they gain from their participation and are often willing to incur financial losses because of this. 32. The TRA in Case N27 noted that whether an activity is essentially that of a private recreational pursuit or hobby, or not, is a question of fact in each case depending on the totality of evidence. The TRA also formed the view that it was wrong for the Commissioner to make what, in effect, appeared to be a policy decision that racing syndicates were necessarily carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby of those involved. 33. The Commissioner agrees that whether any syndicate is carrying on a hobby or taxable activity will always depend on an examination of the totality of the evidence. However, for a racing syndicate not to be engaged in a private recreational pursuit or hobby would require it to demonstrate the presence of sufficient factors to draw a different inference. The onus of proof lies with the taxpayer to demonstrate this. The Commissioner considers that, for syndicates whose activities are limited to racing horses, a taxpayer would need to establish all of the following matters:  The syndicate is formed not for the personal interest or pleasure of the participants, but for the purpose of making a profit from the activity, and it is operated in that manner;  The activity of the syndicate is organised to achieve a pecuniary profit, and it operates in a systematic fashion that, on an objective assessment, appears to materially reduce the element that luck plays in whether any prize-money is won; and  A significant amount of time is involved in performing the activity undertaken by the manager of the syndicate (including acquiring and managing the horses that are assisting in meeting financial imperatives and disposing of horses that are not). 7 UNCLASSIFIED 34. In the Commissioner’s view the key determining factor in deciding whether there is a taxable activity of racing concerns the goal or the object of the taxpayer. In this regard, indications of intention drawn from the syndicate agreement and other relevant documents will be relevant. However, the relevant evidence will go beyond this and include anything that supports or negates the stated intention of the syndicate and its members. Therefore, merely including a statement in the syndicate agreement that it is intended to make a profit from horse racing will not be sufficient. 35. Before finding that there is a taxable activity, the Commissioner would expect evidence to show that the factors in paragraph 33 above are satisfied. In the absence of this, the Commissioner’s view is that the horse racing activity will be being carried on as a private recreational pursuit or hobby. 36. The Commissioner’s view that there is a relatively high bar to demonstrating that horse racing as a standalone activity is not carried on as a private recreational pursuit or hobby is consistent with the approach taken by courts in both the United Kingdom and Australia. 37. For example, in the early cases of The Earl of Jersey’s Executors v Bassom (H.M. Inspector Taxes) and The Earl of Derby v Bassom (H.M. Inspector of Taxes) (1924-26) 10 TC 357 (KBD) both appellants bred, owned and raced thoroughbred horses. The findings made were that the breeding and racing of horses was carried on by the taxpayers as a hobby. While accepting that one of the objects of the activities was to improve the breed of horse, the chief object of the activities was the pleasure derived from seeing the horses bred by them win big races. 38. The treatment of horse racing as a recreational activity has also been considered in a VAT context in the United Kingdom. In Brian Gubby Ltd (1985) 2 BVC 205, 360 the VAT Tribunal was required to decide whether or not the horse related activities of the company constituted a business for tax purposes. Against that background we ask ourselves whether or not during the period of the assessment either the activity of training horses or the activity of racing horses constituted a ‘business’ or an intended ‘business’ of the Appellant Company which generated or would generate taxable supplies. We consider that in relation to neither such activity was either of such requirements satisfied. As to training, we consider and hold that, throughout the period of assessment, Mr Brian Gubby personally carried out the training as his hobby and a personal interest, and that he had no intention of training horses for any outsider. Therefore no taxable supply was made, or intended to be made in the future, in the course of this activity. As to racing, we consider and hold again that, throughout the period of assessment, Mr Brian Gubby was involved therein as his hobby and personal interest. 39. The decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Shepherd shows that, in relation to winning prize money from the racing of horses, it is ordinarily difficult to displace the implication that there is no ability to organise the activity toward the end of making a profit (because of the significant element of chance involved, per \[31\] above). 40. In Shepherd, the taxpayer owned and raced various racehorses, but on the facts of the case neither her prize money nor betting wins were found to be the product of a business. Rath J held that the taxpayer, while having a passion for horses, indulged in horse racing as a pastime; although a keen follower of horse racing, racing was not her business. His Honour referred to Martin v FCT (1953) 90 CLR 470 and the judgment of Rowlatt J in Graham v Green (1925) 2 K.B. 37 in reaching his conclusion, at 4252: 8 UNCLASSIFIED The common reason why betting winnings were not regarded as “profit or gain” in Graham v. Green, or “income” in Martin's case is that in those cases there was no organization of the activity towards the end of making a profit. In that sense, such gains as arose in the course of the activity had a significant element of chance, and there was no system, or no sufficient system, in relation to the chances involved as to lead to the conclusion that a system for profit making had been devised. There is a similar element of chance in relation to winning prize money from the racing of horses. Owner competes against owner, and the chance of one owner's horse winning is dependent to an extent on considerations as to which no system or organization would usually apply, for example the form of the various horses and the weather conditions. Skill is involved, in bringing a horse to its peak and in the selection of riders; but skill which is displayed in a pastime, as the passage quoted from the judgment of Rowlatt J . shows, is not decisive of the question as to whether a business is being carried on, and may not in many cases be even relevant to that question. \[Emphasis added\] 41. Drummond v CIR (2013) 26 NZTC 21,023 was a New Zealand income tax case concerning whether s EC 39(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 requires an existing breeding business. In the course of its decision the High Court stated: \[87\] The defendant has argued that there was no business at all. I disagree. On my analysis there was clearly a racing business. I have read the Adjudication Report from the Office of the Chief Counsel dated 23 November 2011. I agree with the conclusion in that regard. 42. The High Court commented in Drummond that the syndicate was in the business of racing which demonstrates that it is possible to have such a business. However, the Court did not consider or discuss the distinction between a business and a hobby and, therefore, did not give reasons why it thought that the taxpayers were not carrying on a hobby. In this regard, it does not assist in determining what considerations are relevant to deciding whether a taxpayer is carrying on a taxable activity or a hobby. 43. Furthermore, the actual issue before the Court in Drummond was whether at the relevant time there was an existing breeding business. The Court found that the taxpayers had a contingent intention to breed, even though the breeding business had not yet commenced. Accordingly, the partnership’s potential activity was wider than just racing. It is not clear the extent to which this contributed to the Court’s finding that the taxpayer was carrying on a racing business. 44. Case K40 (1988) 10 NZTC 343 could also be taken to suggest that a lower bar exists for establishing a business of horse racing than the Commissioner is putting forward in this item. There, Keane DJ stated: First, it is scarcely contestable that horse racing investment is pursued as a business enterprise, just as frequently as it is indulged in as a hobby. Perhaps more frequently. 45. However, that case related to a breeding business that also involved racing. In finding that the taxpayer was carrying on a business rather than a hobby, Keane DJ found the following considerations relevant:  The taxpayer had no interest in racing;  The taxpayer committed her entire savings to the venture and the scale of operations increased with the taxpayer’s means; and  The care taken in selecting the horses. 46. In finding that there was a business in the relevant years, Keane DJ considered the pattern of activity over the whole period. By that time the taxpayers owned a number of horses and had successfully bred and sold progeny from their horses. 9 UNCLASSIFIED 47. As set out above, GST is charged on the supplies in New Zealand of goods and services made by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person. A racing syndicate involved solely in racing horses, in the absence of the circumstances set out above at \[33\], is not undertaking a taxable activity, as it is undertaking a private recreational pursuit or hobby. Therefore it cannot be registered for GST purposes. Section 5(11CB) 48. Section 5(11CB) treats a prize received by a registered horse owner as consideration for a supply of services provided to the racing club. It applies only when a registered person is carrying on the racing in the course of a taxable activity. It does not deem horse racing to be carried on as a taxable activity. As such s 5(11CB) will not apply to prize money received by horse owners where the horse racing is carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby. Examples 49. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the Commissioner’s view of the application of the law. Example 1 – Horse racing syndicate not carrying on a taxable activity 50. Fast Horses Ltd breeds race horses. Some of its horses are sold outright to third parties. Others are syndicated with shares being offered to members of the public. Fast Horses Ltd is currently offering shares in one of its horses “Apportionment Method”. Sixty shares are being offered for $2,000 each. These are being promoted online and in newspapers. The advertisements emphasise the “buzz” and “excitement” that come from following the horse’s performance and the opportunity to join the other owners in the “winner’s circle” if Apportionment Method performs well. 51. Simon is thinking about investing in the syndicate and wants to know whether it will be carrying on a taxable activity. The syndicate will not be carrying on a taxable activity. The syndicate is being formed for the personal interest or pleasure of the members. There is no evidence that the syndicate will be operated for the purpose of making a profit from racing. Example 2 – Horse racing syndicate not carrying on a taxable activity 52. Tom’s uncle has left him $10,000 in his will. Tom’s wife Edith has wanted to own a race horse for some time. Many of Edith’s friends invest in horse racing syndicates and Edith thinks that she would enjoy this too. Tom and Edith decide to form a syndicate for the purpose of purchasing and racing a horse. Tom and Edith do not know much about horses, so they seek advice from their friends about the type of horse to buy. 53. Based on the advice received, Tom and Edith purchase a $5,000 thoroughbred yearling colt called “Straight-line Method”. Tom and Edith would also like to make some money from horse racing and they are optimistic about their chances. They hire a trainer to train and manage the day to day racing of their colt. Straight-line Method is gelded and is then entered into several 2yo races. When Straight-line Method is being raced locally, Tom and Edith go and watch. Otherwise the trainer provides them with the results after each race. Tom and Edith want to know whether their syndicate is carrying on a taxable activity. 10 UNCLASSIFIED 54. Tom and Edith’s syndicate is not carrying on a taxable activity. The syndicate was formed for Tom and Edith’s personal interest or pleasure, not for the purpose of making a profit from racing. The syndicate has a trainer and some degree of organisation. However, there is no evidence that the syndicate is run in a way to maximise the likelihood of achieving a pecuniary profit. The syndicate has only a single horse and there is nothing to suggest that either the horse will be replaced if it performs poorly, or additional horses will be purchased. Example 3 – Horse racing syndicate not carrying on a taxable activity 55. Les, Sally and Bruce are former professional jockeys. They have all been involved in the horse racing industry for most of their lives. In their spare time, they love attending the races. Les, Sally and Bruce decide to pool their money and purchase a race horse. Their main purpose is to make attending the races even more exciting; however, they also hope to win some money and feel confident that they will be able to. They purchase a ready to race gelding called “Bright-line” from a well-known local stud farm for $15,000. 56. Les, Sally and Bruce decide to undertake the management duties themselves and spend, on average, 5 hours each a week on this. They hire a trainer and together they develop a business plan and a training programme aimed at giving Bright- line the best chance of winning his races. Les, Sally and Bruce attend all of Bright-line’s races. Bright-line is moderately successful, winning 10% of his races and placing in another 20%. Les, Sally and Bruce use their winnings to purchase a second horse, which is also raced. Les, Sally and Bruce want to know whether their syndicate is carrying on a taxable activity. 57. Les, Sally and Bruce’s syndicate is not carrying on a taxable activity. Whether a taxpayer is carrying on a taxable activity or a private recreational pursuit or hobby depends on the object of the taxpayer in undertaking the activity. Les, Sally and Bruce’s syndicate was formed primarily for personal interest or pleasure, not for the purpose of making a profit from racing. The syndicate is operated in a coherent way with a view to increasing the chances of making a profit and a moderate amount of time is invested in the activity. However, this does not change the fact that that the essence of the racing activity is being carried on as a private recreational pursuit or hobby. Example 4 – Horse racing syndicate carrying on a taxable activity 58. Burt, Trevor and Cyril are retired. They have found that their pensions are not sufficient to support them in their retirement. Therefore, they each wish to invest a significant portion of their savings to earn income to supplement their pensions. They are attracted by an advertisement from a local stud farm that suggests that a well organised horse racing syndicate could return a healthy profit. 59. Burt, Trevor and Cyril form a syndicate and engage a bloodstock agent to find them horses of suitable pedigree or form. The syndicate purchases two yearlings of good pedigree from the national yearling sales held at Karaka for $50,000 each and a three-year old with great racing form from a private seller for $300,000. The syndicate is also searching for one more horse. The syndicate hires a trainer to manage the day to day activities of their horses and detailed plans are developed for each horse’s racing career. 60. The syndicate undertakes substantial research and analysis to develop a business plan that identifies relevant risks and how to minimise them and optimise the likely returns. The business plan includes financial projections that show how the 11 UNCLASSIFIED syndicate could make a profit from its horse racing activity and also outlines possible further capital requirements for a range of contingencies. Burt, Trevor and Cyril have ensured that they access to funds to meet any potential further capital requirements. The business plan also requires the trainer to regularly monitor each horse’s performance with a view to replacing horses that are not performing. 61. Neither Burt nor Trevor has ever had much interest in racing; however, they occasionally attend races where one of their horses is running. Cyril, on the other hand, has always enjoyed attending the races and continues to do so regularly. Burt, Trevor and Cyril want to know whether their syndicate is carrying on a taxable activity. 62. Burt, Trevor and Cyril’s syndicate is carrying on a taxable activity. Notwithstanding, Cyril’s interest in racing, the syndicate was not formed for the personal pleasure of the members. Rather it was formed primarily for the purpose of making a profit from horse racing. Further, the syndicate is operated in a systematic fashion that, objectively, increases the likelihood of achieving a profit and materially reduces the element that luck plays. This is demonstrated by the way the horses are initially selected, the detailed planning aimed at maximising their chances of winning races, and the fact that non-performing horses will be replaced.

1 UNCLASSIFIED QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 17/05 INCOME TAX – WHETHER YOUTUBE RECEIPTS ARE TAXABLE All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act) unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) is about ss CA 1(2), CB 1 and CB 3. This QWBA considers the income tax treatment of YouTube receipts. It does not consider the GST treatment of YouTube receipts. It also does not consider source or residence issues related to YouTube receipts. It is assumed that the recipient is a New Zealand resident for income tax purposes. Question 1. Do I need to pay tax on YouTube receipts? Answer 2. Yes, in many cases, YouTube receipts will be taxable. This may be because the receipts are from a business. However, you do not need to be carrying on a business to be taxable on YouTube receipts. Two other provisions in the Act tax YouTube receipts if they are  income under ordinary concepts, or  from a profit-making undertaking or scheme. Explanation Background 3. YouTube receipts (or receipts from similar online sources, such as Vimeo or Twitch) are no different from any other type of receipt. There are no separate provisions within the income tax laws that deal specifically with receipts from online or web-based activities. Where relevant, current tax laws and interpretations apply. 4. New Zealand tax residents are taxable on their worldwide income. Despite the online origin of YouTube receipts, a resident will be taxable if those receipts are “assessable income” as defined in the Act. 5. There are various types of YouTube receipts, including:  Advertising revenue (AdSense income from Google).  Affiliate income (earning a commission by promoting other people’s or companies’ merchandise on your YouTube channel via external annotation links).  Paid content (fee received for purchase/rent of a video or subscription to a YouTube channel).  Sponsorship (fee earned from product placements or endorsements). 6. YouTube receipts are often passively earned, in that once the video has been created and monetised, the creator can earn revenue without doing anything more. There may be a perception that passive YouTube receipts are more akin to income from a hobby or pastime (ie, not a business) and are therefore not 2 UNCLASSIFIED taxable. However, a business is not necessary for YouTube receipts to be taxable. For instance, YouTube receipts may also be taxable as income under ordinary concepts or as income from a profit-making undertaking or scheme. The relevant law 7. The Act does not define “income” exhaustively, although a number of types of income receipts are included within Part C. 8. Under s CB 1, amounts derived from a business are income for tax purposes. Inland Revenue has released guidance on whether a taxpayer is carrying on a business (eg, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 3 (September 1995): 8; IR1022 – Online Trading Tax Implications (October 2013); IR320 - Smart Business: A guide for businesses and non-profit organisations (March 2016)). These are available on the Inland Revenue website: www.ird.govt.nz . 9. Under s CB 3, an amount a person derives from carrying on or carrying out a profit-making undertaking or scheme is their income. Essentially, an undertaking or scheme is a programme of action, a series of steps, or an enterprise directed to an end result. The words “undertaking or scheme” suggest activities that are co-ordinated by plan or purpose. The plan or purpose must be coherent and have some unity of conception (see Investment & Merchant Finance v FCT (1970) 120 CLR 177 (HCA)), but does not need to be precise - a fairly generalised plan is all that is needed (see Case S86 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,538). Also, any purpose of making a profit must be the dominant purpose (see CIR v Walker \[1963\] NZLR 339 (CA)). 10. Under s CA 1, an amount is also income of a person if it is their income under ordinary concepts. The phrase “income under ordinary concepts” is not defined in the Act and its meaning has developed under the common law. 11. In Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176 (CA), Richardson J described the concept of income as comprising three features:  Income is something that comes in.  Income imports the notions of periodicity, recurrence and regularity.  Whether a particular receipt is income depends upon its quality in the hands of the recipient. 12. Some other key principles from cases that considered income under ordinary concepts include:  The periodic nature of payments made is the major determinant in many cases. Regularity or recurrence indicates that payments may become part of the receipts upon which the recipient may depend for their living expenses (Reid, A Taxpayer v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,350 (CA), FCT v Hyteco Hiring Pty Limited 92 ATC 4,694 (FFC)).  Consideration must be given to the relationship between payer and payee (Reid).  The purpose of any payments made must be taken into account (such as in Reid, where the payments were contractual and received in return for performing certain student obligations). 13. Windfall gains are excluded from being income under ordinary concepts. A windfall gain would include gifts and gratuitous receipts (eg, an inheritance or bequest), as well as winnings from games of chance (eg, lottery winnings). The key point is the random nature of these types of receipts, which precludes them from being classified as income under ordinary concepts. 3 UNCLASSIFIED 14. You should be aware that even if you are not conducting a business of earning income from YouTube videos, your receipts may still be taxable as income from a profit-making undertaking or scheme, or as income under ordinary concepts. Each case needs to be considered on its own facts. 15. The costs related to gaining or producing your YouTube income may be deductible for tax purposes. This is subject to:  The capital limitation: expenditure of a capital nature is not deductible. The cost of capital items may, however, be depreciated.  The private limitation: expenditure for any private benefit is not deductible. Your expenditure may need to be apportioned if it is partly for private purposes (with the private portion not being deductible). 16. Some examples have been included below. Example 1 – non-taxable hobby income 17. Damian is employed full time as a marketing manager. He is also a keen wildlife photographer. His busy job does not allow him much time to pursue his interest in photography. However, once a year, Damian takes a safari holiday in Africa and spends an enjoyable three weeks viewing and photographing wildlife. When he gets back from holiday, he likes to upload his favourite photographs and set them to music on his YouTube channel. To recover some of the costs of the holiday and his expensive photography equipment, Damian sells the photographs via his YouTube channel. He includes his email contact details and viewers who want to purchase the images can contact him for high resolution copies. 18. Damian’s intention is not to make a profit and his YouTube activities are not business-like. His photography is a recreational pursuit, which he does in his spare time for personal enjoyment. On the specific facts set out, Damian is, therefore, not conducting an online photography business via YouTube. The income he receives from selling his photographs is not taxable business income. The sporadic nature of receipts and lack of profit-making intention also mean the income is not taxable under ordinary concepts or as a profit-making scheme. Example 2 – income taxable under ordinary concepts 19. Hayden is a solicitor employed full time. He is also an online game enthusiast. He plays the interactive game “CourtCraft” in his spare time. Hayden also likes to makes videos of himself playing CourtCraft, which he posts on his YouTube Channel. 20. Over time, Hayden’s online activities result in a substantial following by other online game enthusiasts. Hayden is approached by the developers of CourtCraft and an arrangement is reached under which Hayden monetises his videos and posts a link in them to the developer’s online store (a YouTube approved external retail site). Every time someone clicks on the link, they are directed to the store. If this results in the sale of any of the developer’s online products, Hayden receives a commission. 21. Hayden’s videos are such a success that he ends up earning a few thousand dollars of commission income each month. Hayden retains his day job and continues to play CourtCraft in his spare time. Is he taxable on the commission income? 22. Hayden is employed full time and only plays CourtCraft in his spare time. He consequently devotes little time, money and effort to earning the commission income. Hayden’s intention is also not to make a profit from his gaming 4 UNCLASSIFIED activities; he simply enjoys playing CourtCraft and the attention he derives from the interest in his videos. Based on these facts, Hayden may not be carrying on a business of earning commission. However, the commission he receives is clearly income within the ordinary concepts definition. It is a regular monthly amount coming in to Hayden, in recognition of a service he provides to CourtCraft’s developers. Hayden will therefore be taxable on the commission income. Example 3 – income taxable from a profit-making scheme 23. Sarah owns an especially cute hamster. She builds a miniature playground, complete with tiny slide and swing, for the hamster and posts a video of it playing on YouTube. She shares the video with her friends on social media. The video is an instant online success and goes viral, quickly amassing millions of views worldwide. Despite the millions of views, Sarah has not made any money from the video. Her friends encourage her to monetise the video and try to make a bit of money. 24. Sarah decides to profit from her cute hamster. She creates a Google AdSense account and monetises the video. Ad clicks by viewers of the video result in Sarah earning a share of advertising revenue. Her hamster video quickly generates $10,000 paid to Sarah in the first month after monetising the video. However, the internet’s “cute hamster” phase is short-lived and, after her initial success, viewing of Sarah’s video (and resultant AdSense revenue) quickly comes to an end. 25. Although the hamster video going viral appears to be a random event, the money Sarah makes from the video is, on the facts set out, not a windfall gain. This is because Sarah, by choosing to monetise the video and allowing ads to run on the video with the dominant purpose of making a profit, has undertaken a profit- making scheme. The advertising income she receives will be taxable under s CB 3. Summary 26. If you receive YouTube receipts, they may be assessable income, depending on the circumstances. The assessable income needs to be declared in your tax return. 27. Similarly, if any amount is assessable income, then some of the costs related to gaining or producing that income may be allowable as a deduction (subject to the capital and private limitations). 28. You must retain records sufficient to calculate your income and expenses. Generally, those records should be kept for seven years from the end of the income year to which they relate. Item provides general guidance only 29. This item provides general guidance only. This item also does not consider any possible goods and services tax consequences of YouTube receipts. Individual circumstances are inevitably different. Inland Revenue suggests that anyone earning significant YouTube receipts may wish to obtain advice from a tax advisor. 5 UNCLASSIFIED References Related rulings/statements Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 3 (September 1995): 8 IR1022 – Online Trading Tax Implications (October 2013) IR 320 - Smart Business: A guide for businesses and non-profit organisations (March 2016) Subject references YouTube receipts E-commerce Profit-making undertaking or scheme Income under ordinary concepts Record keeping Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007, ss CA 1(2), CB 1 and CB 3 Tax Administration Act 1994, s 22 Case references A Taxpayer v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,350 (CA) Case S86 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,538 CIR v Walker \[1963\] NZLR 339 (CA) FCT v Hyteco Hiring Pty Limited 92 ATC 4,694 (FFC) Investment & Merchant Finance v FCT (1970) 120 CLR 177 (HCA) Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176 (CA)

This Question We’ve Been Asked is about ss CA 2, CB 1, CG 5B, DA 1, DA 2(1) and DA 2(3). Question What is the income tax treatment of payments made or received under a term life 1. or an illness/disability insurance policy where:  the policy holder and recipient of any claim amount received under the policy is a business that employs staff;  the premium amounts are paid by the business;  the insured person is an employee of the business (“the key-person”);  the employee has no enforceable or implied right against the employer to receive the claim or part thereof; and  the policy is taken out to compensate for a loss of business profits that would result from the death or incapacitation of the key person, whether or not the loss is accurately estimated? This type of insurance policy is commonly referred to as a “key-person insurance” policy and includes policies that cover total permanent disability, personal sickness and accident (“disablement policies”). Answer A lump sum or a periodic sum paid under the policy is taxable income of the 2. employer under s CB 1 (business income). Premium amounts paid are deductible under s DA 1. 3. This QWBA covers key-person insurance policies to the extent that the policy is 4. taken out to compensate for a loss of business profits that would result from the death or incapacitation of the key person. Insurance policies can be taken out for reasons other than, or in addition to, this loss of business profits purpose (eg, mortgage repayment protection, and collateral for capital funding). To the extent the insured amount is for replacement of capital, the claim amount portion that relates to the replacement of capital will not be taxable income. Where a policy is not solely to replace a loss of profits, apportionment of the premiums and/or claim amount may be required. Fringe benefit tax (FBT) does not apply. 5. Explanation Inland Revenue has reviewed all Public Information Bulletins (see 6. http://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/pib-review/). During this review, two items on the income tax treatment of insurance in an employment context were identified as being out of date. The two items are “Staff insurance schemes” (Public Information Bulletin No 70 (December 1972): 11) and “Life and accident 2 UNCLASSIFIED insurance policies” (Public Information Bulletin No 106 (July 1980): 2). These PIBs covered a number of different scenarios. We are replacing the PIBs with a series of Questions We’ve Been Asked (QWBAs) covering common scenarios. PIB 106 dealt with policies where the premiums were paid by the employer and 7. proceeds were payable to the employer. Key-person insurance has these features. The PIB item noted that the tax treatment depended on what the insurance was for. This QWBA is considering the tax treatment of payments made or received under a key-person insurance policy for the replacement of loss of business profits. Many businesses (including sole traders or partnerships) have a key employee 8. who has a unique set of skills and/or knowledge, and is vital to the business’s continued success. Should something happen to that employee, the loss of that employee will have a detrimental impact on the profitability of the business or generate financial strain. The employer may choose to protect the business from this risk by taking out a key-person insurance policy on the life and/or disablement of that key employee. This item covers policies where the purpose of the employer in taking out the policy is to obtain cover that provides revenue replacement to that employer in the event of a key person’s death or disablement due to illness or accident. The disablement could be either temporary or permanent. The claim amount can be received as a lump sum (as in the case of death or permanent disablement) or as periodic payments where the incapacity is temporary. This item does not apply to business owners such as a sole trader who takes key person insurance out on themselves (see paragraph 11 below) . The features of a key-person insurance policy covered by this QWBA are: 9.  the business (the employer) is the policy owner and the recipient of any amounts received under the policy (ie, the beneficiary);  the employer pays the premiums;  the employer is the only party eligible to make a claim under the policy;  the policy is either a term life or a disablement insurance policy or a combination of both;  the insured person is an employee;  the policy is taken out to compensate for a loss of business profits (either due to a reduction in turnover or an increase in costs) that would result from the death or extended incapacity (due to illness or accident) of the key employee, whether or not the loss is accurately estimated;  the employee has no enforceable or implied right against the employer to receive the claim or part thereof; and  the claim amount is an agreed amount that may be paid as a lump sum or by periodic payments to the employer. A number of other insurance policies also address types of financial loss suffered 10. by a business (eg, business interruption). The type of key-person policy covered by this QWBA insures against an event involving the personal health (or death) of a key employee. Whereas a business interruption policy insures against financial loss triggered by physical damage to the business’s operations caused by an event such as fire, earthquake or cyclone. Business interruption policies do not have a life insurance component to them. The type of key-person policy covered by this QWBA is also distinguishable from 11. an income protection policy because it protects the income of the business 3 UNCLASSIFIED (employer), whereas income protection policies provide protection for the income of the insured person (eg, income of the employee or sole trader). Business interruption and income protection policies are not covered in this QWBA. Also this item does not cover whole of life or endowment policies as we understand that these types of policies are no longer commonly used in this context. Income tax treatment of the claim amount An employer can receive an amount of money from an insurer on the occurrence 12. of the insured event, referred to as the claim amount. An amount derived from a business is income (s CB 1(1)). Capital amounts are 13. excluded from taxable income (s CB 1(2)). Whether a claim amount received is income or capital depends on whether it is compensating for a loss of a capital or revenue nature (Egmont Co-operative Dairies Ltd (in liq) v CIR \[1996\] 2 NZLR 419 (1996) 17 NZTC 12,536, Carapark Holdings Ltd v FCT (1967) 115 CLR 653). Insurance claim amounts that are received to “fill the hole of” or replace lost 14. business profits are generally considered to be business income in nature. Richardson P in Egmont (quoting Kitto, Taylor and Owen JJ in Carapark) stated: In general, insurance moneys are to be considered as received on revenue account where the purpose of the insurance was to fill the place of a revenue receipt which the event insured against has prevented from arising, or any outgoing which has been incurred on revenue account in consequence of the event insured against, whether as a legal liability or as a gratuitous payment actuated only by considerations of morality or expediency. Similarly, in CIR v Soma President Textiles Ltd; CIR v New Zealand Knitting Mills 15. Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,313, McGechan J stated (at 11,321): ... It is well recognised that the character of a compensation receipt-as capital or income-is coloured by the character of the item it compensates. Compensation for capital assets is capital: for income items, is income.... See also Burmah Steam Ship Co Ltd v IRC (1931) 16 TC 67 and London & Thames Haven Oil Wharves Ltd v Attwooll \[1967\] 2 All ER 124,134. The Courts have confirmed that income derived under a policy insuring a key-16. person will generally be revenue in nature (see Gray & Co Ltd v Murphy (1940) 23 TC 225 (KB), Executors of Williams v IR Commissioners (1924) 26 TC 23 (HL), Keir & Cawder v Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1958) 38 TC 23 (Court of Session), and Carapark). In Keir & Cawder, Lord President Clyde summarised this principle as follows: In the ordinary case where a company insures the life of an employee whose services are valuable to them, the sum received by the company on his death is a revenue reciept: see Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Williams’s Executors, 26 T.C. 23; for the expenditure incurred by the company in securing and retaining his services is a proper revenue charge, and the benefits derived from these services, being reflected in the profits of the company, are also of a revenue character. In the ordinary case, therefore, if the company insures the life of that person and on his death receives a payment from the insurance company, that payment represents compensation to the company for the loss of his services in helping them to earn profits and is a receipt on revenue account. As key-person insurance amounts replace taxable business profits they will also 17. be taxable income under the Act. However, if the claim amount replaces a capital component, that component of the claim amount would be capital for tax purposes. If the income that is being replaced by the claim amount is exempt or excluded 18. income (s CA 2) then the claim amount will also be exempt or excluded income in the same manner as the income it replaces. 4 UNCLASSIFIED Section CG 5B is a specific provision that taxes certain receipts for interruption or 19. impairment of business activities. In an insurance context it taxes insurance payments received for an interruption or impairment of business activities resulting from an event. If the key-person insurance policy includes payments that are contingent on the taxpayer proving an actual loss of income, these payments are likely to be taxable under s CG 5B and subject to the timing provision in s CG 5B(3). Deductibility of premiums for employer A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the 20. extent that it is incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving taxable (and/or excluded) income (s DA 1). It is also necessary that the deduction is not denied by the general limitations contained in s DA 2. As set out above, insurance recovery amounts under key-person insurance 21. policies will generally be revenue in nature (see Egmont; Carapark). Where that is the case, the payment of a premium intended to insure against the lost taxable income will satisfy the nexus test in s DA 1. The capital limitation in s DA 2(1) will not apply because the premiums are a regular expense outlaid as part of the regular demands on the income of the business. There will, however, be situations where premiums will not be deductible, either 22. because the expenditure will not satisfy the general permission in s DA 1, or because one or more of the general limitations in s DA 2 will apply. For example, the Commissioner considers that premiums will not be deductible in the following situations:  Where the employer takes out a policy for the purpose of securing the ability to repay a loan. In this situation, the capital limitation will apply. 1  Where the employer takes out a policy on behalf of its shareholders in order to buy out a shareholder’s estate in the event one of them dies. In this situation, the benefit accrues to the shareholders, rather than to the company itself. Therefore, the general permission will not be satisfied. Where a policy is not solely to replace a loss of profits, apportionment of the 23. premiums and/or claim amount may be required. The taxpayer has the onus of proving that an insurance premium is deductible. 24. Therefore, it will be necessary to regularly review the purpose of a policy to determine deductibility of the premium, consistent with the principles of self- assessment. Fringe Benefit Tax For the avoidance of doubt, there is no benefit provided to an employee in 25. connection with the key person insurance policies covered in this QWBA. This means no fringe benefit tax applies. Examples The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the 26. law. 1 The Commissioner has also confirmed that a deduction will not be allowed under s DB 5 where the insurance has a primary purpose of ensuring repayment obligations can be met (see “Deductibility of expenditure incurred in borrowing money – section DB 5” Interpretation statement IS 13/03 (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 1 (February 2014):3)). 5 UNCLASSIFIED Example 1 – Purpose is only for loss of profits ABC Ltd relies heavily on its top salesperson, Bob Adams. ABC Ltd is concerned 27. that if something happened to Bob, the company would suffer a significant loss of profits. It estimates its potential loss of profits would be at least $400,000. To help manage this risk, ABC Ltd takes out a key-person insurance policy. Features of the policy are:  Bob Adams is the life insured;  the policy document describes the policy benefits as a “term life insurance policy” and names ABC Ltd as the policy owner;  ABC Ltd is contractually bound to pay the monthly premiums;  the insurer will pay out to ABC Ltd on death, or on total permanent disablement of Bob, or pay a monthly benefit based on expected losses suffered if Bob is temporarily unable to work. A claim amount of $400,000 is payable as a lump sum on death or total 28. permanent disablement. A lesser amount is payable for partial disablement. Alternatively for temporary incapacity, a monthly benefit ($12,500 per month payable in monthly instalments for a maximum of 24 months) will be paid to ABC Ltd until either Bob can return to work or is no longer employed by ABC Ltd. The value of the claim amount and the value of the monthly benefit amounts 29. have been determined with reference to ABC Ltd’s historical financial results. ABC Ltd wants to know whether it can deduct the premiums that it pays on the 30. policy. ABC Ltd is allowed a deduction for the premiums paid as they are a cost incurred by them in deriving taxable income (s DA 1). Unfortunately the following year, Bob is killed in a car accident and ABC Ltd 31. receives the $400,000 claim amount shortly after this event. ABC Ltd wants to know whether the claim amount is taxable. 32. The claim amount is taxable under s CB 1. The purpose of the policy is to ensure 33. ABC Ltd does not suffer a loss of business profits due to Bob being unable to contribute to the business’s profitability. As the amount of $400,000 received from the insurer is intended to replace business profits, it will be taxable income under s CB 1(1). If Bob had been only injured in the car accident, ABC Ltd would suffer a 34. temporary loss of business profits. In that case, ABC Ltd would receive a monthly benefit. The monthly benefit amounts would also be taxable income under s CB 1. Example 2 – Multiple purpose key-person policy Quick Growth Ltd relies heavily on its chief programmer, John Jones. Five years 35. ago when the company began Quick Growth Ltd was concerned that if something happened to John, the company would suffer a significant loss of profits. To help manage this risk Quick Growth Ltd took out a key-person insurance policy for $500,000. The features of the policy were identical to ABC Ltd’s policy (above). Because Quick Growth Ltd has expanded rapidly they are reassessing their 36. insurance requirements. In addition, Quick Growth has applied for a loan from the bank. The bank has indicated they will accept the key-person insurance policy will meet their requirement for mortgage repayment insurance. Quick 6 UNCLASSIFIED Growth Ltd decides they now require $600,000 to cover the loss of profits risk but also require an additional $400,000 cover to satisfy the bank’s requirements. Quick Growth Ltd wants to know if it can claim the premiums it pays on the 37. policy. Quick Growth Ltd is allowed a proportional deduction for the premiums paid based on the ratio of the insured amount relating to the loss of profits/total insured amount (eg, $600,000/$1,000,000 = 60%). The remaining 40% of the premium is subject to the capital limitation in s DA 2. Six months later John has a heart attack and dies. Quick Growth Ltd receives the 38. $1,000,000 claim amount shortly after this event. Quick Growth Ltd wants to know whether the claim amount is taxable. 39. The claim amount of $600,000 for loss of profits is taxable (s CB 1). The purpose 40. of this amount was to replace business profits due to John being unable to contribute to the business’s profitability. The balance is not taxable. As the amount of $400,000 is intended to replace capital repayments it will not be taxable under s CB 1(1).

1 UNCLASSIFIED Notes In the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill introduced to Parliament on 6 April 2017 it is proposed to amend:  s CD 15 (Tax credits linked to dividends) to confirm that a non-cash dividend includes any resident or non-resident withholding tax paid for that dividend; and  s LB 3 (Tax credits for resident withholding tax) to confirm that, when determining tax withheld and paid, a person’s resident passive income includes resident withholding income for a non-cash dividend. This QWBA sets out the Commissioner’s view that these amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 confirm the existing treatment of resident and non-resident withholding tax as explained below. QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 17/07 RESIDENT AND NON–RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAXES: NON-CASH DIVIDENDS All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) is about ss RE 14 and RF 10. Question 1. Does the income of a person receiving a non-cash dividend include any resident or non-resident withholding tax paid on the dividend? Answer 2. Yes. 3. This means a recipient of a non-cash dividend has income comprising the amount of the non-cash dividend determined under s CD 38 and any resident or non-resident withholding tax paid for that dividend. Explanation 4. This question arises because, unlike a cash dividend where tax is withheld from the dividend income, with a non-cash dividend withholding tax must be paid in addition to the dividend income. Resident withholding tax 5. In certain situations, the Act requires a person who is paying a dividend to another person to withhold some of the payment and pay it to the Commissioner as resident withholding tax (RWT). The person receiving the payment can usually offset the RWT as a credit against their tax liability for the payment, and receive a refund of the RWT in certain circumstances. 6. For RWT to apply, the payment must be “resident passive income” as defined in the Act (also known as “resident withholding income” in earlier Acts). Relevantly, “resident passive income” includes dividends whether paid in money (cash 2 UNCLASSIFIED dividends) or not paid in money (non-cash dividends). Generally, any transfer of value by a company to a shareholder caused by the shareholder relationship is a dividend. A non-cash dividend is a dividend if it does not consist of an unconditional payment in money or a credit to the balance of a shareholder’s current account (or similar account) with the company. Non cash dividends are considered to be “paid” (in terms of the RWT provisions), as the Act defines an “amount” as including “an amount in money’s worth” and it defines “pay” as including where any “amount” is distributed or credited to a person, or otherwise dealt with in their interest. 7. One example of a non-cash dividend is an in-kind (or “in-specie”) distribution where property of the company is transferred to a shareholder for no consideration. Another example of a non-cash dividend is a taxable bonus issue. A further example is where there is a deemed dividend under the Act, such as when company property (eg, a company car) has been provided for a shareholder’s private use and insufficient consideration has been provided for that use. Generally, this is where the shareholder is not an employee. 1 8. The amount of a non-cash dividend taken into account for the RWT rules is the market value of what the recipient receives less any consideration the recipient provides in return (see s CD 38). 9. With cash dividends, s RA 9 makes it clear the gross dividend including the RWT is income of the recipient. Section RA 9 states the recipient derives the RWT “for the purposes of the Act” in the same way they derive the underlying payment. 10. This QWBA confirms the Commissioner’s view that the same result arises for non-cash dividends. That is, the recipient’s income from a non-cash dividend includes the RWT paid for the dividend. However, this is not clearly stated in the Act. The lack of clarity has led to doubt over whether a non-cash dividend is “grossed up” to include RWT. 11. Practically, it is not possible to withhold RWT from non-cash dividends as they are not paid in money. This means RWT cannot be “withheld” using the same legislative approach used for cash dividends. The Act must provide separately for RWT on non-cash dividends. It does so principally through s RE 14. 2 12. Section RE 14 requires a person paying a non-cash dividend to calculate and pay RWT using a formula based on the “amount” of the non-cash dividend (as per s CD 38). In this situation, unless the Act treats the RWT as the recipient’s income, their income would be limited to the amount of the non-cash dividend as determined under s CD 38. 13. Although s RE 14(4) treats the RWT “as if it were the amount of tax required to be withheld and paid under the RWT rules”, this is only for the calculation in s RE 14(2). Section RE 14 does not treat the RWT calculated under the provision as an amount of RWT withheld for all purposes of the Act. 1 Where the shareholder is also an employee, non-cash benefits like the provision of a vehicle will generally be a fringe benefit rather than a dividend. Section CX 17 allows companies to elect some non-cash benefits to be treated as dividends instead of fringe benefits. This option does not apply to “unclassified benefits” such as vehicle-related benefits or loans which are treated as fringe benefits. 2 Non-cash dividends that are either “bonus issues in lieu” or “a share issued under a profit distribution plan” are dealt with in a similar way under s RE 15 and the conclusions in this QWBA apply equally to those types of non-cash dividends. 3 UNCLASSIFIED 14. Because there is no amount “withheld”, it is unclear whether s RA 9 (as discussed above in paragraph 9) applies to RWT calculated under s RE 14. No other provision matching s RA 9 applies to non-cash dividends. Also, subpart CD of the Act (income arising from equity) does not specifically refer to the RWT calculated under s RE 14 as income of the recipient. 15. Any lack of clarity has only arisen since the Income Tax Act 2007 replaced the Income Tax Act 2004. However, the provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 are intended to have the same effect as the Income Tax Act 2004. Where there is any lack of clarity in the Income Tax Act 2007 it is appropriate to consider the corresponding provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004 (see s ZA 3(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007). 16. Under the Income Tax Act 2004 (and earlier income tax legislation), it was clear the recipient’s income included any RWT paid on non-cash dividends. In those Acts, RWT payable on a non-cash dividend was deemed to be a deduction of RWT for all purposes of the Acts (see s 327C(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976 and ss NF 2(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and 2004). The Commissioner’s view of the issue under the 1976 Act is illustrated by the example at page 15 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 3, No 7 (April 1992) where the recipient of a non-cash dividend (“Co. A” in example 2) is stated to derive an amount of income that includes the RWT. There is no identified change to the former s NF 2(2) in the Income Tax Act 2007 (see schedule 51 of the Act). 17. In addition, an inappropriate result could arise if the RWT paid for a non-cash dividend is not an amount of “tax withheld” for all purposes of the Act. Then, a tax credit would not be allowed for the RWT. This is because under s LB 3(1) a person has a tax credit equal to the “tax withheld” and paid in relation to their resident passive income. If no tax credit was allowed the result could be double taxation. Double taxation is where the same person is taxed twice on the same income. An interpretation that results in double taxation should not be adopted unless it is beyond any doubt that it was intended (see Canadian Eagle Oil Co Ltd v R \[1945\] 2 All ER 499 (HL); C of T v Luttrell \[1949\] NZLR 823 (CA)). 18. For example, with a non-cash dividend of $100, RWT of $49.25 would be paid to the Commissioner on behalf of the recipient of the dividend. Despite this tax payment on their behalf, the recipient could pay tax again for the same dividend if they could not claim a tax credit. 19. An inappropriate result would also arise if RWT on a non-cash dividend was treated as an amount withheld for the purpose of the tax credit provisions but not for the purpose of calculating the recipient’s income. In that case, a mismatch arises between the recipient’s income and the tax credits that can be offset against tax payable on the dividend income. For example, the RWT on a $100 cash dividend is $33. The recipient’s income is $100 and the tax credit available to them for the RWT is consistent with the RWT tax rate of 33%. In contrast, the RWT on a $100 non-cash dividend is $49.25. If the recipient’s income was only $100, the tax credit available to them is inconsistent with the RWT tax rate. However, the tax credit is consistent with the 33% RWT tax rate if the recipient’s income is $149.25 (ie, $149.25 @ 33% = $49.25). 20. Finally, the Act defines “resident passive income” as including both dividends and the RWT paid for them. Arguably, it follows that for the purposes of the Act, dividend income includes the RWT (whether deducted from, or paid in addition to, the dividend). With cash dividends or interest, RWT is paid out of the income. RWT paid for non-cash dividends is an additional payment and an additional transfer of value from the payer to the recipient. It is appropriate to treat this additional amount as income of the recipient and it is consistent with amendments 4 UNCLASSIFIED made by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 (ss 267–268) to allow non-cash and cash dividends paid together to be treated for RWT purposes as a single dividend. It also avoids the inappropriate results mentioned above. Non-resident withholding tax 21. A similar issue to that discussed above for RWT arises for non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). As with RWT, in certain situations the Act requires a person who is paying a dividend to a person who is not a tax resident to withhold some of the payment and pay it to the Commissioner as NRWT. For this to occur, the payment must be “non-resident passive income” as defined in the Act (also known as “non-resident withholding income” in earlier Acts). As with “resident withholding tax”, non-cash dividends can be “non-resident passive income”. 22. Section RF 10 applies NRWT to non-cash dividends. The formula operates to gross up the dividend in the same way as the RWT formula in s RE 14. For example, a $100 non-cash dividend attracts $42.86 NRWT using a 30% tax rate (ie, the dividend is treated as equivalent to a $142.86 cash dividend). 23. Non-resident passive income comprising dividends is also “schedular income” (see paragraph (f) of the s YA 1 definition “schedular income” and s RF 2(3)(a)). A person’s tax liability for schedular income is calculated separately from other income under s BC 7. Section RF 2(4) applies to dividends and provides that if the dividend recipient is a filing taxpayer, their schedular tax liability under s BC 7 for the dividend is “determined by the amount of tax required to be withheld” (ie, the tax liability equals the NRWT paid). This makes the NRWT a final tax on the dividend and effectively means the non-resident recipient’s income has been assessed as including the NRWT (ie, $142.86 using the $100 non-cash dividend example above). 24. A “filing taxpayer” is essentially any person who is not a “non-filing taxpayer” (see s YA 1 definitions). A “non-filing taxpayer” includes a person who only derives non-resident passive income in the year. So a person who is a non-resident who only received dividend income will be a non-filing taxpayer. Section RB 3(2) provides a non-filing taxpayer's terminal tax is their schedular income tax liability calculated using the formula: amount of income × tax rate. 25. For this calculation to give the same amount of terminal tax liability as the NRWT paid, the “amount of income” must include the dividend plus the NRWT paid for the dividend. Accordingly, the Commissioner’s view is that the “amount of income” in s RB 3(2) includes any NRWT paid for the dividend income. If this was not the case, a non-filing taxpayer’s tax liability for a $100 non-cash dividend would be $30 despite the $42.86 NRWT paid. This would be a similar anomalous result as noted above with RWT if the withholding tax is not treated as income along with the dividend. Example 26. As shown, for tax purposes the income of recipients of non-cash dividends varies according to whether the dividend is subject to withholding tax. Companies providing non-cash dividends may need to consider if this unequal outcome has any implications for non-tax related legislation. One approach may be to pay an additional compensating payment to equalise the distributions to shareholders. 5 UNCLASSIFIED Facts A New Zealand resident company has four equal shareholders: three are New Zealand tax residents and one is not a tax resident. Two of the three New Zealand resident shareholders are exempt from RWT. The company pays a non-cash dividend by distributing to its shareholders shares the company holds in another company. Each shareholder receives 100 shares with a current market value of $10 each. The shareholders provide no consideration to the company in return so the amount of the dividend paid is $1,000. No imputation credits are attached to the dividends. RWT for the resident shareholders Where an RWT liability arises, the formula in s RE 14(2) applies as follows: (tax rate × dividend paid ÷ (1 – tax rate)) – tax paid or credit attached (0.33 × $1,000 ÷ (1 – 0.33)) – 0 = $492.53 Where the dividend is subject to RWT, shareholders’ income is $1,492.53 ($1,000 + $492.53). Where the dividend is not subject to RWT, the shareholders’ income is $1,000. NRWT for the non-resident shareholder Where a NRWT liability arises, the formula in s RF 10(2) applies as follows: (rate A ÷ (1 – rate A) × dividend payment) 3 Where: rate A = 0.3 (the tax rate set out in s RF 8) dividend payment = $1,000 (the amount of the dividend to the extent it is not fully imputed) (0.3 ÷ (1-0.3) × $1,000) = $428.57 Comment As this example shows, companies may need to consider the differing results arising for shareholders when deciding to pay non-cash dividends. In this case, the company may wish to consider whether to make compensating payments to equalise the distributions to shareholders. Comparison with cash dividends In comparison, if the dividend in this example was a cash dividend and RWT or NRWT applied, the withholding tax would be deducted from the cash payment to the shareholders (ie, no additional amount would be paid by the company on the shareholders’ behalf as RWT or NRWT). 3 This is the formula following amendment by s 277 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016-17, Closely Held Companies and Remedial Matters) Act 2017. 6 UNCLASSIFIED This means the income of all shareholders is $1,000 regardless of whether RWT or NRWT applied to the dividend. Assuming the dividend is taxable to a shareholder, depending on whether withholding tax applied or not, a shareholder either receives an after-tax amount from the company or has to fund any tax due on that dividend themselves. 7 UNCLASSIFIED References Subject references Non-cash dividend Non-resident withholding tax Resident withholding tax Schedular income Legislative references Income Tax Act 1976: s 327C(2) Income Tax Act 1994: s NF 2(2) Income Tax Act 2004: s NF 2(2) Income Tax Act 2007 – ss BC 7, LB 3, CD 15, CD 38, CX 17, RA 9, RB 3, RE 14, RE 15, RF 2, RF 8, RF 10, YA 1 Case references Canadian Eagle Oil Co Ltd v R \[1945\] 2 All ER 499 (HL) C of T v Luttrell \[1949\] NZLR 823 (CA) Other references Tax Information Bulletin Vol 3, No 7 (April 1992):15
20 September 2017 Unclassified Question Are amounts derived on the sale of gold bullion income for tax purposes? Answer As with any personal property, amounts derived on the disposal of gold will be income under s CB 4 if the gold was acquired for the dominant purpose of disposal. Explanation 1. While the test in s CB 4 is subjective, any assertion that property was not acquired for the dominant purpose of disposal needs to be assessed against the totality of the circumstances. These include the nature of the asset, the person’s vocation, the circumstances of the purchase, the number of similar transactions, the length of time the property was held, and the circumstances of the use and disposal of the asset. 2. The nature of the asset is always an important consideration. In the case of gold bullion, the Commissioner considers that this is particularly so, as bullion does not provide annual returns or income while it is held, nor does it confer other benefits (which other investments that do not provide income while held might). The Commissioner therefore considers that, for gold bullion, the nature of the asset is a factor that strongly indicates that it was acquired for the dominant purpose of ultimately disposing of it. QB 17/08 Are proceeds from the sale of gold bullion income? QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This QWBA is about whether disposals of gold bullion will give rise to income under s CB 4. Amounts derived on the disposal of personal property are income under s CB 4 if the property was acquired for the dominant purpose of disposal. While this QWBA discusses s CB 4 in the context of gold bullion, the same principles are relevant to the disposal of other personal property. Some of the issues discussed are particularly relevant to the disposal of non-income producing assets. Key provision Section CB 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Key terms in this item In the context of this QWBA, gold bullion refers to physical gold bars, coins, or certificates (allocated or unallocated), or direct units in gold (ie, units that give rise to ownership of a certain amount of gold, measured in physical units). Gold may also be invested indirectly, for example through investment in a fund that owns commodities or benchmarks its return to commodities, or through other derivatives such as forwards, futures or options. Investments in gold in those or other forms not covered by this QWBA may still give rise to tax implications under s CB 4 or under other tax rules (for example under the financial arrangements rules). QB 17/08: 20 September 2017 Unclassified 2 3. In most cases, gold purchased in bullion form will be purchased for the dominant purpose of disposal. However, there may sometimes be situations where the Commissioner may accept that the dominant purpose in acquiring gold bullion was to retain it for reasons other than eventual disposal. For example, there may be circumstances where bullion is acquired for the dominant purpose of building up a diversified portfolio of property that the person will not necessarily realise, or as a long-term investment that the person will not necessarily realise. In such circumstances it may be that the taxpayer can show that the bullion was not purchased with the dominant purpose of disposal. 4. Ascertaining what a person’s subjective purpose was at the time they acquired property is a very fact-specific assessment. The particular circumstances of the situation need to be carefully considered, and any assertion that gold was not acquired for the dominant purpose of disposal would need to be supported by clear and compelling evidence. 5. It is also important to bear in mind that merely describing property, or the reason for which it was acquired, in a particular way will not answer the question of whether there was a dominant purpose of disposal. For example, describing property as being acquired as a long-term investment, a hedge against inflation, for portfolio diversification, or as a store of value outside the monetary system is not sufficient to negate a dominant purpose of disposal. The person’s underlying motive should not be confused with their purpose. The key question is whether the person’s objective in acquiring the gold is to be achieved through a course of action that will involve disposal at some point, such that, as a matter of fact, the person’s dominant purpose is one of disposal. If a taxpayer asserts that they did not acquire gold bullion for the dominant purpose of disposal, the onus is on them to satisfactorily show that. 6. When gold that was acquired for the purpose of disposal is sold, a deduction for the cost of the property is allowed, subject to the normal rules. Just as an increase in value will mean that any profits will be taxed, if gold has decreased in value and is sold for less than it cost, this will result in a deductible loss. Other expenditure may also be deductible, such as interest on money borrowed to purchase the gold, insurance premiums, and storage costs. What is the relevant taxing provision? 7. Section CB 4 provides that: CB 4 Personal property acquired for purpose of disposal An amount that a person derives from disposing of personal property is income of the person if they acquired the property for the purpose of disposing of it. 8. Amounts derived on the disposal of gold will therefore be income under s CB 4 if the gold was acquired for the purpose of disposal. What types of disposals fall within the scope of s CB 4? No requirement for purpose of disposal at a profit 9. Before the provision taxing the disposal of personal property acquired for the purpose of disposal was introduced, there was a provision in the tax legislation that taxed disposals of land acquired for the purpose of selling or otherwise disposing of it at a profit. When that provision was expanded to include personal property, one of the changes made was that the property only needed to be acquired for the purpose of sale or disposition (rather than sale or disposition at a profit). It is therefore clear that for s CB 4 to apply the purpose in acquiring the property does not need to be sale or disposal at a profit. QB 17/08: 20 September 2017 Unclassified 3 Purpose of disposal by way of sale or similar 10. However, the Commissioner considers that s CB 4 is limited to situations where there was a purpose of disposal by way of sale or similar (eg, by way of barter). While the legislation simply refers to property acquired for the purpose of disposal, prior to the Act being re-written for simplicity and improved clarity (which was done progressively from 1994) the provision stated that it applied to disposals of personal property that was “acquired for the purpose of selling or otherwise disposing of it”. The Commissioner considers that in the pre-rewrite wording, “selling” coloured the words “or otherwise disposing of it”, indicating that the provision would apply where the purpose in acquiring the property was disposal by way of sale or similar. To read the provision more broadly would mean that any personal property acquired to be gifted would be within the tax base, which was clearly not intended and would be absurd. There was no intention to broaden the scope of s CB 4 when the Act was re-written – the provision was intended to continue to have the same effect. 1 As such, the wording of the provision before the Act was re-written must be used to determine the correct meaning of s CB 4. 2 The Commissioner therefore considers that the correct interpretation of s CB 4 is that it will apply to disposals of personal property acquired for the purpose of disposal by way of sale or similar. 11. This means that s CB 4 would not apply to disposals of property acquired for the purpose of disposal by way of gift, for example. But it should be noted that if property was acquired for the purpose of disposal by sale or similar and is then gifted, such a disposal would give rise to income under s CB 4. It is the person’s purpose at the time they acquire the property that is relevant, not how they ultimately dispose of the property. And subpart FC of the Act ensures that tax-base property cannot be gifted outside of the tax base. 12. Similarly, s CB 4 would not apply to disposals of property acquired for the purpose of being passed to heirs on death. But if property was acquired for the purpose of disposal by sale or similar and ends up being transferred on death, there may be tax consequences arising from that transfer or from a subsequent disposal. 3 Section CB 4 – main principles 13. The leading case on s CB 4 is CIR v National Distributors Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346 (CA). This was a case about whether various parcels of shares were acquired for the purpose of selling or otherwise disposing of them, so that the proceeds on the sales would be taxable under what is now s CB 4. In discussing the provision, Richardson J noted that: Section 65(2) \[now s CB 4\] is expressed as a deeming provision. The assessable income of the taxpayer is deemed to include profits derived from transactions coming within the respective limb of para (e). The second limb has been in the legislation since 1916. It brings within the tax net particular transactions which might otherwise escape liability. It does not perpetuate the theoretical distinction between capital and income. It is not to be read down by any preconceptions as to the nature of a tax on income or by importing a requirement that the acquisitions to which it refers should have a business overlay. The words used must be given their natural and ordinary meaning (see Lowe v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1981\] 1 NZLR 326, 342). \[Emphasis added\] 1 Section YA 3(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and schedule 22A (Identified policy changes) to that Act, and s ZA 3(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and schedule 51 (Identified changes in legislation) to that Act. 2 Section YA 3(4) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and s ZA 3(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 3 The specific rules in the Act dealing with property that is transferred on a person’s death, or on a distribution by an executor, administrator or trustee of a deceased’s estate to a beneficiary are in subpart FC of the Act. QB 17/08: 20 September 2017 Unclassified 4 14. The main principles on the application of s CB 4 that can be drawn from National Distributors are as follows:  There is no business overlay to s CB 4; the distinction between capital and revenue is not relevant.  All that is required is that the property be acquired for the dominant purpose of disposal.  The onus is on the taxpayer to show that they did not acquire the property with the dominant purpose of disposal.  The test of purpose is subjective, but the taxpayer’s assertions as to their purpose need to be assessed against the totality of the circumstances. These will include the nature of the asset, the vocation of the taxpayer, the circumstances of the purchase, the number of similar transactions, the length of time the property was held, and the circumstances of the use and disposal of the asset.  It is important to bear in mind the distinction between motive and purpose; the reason why the taxpayer decided to acquire property with a view to disposal in due course is not relevant to the statutory inquiry. If the taxpayer’s dominant purpose in acquiring the property is to dispose of it in the future, the provision will apply.  If at the time the property was acquired the taxpayer did not expect to hold the property forever and contemplated the possibility of sale, this alone would not bring the sale within s CB 4. The property must have been acquired for the dominant purpose of disposal.  If the property was acquired for a number of purposes, disposal must be the predominant one for s CB 4 to apply.  If the taxpayer can establish that they had no clear purpose in mind when acquiring an asset, s CB 4 will not apply. Will amounts derived on the disposal of gold bullion be income? 15. While the test of purpose for s CB 4 is subjective, as noted above, any assertion that property was not acquired for the purpose of disposal needs to be assessed against the totality of the circumstances. 16. As noted by Richardson J in National Distributors, the nature of the asset is always an important consideration. Assets acquired for private use and enjoyment clearly fall outside the scope of s CB 4. In other situations there may be an element of private use and enjoyment as well as economic reward, and it will be necessary to determine what the dominant purpose on acquisition was. But in some situations it will be clear that the asset is not intended for private use and enjoyment. In that case, it might generally be expected that the asset was acquired for the purpose of deriving income from it while it is held, or with the aim of realising a profit on its disposal sooner or later. 17. In the case of gold bullion, the Commissioner considers that the nature of the asset is a significant consideration in deciding if it was acquired for the dominant purpose of disposal, as bullion does not provide annual returns or income while it is held. Other investments may similarly not provide income while held, for example shares that do not pay dividends, but may confer other benefits such as voting rights. The Commissioner therefore considers that, for gold bullion, the nature of the asset is a factor that strongly indicates that it was acquired for the purpose of ultimately disposing of it. 18. In most cases, gold purchased in bullion form will be purchased for the dominant purpose of disposal. However, there may sometimes be situations where the Commissioner may accept that the dominant purpose in acquiring gold bullion was to retain it for reasons QB 17/08: 20 September 2017 Unclassified 5 other than eventual disposal. For example, there may be circumstances where bullion is acquired for the dominant purpose of building up a diversified portfolio of property that the person will not necessarily realise, or as a long-term investment that the person will not necessarily realise. In such circumstances it may be that the taxpayer can show that the bullion was not purchased with the dominant purpose of disposal. 19. This will always be a very fact-specific call, and would require consideration of what the person had in mind at the time they acquired the property. Relevant factors to consider in testing this might be things such as the person’s means at the time they acquired the property, whether at that time they expect to or are likely to need to realise their investments in the future, and the circumstances surrounding the disposal. Other factors such as the number of similar transactions and the length of time the property was held would also be relevant in testing the veracity of the taxpayer’s assertion. Any assertion that gold was not acquired for the dominant purpose of disposal would need to be supported by clear and compelling evidence. 20. It is important to bear in mind that merely describing property or the reason for which it was acquired in a particular way will not answer the question of whether there was a dominant purpose of disposal. For example, describing property as being acquired as a long-term investment, a hedge against inflation, for portfolio diversification, or as a store of value outside the monetary system is not sufficient to negate a dominant purpose of disposal. The person’s underlying motive should not be confused with their purpose. The key question is whether the person’s objective in acquiring the gold is to be achieved through a course of action that will involve disposal at some point, such that, as a matter of fact, the person’s dominant purpose is one of disposal. If a taxpayer asserts that they did not acquire gold bullion for the dominant purpose of disposal, the onus is on them to satisfactorily show that. 21. The table on the following two pages summarises a number of overseas cases that have considered the taxability of gold and silver bullion. While the provisions considered in those cases are not identical to s CB 4, in most cases the tax outcomes would be the same in New Zealand, and they are useful fact scenarios to consider. The table also sets out the Commissioner’s view of whether s CB 4 would apply on the same facts, and, if the result would be different in New Zealand, explains why. There are other overseas cases considering the taxability of non-income producing commodities, but the cases set out in the table below 4 are considered the most relevant as they deal with gold or silver bullion. 4 Wisdom v Chamberlain (Inspector of Taxes) \[1969\] 1 All ER 332 (CA), Southco Holdings and Management Ltd et al v MNR 75 DTC 162 (Tax Review Board), Case P27 82 ATC 117 (Board of Review), Case Q109 83 ATC 560 (Board of Review), Victor Harms v MNR 84 DTC 1666 (TCC), and Case U145 87 ATC 844 (AAT). QB 17/08: 20 September 2017 Unclassified 6 Case Summary of facts Decision Reasons for decision CIR’s view of whether s CB 4 would apply Wisdom v Chamberlain Court of Appeal (England) The taxpayer had invested in silver as a hedge against expected devaluation of the British pound. When the pound recovered, and the risk of devaluation was gone, the taxpayer sold the silver bars at a profit. The sales of the silver were an adventure or concern in the nature of trade. The fact that the silver was acquired as a hedge against devaluation did not detract from the transactions being in the nature of trade. Although the investment was a hedge, the transactions were nonetheless entered into on a short-term basis for the purpose of making a profit. The amount derived on the sale would similarly be income under s CB 4. This is because while the taxpayer’s motivation in acquiring the silver was to protect against expected devaluation of the pound, that aim was to be achieved either by re-sale at a profit if devaluation occurred, or by re-sale if the danger of devaluation passed. Southco Holdings v MNR Tax Review Board (Canada) The taxpayer acquired large quantities of gold bullion over a seven-year period. The representative of the taxpayer company explained that the company was forced to sell the gold to help its parent company pay a substantial tax bill. The profits arising from the sales were income from an adventure in the nature of trade, and so income. The taxpayers were not in the business of processing gold to make a profit. The gold was therefore only of value to them in that it could be exchanged for money, and it was inconceivable that the taxpayer would buy such a commodity in such a quantity without the intention of reselling it at a profit. The explanation for the sale was not convincing enough to prove that there was a unique reason for the sale which might have supported a conclusion that the transactions were not an adventure in the nature of trade. The amount derived on the sale would similarly be income under s CB 4. This is because it was clear (and admitted by the taxpayer) that the gold, which was acquired for peace of mind and as security against inflation, was of no benefit unless it was sold. In the most profitable transactions, the gold was sold after about 15 months, and the reasons given for the sales did not suggest there had been some purpose other than eventual sale at a profit. Case P27 Board of Review (Australia) The taxpayer received an early discharge from the army after suffering an injury, and then worked as a public servant. He invested his payout from the army in gold and silver bullion as he wanted to preserve its purchasing power, so that it would more closely approximate what he would have received had he stayed in the army until age 55. It was accepted by the taxpayer in his evidence that to achieve this purpose the bullion had to be sold eventually in whole or in part. The taxpayer ended up selling the gold some two and a half years later to purchase a rural property. His instructions for the sale were given within two hours of hearing a radio message concerning the price of bullion on that day. The profits were taxable as the taxpayer acquired the bullion with the dominant purpose of selling it at a profit. While the taxpayer’s motive in acquiring bullion was as a hedge against inflation, his dominant purpose was to sell it at a profit when he reached age 55. The amount derived on the sale would similarly be income under s CB 4. This is because while the taxpayer’s motivation was to secure the value of his payout from the army, his purpose was always to sell the gold and silver. QB 17/08: 20 September 2017 Unclassified 7 Case Summary of facts Decision Reasons for decision CIR’s view of whether s CB 4 would apply Case Q109 Board of Review (Australia) The taxpayers were Asian immigrants to Australia. Against the backdrop of the husband’s ill health, they purchased the silver bullion to protect their capital, and to provide for their children’s financial futures. This was in keeping with their cultural custom. It was considered that silver or gold would best withstand fluctuations in value over an indefinite period. The price of silver rose unpredictably and substantially. At that time, the taxpayers decided to take advantage of the extraordinary rise in the value of silver and sell some. The profits on the sale of the bullion were not income under ordinary concepts, and were not derived from the carrying on or carrying out of a profit-making undertaking or scheme. The bullion was not acquired for the purpose of profit- making by sale. The evidence indicated that the taxpayers’ financial position was sound at the time the bullion was acquired, and neither of them could foresee a future situation where it might be necessary for them to sell all or some of the bullion for their personal benefit. Further, at the time of acquisition, it was probably not feasible for anyone to have confidently (if at all) predicted the remarkable rise in the value of silver, particularly over a short period of time. The amount derived on the sale would not be income under s CB 4. This is because s CB 4 is limited to situations where there was a purpose of sale or some other similar disposal. In this case, the taxpayers acquired the gold to gift to their children at maturity, in accordance with their cultural custom. Victor Harms v MNR Tax Court of Canada The taxpayer had purchased gold bars and coins with the aim of preserving his capital in the event of what he considered the imminent collapse of the economy, and emergence of a barter system. In the event that this happened, the taxpayer considered that gold would maintain its purchasing power. The taxpayer ended up selling the gold bars and coins when there were indications of economic deflation. The profits were not considered to be from an adventure in the nature of trade. The gains the taxpayer made on the sales were held to be capital, not income. There was nothing to indicate that the taxpayer had acquired the gold with the intention of selling it. There was nothing to suggest that the transactions were entered into on a short-term basis or that the taxpayer intended to sell the gold at an opportune time. The court was satisfied that the taxpayer was convinced the economy was going to collapse and that gold would serve as the basis of any barter system that would emerge. The amount derived on the disposal would be taxed under s CB 4. What is required is a dominant purpose of disposal – which the CIR considers means by way of sale or similar. In this case, the taxpayer acquired the gold for the purpose of disposing of it either by way of barter in the event of economic collapse, or by selling it if a particular scenario eventuated. Either of those alternatives amount to a purpose of disposal by way of sale or similar, so s CB 4 would apply. Case U145 AAT (Australia) The taxpayer was a 63 year old bookmaker, with a portfolio of long-term investments including some gold bullion. He bought the bullion to extend and diversify his portfolio, and hoped it would be a good long-term investment. The AAT accepted that he did not acquire the gold intending to sell it, but merely for it to be part of his portfolio which could be used if the taxpayer became unable to work. The taxpayer wanted to work for as long as he could, and gave evidence of a bookmaker who was still working at age 89. The taxpayer ended up selling the gold due to a business liquidity issue, and a large tax liability. He also sold shares, most of them at a loss. The taxpayer did not acquire the gold with the predominant purpose of profit- making by sale, so the proceeds were not taxable. At the time the taxpayer acquired the gold, its sale was a possibility that depended on a number of contingencies which were contrary to the taxpayer’s expectations (ie, the need to retire). It was also noted that even if such contingencies arose and the sale of part of the taxpayer’s portfolio was required, this would not necessarily have included the gold. The AAT considered that it was apparent that the weakest of the taxpayer’s shareholdings (together with the remaining gold) were sold to fund the tax liability. The amount derived on the sale would not be income under s CB 4. The taxpayer’s particular circumstances show that the dominant purpose on the acquisition of the bullion was not disposal. QB 17/08: 20 September 2017 Unclassified 8 22. As can be seen, ascertaining what a person’s subjective purpose was at the time they acquired property is a very fact-specific assessment. The particular circumstances of the situation need to be carefully considered, and as noted above, the person’s motives need to be distinguished from their purposes in acquiring the property. What if a person has no purpose in acquiring gold bullion? 23. As noted at \[14\], if someone can establish that they had no clear purpose in mind when acquiring an asset, s CB 4 will not apply (National Distributors). The Commissioner considers it unlikely that someone could satisfactorily show that they purchased gold bullion with no clear purpose in mind. What if gold bullion is purchased as part of a business? 24. Section CB 4 would not be relevant where a taxpayer sells or exchanges gold bullion in the ordinary course of their business, or has the bullion for use in producing stock for sale or exchange (for example, a jeweller who converts gold bullion into other forms for sale). In those situations, the commodity would be the taxpayer’s “trading stock” (s EB 2). Business income is taxed under s CB 1, and the timing of deductions for the value of trading stock is determined under the trading stock rules (see in particular s DB 49(2)). What deductions can be claimed? 25. Property that, if disposed of for valuable consideration, would produce income for a person is generally 5 “revenue account property” (as defined in s YA 1). Personal property that is acquired for the purpose of disposal is therefore revenue account property. 26. Section DB 23 allows a deduction for the cost of revenue account property. This is subject to the “general permission” (s DA 1) being satisfied. The general permission requires a nexus between the expenditure and the derivation of assessable and/or excluded income, or for the expenditure to have been incurred in the course of the person carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable and/or excluded income. 27. Where gold bullion was acquired for the dominant purpose of disposal it will be revenue account property, and the cost of the gold will be deductible under s DB 23. The deduction is allocated to the earlier of the income year in which the property is disposed of or ceases to exist (s EA 2). Just as an increase in value will mean that the profits are taxed, if the gold has decreased in value, and is sold for less than it cost, that would result in a deductible loss. 28. Where gold bullion is acquired for the purpose of being disposed of, the taxpayer would also be able to deduct expenditure (subject to the normal rules) such as interest on money borrowed to purchase the gold, insurance premiums, storage costs, etc, (ss DA 1, DB 6 and DB 7). 29. As noted above, where gold bullion is a taxpayer’s trading stock, the timing of deductions for the value of the trading stock is determined under the trading stock rules (see in particular s DB 49(2)). 5 The exceptions to this are not relevant for present purposes. QB 17/08: 20 September 2017 Unclassified 9 The following example is included to assist in explaining how the law applies. In addition to this example, the table on pages 6 and 7 above sets out the Commissioner’s view of whether s CB 4 would apply on the same facts as in the cases set out in the table, and includes examples of situations where s CB 4 would not apply. 30. Between late 2007 and early 2008, Zoë, who lives in New Zealand, purchased gold and silver units issued by an Australian mint. The units gave rise to ownership of a total of 57.986 ounces of gold (purchased for a total of NZD59,585.25) and 879.098 ounces of silver (purchased for a total of NZD18,606.99). Zoë was concerned about volatility in the share market, the economic uncertainty at the time, and the safety of the banking system. She considered that gold and silver provided a stable and low-risk investment option. Zoë did not have any particular timeframe in mind for holding the gold and silver units, as it depended in part on what happened with the equities and commodities markets, but ultimately she hoped to make a profit and so increase her retirement fund. 31. Zoë sold the gold units in mid-2016 to help fund the purchase of a larger residential property. Those units were sold for NZD100,354.05. Zoë sold the silver units later in 2016 to fund her wedding. Those units were sold for NZD20,632.43. 32. Amounts derived on the disposal of personal property are income under s CB 4 if the property was acquired for the dominant purpose of disposal. The Commissioner considers that the amounts Zoë derived on the sales of the gold and silver units are income under s CB 4, because those units were acquired for the dominant purpose of ultimately being disposed of. The units did not provide annual returns or income while being held, and Zoë acquired them with the aim of realising a profit on their disposal sooner or later. There is nothing to suggest that Zoë did not anticipate selling the units at some point. Zoë’s aim in acquiring the units was to make a profit on their disposal. In the circumstances, the fact that Zoë had concerns about the share market and considered the units to be a stable investment does not suggest that they were not acquired for the purpose of ultimately being disposed of. The events that prompted Zoë to sell the units are not relevant to the application of s CB 4. 33. Under s CB 4, the amounts derived on the sales of the gold units (NZD100,354.05) and silver units (NZD20,632.43) are therefore income to Zoë in the 2016-2017 income year. Because the gold and silver units are revenue account property, and there is the necessary nexus between the expenditure incurred in purchasing the units and the derivation of income, Zoë is able to deduct the cost of that property under s DB 23. Zoë can therefore deduct NZD59,585.25 (the cost of the gold units) and NZD18,606.99 (the cost of the silver units) in the 2016-2017 income year. She can also deduct other expenditure incurred in deriving the income, for example forex charges or bank transaction fees.

This Question We’ve Been Asked provides guidance for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue staff on which buildings the Commissioner considers come within the asset class “Buildings with prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels” in the “Buildings and Structures” asset category in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates. Question 1. What buildings come within the asset class “Buildings with prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels”? Answer 2. The asset class “Buildings with prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels” (sandwich panels) includes buildings 1 where:  The structural framework of the building is of a material other than sandwich panels and the building can be categorised as a “shade-roof structure”, or  The structural framework of the building is of a material other than sandwich panels and no less than 75% of the exterior cladding of the building is predominantly made using sandwich panels. In calculating this 75% threshold:  The windows and doors of a building are ignored and treated as being constructed of the same material as that which surrounds them.  Unless the roof of a building is constructed solely or partly using sandwich panels, the roof of the building is ignored and the calculation focuses only on the exterior cladding used to construct the side walls of the building. Where the roof is constructed solely or partly using sandwich panels, the calculation should focus on the square metre area of the exterior cladding of the entire building (that is, the square metre area of both the side walls and roof of the building), or  Sandwich panels form the core of the structural framework of the building; the building is constructed solely of interlocking sandwich panels without any other form of frame construction (steel, for instance). Background 3. In Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 10 (November 2015) the Commissioner published QB 15/12 Depreciation treatment for “Buildings with prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels” (QB 15/12). Feedback received since this item was published indicates that taxpayers have found its contents difficult to understand and apply in practice. In order to provide greater clarity this item updates and replaces QB 15/12. 1 For the meaning of the term “building” in the context of the depreciation provisions, please refer to Interpretation Statement IS 10/02: “Meaning of ‘building’ in the depreciation provisions” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 5 (June 2010): 24). UNCLASSIFIED 4. A prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panel comprises a foam core sandwiched between two “skins”. The core is most commonly made from polyurethane or styrene foam and is both durable and light weight. The “skin” is most commonly made from stainless steel, aluminium or plain galvanised steel. These panels are referred to as “sandwich panels”. 5. Since the 1970’s, the use of sandwich panels has been a cost-efficient element in the construction of buildings where hygienic food storage is required; coolstores and meat or fish processing facilities for example. Their use enables product to be held within a defined temperature range and so more easily meet storage, handling and hygiene regulations as well as client requirements for a finished product (chilled rather than frozen meat, for example). 6. Historically, the use of sandwich panels was limited to lining the internal walls of a building for insulation purposes, with (generally) steel being used for the framing, roofing and external weather cladding of the building. However, as sandwich panel quality and manufacturing techniques improved, sandwich panels have been used as unprotected weather cladding and insulation for the building or even as the core structural element, weather cladding and insulation for the building. 7. The “Buildings with prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels” asset class appears in the “Building and Structures” asset category in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates (“Depreciation Table”) and has a depreciation rate of 4.5% diminishing value (DV) or 3% straight line value, based on an estimated useful life (EUL) of 33.3 years. Discussion 8. In the asset categories contained in Determination DEP 1: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 1 (DEP 1), the building asset classes are initially described by the structural/construction method used (for example, Buildings with steel or steel and timber framing). In some cases these generally described building classes will be further, more narrowly, described by the activity the building houses (for example, Fertiliser works, Mushroom factories). The asset class “Buildings with prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels” is a reference to an element of the construction, rather than to an activity that is being carried on within the structure. 9. Used in this context, the word “with” can be defined as being either “accompanied by” or “material used for a purpose” 2 . Given these definitions it is the Commissioner’s view that, to fall within this asset class a building will either need to be constructed solely of sandwich panels or constructed using other materials (steel for instance) but “accompanied by” sandwich panels (usually as cladding and/or insulation). As has already been stated, the wording used to describe this class of building is not a reference to any activity that may be undertaken within the building. This being so, the EUL that has been set for this asset class assumes that the EUL will not be affected by the activities undertaken within the building 3 . 10. Given all of the above, it is the Commissioner’s view is that the prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels asset class could include either the building’s cladding or the framing structure, as follows: 2 Concise Oxford English Dictionary. 3 This is further discussed at \[18\]. UNCLASSIFIED The structural framework of the building is of a material other than sandwich panels and the building can be categorised as a “shade-roof structure” 11. Historically steel has been the predominant material used in the framing of buildings that also use sandwich panels, due to steel’s economy and resilience in low temperature environments. Historically, coolstore buildings have been an example of this. Typically, the building will be constructed using steel framing with sheet metal cladding that acted as a weather enclosure. The insulated building will be created by lining the inside of the metal clad building with sandwich panels to form a fully insulated “box”. Where a structure is fully insulated in this way it is known as a shade-roof structure. 12. As these shade-roof structures are “accompanied by” sandwich panels, they fall within the asset class Buildings with prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels. The structural framework of the building is of a material other than sandwich panels and no less than 75% of the exterior cladding of the building is predominantly made using sandwich panels 13. In some instances the exterior cladding of a building may be constructed from mixed materials. For example, a building has steel framing with most of the building being clad using sandwich panels. There is however a small administration room at one end of the building that is built from concrete blocks. Alternatively, the steel framed building may be largely constructed using concrete blocks, but have a small coolstore facility attached that is constructed of sandwich panels. 14. Where the exterior cladding of a building is made from mixed construction materials, the Commissioner will take into account the overall percentage of the different materials used. If, overall, 75% or more of the exterior wall cladding of the building is made from sandwich panels, the Commissioner considers that the building comes within the asset class Buildings with prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels. 15. The CIR arrived at this 75% threshold after receiving specialist valuation advice. This threshold is indicative of the “tipping point” at which the EUL of the building is negatively impacted by the use of sandwich panels. It is the CIR’s view that, where less than 75% of the exterior cladding of the building is made from sandwich panels then, subject to normal and reasonable maintenance being maintained 4 , this type of building will generally have a EUL of 50 years. 16. Whether 75% of the building is constructed using sandwich panels is calculated using the following formula: Square metre area of sandwich panels used as external cladding Total square metre area of all of the building’s external cladding 17. In calculating the square metre area the following matters are to be taken into account:  The windows and doors of a building are ignored and treated as being constructed of the same material as that which surrounds them.  Unless the roof of a building is constructed solely or partly using sandwich panels, the roof of the building is ignored and the calculation focuses only on the exterior cladding used to construct the side walls of the building. Where 4 Per the definition of estimated useful life contained in section EE 63(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007. UNCLASSIFIED the roof is constructed solely or partly using sandwich panels, the calculation should focus on the square metre area of the exterior cladding of the entire building (that is, the square metre area of both the side walls and roof of the building). 18. As previously stated (at \[9\]), this 75% threshold assumes that there are no other factors that would affect the EUL of that class of building. Where there are other factors that may affect the EUL of a class of building in a taxpayer’s possession, then a taxpayer is able to make a provisional depreciation determination application to the CIR 5 . Sandwich panels form the core of the structural framework of the building; the building is constructed solely of interlocking sandwich panels without any other form of frame construction (steel, for instance) 19. As manufacturing techniques and sandwich panel quality has improved, sandwich panels are increasingly being used as unprotected cladding against external weather environments. This decreased use of the more conventional sheet-metal cladding has seen sandwich panels being used as the structural element, weather cladding and insulation of buildings. As the building is constructed solely from sandwich panels, the building comes within the asset class Buildings with prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels. Changing a depreciation rate 20. In limited circumstances a taxpayer can change the depreciation rate that they use to depreciate an item of depreciable property. For example, where the taxpayer has been using an incorrect rate. 21. For further guidance on changing to a different depreciation rate please refer to QB 15/03: Income tax – changing to a different depreciation rate for an item of depreciable property (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 4 (May 2015): 30) 6 . 5 An example of this occurring is described in Determination PROV 24: Provisional depreciation rate for mushroom factory building and plant. In that case the CIR accepted that the EUL of these specialised buildings was affected because they are exposed to a wet, humid and corrosive environment due to the material that is used in growing mushrooms and the environment that mushrooms need to grow successfully. 6 More information on QB 15/03 can be found at www.ird.govt.nz (search term “QB 15/03”).
Date of issue: 29 November 2017 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question 1. Where a person owns an asset and contributes that asset to a partnership as a capital contribution, does the person dispose of:  the entire asset (full disposal); or  only part of the asset, because the person, in their capacity as a partner of the partnership, has an interest in the asset, under s HG 2, proportionate to the person’s partnership share (partial disposal)? Answer 2. There is a full disposal of the asset. 3. In summary, this is because:  Neither s HG 2 nor any other provision in the Act specifies or determines whether there is a full or partial disposal where a person contributes an asset to a partnership as a capital contribution. In the absence of any applicable provision in the Act, the answer is determined under partnership law and the general law.  Where a person contributes an asset to a general partnership, the legal ownership of the asset and the person’s interest in the asset fundamentally change. Before disposal, the person is the sole owner of the asset. Following disposal, the asset ceases to be the person’s property. The asset belongs to the partners of the partnership as joint owners and is partnership property. The person and their co- partners each have a beneficial interest in the whole of the asset, and the asset, as partnership property, must be used exclusively for the purposes of the partnership. There has been a disposal of the asset by its sole owner to joint owners.  Where a person contributes an asset to a limited partnership, the person has fully disposed of the asset to a separate legal person who has not held any previous interest in the asset. 4. This means, for example, that where the asset disposed of is either depreciable property or revenue account property (which includes trading stock) for the person, the person may have an amount of depreciation recovery income or depreciation loss, or income or loss, calculated on the basis that the person has fully disposed of the asset. QB 17/09 Is there a full or partial disposal when an asset is contributed to a partnership as a capital contribution? QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This QWBA is about whether there is a full or partial disposal of an asset where a person contributes an asset to a general or limited partnership as a capital contribution. Where the asset disposed of is, for example, depreciable property or revenue account property the disposal may result in income or loss for the person who disposed of the asset. Whether there is a full or partial disposal is relevant to the amount of income or loss the person may have from contributing the asset to the partnership. Key provision Section HG 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. QB 17/09: 29 November 2017 2 UNCLASSIFIED Explanation 5. Uncertainty exists about whether there is a full or partial disposal where a person contributes an asset, which is owned by the person, to a partnership as a capital contribution. The Commissioner has been asked to clarify her position on this question. 6. This item focuses on the income tax consequences for the person disposing of the asset to a partnership as a capital contribution. Meaning of “partnership” 7. For the purposes of the Act, the term “partnership” is defined in s YA 1 to mean:  the relationship that subsists between a group of 2 or more persons who carry on a business in common with a view to profit (a general partnership);  a limited partnership registered under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 (limited partnership);  a joint venture, if the venturers all choose to be treated as a partnership for the purposes of the Act and the Tax Administration Act 1994;  co-owners of property if the co-owners all choose to be treated as a partnership for the purposes of the Act and the Tax Administration Act 1994, provided the co- owners are not co-owners only because they are shareholders of the same company, or settlors, trustees, or beneficiaries of the same trust. 8. A listed limited partnership, which is an entity or group of persons that is listed on a recognised exchange, is a company, and not a partnership, for the purposes of the Act: s YA 1 definitions of “company” and “listed limited partnership”. 9. This item considers whether there has been a full or partial disposal where a person contributes an asset to a general partnership or limited partnership as a capital contribution. It is outside the scope of this item to consider the full or partial disposal question in relation to either joint venturers or the co-owners of property. Taxation of partnerships under the Act 10. Sections HG 2 to HG 12 of the Act contain rules concerning the taxation of partnerships. 11. Section HG 2(1) provides that a partnership is transparent and is “looked through” in accordance with a partner’s partnership share – that is, for a particular right, obligation, or other property, status or thing, the share that a partner has in the partnership: s YA 1 definition of “partnership share”. 12. More specifically, s HG 2(1) provides that for the purposes of a partner’s liabilities and obligations under the Act, in their capacity as partner of a partnership, the partner is treated, unless the context requires otherwise, as:  carrying on an activity carried on by the partnership and having a status, intention and purpose of the partnership, and the partnership is treated as not carrying on the activity or having the status, intention, or purpose (s HG 2(1)(a)); and  holding property that a partnership holds, as being party to an arrangement to which the partnership is a party, and as doing a thing and being entitled to a thing that the partnership does or is entitled to in proportion to the partner’s partnership share, and the partnership is treated as not holding the property, being a party to the arrangement, and not doing the thing or being entitled to the thing (s HG 2(1)(b)–(d)). 13. It has been suggested that s HG 2(1) has the effect that where a person, in their non- partner capacity, disposes of an asset to a partnership as a capital contribution, the QB 17/09: 29 November 2017 3 UNCLASSIFIED person disposes of only part of the asset because following the disposal, the person, in their capacity as partner, is treated as holding the asset in proportion to their partnership share. 14. The Commissioner’s view is that s HG 2(1) is not directly relevant to whether there is a full or partial disposal because:  The rules in s HG 2(1) apply for the purposes of determining a partner’s liabilities and obligations under the Act in their capacity as partner of a partnership.  The income tax consequences for a person disposing of an asset to a partnership as a capital contribution arise in the person’s non-partner capacity (as transferor of the asset) and do not arise in the person’s capacity as a partner of the partnership.  Any income tax consequences on the disposal cannot give rise to partnership income or loss because the partnership is acquiring, and not disposing of, the asset. 15. The Commissioner is aware that it has been suggested that the full disposal approach ignores the wording of s HG 2(1) and that the section can be interpreted as a broader statement of transparency that applies to a person in their non-partner capacity. The Commissioner considers:  These views disregard the literal wording of s HG 2(1), which explicitly states that the rules in s HG 2(1) apply to a partner “in their capacity of partner of a partnership”. These words are unambiguous and explicitly provide that a person who is a partner of a partnership may have liabilities and obligations under the Act in both their partner and non-partner capacities.  The literal wording of s HG 2(1) does not state that there is no disposal of that part of the asset that is treated as being held by the partner that contributed the asset. And nor does it state that the part of the asset that is treated as being held by the partner is to be disregarded in determining the partner’s liabilities and obligations, in their non-partner capacity, in relation to their disposal of the asset. 16. The Commissioner also notes s HG 2(1)(b) provides that the “partner is treated as holding property that a partnership holds, in proportion to the partner’s partnership share”. The Commissioner considers that this look-through proportional holding of property rule applies only to “partnership property”, which requires at law (and logically) a transfer of all of the beneficial and / or legal interests in the property to the partnership. Under the partial disposal approach, however, it is said that only part of the asset is disposed of by the person contributing the asset to the partnership. In the Commissioner’s view:  It is not possible for 100% of an asset to be partnership property and subject to s HG 2(1)(b) if only part of the asset has been disposed of to the partnership.  The underlying logic of the partial disposal approach appears to be as follows: o there is a full disposal of the asset so that s HG 2(1)(b) applies to the entire asset, with the consequence that the partners are treated as holding the asset in proportion to their partnership shares; and o the view that s HG 2(1)(b) then has the effect of recharacterising the full disposal as a partial disposal (in that there is no disposal to the extent of the contributor’s partnership share in the asset).  Section HG 2(1)(b), on its plain and ordinary meaning, does not have the effect of recharacterising a full disposal as a partial disposal. QB 17/09: 29 November 2017 4 UNCLASSIFIED 17. The Commissioner considers that ss HG 3 to HG 12 are also not relevant to the question considered in this item. This is because ss HG 3 to HG 10 concern the disposal of a partner’s interest in a partnership and the disposal of property that a partner is treated as holding and ss HG 11 and HG 12 contain rules that limit deductions by partners of limited partnerships. 18. Further, no provision in any other part of the Act specifically deals with whether there is a full or partial disposal where a person contributes an asset to a partnership as a capital contribution. Although the word “dispose” is defined in s YA 1 of the Act for the purposes of specific sections, none of these sections are relevant to the full or partial disposal question. In the absence of any applicable provision or definition in the Act, it is the Commissioner’s view that the answer must be determined under partnership law and general law. General partnerships 19. The Partnership Act 1908 applies to general partnerships. 20. A general partnership is an unincorporated body of persons. It has no separate legal personality of its own: R v Holden \[1912\] 1 KB 483; Meyer & Co v Faber (No 2) \[1923\] 2 Ch 421; and Laws of New Zealand Partnership and Joint Ventures (online ed) at \[6\]. Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are called collectively a “firm”: s 7 of the Partnership Act 1908. Every partner of a firm is liable jointly with the other partners of the firm for all debts and obligations of the partnership incurred while a partner: s 12 of the Partnership Act 1908. 21. Section 23 of the Partnership Act 1908 provides that “partnership property” includes all property and rights and interests in property originally brought into the partnership stock or acquired on account of the partnership or for the purposes and in the course of the partnership business. This section provides further that partnership property must be held and applied by the partners exclusively for the purposes of the partnership and in accordance with the partnership agreement. 22. Under partnership law, the following principles apply to partnership property:  A partner does not have title to specific partnership property but has a beneficial interest in the entirety of the partnership assets and in each and every particular asset of the partnership: Hadlee v CIR \[1991\] 3 NZLR 517 (CA) at 528; Hadlee v CIR \[1993\] 2 NZLR 385 (PC) at 388; and Lindley and Banks on Partnership (19th ed, Sweet & Maxwell, UK, 2010) at 19-08.  Subject to any express or implied agreement by the partners, all the partners of a general partnership have identical and equal interests in the partnership property: Lindley and Banks on Partnership (19th ed, Sweet & Maxwell, UK, 2010) at 19-04.  Legal title to partnership property may be held by one of the partners, some of the partners, or all of the partners. If the legal title to partnership property is vested in only some of the partners, they hold the relevant property as trustees for all of the partners: Lindley and Banks on Partnership (19th ed, Sweet & Maxwell, UK, 2010) at 19-07.  During the continuance of a partnership, the beneficial interest of a partner is in the nature of a future interest taking effect in possession on (and not before) the determination of the partnership (whether by a change in the membership or by general dissolution). This is because each partner is entitled to require the partnership property to be applied for the purposes of the partnership and no partner is entitled to use or enjoy their share of those assets to the exclusion of their co-partners: Lindley and Banks on Partnership (19th ed, Sweet & Maxwell, UK, 2010) at 19-08. QB 17/09: 29 November 2017 5 UNCLASSIFIED Limited partnerships 23. A limited partnership is a limited partnership registered under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008: s 6 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. 24. A limited partnership is a separate legal person: s 11 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. 25. A limited partnership must have at least one general partner and at least one limited partner, and a person may not be both a general partner and a limited partner of the same partnership: s 8 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. 26. Each general partner is jointly and severally liable with both the limited partnership and the other general partners for the unpaid debts and liabilities of the limited partnership: s 28 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. However, unless the partnership agreement provides otherwise, a general partner is liable for any debts or liabilities of the limited partnership only to the extent that the limited partnership cannot pay those debts or liabilities: s 28 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. 27. A limited partner who does not take part in the management of the limited partnership is not liable for the debts and liabilities of the limited partnership: s 31 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. Nature of the capital of a partnership and of a capital contribution 28. The capital of a partnership has the following three attributes:  The capital of a partnership is the aggregate of the sums contributed by its members for the purpose of commencing and carrying on the partnership business and intended to be risked by the members in that business.  The capital of a partnership is not the same as its property: the capital is a sum fixed by the agreement of the partners, while the actual assets of the partnership vary from day to day and include everything belonging to the partnership and having any monetary value.  Once a person has introduced an asset into a partnership as a capital contribution with an agreed ‘capital’ value in the partnership’s books, the asset ceases to be the person’s property and thereafter belongs to the partnership and is partnership property. The person ceases to have any beneficial interest in the asset which is qualitatively different to that of his, her, or its, co-partners. (See CIR v Dormer (1997) 18 NZTC 13,446 (HC) at 13,453; Bieber v Teathers Ltd (in liquidation) \[2012\] 2 BCLC 585 (Ch) at \[76\]; and Lindley and Banks on Partnership (19th ed, Sweet & Maxwell, UK, 2010) at 17-01, 17-02 and 18-37). 29. When an asset is contributed to a partnership as a capital contribution, its legal ownership and juristic character changes. Where the asset is contributed to a general partnership, the asset becomes property of the partnership and the partners become the joint legal owners of the whole asset. 30. This was explained by the English High Court in Bieber v Teathers Ltd in the context of contributions to general partnerships. Teathers was the promoter and managing partner of the Take 3 TV partnerships, which were commercially unsuccessful. Teathers had invited subscriptions from investors in an information memorandum and used the subscriptions to establish the partnerships. Investors claimed there had been a breach of trust by Teathers because it had not applied the subscriptions in accordance with criteria in the memorandum. The Court held there was a trust obligation, but the obligation had ended when the subscriptions were paid from a settlement account to the relevant partnership account. This was because the partnership deeds stated that the subscriptions were capital of the partnerships and on payment to the relevant QB 17/09: 29 November 2017 6 UNCLASSIFIED partnership account the subscriptions became capital of the partnership. The Court said at \[76\]: Of course, real money moved. It moved from the HSBC settlement account to the relevant Barclays partnership account. When that happened the legal ownership and juristic character of the money changed. It ceased to belong to Teathers and became the property of the partners. As is stated in Lindley & Banks on Partnership (19th edn) at 17–02: “... once a partner has brought in the asset and been credited with its agreed “capital” value in the firm’s books, the asset as such will cease to be his property and will thereafter belong to the firm ...” It belonged to the firm not in the sense that each partner individually owned that little bit of the Barclays partnership account which represented his payment, but in the sense that they were joint owners of the whole (just as they were jointly and severally liable on the account). By “joint owners” I do not mean that they were beneficial joint tenants or tenants in common. I mean that the partners together were joint legal owners and that each partner was entitled in equity to that floating and unascertainable share of the partnership property that would be determined only at dissolution. The money ceased to be money held by Teathers under an irrevocable offer ... \[and\] became a partnership asset to be dealt with under the terms of the partnership deed and s 20 of the Partnership Act 1890 \[a provision materially the same as s 23 of the Partnership Act 1908 (New Zealand)\]. \[Emphasis added\] 31. In dismissing an appeal by Teathers, the English Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that once the subscriptions had been paid into the relevant partnership account, the subscriptions belonged to the partnership and vested in the general partners as joint legal owners. Consequently, each investor’s beneficial ownership of his or her individual subscription ceased and was replaced with a right to participate in the profits of the partnership and in its net assets on dissolution: Bieber v Teathers Ltd (in liquidation) \[2013\] 1 BCLC 248 (CA) at \[59\]. Capital contributions to limited partnerships 32. The term “capital contribution” is defined in s 37 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. The definition provides that the capital contribution of a partner is the share of the assets contributed, or agreed to be contributed, by a partner to the limited partnership or assigned to a partner by another partner and may take any form and may be made on terms (if any) provided in the partnership agreement. 33. Section 38 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 provides that the partnership interest of a partner is the partner’s share of the assets of the limited partnership, the partner’s right to receive distributions from the limited partnership, and the partner’s right to any other benefit conferred by the partnership agreement and includes any liability or other burden of the partner in relation to the limited partnership. Since a limited partnership is a separate legal person, a partner’s share of the assets of a limited partnership is only a notional share because the assets are owned by the limited partnership: Laws of New Zealand Limited Partnerships (online ed) at \[17\]. 34. It is the Commissioner’s view that the answer to the question as to whether there is a full or partial disposal where a person contributes an asset to a limited partnership as a capital contribution is that there is a full disposal of the asset. This is because the person contributing the asset and the limited partnership are each a separate legal person. Further, there is no continuity of interest because the limited partnership has not owned any previous interest in the asset. 35. The Commissioner considers that the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in Edenvale Restoration Specialists Ltd v British Columbia 2013 BCCA 85 supports her view. The issue in Edenvale concerned the amount of tax payable under the Social Service Tax Act, RSBC, 1996, on the purchase of property by a limited QB 17/09: 29 November 2017 7 UNCLASSIFIED partnership, which had paid the purchase price, in part, by issuing the vendor with units in the limited partnership representing 15% of the total units in the partnership. Under the Ontario Limited Partnership Act 1990 a limited partnership is not a separate legal person and the plaintiff contended, on the basis of Seven Mile Dam Contractors v British Columbia (1979) 104 DLR (3d) 274 (SC), which is discussed later in this item, that tax was payable on 85%, not 100%, of the transferred property. The Court rejected that contention and distinguished Seven Mile. The Court held that under the partnership agreement, and on the facts, that it was the general partner, a limited liability entity, that was the purchaser of the property. Consequently, the general partner, as purchaser, was required to pay tax on 100% of the purchase price of the property because it had not previously owned any interest in the property. Alternative arguments Common law principle that a person cannot dispose of property to themselves 36. Under common law, a person cannot convey or dispose of property to themselves or contract with themselves: Rye v Rye \[1962\] AC 496 (HL); Ellis v Kerr \[1910\] 1 Ch 529; Napier v Williams \[1911\] 1 Ch 361; De Tastet v Shaw (1818) 1 B & Ald 664. 37. It has been suggested that the general law principle that a person cannot dispose of property to themselves applies where a person contributes an asset to a general partnership, with the consequence that there is only a partial disposal of the asset to the partners who had no prior interest in the asset. 38. It is the Commissioner’s view that the potential application of this general law principle cannot arise in the context of the contribution of an asset to a limited partnership as a capital contribution. This is because the disposal of the asset is from one separate legal person to another and, therefore, there is no disposal of property from a person to themselves. 39. In the context of general partnerships, it is the Commissioner’s view that this general law principle has no application because s 56 of the Property Law Act 2007 abrogates the general law principle that a person cannot dispose of property to themselves. Section 56 of the Property Law Act 2007 provides that a person may dispose of an estate or interest in property to themselves, alone or jointly with some other person, and that such a disposition is enforceable in the same manner as a disposition to another person. The Property Law Act 2007 applies to property to the extent that the law of New Zealand applies to the property, unless a provision of the Property Law Act 2007 is inconsistent with a provision in another enactment, in which case the provision in the other enactment prevails: s 8(1), (2) and (4) of the Property Law Act 2007. 40. For the purposes of the Property Law Act 2007, “disposition” includes any sale, transfer, exchange, or assignment, and includes the creation of any interest in property: s 4 of the Property Law Act 2007. Where a person contributes an asset to a partnership as a capital contribution, the contribution is a valid and enforceable disposition. This is because there is a transfer of the asset from the person, as owner, to the partners, as joint owners and, further, because the contribution involves the creation of beneficial interests: s 56 of the Property Law Act 2007. 41. The Commissioner also notes, for completeness, that it is well-settled law that the principle that a person cannot dispose of property to themselves is in any event qualified for income tax purposes. For example, it is settled law that where a taxpayer transfers an asset from a (taxable) trading account to a (non-taxable) private account, or vice versa, the taxpayer is treated as disposing of, or acquiring, the asset for market value: Sharkey (Inspector of Taxes) v Wernher \[1955\] 3 All ER 493 (HL); Bernard Elsey Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1969) 121 CLR 119 (HCA); Case A27 (1974) 1 NZTC 60,245; and CIR v Farmers’ Trading Co Ltd \[1982\] 1 NZLR 449 (CA). QB 17/09: 29 November 2017 8 UNCLASSIFIED The common law mutuality principle 42. The common law mutuality principle provides that a person cannot make a profit from trading with themselves. The application of the principle generally arises in the context of co-operative type associations, where both mutuality and transactions of a mutual character are present – that is, the collective dealing of the members of the association as a group and individual dealings of members with the group for their mutual benefit. In the context of a group of persons, the essence of the principle “is an association of persons who have joined together not for trade or profit but to achieve through their mutual contributions a common end or benefit in which all members participate or are entitled to participate”. 43. The Commissioner’s view is that the mutuality principle has no application to the full or partial disposal question. This is because:  A partnership is the relation that subsists between persons carrying on business in common with a view to profit. Consequently, mutuality, which requires persons to associate not for trade or profit but for a common end or benefit, is not present in a partnership.  The contribution of an asset to a partnership as a capital contribution is not a mutual transaction because the contributor is not making the contribution in their capacity as a member of the partnership. Rose, Neil, and Seven Mile 44. The Commissioner is aware of the view that Rose v FCT \[1951\] 84 CLR 118 (HCA), Neil v Inland Revenue Commissioner (NZ) (1967) 14 ATD 509 and Seven Mile support the partial disposal approach. However, the Commissioner considers, for the reasons mentioned below, that these cases are not determinative of the full or partial disposal issue in the New Zealand context. Rose 45. In Rose, the High Court of Australia was concerned with ss 36(1) and 59(2) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936–48 (ITAA 36) (which respectively applied where a taxpayer “disposed of” trading stock and depreciable property) and whether, for the purposes of those sections, there had been a full, a partial or no disposal of assets. The taxpayer had introduced, as a capital contribution, assets, including livestock, plant and machinery, of his existing grazing business to a general partnership, comprised of the taxpayer and his two sons. The Court at pg 123 expressed the issue as whether: the transmutation of the property in the assets from the sole property of the taxpayer to the co-ownership of him and his two sons as partners in equal shares involve\[d\] a disposal of the livestock and of the depreciable property for the purposes of \[ss\] 36(1) and 59(2) respectively. 46. The Court said that the resolution of the issue depended on the meaning of the expression “disposed of” in each section. It considered that each section was directed at the disposal of the “entirety of ownership in the assets and not the conversion of single ownership into collective ownership” or the creation or transfer of an undivided share or fractional interest in the assets: Rose at 124. The Court held that the investing of the property in the assets in the three partners did not involve a disposition of the assets within the meaning of ss 36(1) and 59(2) of the ITAA 36. This was because the taxpayer, as partner, retained an interest in the assets. Therefore, the taxpayer had not disposed of the entirety of the property in the assets. 47. It is the Commissioner’s view that Rose does not assist in answering the question considered in this item. This is because Rose is limited to its specific statutory context QB 17/09: 29 November 2017 9 UNCLASSIFIED and stands as authority only for the meaning of the words “disposed of” in ss 36(1) and 59(2) of the ITAA 36. Further, Rose contains no detailed analysis on the nature of the capital of a partnership or on how the ownership, juristic character, and a person’s interest in an asset will fundamentally change when a person introduces an asset to a partnership as a capital contribution. Neil 48. The reasoning of Rose was applied in New Zealand in Neil, a case in which the taxpayer and his brother owned, in equal shares, livestock used in a farming business and where the taxpayer sold his half interest to his brother. The issue was whether the taxpayer had assessable income from the sale of his half-interest in the livestock under s 98(7) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954, a section materially similar in wording to s 36(1) of the ITAA 36. 49. The Court considered that the reasoning in Rose applied because of the similarity of the material words in s 36(1) of the ITAA 36 and s 98(7) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954, despite the fact that Rose concerned a disposal from single ownership into collective ownership and Neil concerned a disposal in the opposite direction. The Court held that s 98(7) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 did not apply because that section applied to the disposal of only “trading stock” and not to a disposal of a share or an interest in trading stock. The Court also considered that the amendment in 1966 of s 98(7) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 so that it applied to the disposal of a share or an interest in trading stock indicated that the section, as it stood at the time of the taxpayer’s sale of his half-interest, did not apply to a sale of a fractional share in trading stock. 50. The Commissioner considers that Neil does not assist in answering the full or partial disposal question considered in this item. This is because, firstly, since the taxpayer disposed of a half interest, the issue of whether there had been a full or partial disposal of the asset was not (and, on the facts, could not be) in issue. Secondly, like Rose, Neil is limited to its specific statutory context, which the Court held required a disposal of the whole asset for the provision in issue to apply. Thirdly, also like Rose, Neil contains no detailed analysis on the nature of the capital of a partnership or on how the ownership, juristic character, and a person’s interest in an asset all fundamentally change when a person introduces an asset to a partnership as a capital contribution. Fourthly, it did not involve the disposal of an asset to a partnership as a capital contribution. 51. For completeness, the Commissioner notes that it is her view that neither s EB 24 (the provision in the Act that corresponds to s 98(7) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 as amended) or s EE 2 of the Act are relevant to the question considered in this item. Although these provisions provide that the trading stock and depreciation rules apply to the disposal of a share or interest in trading stock or depreciable property that is co- owned, these sections do not answer or inform the question of whether there has been a full or partial disposal where an asset is contributed by a person to a partnership as a capital contribution. Seven Mile 52. In Seven Mile, the Supreme Court of British Columbia held that there was a partial disposal, for the purposes of the Social Services Tax Act, RSBC, 1960, where a vendor general partnership had sold assets to a purchaser general partnership in which the vendor partnership held a 50% partnership share. On appeal, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia affirmed the decision of the Supreme Court: Seven Mile Dam Contractors v British Columbia (1980) 116 DLR (3d) 398. 53. The Commissioner acknowledges that Seven Mile could possibly be viewed as providing some support for the partial disposal view where an asset is contributed to a general QB 17/09: 29 November 2017 10 UNCLASSIFIED partnership. However, it is the Commissioner’s view that Seven Mile provides no real assistance to resolving the full or partial disposal issue in a New Zealand context. This is because Seven Mile, like Rose and Neil, contains no detailed analysis on the nature of the capital of a partnership or on how the ownership, juristic character, and a person’s interest in an asset all fundamentally change when a person introduces an asset to a partnership as a capital contribution. Other considerations 54. It is the Commissioner’s view that the full disposal approach produces outcomes that are sensible and workable, which is in contrast to the logical challenges and compliance issues that arise under the partial disposal approach. 55. The Commissioner observes that the partial disposal approach appears to give rise to an inherent inconsistency since, under this approach, only part of an asset is disposed of, but, nonetheless, the whole of the asset is treated as partnership property. It is difficult to understand how, on the one hand, the partners hold, as joint owners, 100% of the whole asset as partnership property when, on the other hand, the person has disposed of only part of the asset. If the person has not disposed of part of the asset (in the sense of creating beneficial interests in the asset), it would appear that the partners can have no joint beneficial ownership interest in that part of the asset that the person has not disposed of. The Commissioner notes that this inconsistency does not arise under the full disposal approach. Furthermore, the Commissioner notes that the partial disposal view is inconsistent with how partnerships actually, in practice, treat assets that have been contributed as capital contributions – that is to say, as having been fully disposed of to the partnership with the effect that the entire asset is treated as partnership property. This can lead to schematic issues in relation to how the rules in subpart HG in the Act are intended to work. For example, where the asset that is ‘partially’ contributed is revenue account property for the contributor and is held by the partnership on capital account and the partnership treats the entire asset as partnership property. 56. The Commissioner is also aware that the partial disposal approach can, in practice, give rise to non-compliance. This occurs where the contributor of the asset overlooks the obligation to account for tax on the part of the asset they have treated, for tax purposes, as being retained by them when the asset is subsequently disposed of by the partnership. Conclusion – there is full disposal when an asset is contributed to a partnership as a capital contribution 57. It is the Commissioner’s view that where a person owns an asset and contributes that asset to a general partnership or to a limited partnership as a capital contribution, there is a full disposal of the asset by the person to the partnership under partnership law and general law. 58. Where the asset is contributed to a general partnership, this is because:  Neither s HG 2 nor any other provision in the Act applies to determine whether there is a full or partial disposal, so partnership law and the general law apply to determine the issue.  The legal ownership of the asset, its juristic character, and the person’s interest in the asset, all fundamentally change.  Before disposal, the person is the owner of the asset.  Once the person has introduced an asset into a partnership as a capital contribution, the asset ceases to be the person’s property. It belongs to the partners of the partnership and becomes partnership property. QB 17/09: 29 November 2017 11 UNCLASSIFIED  The asset belongs to the partnership - not in the sense that each partner individually owns a separately identifiable part of the asset, but in the sense that the partners are the joint owners of the whole asset.  Following disposal, the person ceases to have any beneficial interest in the asset that is qualitatively different to that of the person’s co-partners, and the asset must be used by the partners exclusively for the purposes of the partnership.  A disposal of property by a person to themselves, alone or jointly, is valid and enforceable.  There has been a disposal of the whole asset by its sole owner to joint owners. 59. Where the asset is contributed to a limited partnership, this is because:  Neither s HG 2 nor any other provision in the Act applies to determine whether there is a full or partial disposal, so partnership law and the general law apply to determine the issue.  There has been a disposal of the asset from one separate legal person, the person who owned the asset, to another separate legal person, the limited partnership.  The limited partnership, as a separate legal person, has not held any interest in the asset before the disposal of the asset to it. Example The following example is included to assist in explaining the application of the law. 60. James has been carrying on business as an owner–driver for a logistics company. He purchased a truck for $150,000, which he has been using in his business. His friend Fiona has identified a business opportunity in the logistics market, so she and James have formed a general partnership to carry on a logistics business. They have agreed that James will contribute his truck, which has a current market value of $125,000 and a book value of $100,000, as his capital contribution to the partnership, and Fiona will contribute $125,000 in cash as her capital contribution to the partnership. 61. In the income tax year that James contributes his truck to the partnership, he will have depreciation recovery income of $25,000 because he has fully disposed of his interest in the truck. James now owns the truck in partnership with Fiona, and the truck has ceased to be his property. As partnership property, the truck must be used for the business of the partnership. 62. If James and Fiona had established a limited partnership, instead of a general partnership, the same depreciation outcome would arise for James. This is because James would have fully disposed of the truck to the limited partnership, a separate legal person to James, and the limited partnership, as the new owner of the truck, would not have owned any previous interest in the truck.

Date of issue: 20 December 2017 1 Unclassified Question What is the income tax treatment of a group insurance policy that has all the following features?  The policy owner is the employer.  The employer pays the premium.  The insured persons are the employees of the employer.  The employer holds the insurance policy for the benefit of the employees of the employer.  The insurance is term life cover, accident/medical cover, or both.  The risk insured against is the death, permanent disablement, accident, disease or sickness of the employee(s).  The claim amount will either be paid to the employer by the insurer on the happening of the relevant event (death or accident or medical event), and then passed on to the relevant employee (or their estate), or paid directly to the employee at the direction of the employer. Answer The employer will generally be entitled to a deduction for the premiums paid. The premiums paid will be subject to fringe benefit tax (FBT). Amounts paid out under the group insurance policy will not be income of the employer. QB 17/10 Income tax and fringe benefit tax – Insurance – Group insurance policy taken out by employer for the benefit of an employee QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) considers the income tax and fringe benefit tax treatment of group insurance policies taken out by an employer for the benefit of its employees. This insurance may be term life cover, accident/medical cover, or both. To the extent that policies contain income protection insurance, which may be included in some personal accident/medical insurance policies, they are not considered. Key provision ss CA 1, CX 2, CX 16, CX 37, DA 1 and DA 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Key terms in this item FBT Fringe benefit Insurance QB 17/10: 20 December 2017 2 Unclassified Lump sums paid out on death under a term life insurance policy will not be taxable income of the employee (or the employee’s estate). Amounts paid out (or that an employee is otherwise entitled to) under accident/medical cover policies will be income of the employee only if they are income under ordinary concepts (s CA 1(2)). Amounts that are not income under ordinary concepts will not be subject to tax. Amounts that are income under ordinary concepts may be exempt income under s CW 34 if they are paid to a person because they (or another person) are incapacitated for work and the payment is not calculated according to loss of earnings. Explanation 1. During a review of all Public Information Bulletins (see http://www.ird.govt.nz/technical- tax/pib-review/), two items on the income tax treatment of insurance in an employment context were identified as being out of date. The two items are “Staff insurance schemes” (Public Information Bulletin No 70 (December 1972): 11) and “Life and accident insurance policies” (Public Information Bulletin No 106 (July 1980): 2). Those PIBs covered a number of different scenarios. We have replaced the PIBs with a series of QWBAs covering common scenarios. 2. This QWBA considers group insurance policies with the features listed in the Question above. References in this QWBA to group insurance policies taken out for the benefit of employees also refer to policies taken out where the insured person is an employee’s spouse, civil union partner, de facto partner, or child. 3. Term (or temporary) life insurance pays out the sum insured (as a lump sum) if the life insured dies during the term of the policy. Many different types of insurance policies could be accident/medical insurance (or could include an element of accident/medical insurance). These include medical insurance, income protection insurance, accident insurance, and trauma or critical illness policies. This QWBA does not consider policies to the extent that they provide income protection insurance. Pay outs under these insurance policies can be periodic or lump sum and can be calculated in a variety of ways. Where a policy provides multiple types of cover, it may be necessary to apportion the claim proceeds. 4. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless stated otherwise. Deductibility of premiums for employer 5. A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent that it is incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable (and/or excluded) income (s DA 1). Section DA 2 sets out some limitations on deductibility. For example, expenditure that is capital in nature, or expenditure incurred in deriving exempt income, is not deductible (s DA 2(1) and (3)). 6. In most cases, salary and wage costs will be deductible because they will satisfy the nexus test in s DA 1 and none of the general limitations will apply. The payment of a premium for a group insurance policy that is paid in connection with the employees’ employment is a business cost just like salary or wages. Therefore, provided the costs of an employee’s salary or wages are deductible, the costs of paying the insurance premiums will be too. When amount of premium is subject to FBT 7. Under s CX 2, a “fringe benefit” is a “benefit” that is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment (s CX 2(1)(a)), and is either one of the specified benefits listed in ss CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, or CX 12 to CX 16, or is an unclassified benefit under s CX 37 (s CX 2(1)(b)). Some benefits are excluded from being fringe benefits by specific provisions in subpart CX (see s CX 2(1)(c)). Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether a QB 17/10: 20 December 2017 3 Unclassified “benefit”, that is either a specified benefit or an unclassified benefit, arises for employees when an employer takes out a group insurance policy, and whether any of the exclusions apply. 8. Where an employer takes out a group insurance policy with the intention of holding it for the benefit of the relevant employees (or their estates) such that the employees have an enforceable right to the claim amount, the Commissioner’s view is that a trust relationship will arise. The employer is the trustee, and the employer holds the group insurance policy for the employees, who are the beneficiaries. Employers commonly use group insurance policies in this way to attract and retain employees. Information about the insurance is often, but not always, made available to employees. 9. The Commissioner’s view is that the provision of the group insurance policy in this situation is a “benefit” to the employees. It provides an economic advantage to the employees as it gives them benefits (coverage under the policy) to which they would otherwise not be entitled. 10. The only potentially relevant specific provision is s CX 16. Section CX 16 applies when an employer pays a “specified insurance premium” or makes a contribution to the insurance fund of a friendly society for the benefit of an employee (s CX 16(1)). “Specified insurance premium” is defined in s CX 16(3) as follows: Meaning of specified insurance premium (3) In this section, specified insurance premium means a premium paid for the benefit of an employee on an insurance policy to the extent to which the insurance policy is for— (a) life insurance under section EY 8 (Meaning of life insurance) on the life of the employee or their spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner, or on their joint lives, or on the life of their child: (b) accident or medical insurance referred to in section EY 8(3) on the life of the employee or their spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner, or on their joint lives, or on the life of their child: (c) insurance against accident, disease, or sickness, whether fatal or not, suffered by the employee, their spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner, or their child. 11. The Commissioner considers that most group insurance policies will fit within the requirements of s CX 16(3). On this basis, the payment of the premium will be a fringe benefit under s CX 16. However, if a group insurance policy does not come within s CX 16, it will still be an unclassified benefit under s CX 37. Section CX 37 applies to benefits that an employer provides to an employee in connection with their employment that are not covered and are not excluded by a more specific provision. 12. The only potentially relevant FBT exclusion in subpart CX is s CX 31, which deals with income protection insurance. This QWBA does not consider income protection insurance. On that basis, this exclusion will not apply. 13. Therefore, provided the group insurance policy is provided in connection with an employee’s employment, the provision of a group insurance policy in the situation covered by this QWBA will satisfy the requirements of s CX 2, and there will be a “fringe benefit”. As a result, the employer will be liable for FBT on the premiums paid. Income tax treatment of proceeds – employer 14. Where the employer holds the group insurance policy on trust for the employees, the relevant employee beneficiary will have an absolute entitlement to any claim proceeds, such that those proceeds will vest in the employee. As the employer does not receive the claim proceeds for the employer’s benefit, those claim proceeds cannot be income of the employer. QB 17/10: 20 December 2017 4 Unclassified Income tax treatment of proceeds – employee 15. Whether a payment made under an insurance policy is taxable will depend on what it is paid for. Some payments will not be income (under a specific provision or ordinary concepts) and, therefore, will not be taxable. Payments that are “income” may be either assessable or exempt income depending on the circumstances. The following discussion is intended to help decide how a payment under an insurance policy should be treated. 16. There are no specific provisions that apply to make payments under term life or accident/medical insurance policies income. Therefore, payments under these policies will be income only if they are income under ordinary concepts (s CA 1(2)). 17. Whether a payment under an insurance policy is income or not will depend on the relationship between the payer and the recipient and the purpose of the payment (Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176). Where a payment is made to replace income which the recipient would otherwise have earned or where the purpose of the payments is to provide the recipient with amounts to meet their living expenses, the payments are likely to be income. Payments that are regular or recurring are much more likely to be income (Reid). However, a one-off payment may still be income (FCT v Hyteco Hiring Pty Ltd 92 ATC 4,694). 18. Therefore, the payments that are most likely to be income are payments that are intended to compensate an insured person for lost income (whether periodic, or lump sum) and other regular or periodic payments intended to help the insured person meet their living expenses. Other lump sum and reimbursing payments are unlikely to be income (for example, a lump sum payment made under a term life policy, or a payment reimbursing medical expenses). 19. Payments that are not “income” will not be taxable. If a payment is “income”, it is necessary to consider whether it is assessable income or exempt income. 20. The relevant exemption provision is s CW 34. A payment made to a person because they (or another person) are incapacitated for work will be exempt under s CW 34 if it is a payment by a friendly society, or a payment of income made under a policy of personal sickness or accident insurance and the payment is not calculated according to loss of earnings. If the payment does not meet these criteria, it will be assessable income. 21. The Commissioner considers that it will be rare for payments received by employees under a policy of the type considered by this QWBA to be “income” but not subject to the exemption in s CW 34. 22. Payments received for a claim under an insurance policy will not be subject to FBT. 23. The following examples are included to help explain the application of the law. QB 17/10: 20 December 2017 5 Unclassified Example 1 – Term life cover Judith’s employer takes out a group term life insurance policy with the lives insured being the employer’s senior employees. Judith is one of the senior employees covered by the policy. The employer intends that the policy will be held for the benefit of the employees. The senior employees are informed about the existence of the policy, and their entitlements under the policy, in their “Employee Welcome Pack”. There is also a page on the employer’s intranet that discusses the entitlements of the senior employees under the group insurance policy. Judith’s employer is allowed a deduction for the premiums. The premiums are subject to FBT because a fringe benefit arises under s CX 16. Judith contracts a terminal illness that is covered by the group insurance policy. Judith’s employer receives a $200,000 payment under the policy, which it passes on to Judith. The $200,000 payment is not income of the employer. The employer only receives this amount as trustee for Judith. The $200,000 is also not income for Judith. The amount is not income under ordinary concepts. It is a one-off payment. Also, it is not paid to compensate Judith for lost income. Example 2 – Accident cover Bill’s employer takes out a group accident/medical insurance policy with the lives insured being the employer’s employees. The employer intends that the policy will be held for the benefit of the employees. This is demonstrated by the fact that the policy documents indicate that it is for the benefit of the employees. In addition, the terms of the policy allow the employees to elect to have additional voluntary cover, and to transfer the cover should the employee leave their employment. Bill’s employer is allowed a deduction for the premiums. The premiums are subject to FBT because a fringe benefit arises under s CX 16. Bill suffers an accident where he breaks his leg and has to undergo various medical procedures. Bill’s employer receives a $1,000 payment, which it passes on to Bill as a reimbursement for Bill’s medical expenses. The $1,000 is not income of the employer. The employer only receives this amount as trustee for Bill. The $1,000 is also not income for Bill. The amount is not income under ordinary concepts. It is a one-off payment. Also, it is not paid to compensate Bill for lost income.

Date of issue: 31 January 2018 Unclassified 1 Question Can a fit-out of an existing building be “ improvements” for the purposes of s CB 11? Answer Yes. A person in the business of erecting buildings (or associated with such a person) who does a fit-out of an existing building, and later sells that building, may be required to pay tax on the net proceeds of the sale under s CB 11. Explanation 1. Under s CB 11, a person in the business of erecting buildings who makes “improvements” to land and then sells that land within 10 years of completing the “improvements”, is liable for income tax on the net sale proceeds. It is irrelevant whether the land was acquired for the purpose of the person’s business of erecting buildings. 2. Section CB 11 also applies in the same way to a person who is not in the business of erecting buildings themselves, but is associated with someone in the business of erecting buildings. Further information on the “associated persons” rules can be found in “New Definitions of ‘Associated Persons’”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 21, No 8, Pt II (October/November 2009): 75–93. 3. Section CB 11 provides: CB 11 Disposal within 10 years of improvement: building business Income (1) An amount that a person derives from disposing of land is income of the person if— (a) they dispose of the land within 10 years of completing improvements to it; and (b) at the time they began the improvements, they carried on a business of erecting buildings, whether or not the land was acquired for the purpose of the business. QB 18/01 Can a fit-out of an existing building be “improvements” for the purposes of s CB 11? QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED Unexpected tax consequences may result from the sale of an investment property for people who complete a fit-out of their property where they are in the business of erecting buildings, or are associated with someone in that business. Key provision Section CB 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Key terms in this item “Improvements”, for the purposes of s CB 11, is defined as being improvements to land that are not minor and are made by a person, or an associated person, erecting a building or otherwise. Unclassified 2 Income: associated person in business of erecting buildings (2) An amount that a person (person A) derives from disposing of land within 10 years of completing improvements on it is income of person A if another person (person B) associated with person A at the time the improvements were begun carried on a business of erecting buildings, whether or not— (a) person A carried on a business of erecting buildings; or (b) the land was acquired for the purpose of person B’s business. Exclusions (3) Subsection (2) is overridden by the exclusion for bodies controlled by a local authority in section CB 15C and subsections (1) and (2) are overridden by the exclusions for residential land in section CB 16 and for business premises in section CB 19. 4. Subsection (1) applies to persons in the business of erecting buildings and subs (2) applies to landowners who are associated with a person in the business of erecting buildings. While there are some exclusions in s CB 11(3) for council-controlled organisations and for residential land and business premises, these are not covered in this item. The key requirement for triggering the section is that the landowner made “improvements”. The definition of “improvements” 5. For the purposes of s CB 11, the term “improvements” is defined under s YA 1 as: improvements, in ... CB 11 (Disposal within 10 years of improvement: building business), means improvements to land that— (a) are not minor; and (b) are made— (i) by a person erecting a building or otherwise; or (ii) by an associated person erecting a building or otherwise \[Emphasis added\] 6. There are three main criteria that need to be satisfied in the definition of “improvements”: improvements to land that are not minor and are made by a person erecting a building or otherwise. 7. The term “improvements” used in the context of s CB 11 should not be confused with the term “improvement” defined under s EE 67 for the purposes of the depreciation rules. Improvements to land 8. “Improvements” under s YA 1 must be improvements to land. Based on case law, improvements to land include any work or operations done to land that enhance the value of that land (Case L43 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,262; Morrison v Federal Commissioner of Land Tax (1914) 17 CLR 498). 9. Improvements to land will often involve work or operations that add something to land, for example, the construction of a house. However, improvements to land can also involve the removal of something previously attached to land, for example, the removal of an unsafe building from land enhancing the value of that land (Morrison v Federal Commissioner of Land Tax; McGeoch v Federal Commissioner of Land Tax (1929) 43 CLR 277). 10. Work done to a building may be improvements to land to the extent that it involves adding fixtures or making structural changes to the building. This is because legally, a building and its fixtures are considered part of the land to which they are attached. This long-standing principle of land law is summarised in Hinde, McMorland & Sim Land Law in New Zealand (online looseleaf ed, LexisNexis, accessed 8 September 2017) at \[6.036\]: ... whatever is affixed to the soil, belongs to the soil. Thus buildings erected on land and items permanently attached to the buildings become fixtures and a part of the land itself. Unclassified 3 11. In most instances, building fixtures will be those items permanently attached to a building. In the context of a fit-out of an existing building, it is unlikely that items not permanently attached to the building would be classified as fixtures. Therefore, to the extent that a fit-out of an existing building involves the addition and/or removal of fixtures enhancing the value of the building, the fit-out will be improvements to the land on which the building is built. 12. However, where the work done to a building is repairs and maintenance, it is not considered to be improvements to land for the purposes of s CB 11. Interpretation Statement IS 12/03: “Income Tax – Deductibility of Repairs and Maintenance: Expenditure – General Principles” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24 No 7 (August 2012): 68-105) sets out the approach for determining whether work is repairs and maintenance or a capital improvement. “Erecting a building or otherwise” 13. Under s YA 1, “improvements” means “improvements to land ... made by a person \[or an associated person\] erecting a building or otherwise”. The words “improvements to land ... made by a person erecting a building” provide an example of the most common type of improvements to land, the erecting of a building. However, the words “or otherwise” make it clear that the erecting of a building is not the only improvements to land that can meet the definition of “improvements”, and that any other improvements to land can also be included. This wide interpretation is consistent with the common law and the legislative history of s CB 11. 14. Before being rewritten in its current form, the definition of “improvements”, most recently contained in s CD 1(2)(d) of the Income Tax Act 1994, was worded as “any improvements ... to that land (whether by way of erecting a building or otherwise)”. This earlier wording highlights that any improvements to land can be “improvements”. The current definition of “improvements” under s YA 1 (and s OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 before it) was intended to have the same effect as the wording of the definition in s CD 1(2)(d) of the Income Tax Act 1994. “Not minor” 15. Even where improvements to land have been made by a person (or an associated person) erecting a building or otherwise, they will only be “improvements” for the purposes of s CB 11 if they are “not minor”. 16. The meaning of “not minor” has previously been considered in Interpretation Guideline IG0010 “Work of a Minor Nature”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 1 (February 2005): 5– 23 (IG0010). IG0010 confirms that “not ... of a minor nature” and “not minor” have the same meaning and effect. Although IG0010 discusses when development or division work is “not minor” in the context of s CB 12, the common legislative history of ss CB 11 and CB 12 suggests that similar principles will apply when determining whether improvements to land are “not minor” for the purposes of s CB 11. 17. When considering whether improvements to land are “not minor” for the purposes of s CB 11, an overall assessment of what was done in the particular circumstances should be made. The following factors set out in IG0010 for the purposes of s CB 12 are considered useful and relevant when deciding whether improvements to land are “not minor” for the purposes of s CB 11:  the importance of the improvements in relation to the physical nature and character of the land;  the total cost of the improvements made in both absolute and relative terms;  the nature of the professional services required; and  the nature of the work required for the improvements. Unclassified 4 Examples The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Example 1 - A fit-out that triggers s CB 11 Valyrian Villas Ltd is a construction company that builds homes for customers based on pre-drawn plans. It is in the business of erecting buildings. Seven years ago, Valyrian Villas Ltd purchased a two-storey office building as a rental investment separate from its building business. Valyrian Villas Ltd leased the whole office building to a law firm. Last year, the law firm moved to larger premises and Valyrian Villas Ltd decided to do a new fit-out of the office building. The cost of the fit-out was considerable. Both floors of the building were converted from individually partitioned offices into an open plan layout. All the internal walls around each of the 20 offices were removed. The large kitchen and staff room on the ground floor were replaced by six smaller kitchenettes located around the building. The two large boardrooms were divided into smaller, soundproofed meeting rooms. The entire building also had new LED lighting and cabling for state-of-the-art information and communications technology installed. Recently, almost a year after the fit-out was completed, Valyrian Villas Ltd sold the office building. Under s CB 11, Valyrian Villas Ltd is liable for income tax on the sale of the building because:  Valyrian Villas Ltd is in the business of erecting buildings.  The fit-out involved the addition and removal of fixtures, enhancing the value of the office building. Therefore, the fit-out is improvements to the office building and as a consequence, to the underlying land.  Although a question of fact and degree, Valyrian Villas Ltd’s fit-out of the office building is considered to be “not minor”. The completed fit-out was important in relation to the physical nature and character of the building (and therefore the land), with a marked change to the floor plan and amenities across the building as a whole. The cost of Valyrian Villas Ltd’s fit-out was considerable. The nature of both the professional services and physical work required to complete the fit- out was likely to have been significant, given the extent of the changes made.  Although the fit-out did not involve the erecting of a building, s CB 11 applies to any class of “improvements”. Therefore, the fit-out comes within the “or otherwise” class of “improvements” provided for by the words “made by a person erecting a building or otherwise”.  The building was sold within ten years of the fit-out being completed.  While there are some statutory exclusions to s CB 11, none of these are relevant to Valyrian Villas Ltd’s situation (see ss CB 11(3), CB 15C, CB 16 and CB 19 for the exclusions to s CB 11). Example 2 – A fit-out that is only a minor improvement to land Dornish Dwellings Ltd is in the business of erecting buildings. It also owns a small retail shop that it leases to a florist. The florist’s lease ends, and Dornish Dwellings Ltd looks for new long-term tenants. Sandy, a young clothing designer, approaches Dornish Dwellings Ltd and asks if he could set up a pop-up store in the shop for one month so he can sell his line of designer clothing. Dornish Dwellings Ltd agrees to lease the shop to Sandy. Dornish Dwellings Ltd fits out the now empty shop with some old shelving and clothes racks, a couple of bamboo screens for customers to change behind, and other shop furniture. Because nothing done in the fit-out is permanently attached to the building, Dornish Dwellings Ltd has not made improvements to land. Accordingly, s CB 11 would not be triggered by Dornish Dwellings Ltd providing Sandy with the temporary fittings. Unclassified 5 Example 3 – A fit-out that is only a minor improvement to land North Of The Wall Limited is in the business of erecting buildings. The company decides to invest profits in an investment property and purchases a 16 floor office building for $82,000,000. Six months after North Of The Wall Limited purchased the building, the tenant that leased the fourth floor moves out. In order to attract a new tenant, North Of The Wall Limited does a fit-out of the fourth floor. The fit-out takes three months to complete and includes both the addition of fixtures at a cost of $200,000, and fittings at a cost of $50,000. The fit-out does not significantly change the overall character of the office building. Although the fit-out involves improvements (the fixtures) to land, these are considered to be minor. While the cost of the improvements in absolute terms is not insignificant, it is small relative to the overall value of the office building. The fit-out is not considered to be important in relation to the nature and character of the building (and, therefore, the land). No architectural or other professional services are used and only minimal physical work is required. Therefore, although North Of The Wall Ltd has made improvements to land, these are considered to be minor and therefore do not meet the definition of “improvements” for the purposes of s CB 11. Example 4 – A person associated with someone in the business of erecting buildings Tyroshi Tenements Ltd is a property-holding company owned by Braavosi Building Ltd, a construction company. Tyroshi Tenements Ltd is not in the business of erecting buildings, but Braavosi Building Ltd is. Tyroshi Tenements Ltd has been associated with Braavosi Building Ltd for over 20 years. This year, Tyroshi Tenements Ltd sells one of its commercial properties (office block A). Importantly, eight years earlier, Tyroshi Tenements Ltd carried out a significant and costly fit-out of every floor in office block A. Although Tyroshi Tenements Ltd is not in the business of erecting buildings itself, it is still subject to s CB 11 because it was associated with Braavosi Building Ltd at the time the fit-out was begun. Therefore, assuming the fit-out of office block A was “improvements” for the purposes of s CB 11, by selling office block A this year, eight years after completing the fit-out, Tyroshi Tenements Ltd must pay tax on the sale.

Date of issue: 23 February 2018 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question What is the income tax treatment of a term life insurance policy that is:  taken out by an employee (the employee is the policy holder), and  the premiums are paid by the employer on the employee’s behalf? Answer The employer will generally be entitled to a deduction for the premiums paid. The amount of the premiums will be treated as salary or wages and, therefore, subject to PAYE. Fringe Benefit Tax will not apply. Lump sum claims paid under a term life insurance policy will not be taxable income of the employee (or the employee’s estate). Explanation 1. Inland Revenue undertook a review of all Public Information Bulletins (see http://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/pib-review/). During that review two items on the income tax treatment of insurance in an employment context were identified as being out of date. The two items are “Staff insurance schemes” (Public Information Bulletin QB 18/02 Income Tax – insurance – term life insurance policy taken out by employee with employer paying the premiums on employee’s behalf QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) considers the income tax treatment of term life insurance policies where an employee takes out the policy and their employer pays the premiums for them. This QWBA replaces QB 15/05: “Income Tax – Insurance – Term life insurance policy taken out by employee with employer paying the premiums on employee’s behalf” Tax Information Bulletin Volume Twenty Seven, No 6 (July 2015). Key provisions Sections CA 1, CE 1(1), CE 5, CX 4, DA 1, DA 2, RD 2, RD 3, RD 5(2) and the definitions of “expenditure on account of an employee” and “salary or wages” in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. QB 18/02: 23 Feb 2018 2 UNCLASSIFIED No 70 (December 1972): 11) and “Life and accident insurance policies” (Public Information Bulletin No 106 (July 1980): 2). Those PIBs covered a number of different scenarios. Those items were replaced with a series of Questions We’ve Been Asked (QWBAs) covering common scenarios. 2. Since those QWBAs were published changes have been made to the Income Tax Act to simplify the treatment of employer provided insurance. Those changes came into effect on 30 March 2017. It has, therefore, been decided to update and replace the affected QWBAs. 3. This QWBA considers the situation where an employee takes out a term life insurance policy and the employer pays the premiums. The previous version of this QWBA was QB 15/05: “Income Tax – Insurance – Term life insurance policy taken out by employee with employer paying the premiums on employee’s behalf” Tax Information Bulletin Volume Twenty Seven, No 6 (July 2015). This QWBA does not cover the situation where an employer takes out a life insurance policy for the employee’s benefit. For discussion of that situation, see QB 18/03. 4. Term life insurance pays out the sum insured (as a lump sum claim) if the life insured dies during the term of the policy. Deductibility of premiums 5. A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent that it is incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable (or excluded) income (s DA 1). Section DA 2 sets out some limitations on deductibility. For example, expenditure that is capital in nature, or expenditure incurred in deriving exempt income, is not deductible (s DA 2(1) and (3)). 6. In most cases, salary and wage costs will be deductible because they will satisfy the nexus test in s DA 1 and none of the general limitations will apply. The payment of a life insurance premium for an employee is a business cost just like salary or wages. Therefore, provided the costs of an employee’s salary or wages are deductible, the costs of paying the insurance premiums will be too. Amount of premium paid taxable in the hands of the employee 7. An employee’s income includes “expenditure on account” of that employee (s CE 1(1)(b)). Expenditure on account of an employee means a payment made by an employer relating to expenditure incurred by an employee (or to be incurred by an employee) (s CE 5(1)). This is subject to certain exceptions (in s CE 5(3)), none of which are relevant here. In particular, the exclusion in s CE 5(3)(a) will not apply as the expenditure would not be deductible to the employee in the absence of the employment limitation (being a payment made to secure a capital benefit). 8. In the situation covered by this QWBA, the employee has a legal obligation to the insurance company to pay the insurance premiums. Therefore, the amount of the insurance premiums has been incurred by the employee. The employer is paying the premiums to the insurance company. Therefore, the payment of the insurance premiums is expenditure on account of the employee and is the employee’s income. 9. A payment of expenditure on account of an employee is part of the employee’s “salary or wages” (s RD 5(2)). A payment of salary or wages is a “PAYE income payment” (s RD 3). Therefore, the PAYE rules apply and the amounts are subject to PAYE. The amount of the premiums needs to be grossed up before PAYE is calculated. That is, the amount of the premium paid is the amount net of tax. 10. As the payment of the premium is assessable income to the employee, the fringe benefit tax rules will not apply (s CX 4). QB 18/02: 23 Feb 2018 3 UNCLASSIFIED 11. There are also other potential implications of having the gross amounts of the premiums included in an employee’s salary or wages. For example, there are various circumstances where obligations, eligibility, or entitlements may be calculated based on an employee’s salary or wages (for example Kiwisaver and Working for Families Tax Credits). Income tax treatment of claims paid 12. The claim proceeds received by an employee (or their estate) under a term life insurance policy are not income. An amount is income if it comes within a provision of Part C of the Act (s CA 1(1)). There are no specific provisions that tax claim payments under term life insurance policies. 13. An amount is also income if it is income under ordinary concepts (s CA 1(2)). A lump sum claim payment under a life insurance policy is not income under ordinary concepts. 14. The following example is included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Example Sally takes out a term life insurance policy with XYZ Insurance Ltd (XYZ). The sum insured is payable to Sally’s family in the event of her death. Sally’s employer, Flamingo Plumbing Ltd (FPL), pays the premiums to XYZ on Sally’s behalf. FPL and Sally want to know the income tax implications of this. FPL is allowed a deduction for the amounts of premium paid to XYZ. The amounts of premium paid will be treated as part of Sally’s salary or wages. These amounts are, therefore, subject to PAYE. Any lump sum claim paid under the policy to Sally (or her estate) will not be subject to income tax.

This item applies to both individual term life policies and group life policies where the employees (or associates) are the beneficiaries of the policy. Answer The employer will generally be entitled to a deduction for the premiums paid. The premiums paid will not be subject to PAYE. The premiums paid will be subject to fringe benefit tax (FBT).

QB 18/03 Income Tax – insurance – term life insurance policy taken out by employer for the benefit of an employee QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) considers the income tax treatment of term life insurance policies where an employer takes out the policy for the benefit of an employee. This QWBA replaces QB 15/06: “Income Tax – Insurance – Term life insurance policy taken out by employer for the benefit of an employee” Tax Information Bulletin Volume Twenty Seven, No 6 (July 2015). This QWBA applies from 30 March 2017. Key provisions Sections CA 1, CE 1(1), CE 5, CX 2, CX 4, CX 16, DA 1, DA 2, GB 32, RD 3, RD 5(2) and the definition of “expenditure on account of an employee” in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

The previous version of this QWBA was QB 15/06: “Income Tax – Insurance – Term life insurance policy taken out by employer for the benefit of an employee” Tax Information Bulletin Volume Twenty Seven, No 6 (July 2015). This QWBA does not cover the situation where an employee takes out a term life insurance policy and the employer pays the premiums. For discussion of that situation, see QB 18/02. 4. Term (or temporary) life insurance pays out the sum insured (as a lump sum claim) if the life insured dies during the term of the policy. Deductibility of premiums 5. A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent that it is incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable (or excluded) income (s DA 1). Section DA 2 sets out some limitations on deductibility. For example, expenditure that is capital in nature, or expenditure incurred in deriving exempt income, is not deductible (s DA 2(1) and (3)). 6. In most cases, salary and wage costs will be deductible because they will satisfy the nexus test in s DA 1 and none of the general limitations will apply. The payment of a life insurance premium for the benefit of an employee (or their family) is a business cost just like the employee’s salary or wages. Therefore, provided the costs of an employee’s salary or wages are deductible, the costs of paying the insurance premiums will be too. When amount of premium is subject to FBT 7. An employee’s income includes “expenditure on account” of that employee (s CE 1(1)(b)). Expenditure on account of an employee means a payment made by an employer relating to expenditure incurred by an employee (or to be incurred by an employee) (s CE 5(1)). In this case the employer has the legal obligation to pay the premium (as they have contracted with the insurance company to take out the policy). Consequently, the payment of the premium is not expenditure on account of an employee and is not subject to PAYE. It is, therefore, necessary to consider whether FBT applies. 8. Under s CX 2, a “fringe benefit” is a benefit that is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment and comes within one of ss CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, or CX 12–CX 16, or is an unclassified benefit under s CX 37. Some benefits are QB 18/03: 23 Feb 2018 3 UNCLASSIFIED also excluded from being fringe benefits by specific provisions in subpart CX. None of those exclusions are relevant here. 9. It is the provision of the policy rather than any payment under the policy that is the relevant “benefit” for FBT purposes. The provision of a life insurance policy is an economic benefit to an employee as they received cover under the policy without the need to pay for it themselves. 10. Section CX 16 specifically includes life insurance policies as fringe benefits. It applies when an employer pays a “specified insurance premium”. The definition of “specified insurance premium” includes a premium paid for the benefit of an employee on an insurance policy to the extent to which the insurance policy is for life insurance on the life of the employee or their spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner, or on their joint lives, or on the life of their child (s CX 16(3)(a)). Section CX 16 will, therefore, apply to premiums paid for term life insurance. 11. There are no provisions in subpart CX that would exclude a term life insurance policy from being subject to FBT. Therefore, a term life insurance policy will be subject to FBT under s CX 16. 12. Where an employer provides a fringe benefit to a person associated with an employee, s GB 32 treats the benefit as if it were provided by the employer to the employee. This is subject to the shareholder-employee exemption in s GB 32(2) and the look-through company exemption in s GB 32(2B). Therefore, subject to those exemptions, premiums paid on term life insurance policies taken out by an employer for the benefit of an employee’s spouse, civil union partner, de facto partner or child will also be subject to FBT. Income tax treatment of claims paid 13. The claim proceeds received by an employee (or their estate) under a term life insurance policy are not income. An amount is income if it comes within a provision of Part C of the Act (s CA 1(1)). There are no specific provisions that tax payments under term life insurance policies. 14. An amount is also income if it is income under ordinary concepts (s CA 1(2)). A lump sum claim payment under a life insurance policy is not income under ordinary concepts. Application date 15. This QWBA reflects changes to ss CE 5 and CX 16, which came into force on 30 March 2017. The QWBA, therefore, applies from that date. For the position prior to 30 March 2017, see QB 15/06: “Income Tax – Insurance – Term life insurance policy taken out by employer for the benefit of an employee” (Tax Information Bulletin Volume Twenty Seven, No 6 (July 2015). 16. The following example is included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Example Red Herring Fishing Ltd (RHF) takes out a term life insurance policy for one of its employees, Jared Stone. The policy is for a term of two years. The only benefit payable under the policy is if death occurs during the policy term. In such a case, the sum insured is paid to the employee’s estate. RHF pays the premiums. RHF and Jared want to know the income tax implications of this arrangement. RHF is allowed a deduction for the amounts of premium paid. The amounts of premium paid are subject to FBT under s CX 16. Any lump sum claim paid under QB 18/03: 23 Feb 2018 4 UNCLASSIFIED the policy will not be subject to income tax.

Date of issue: 23 February 2018 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question What is the income tax treatment of a personal sickness or accident insurance policy that is:  taken out by an employee (the employee is the policy holder), and  the premiums are paid by the employer on the employee’s behalf? Answer The employer will generally be entitled to a deduction for the premiums paid. The amount of the premiums paid for income protection insurance will not be subject to PAYE. The amount of premiums paid for other personal sickness or accident insurance policies will be treated as salary or wages and, therefore, subject to PAYE. Fringe Benefit Tax will not apply. Claim amounts paid (or that an employee is otherwise entitled to) under income protection insurance policies will be income under s CE 11. Claim amounts paid (or that an employee is otherwise entitled to) under other personal sickness or accident policies will be income only if they are income under ordinary concepts (s CA 1(2)). Claim amounts that are not income under ordinary concepts will not be subject to tax. Claim amounts that are income under s CE 11 or s CA 1(2) will be exempt income if they are payments: QB 18/04 Income Tax – insurance – personal sickness and accident insurance taken out by employee with employer paying the premiums on employee’s behalf QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) considers the income tax treatment of personal sickness and accident insurance policies where an employee takes out the policy and their employer pays the premiums for them. This QWBA replaces QB 15/09: “Income Tax – Insurance – Personal sickness and accident insurance taken out by employee with employer paying the premiums on employee’s behalf” Tax Information Bulletin Volume Twenty Seven, No 10 (November 2015). Key provisions Sections CA 1, CA 2(2), CE 1(1), CE 5, CE 11, CW 34, CX 4, DA 1, DA 2, RD 2, RD 3, RD 5(2) and the definitions of “expenditure on account of an employee” and “salary or wages” in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. QB 18/04: 23 Feb 2018 2 IN CONFIDENCE  made to a person because they (or another person) are incapacitated for work; and either o paid by a friendly society (s CW 34(2)(a)); or o not calculated according to a loss of earnings (s CW 34(2)(c)). If the claim payment does not meet these criteria, it will be assessable income. Explanation Scope 1. This QWBA considers the income tax treatment of personal sickness or accident insurance policies. Some personal sickness or accident insurance policies include elements of income protection insurance. There are specific provisions in the Act that apply only to income protection insurance, so income protection insurance may have a different tax treatment to other personal sickness or accident insurance. 2. This QWBA does not consider the treatment of claim payments to or from sickness, accident, or death benefits funds. 3. This QWBA also does not consider the treatment of weekly compensation purchased under s 223 of the Accident Compensation Act 2001. Background 4. Inland Revenue undertook a review of all Public Information Bulletins (see http://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/pib-review/). During that review two items on the income tax treatment of insurance in an employment context were identified as being out of date. The two items are “Staff insurance schemes” (Public Information Bulletin No 70 (December 1972): 11) and “Life and accident insurance policies” (Public Information Bulletin No 106 (July 1980): 2). Those PIBs covered a number of different scenarios. Those items were replaced with a series of QWBAs covering common scenarios. 5. Since those QWBAs were published changes have been made to the Income Tax Act to simplify the treatment of employer provided insurance. Those changes came into effect on 30 March 2017. It has, therefore, been decided to update and replace the affected QWBAs. The previous version of this QWBA was QB 15/09: “Income Tax – Insurance – Personal sickness and accident insurance taken out by employee with employer paying the premiums on employee’s behalf” Tax Information Bulletin Volume Twenty Seven, No 10 (November 2015). Although no material changes have been made to QB 15/09, it was considered that it would be useful to update and republish it with the related QWBAs (QB 18/02, QB 18/03 and QB 18/05). 6. This QWBA considers the situation where an employee takes out a personal sickness or accident insurance policy and the employer pays the premiums. This QWBA does not cover the situation where an employer takes out a sickness or accident insurance policy for the employee’s benefit (see QB 18/05 for discussion of that situation). 7. There are many different types of insurance policies that could be sickness or accident insurance (or could include an element of personal sickness or accident insurance). These include medical insurance, income protection insurance, accident insurance, and trauma or critical illness policies. Claim payments under these insurance policies can be periodic or lump sum and can be calculated in a variety of ways. QB 18/04: 23 Feb 2018 3 IN CONFIDENCE 8. Where only part of a policy comes within a particular definition, it may be necessary to apportion premiums between different types of insurance. Similarly where a claim payment under a policy is made for more than one thing, apportionment of the receipt may be required. Deductibility of premiums for employer 9. A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent that it is incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable (and/or excluded) income (s DA 1). Section DA 2 sets out some limitations on deductibility. For example, expenditure that is capital in nature, or expenditure incurred in deriving exempt income, is not deductible (s DA 2(1) and (3)). 10. In most cases, salary and wage costs will be deductible because they will satisfy the nexus test in s DA 1 and none of the general limitations will apply. The payment of a sickness or accident insurance premium for an employee that is paid in connection with the employee’s employment is a business cost just like salary or wages. Therefore, provided the costs of an employee’s salary or wages are deductible, the costs of paying the insurance premiums will be too. Whether amount of premium paid is taxable in the hands of the employee 11. An employee’s income includes “expenditure on account” of that employee (s CE 1(1)(b)). Expenditure on account of an employee means a payment made by an employer relating to expenditure incurred by an employee (or to be incurred by an employee) (s CE 5(1)). This is subject to certain exceptions (in s CE 5(3)). 12. The only potentially relevant exclusion in this context is s CE 5(3)(j). Section CE 5(3)(j) applies to premiums for income protection insurance that an employer is liable to make a contribution towards for the benefit of an employee. Where a personal sickness or accident policy is also (or also includes) income protection insurance, s CE 5(3)(j) may be relevant. 13. In the situation covered by this QWBA, the employee has a legal obligation to the insurance company to pay the insurance premiums. Therefore, the amount of the insurance premiums is incurred by the employee. The employer is paying the premiums to the insurance company. Therefore, the payment of the insurance premiums meets the definition of expenditure on account of the employee under s CE 5(1). 14. To the extent that the premium paid is:  for “income protection insurance”; and  the employer has a liability to pay (or make a contribution towards) that premium, then the payment of the premium will not be expenditure on account of the employee. Premiums paid for income protection insurance are not subject to PAYE (s CE 5(3)(j)). 15. In all other cases the payment of the premium will be expenditure on account of the employee. A payment of expenditure on account of an employee is part of the employee’s “salary or wages” (s RD 5(2)). A payment of salary or wages is a “PAYE income payment” (s RD 3). Therefore, the PAYE rules apply and the amounts are subject to PAYE. The amount of the premiums needs to be grossed up before PAYE is calculated. That is, the amount of the premium paid is the amount net of tax. 16. As the payment of the premium is assessable income to the employee, the FBT rules will not apply (s CX 4). QB 18/04: 23 Feb 2018 4 IN CONFIDENCE 17. There are also other potential implications of having the gross amounts of the premiums included in an employee’s salary or wages. For example, there are various other circumstances where obligations, eligibility, or entitlements may be calculated based on an employee’s salary or wages (for example KiwiSaver and Working for Families Tax Credits). Income tax treatment of claims paid 18. Whether a claim payment made under an insurance policy is taxable will depend on what it is paid for. Some claim payments will not be income (under a specific provision or ordinary concepts) and, therefore, will not be taxable. Claim payments that are “income” may be either taxable or exempt income depending on the circumstances. The following discussion is intended to assist with determining how a claim payment under an insurance policy should be treated. Is the payment to the employee income? 19. If a personal sickness or accident insurance policy is (or includes) income protection insurance, s CE 11 may apply. Claim payments made under a policy of income protection insurance where an employer is liable to pay or contribute to the premiums are income to the employee under s CE 11. 20. There are no specific provisions that apply to make claim payments under other personal sickness or accident insurance policies income. Therefore, claim payments under these insurance policies will be income only if they are income under ordinary concepts (s CA 1(2)). 21. Whether a claim payment under an insurance policy is income or not will depend on the relationship between the payer and the recipient and the purpose of the payment (Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176). Where a claim payment is made to replace income which the recipient would otherwise have earned or where the purpose of the payments is to provide the recipient with amounts to meet their living expenses, the payments are likely to be income. Claim payments that are regular or recurring are much more likely to be income (Reid). However, a one-off claim payment may still be income (FCT v Hyteco Hiring Pty Ltd 92 ATC 4,694). 22. Therefore, the claim payments that are most likely to be income are payments that are intended to compensate an insured person for lost income (whether periodic, or lump sum) and other regular or periodic payments intended to help the insured person meet their living expenses. Other lump sum and reimbursing claim payments are unlikely to be income (for example, a lump sum payment made to compensate a person for the loss of a limb, or a payment reimbursing medical expenses). 23. Claim payments that are not “income” (either under s CE 11 or s CA 1(2)) will not be taxable. If a claim payment is “income”, it is necessary to consider whether it is assessable income or exempt income. Is the claim payment exempt income of the employee? 24. The relevant exemption provision is s CW 34. A claim payment of income made under a policy of personal sickness or accident insurance will be exempt under s CW 34 if:  it is made to a person because they (or another person) are incapacitated for work; and either o the payment is made by a friendly society; or o the payment is not calculated according to loss of earnings. 25. If the claim payment does not meet these criteria, it will be assessable income. QB 18/04: 23 Feb 2018 5 IN CONFIDENCE 26. The following diagram sets out the process for determining how a claim amount paid under a policy should be treated. Each claim payment needs to be considered separately. As noted above, where a single claim payment is made for more than one thing, apportionment may be required: Treatment of claim payment made to a person under a policy of personal sickness or accident insurance 27. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Example 1 – Income protection insurance 28. Joan takes out an income protection insurance policy for herself. Joan’s employment contract contains a clause that, if Joan takes out an income protection insurance policy, her employer will pay the premiums. Joan’s policy provides that, if Joan is unable to work due to sickness or accident, she will be paid 75% of her lost earnings. Joan and her employer want to know the income tax implications of this. 29. Joan’s employer is allowed a deduction for the amounts of premium paid to the QB 18/04: 23 Feb 2018 6 IN CONFIDENCE insurer. There is no PAYE payable on the amount of premiums as they are excluded from being “expenditure on account” under s CE 5(3)(j). If Joan becomes unable to work and her policy pays out, these claim amounts will be Joan’s assessable income. The claim payments will not be exempt under s CW 34 as they will be calculated according to the earnings that Joan has lost. Example 2 – Accident insurance Dennis takes out an accident insurance policy and, as part of his remuneration package, his employer agrees to pay the premiums. Under the policy Dennis will receive a fixed lump sum payment on the occurrence of certain specified events if caused by an accident. Dennis’ accident insurance policy will also reimburse medical expenses incurred as a result of an accident up to a maximum of $50,000. Dennis’ employer is allowed a deduction for the premiums and Dennis is subject to PAYE on the amounts of the premiums paid. The following year Dennis has an accident while using his axe at home and loses a toe. His policy pays out a fixed amount of $1,000 for the loss of his toe and also reimburses Dennis $10,000 for his medical expenses. Dennis wants to know whether to include these amounts in his income. The sum for the loss of his toe and the reimbursements of Dennis’ medical expenses are not income. The claim amounts are not income under ordinary concepts. They are not periodic or regular payments. Also, they are not paid to compensate Dennis for lost income nor are they payments on which Dennis can rely for his living expenses.

Date of issue: 23 February 2018 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question What is the income tax treatment of a personal sickness or accident insurance policy that is:  taken out by an employer (the employer is the policy holder), and  an employee (or their spouse, civil union partner, de facto partner or child) is the beneficiary? This item applies to both individual personal sickness or accident insurance policies and group policies where the employees (or associates) are the beneficiaries of the policy. Answer The employer will generally be entitled to a deduction for the premiums paid. The premiums paid will not be subject to PAYE. The premiums paid will be subject to FBT unless they are premiums paid for income protection insurance where:  the employer has a liability to pay (or contribute to) the premiums; and QB 18/05 Income Tax – insurance – personal sickness and accident insurance taken out by employer for the benefit of an employee QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) considers the income tax treatment of personal sickness and accident insurance policies where an employer takes out the policy for the benefit of an employee.

It has, therefore, been decided to update and replace the affected QWBAs. 6. This QWBA considers the situation where a personal sickness or accident insurance policy is taken out by an employer for the benefit of an employee. The previous version QB 18/05: 23 Feb 2018 3 UNCLASSIFIED of this QWBA was QB 15/10: “Income Tax – Insurance – personal sickness and accident insurance taken out by employer for the benefit of an employee” Tax Information Bulletin Volume Twenty Seven, No 10 (November 2015). See QB 18/04 for discussion of situations where the employee takes out the policy and the employer pays the premiums. 7. There are many different types of insurance policies that could be sickness or accident insurance (or could include an element of personal sickness or accident insurance). These include medical insurance, income protection insurance, accident insurance, and trauma or critical illness policies. Claim payments under these insurance policies can be periodic or lump sum and can be calculated in a variety of ways. 8. Where only part of a policy comes within a particular definition, it may be necessary to apportion premiums between different types of insurance. Similarly where a claim payment under a policy is made for more than one thing, apportionment of the receipt may be required. Deductibility of premiums for employer 9. A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent that it is incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable (and/or excluded) income (s DA 1). Section DA 2 sets out some limitations on deductibility. For example, expenditure that is capital in nature, or expenditure incurred in deriving exempt income, is not deductible (s DA 2(1) and (3)). 10. In most cases, salary and wage costs will be deductible because they will satisfy the nexus test in s DA 1 and none of the general limitations will apply. The payment of a sickness or accident insurance premium for an employee that is paid in connection with the employee’s employment is a business cost just like salary or wages. Therefore, provided the costs of an employee’s salary or wages are deductible, the costs of paying the insurance premiums will be too. When amount of premium is subject to FBT 11. An employee’s income includes “expenditure on account” of that employee (s CE 1(1)(b)). Expenditure on account of an employee means a payment made by an employer relating to expenditure incurred by an employee (or to be incurred by an employee) (s CE 5(1)). In this case the employer has the legal obligation to pay the premium (as they have contracted with the insurance company to take out the policy). Consequently, the payment of the premium is not expenditure on account of an employee and is not subject to PAYE. It is, therefore, necessary to consider whether FBT applies. 12. Under s CX 2, a “fringe benefit” is a “benefit” that is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment (s CX 2(1)(a)) and comes within either one of ss CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, or CX 12 to CX 16 (specified benefits) or is an unclassified benefit under s CX 37 (s CX 2(1)(b)). Some benefits are also excluded from being fringe benefits by specific provisions in subpart CX (see s CX 2(1)(c)). 13. The Commissioner’s view is that the provision of an accident or sickness insurance policy where the employee is a beneficiary is a “benefit” to the employee. It provides an economic advantage to the employee as it gives the employee benefits (coverage under the policy) to which they would otherwise not be entitled. Provided the benefit is provided to an employee in connection with their employment, s CX 2(1)(a) is satisfied. It is, therefore, necessary to consider whether the policy is a specified benefit under one of ss CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, or CX 12 to CX 16, or whether an unclassified benefit arises (s CX 37). It is also necessary to consider whether any exclusion could apply. QB 18/05: 23 Feb 2018 4 UNCLASSIFIED 14. The only potentially relevant specific provision is s CX 16. Section CX 16 applies when an employer pays a “specified insurance premium” or makes a contribution to the insurance fund of a friendly society for the benefit of an employee (s CX 16(1)). The relevant parts of the definition of “specified insurance premium” are s CX 16(3)(b) and (c): CX 16 Contributions to life or health insurance ... Meaning of specified insurance premium (3) In this section, specified insurance premium means a premium paid for the benefit of an employee on an insurance policy to the extent to which the insurance policy is for— ... (b) accident or medical insurance referred to in section EY 8(3) on the life of the employee or their spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner, or on their joint lives, or on the life of their child: (c) insurance against accident, disease, or sickness, whether fatal or not, suffered by the employee, their spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner, or their child. 15. Personal sickness and accident policies are policies that insure against accident, disease, or sickness. Therefore, the policies covered by this QWBA will come within s CX 16 and s CX 2(1)(b) will be satisfied. 16. Where an employer provides a fringe benefit to a person associated with an employee, s GB 32 may treat the benefit as if it were provided by the employer to the employee. This is subject to the shareholder-employee exemption in s GB 32(2) and the look- through company exemption in s GB 32(2B). Therefore, subject to those exemptions, premiums paid on policies of personal sickness and accident insurance taken out by an employer for the benefit of an employee’s spouse, civil union partner, de facto partner or child will also be subject to FBT. Exclusion from FBT 17. The only potentially relevant exclusion is s CX 31. Section CX 31 provides: An employer who satisfies a liability to pay, or contribute to the payment of, a premium for income protection insurance for the benefit of an employee does not provide a fringe benefit to the employee if a payment of the insurance to the employee would be assessable income of the employee. 18. Section CX 31 will exclude from FBT such income protection insurance:  provided by an employer;  for the benefit of an employee;  where the employer satisfies a liability to pay (or contribute to) the premiums; and  a pay-out under the insurance policy would be assessable income of the employee (this requirement is considered below). 19. Where a personal sickness or accident policy is also (or also includes) income protection insurance and all of the above requirements are met, the provision of the income protection insurance will not be a fringe benefit. In all other cases, FBT will apply. Where only part of a policy is income protection insurance, apportionment may be required. Income tax treatment of claims paid 20. Whether a claim payment made under an insurance policy is taxable will depend on what it is paid for. Some claim payments will not be income (under a specific provision or ordinary concepts) and, therefore, will not be taxable. Claim payments that are QB 18/05: 23 Feb 2018 5 UNCLASSIFIED “income” may be either assessable or exempt income depending on the circumstances. The following discussion is intended to assist with determining how a claim payment under an insurance policy should be treated. Is the payment to the employee income? 21. If a personal sickness or accident insurance policy is (or includes) income protection insurance, s CE 11 may apply. Claim payments made under a policy of income protection insurance where an employer is liable to pay or contribute to the premiums are income to the employee under s CE 11. 22. There are no specific provisions that apply to make claim payments under other personal sickness or accident insurance policies income. Therefore, claim payments under these policies will be income only if they are income under ordinary concepts (s CA 1(2)). 23. Whether a claim payment under an insurance policy is income or not will depend on the relationship between the payer and the recipient and the purpose of the payment (Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176). Where a claim payment is made to replace income which the recipient would otherwise have earned or where the purpose of the payments is to provide the recipient with amounts to meet their living expenses, the payments are likely to be income. Claim payments that are regular or recurring are much more likely to be income (Reid). However, a one-off claim payment may still be income (FCT v Hyteco Hiring Pty Ltd 92 ATC 4,694). 24. Therefore, the claim payments that are most likely to be income are payments that are intended to compensate an insured person for lost income (whether periodic, or lump sum) and other regular or periodic payments intended to help the insured person meet their living expenses. Other lump sum and reimbursing payments are unlikely to be income (for example, a lump sum payment made for the loss of a limb, or a payment reimbursing medical expenses). 25. Claim payments that are not “income” (either under s CE 11 or s CA 1(2)) will not be taxable.

If the claim payment does not meet these criteria, it will be assessable income. 28. The following diagram sets out the process for determining how a claim amount paid out under a policy should be treated. Each claim payment needs to be considered separately. As noted above, where a single claim payment is made for more than one thing, apportionment may be required: QB 18/05: 23 Feb 2018 6 UNCLASSIFIED Treatment of claim payment made to a person under a policy of personal sickness or accident insurance Application date 29. This QWBA reflects changes to s CX 16, which came into force on 30 March 2017. The QWBA, therefore, applies from that date. For the position prior to 30 March 2017, see QB 15/10: “Income Tax – Insurance – Personal sickness and accident insurance taken out by employer for the benefit of an employee” Tax Information Bulletin Volume Twenty Seven, No 10 (November 2015). 30. The following example is included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Example Keith’s employer takes out medical insurance policies for each of its senior staff. The policies pay out various amounts if the insured person contracts a disease or becomes sick. Keith’s employer is allowed a deduction for the premiums. The premiums are subject to FBT because a fringe benefit arises under s CX 16. QB 18/05: 23 Feb 2018 7 UNCLASSIFIED Keith contracts influenza and is hospitalised. Keith receives a $10,000 claim payment as a reimbursement of his hospital expenses. Keith wants to know whether to include the $10,000 in his income. The $10,000 is not income. The amount is not income under ordinary concepts. It is a one-off payment. Also, it is not paid to compensate Keith for lost income. 31.

23 February 2018 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question Can a registered person issue a combined tax invoice and credit or debit note? Answer A registered person may issue a combined tax invoice and credit or debit note if each relates to different supplies of goods and services. Tax invoices and credit or debit notes may not be combined if they relate to the same supply. Explanation 1. Tax invoices, credit notes and debit notes perform different functions when goods and services are supplied. Tax invoices are usually issued when goods and services are supplied by a registered person. If some of those goods are subsequently returned, the supply changes, or the price of the goods and services changes after the relevant tax invoice is issued, a credit note or debit note needs to be issued. The question is whether a tax invoice and a credit or debit note can be combined into a single document. Tax invoices 2. Generally, when a registered person makes a supply they need to issue a tax invoice showing the details of the supply to the recipient. Importantly, the tax invoice sets out the GST charged on the supply. This will be the amount of output tax that the supplier has to account QB 18/06 Can a registered person issue a combined tax invoice and credit or debit note? QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This question we’ve been asked (QWBA) is about whether a registered person can issue a combined tax invoice and credit or debit note. It was the subject of question 13 in “Questions and answers about GST” in Public Information Bulletin (May 1986), which is cited in several tax commentaries about prompt payment discounts. This QWBA replaces the Public Information Bulletin item. Key provisions Sections 24 and 25 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Key terms A tax invoice is a document the supplier gives to the recipient that shows the details of the goods and services supplied. A credit note is used when the amount payable for a supply is reduced after the tax invoice has been issued. Similarly, a debit note is used when the amount payable for a supply is increased after the tax invoice has been issued. A prompt payment discount is a reduction in the amount payable for the goods and services if the recipient pays the amount before a certain date. QB 18/06: 23 February 2018 2 UNCLASSIFIED for and that the recipient of the supply may be able to claim as input tax. Multiple supplies may be combined in a single tax invoice. Section 24 details what must be shown on a tax invoice. Examples of tax invoices are given in Inland Revenue’s guides GST guide: Working with GST (IR375) (July 2017): 9, and Smart business: A guide for businesses and non-profit organisations (IR320) (April 2017): 46–47.

Supplies can change for various reasons such as when:  the supply of goods and services is cancelled;  the nature of the supply of goods and services is fundamentally varied or altered;  the previously agreed amount payable for the supply of goods and services changes; or  some or all of the goods and services supplied are returned to the supplier. 4. If the supplier has provided a tax invoice to the recipient of the supply, and the amount of tax charged (as shown on the tax invoice) is reduced, the supplier must issue a credit note to the recipient. Section 25(3)(a) details what must be shown on the credit note. An example of a credit note is given in Inland Revenue’s GST guide: Working with GST (IR375) (July 2017): 18. On the other hand, if the amount of tax charged (as shown on the tax invoice) is increased, the supplier must issue a debit note to the recipient. The requirements for a debit note, set out in s 25(3)(b), are essentially the same as those for a credit note. Further information on credit and debit notes can be found at www.ird.govt.nz/gst/work-out/work-out- records/records-credit/ and www.ird.govt.nz/gst/work-out/work-out-records/records-debit/. 5. The obligation to issue a credit or debit note is only triggered if a tax invoice has been provided. This reflects the purpose of credit or debit notes. If aspects of the supply have changed, resulting in the tax charged on the supply being incorrect, then the credit or debit note will indicate any necessary adjustment to the tax charged. Under ss 25(4) and 25(5) respectively, the adjustment is required to be made in the taxable period in which the credit or debit note is issued. 6. If no tax invoice has been issued before the supply changes, then no credit note or debit note can be issued under s 25(3)(a) or (b). However, the supplier still needs to issue a tax invoice under s 24(1). In this case, the tax invoice should contain the details of the changed supply. Tax invoices and credit or debit notes may be combined 7. While a credit or debit note must be issued after a tax invoice for a particular supply, a tax invoice for one supply and a credit or debit note for another supply can be in a single document. The relevant statutory provisions do not prohibit a tax invoice or a credit or debit note from containing other particulars besides those specified. Therefore, for separate supplies of goods and services, a tax invoice for one supply and a credit or debit note for another supply may be combined into a single document. This might occur in situations where supplies are invoiced monthly, for example, telephone and electricity supplies. 8. The tax invoice for one month’s supply may be combined with a credit or debit note relating to a previous month’s supply. A tax invoice, a credit note, and a debit note could all be combined in one document as long as they all related to different supplies. 9. Similarly, a “buyer created” tax invoice for one supply may be combined with a “buyer created” credit or debit note for another supply. Prompt payment discounts 10. Prompt payment discounts are different. Typically, a prompt payment discount is shown on the tax invoice as a reduction in the amount payable (including GST) if the amount is paid before a certain date. In that case, a lesser amount is stated to be payable. QB 18/06: 23 February 2018 3 UNCLASSIFIED 11. However, a credit note is not required when a recipient of a supply takes advantage of a prompt payment discount offered by the supplier for early payment of the amount payable. Provided the terms of the prompt payment discount are clearly shown on the face of the tax invoice, s 25(3)(e) does not require the supplier to issue a credit note. QB 18/06: 23 February 2018 4 UNCLASSIFIED Examples The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Sample documents are included to show some of the different ways of setting out the legally required information. Example 1 - Goods returned after the tax invoice is issued Jane regularly buys her office supplies from Office to Go. In August 2017, she buys $150.00 (excl. GST) of office supplies and Office to Go issues her with a tax invoice. Jane subsequently returns $15.00 (excl. GST) of damaged goods. When Office to Go invoices Jane for supplies made to her in September 2017, it combines the tax invoice with a credit note for the $15.00 (excl. GST) of damaged goods from August. The document is labelled “Statement of Account/Tax Invoice/Credit Note/Debit Note”. Provided all the requirements of ss 24(3) or 24(4) (whichever applies), and s 25(3)(a) are met, the document is both a tax invoice for the September 2017 supplies and a credit note for the damaged August 2017 supplies that Jane returned. Example 2 – Goods returned before the tax invoice is issued Suppose, instead, that Jane returns the damaged goods to Office to Go before it issues a tax invoice for the goods supplied in August 2017. Office to Go wants to know if it can issue a combined tax invoice and credit note at the end of August 2017, with the tax invoice being for $150.00 (excl. GST) of goods initially supplied and the credit note being for the $15.00 (excl. GST) of goods returned. The correct position is for Office to Go to issue a tax invoice showing the goods actually supplied in August 2017 and a total of $135.00 (excl. GST). A tax invoice showing $150.00 (excl. GST) of goods supplied would not reflect the actual supply once Jane has returned the damaged goods. QB 18/06: 23 February 2018 5 UNCLASSIFIED Example 3 – Combined tax invoice and debit notes In January 2018, Jane enters into a 12 month contract with Office to Go, under which Office to Go agrees to sell A4 paper to Jane at the discounted price of $5.00 (excl. GST) per ream, on the condition that Jane buys 1,000 or more reams of paper by 31 December 2018. If Jane fails to meet this purchase target, the contract provides that the price for all A4 paper purchased under the contract will be increased to $6.00 (excl. GST) per ream. The contract states that if the price is increased due to the purchase target not being met, Jane will make a further payment, being the difference between the discounted price and the actual price on all A4 paper purchased under the contract. By 31 December 2018, Jane has failed to meet the purchase target, making only six purchases of A4 paper over the year, totalling 850 reams. The price of these 850 reams of A4 paper therefore increases from $5.00 (excl. GST) to $6.00 (excl. GST) per ream. As a result, Office to Go issues debit notes in relation to the tax invoices issued for the six A4 paper purchases Jane made earlier in the year, and which understated the actual price of A4 paper supplied and the GST charged on those supplies. For convenience, Office to Go combines these debit notes with the tax invoice it issues in January 2019 in respect of other purchases that Jane has made in December 2018. QB 18/06: 23 February 2018 6 UNCLASSIFIED Example 4 – Prompt payment discount Power To Us Ltd offers customers a 5% prompt payment discount if they pay their monthly bill before the 20th of the following month. The details of the available discount are clearly shown on the tax invoice. John pays the lesser 95% amount owing on his August bill on September 15. Because the prompt payment discount offer was clearly detailed on the August tax invoice, s 25(3)(e) states that Power To Us Ltd does not have to issue a credit note to John.

1 UNCLASSIFIED Question When is an arrangement (the revised arrangement) considered to be “materially different” from the arrangement identified in a private or product ruling for the purpose of ss 91EB(2)(a) and 91FB(2)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA)? Answer The revised arrangement is “materially different” for the purpose of ss 91EB(2)(a) and 91FB(2)(a) of the TAA if, in relation to a tax type, the difference between the revised arrangement and the arrangement identified in the ruling is capable of affecting the tax outcome referred to in the ruling. Whether the revised arrangement is materially different from the arrangement identified in the ruling will be considered on a case-by-case basis, because it will turn on the facts and circumstances of each case. Explanation 1. Section 91EB(2) of the TAA sets out the instances in which a private ruling does not apply to a person in relation to a tax type for an arrangement. One such instance is if the arrangement is “materially different” from the arrangement identified in the ruling. Section 91EB(2)(a) states: QB 18/07 When is an arrangement considered to be “materially different” from the arrangement identified in a private or product ruling? QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This question we’ve been asked (QWBA) will be of interest to anyone who has been issued a binding private or product ruling where differences exist between the arrangement described in the ruling and the arrangement implemented. This QWBA explains when the Commissioner will consider an arrangement to be materially different from the arrangement identified in a private or product ruling. Key provisions Sections 91EB(2)(a) and 91FB(2)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Key terms in this item This QWBA relates to private rulings and product rulings. A private ruling provides certainty to the person(s) referred to in the ruling about how the Commissioner will apply relevant taxation laws to the person(s) in relation to an arrangement. A product ruling provides certainty to consumers of a particular product about how the Commissioner will apply relevant taxation laws to them in relation to the arrangement to which they are a party. An arrangement is a contract, agreement, plan or understanding (whether enforceable or not), including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect. It includes facts that the Commissioner considers are material or relevant as background or context to a private or a product ruling. 2 UNCLASSIFIED (2) A private ruling does not apply to a person in relation to a tax type for an arrangement, to the extent to which, in relation to the tax type — (a) the arrangement is materially different from the arrangement identified in the ruling;... \[Emphasis added\] ... 2. Section 91FB(2)(a) of the TAA contains an equivalent provision in relation to product rulings. 3. We have been asked to provide guidance on the meaning of “materially different” in ss 91EB(2)(a) and 91FB(2)(a). 4. To provide this guidance, we must consider the meaning of the terms “materially” and “different”. The Oxford English Dictionary (online ed, Oxford University Press, accessed 13 February 2017) relevantly defines these two terms (and their derivatives) as follows: Materially adv. ... 4 To a material or important extent; significantly, substantially, considerably. ... Material adj. (specifically in the context of “having significance or relevance”) ... 6a Of serious or substantial import; significant, important, of consequence. ... 6c Of evidence or a fact: significant or influential, esp. in having affected a person’s decision-making; ... 6d Pertinent, relevant; essential. Different adj. ... 2a Unlike in nature, form, or quality; not of the same kind; dissimilar. Differ v. 1 To have different or distinguishing qualities or features; to be dissimilar, different, or distinct in nature, form, or qualities in a particular respect. 5. Therefore, based on these definitions, a “materially different” arrangement is one that is significantly unlike the arrangement identified in the ruling, with that difference being of consequence or influential in affecting a person’s decision-making. 6. No New Zealand case law has considered the meaning of “materially different” in a tax context. 7. The Australian Federal Court considered the meaning of the phrase in Carey v Field \[2002\] FCA 1173. The case was an application for judicial review of the Australian Commissioner’s decision to withdraw a product ruling (a type of public ruling) in the context of the original Australian binding rulings regime (since repealed and replaced). The court was required to consider whether, on the material before the Commissioner and upon which he relied, it was open to him to conclude that the differences he identified as “material differences” were considerations that he was entitled to take into account in deciding to withdraw the product ruling. The real issue between the parties related to what constitutes a “material difference” in that context. The relevant legislation contained no reference to the phrase “materially different”. However, the product ruling contained the following statement: If the arrangement described in the Product Ruling is materially different from the arrangement that is actually carried out, investors lose the protection of the Product Ruling. \[Emphasis added\] 8. The applicant submitted that for a difference to be material, the difference must result in a different tax outcome to that provided for in the ruling. Merkel J disagreed and expressed the following views at \[47\]: ... In my view if it is reasonably open to the Commissioner to form the view on the material before him that, because of a difference between the arrangement implemented and that ruled upon, the tax outcome for a taxpayer who is a member of the class of persons to whom the ruling was intended to apply is capable of being, or is or likely to be, different to that provided for in the ruling, that difference is a material difference, and therefore not an irrelevant consideration in the context of the judicial review of a decision to withdraw the ruling under s14ZAAK(1) of the \[Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth)\]. While a purpose of the binding public ruling system is to provide certainty to taxpayers, that purpose is better served by the Commissioner having the power to withdraw a ruling if he forms the view that the differences between the arrangement 3 UNCLASSIFIED implemented and that ruled upon are capable of having or likely to have a different tax outcome to that provided for in the ruling. Plainly, if it is reasonably open to the Commissioner to form the view that the tax outcomes ruled upon do not apply, greater certainty is provided by the withdrawal of the ruling. The object of certainty and the public interest are not served by the maintenance of a ruling where the Commissioner has formed a view, that is reasonably open on the basis of the material before him, that the ruling can no longer be safely relied upon because of differences between the arrangement implemented and that ruled upon. 9. In other areas of law, the courts have held that a difference is “material” if it is significant or relevant (Rainey v Greater Glasgow Health Board \[1987\] 1 All ER 65 and Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Dela Cruz (1992) 110 ALR 367). In the context of contracts in writing and written instruments, a material alteration is one that alters the legal effect of the instrument (Vacuum Oil Co Pty Ltd v Longmuir \[1957\] VR 456). Given the very different context in which these cases were decided, it is the Commissioner’s view that they are of very limited interpretative value. 10. In the context of the New Zealand binding rulings legislation, it is the Commissioner’s view that the phrase “materially different” in ss 91EB(2)(a) and 91FB(2)(a) means a difference that is capable of affecting the tax outcome referred to in the ruling. 11. Therefore, if in relation to a tax type, the difference between the revised arrangement and the arrangement identified in the ruling is capable of affecting the tax outcome referred to in the ruling, the Commissioner’s view is that the revised arrangement is “materially different” from the arrangement identified in the ruling for the purpose of ss 91EB(2)(a) and 91FB(2)(a). 12. Whether a revised arrangement is materially different from the arrangement identified in a private or product ruling depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. The size of the difference in tax outcome is not a determining factor when evaluating whether the difference in the arrangement is material for the purpose of ss 91EB(2)(a) and 91FB(2)(a). In certain instances the size of the difference in tax outcome will not be a relevant factor at all. Given the widely divergent nature of the taxation laws in respect of which binding rulings may be made, it is not possible to list all the factors that the Commissioner will take into account when considering each case. The Commissioner will consider each matter on a case- by-case basis. When the ruling ceases to apply under ss 91EB(2)(a) and 91FB(2)(a) of the TAA 13. It is the Commissioner’s view that, if a revised arrangement is materially different from the arrangement identified in a ruling, the ruling does not apply in relation to the tax type for the arrangement from the point in time that the arrangement is materially different. The ruling will continue to apply from commencement of the period of the ruling until that point. Process 14. If you have a question about whether an arrangement is materially different from the arrangement identified in a private or product ruling you should contact:  your Compliance Manager if you are a Significant Enterprise taxpayer; or  the team that worked on your ruling; or  the Taxpayer Rulings Unit of the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel (rulings@ird.govt.nz). You may be required to apply for a new ruling to enable the Commissioner to consider whether the revised arrangement is materially different from the arrangement ruled on. 4 UNCLASSIFIED Examples The following examples help to explain the application of the law. Example 1: Using a different investment vehicle Shane, Karen and Steve intend to use a limited partnership structure to invest in a commercial property development. They obtain a private ruling about the tax treatment of interest paid and tax losses. However, they end up using a look-through company structure instead of a limited partnership structure for their investment. The Commissioner considers the revised arrangement is materially different from the arrangement identified in the ruling, because the investment vehicle used is capable of affecting the tax outcome identified in the ruling. Example 2: Loan financing provided by a different bank on identical terms No 8 Wire Limited is in negotiations with ABC Bank (a New Zealand bank) to obtain a loan for $5 million to acquire new business equipment for its factory in New Plymouth. No 8 Wire Limited obtains a private ruling to confirm that interest payments under the proposed loan contract with ABC Bank will be deductible for income tax purposes. The loan falls through shortly after the private ruling is issued, but No 8 Wire Limited is able to secure a $5 million loan on identical terms from XYZ Bank (also a New Zealand bank). The Commissioner considers that the arrangement is not materially different from the arrangement identified in the private ruling issued to No 8 Wire Limited because the difference in the arrangement is not capable of affecting the tax outcome identified in the private ruling. Example 3: Acquiring shares in a different company listed on the ASX Marama is a share dealer with a significant share portfolio. She intends to acquire a portfolio interest in Technotrooper, a foreign company listed on the ASX. She obtains a private ruling that dividend income derived from this company is not income, so is not taxable. The ruling is on the basis that this investment is an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) in relation to which the fair dividend rate method will be used to calculate Marama’s FIF income, and none of the exemptions in ss EX 31 to EX 43 will apply to her proposed shareholding in Technotrooper. Shortly after obtaining the private ruling, Marama decides to acquire a portfolio interest in GadgetsGalore instead. GadgetsGalore is also listed on the ASX. The Commissioner considers that the arrangement is materially different from the arrangement identified in the private ruling, because the tax outcome is capable of being different to that provided for in the private ruling that Marama obtained. Shares listed on the ASX may be eligible for the exemption in s EX 31. If Marama’s rights in GadgetsGalore meet the requirements in s EX 31 it will be exempt from being an attributing interest in a FIF, and no FIF income will arise. However, if Marama’s rights in GadgetsGalore do not meet the requirements in s EX 31 it will not be exempt from being an attributing interest in a FIF, and FIF income may arise in Marama’s hands if all the other relevant requirements in s CQ 5 are met. Example 4: Difference affects only one of the sections ruled on Bric-a-Brac Limited obtains a private ruling in respect of how ss CA 1, CB 1, CB 2, CB 3, CB 4, CB 5 and CX 55 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply to an arrangement. The arrangement subsequently implemented is different from the arrangement identified in the ruling. The difference is capable of affecting how s CX 55 applies to the arrangement but is not capable of affecting how any of ss CA 1, CB 1, CB 2, CB 3, CB 4, or CB 5 apply to the arrangement. Section 91EB(2)(a) of the TAA provides that a “private ruling does not apply to a person in relation to a tax type for an arrangement, to the extent to which, in relation to the tax type, the arrangement is materially different from the arrangement identified in the ruling”. While the private ruling contains ruling bullet points in relation to multiple sections relating to 5 UNCLASSIFIED income tax, the private ruling is in relation to only one tax type (that is, income tax). As the difference between the arrangement identified in the ruling and the arrangement implemented is capable of affecting the tax outcomes ruled on, the ruling does not apply in relation to the relevant tax type (being income tax) for the arrangement. As the ruling was in relation to only one tax type (being income tax), the entire ruling does not apply. Example 5: Difference affects tax outcome not ruled on Bubble and Squeak Limited obtains a private ruling in relation to how ss CW 10 and CX 55 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply to an arrangement. The arrangement as implemented differs from the arrangement ruled on. However, the differences are not capable of affecting the tax outcomes ruled on – the differences are capable of affecting only the tax outcome in relation to s IC 5 (which was not ruled on). It is the Commissioner’s view that the arrangement is not “materially different” for the purpose of s 91EB(2)(a) of the TAA in these particular circumstances. This is because the differences between the arrangement ruled on and the arrangement implemented are not capable of affecting the tax outcomes ruled on. Example 6: Difference affects only one of the tax types ruled on Pitter Patter Limited obtains a private ruling that contains ruling bullet points in relation to income tax and ruling bullet points in relation to GST. The difference in the arrangement ruled on and the arrangement implemented is capable of affecting the GST outcome ruled on, but is not capable of affecting the income tax outcome ruled on. Under s 91EB(2)(a) of the TAA a “private ruling does not apply to a person in relation to a tax type for an arrangement, to the extent to which, in relation to the tax type the arrangement is materially different from the arrangement identified in the ruling”. Therefore, it is the Commissioner’s view that the private ruling does not apply to Pitter Patter Limited in relation to GST for the arrangement. This is because, in relation to the GST tax type, the difference between the arrangement identified in the ruling and the arrangement implemented is capable of affecting the manner in which the GST legislation ruled on applies to the arrangement. The private ruling continues to apply to Pitter Patter Limited and the arrangement in relation to the income tax legislation ruled on. Example 7: Difference may affect conclusion under s BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Property Projects Limited applies for and obtains a private ruling in relation to a new business venture that it is about to launch. The description of the arrangement contains a statement to the effect that Property Projects Limited uses, and will continue to use, IFRS. In the absence of that statement the Commissioner would not be able to rule as requested in relation to s BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Shortly after the private ruling is issued the IFRS thresholds are modified. Those falling under/outside the new thresholds are now able to choose whether to use IFRS or GAAP. Property Projects Limited chooses to continue using IFRS. As Property Projects Limited continues to use IFRS following the modification of the IFRS thresholds, the statement of fact contained in the description of the arrangement holds true. Therefore, it is the Commissioner’s view that the arrangement remains the same as that identified in the ruling. If Property Projects Limited starts using GAAP instead of IFRS following the modification of the IFRS thresholds, it is the Commissioner’s view that the revised arrangement is materially different from the arrangement identified in the private ruling as it is capable of affecting the tax outcome referred to in the ruling. 6 UNCLASSIFIED References Subject references Case references materially different Carey v Field \[2002\] FCA 1173 Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Dela Cruz (1992) 110 ALR 367 Rainey v Greater Glasgow Health Board \[1987\] 1 All ER 65 Vacuum Oil Co Pty Ltd v Longmuir \[1957\] VR 456 Legislative references Other references Tax Administration Act 1994 – ss 91EB(2)(a) and 91FB(2)(a) Oxford English Dictionary (online ed, Oxford University Press), accessed 13 February 2017
Date of issue: 13 April 2018 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question The Commissioner has issued a binding ruling that a general anti-avoidance provision does not apply to an ongoing arrangement. She later identifies some concerns that the conclusion may be incorrect and that the anti-avoidance provision may apply. Can the Commissioner take a different view on the application of a general anti- avoidance provision to an ongoing arrangement when a binding ruling that applies in relation to the general anti-avoidance provision expires? Answer Yes. The Commissioner can apply a new interpretation of the anti-avoidance provision to any period following the expiry of the ruling, as long as this does not have the effect of reversing the tax outcomes in the period covered by the ruling. The general anti-avoidance provisions do not require a different approach from other provisions. Explanation This item considers the situation where a binding private or product ruling has been 1. issued for an ongoing arrangement, and the Commissioner’s view of how the legislation applies to the arrangement subsequently changes. It is clear that if a binding ruling exists, the Commissioner cannot change her mind and 2. apply a different interpretation of the taxation laws to the arrangement during the QB 18/08 Binding Rulings – Effect of the Commissioner changing her mind in relation to the application of s BG 1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) is about Part 5A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and will be of interest to anyone who has been issued a binding private or product ruling for an ongoing arrangement on the application of a general anti-avoidance provision. This QWBA relates to an issue previously considered by the Taxpayer Rulings Unit and is not connected to the Commissioner’s review of the Interpretation Statement on Tax Avoidance. Key provision All legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Key terms general anti-avoidance provision means s BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and/or s 76 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 QB 17/08: 13 April 2018 2 UNCLASSIFIED period of the ruling, as long as the ruling has not ceased to apply for another reason. This is the case whether the Commissioner has formally withdrawn the ruling or not. It is also clear that the Commissioner can, as a general matter, apply a different 3. interpretation of the taxation laws to any period after the ruling expires where her view of the legislation has changed. Binding rulings legislation The binding rulings regime was enacted in 1995 to give taxpayers more certainty about 4. their tax affairs through public rulings and taxpayer-specific private and product rulings. Where a binding ruling has been issued that applies to a taxpayer, that taxpayer, by following the binding ruling, can be certain about how the Commissioner will apply the law. An application for a binding private or product ruling must disclose all relevant facts and documents relating to the arrangement for which the ruling is sought. The legislation relating to binding rulings is found in Part 5A. The binding nature of 5. private rulings is in s 91EA(1): Notwithstanding anything in any other Act, if— (a) a private ruling on a taxation law applies to a person in relation to an arrangement and a tax type for an arrangement; and (b) the person applies the taxation law for the tax type in the way stated in the ruling,— the Commissioner must apply the taxation law in relation to the person, the tax type, and the arrangement in accordance with the ruling. Section 91EB(1) sets out when a private ruling applies: 6. A private ruling on a taxation law for a tax type applies to a person in relation to an arrangement— (a) only if the taxation law is expressly referred to in the ruling; and (b) only for the period or tax year for which the ruling applies. Section 91EB(2) sets out when a private ruling does not apply. This item does not 7. apply if one of the situations in s 91EB(2) applies. Equivalent provisions apply for product rulings (ss 91FA(1) and 91FB). 8. In addition, s 91G provides that a binding ruling does not apply from the date a 9. taxation law is repealed or amended to the extent that the repeal or amendment changes the way the taxation law applies in the ruling. These provisions provide that a binding ruling applies only for the period set out in the 10. ruling. Nothing in the Act deems the approach in the ruling to be correct. The legislation merely requires the Commissioner to apply the tax laws to the person and the arrangement in accordance with the ruling for the period specified in the ruling. As such, the general position is that the Commissioner is required to follow the 11. approach set out in the ruling only for the period of the ruling. Once the term of the ruling has expired, the Commissioner may apply a different interpretation of the taxation laws to future years, if her view has changed, even for an ongoing transaction. The Commissioner will not make the decision to change her mind on an issue covered by a binding ruling lightly. This means that the decision to adopt a different interpretation must be made at an appropriate level in Inland Revenue, which in many cases will require involvement of the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel. The QB 17/08: 13 April 2018 3 UNCLASSIFIED Commissioner’s escalation policy and any relevant care and management factors also need to be taken into account, where appropriate. The existence of a binding ruling does not mean that the conclusion in the ruling is 12. (necessarily) correct; rather, the ruling binds the Commissioner as to how she will apply the taxation laws during the period of the ruling. Effect of anti-avoidance provisions It might be argued that this general position should not apply in the context of general 13. anti-avoidance provisions, on the basis that the effect of the general anti-avoidance provisions is that a “tax avoidance arrangement” is void against the Commissioner. The general anti-avoidance provisions apply to an entire “arrangement” and not to 14. specific income years or a specific part of the “arrangement”. Therefore, it could be argued that where the Commissioner has ruled that a general anti-avoidance provision does not apply, albeit for a set period, the effect of s 91EA(1) is that the entire arrangement that is the subject of the ruling is treated as not being void against the Commissioner, even if the Commissioner changes her mind. The Commissioner considers that such an argument is inconsistent with the provisions 15. of the Act that apply to rulings and the policy behind the rulings regime. One purpose of the binding rulings regime, as set out in s 91A, is to provide taxpayers with certainty about the way the Commissioner will apply taxation laws. As discussed above, a binding ruling provides certainty to a taxpayer only for the period stated in the ruling. This is consistent with comments made by officials in the 1994 document Binding Rulings on Taxation: A discussion document on the proposed regime that the Commissioner is bound by a ruling only while it remains in force. Binding rulings are not law, but are the Commissioner’s interpretation of the law in a 16. form that binds the Commissioner for the period of the ruling. The legally binding nature of a ruling means that even if the Commissioner considers the ruling’s conclusion to be incorrect, she is precluded from applying the correct interpretation to the transaction for the period of the ruling. However, the existence of a ruling stating that a general anti-avoidance provision does 17. not apply to an arrangement does not mean that the transaction is not a “tax avoidance arrangement”. Despite the existence of a favourable ruling, s BG 1 or s 76 may have always applied to void the relevant arrangement. Following expiry of the ruling, the Commissioner is not prevented from treating the arrangement as void in accordance with the relevant anti-avoidance provision, as long as she follows the approach in the ruling for the period that it applied. As noted above, the decision that the anti- avoidance provision applies must be made at the appropriate level in Inland Revenue, and the Commissioner’s escalation policy needs to be taken into account. Judicial review concepts, such as estoppel and legitimate expectation, also do not apply 18. to prevent the Commissioner from being able to change her mind where she has issued a binding ruling in relation to a general anti-avoidance provision. In general, the courts have held that these concepts have limited application to the Commissioner and that the Commissioner cannot be estopped because of a legitimate expectation based on the Commissioner’s past statements or actions. The only exception to this is where a taxpayer has a binding ruling that applies to a particular arrangement and the relevant period, which the courts have accepted is the only way in which to bind the Commissioner (see, for example, Westpac Banking Corp v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2008) 23 NZTC 21,694). QB 17/08: 13 April 2018 4 UNCLASSIFIED An argument that the existence of a binding ruling for a certain period gives rise to a 19. legitimate expectation that the Commissioner will continue to apply the same approach following expiry of the ruling must fail, as the binding rulings regime is quite clear about the scope and application of rulings. Therefore, nothing in the binding rulings legislation suggests that the general position 20. will not apply in relation to the general anti-avoidance provisions. Application of the new position and shortfall penalties It is clear that the Commissioner is not able to apply the new position retrospectively to 21. the period to which the ruling applied. The new position can only ever take effect following the expiration of the ruling. This means that care needs to be taken to ensure that applying the new position to the subsequent period does not have the effect of reversing the tax outcomes in the period that was covered by the ruling. In some situations, this may be difficult (if not impossible) to achieve. Legally, the Commissioner is required to follow the approach set out in the ruling only 22. for the period of the ruling. To obtain certainty on whether the same interpretation will apply in future years of an ongoing transaction, a taxpayer should apply for a reissue of the ruling. Once the term of the ruling has expired, the Commissioner is legally permitted to apply 23. a different interpretation of the taxation laws to any period that is not covered by the ruling. However, in specific cases the Commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to only apply the new interpretation prospectively, taking into account the particular circumstances of the case and relevant care and management factors. This would need to be considered on a case by case basis. Where the Commissioner has issued a binding ruling based on a particular 24. interpretation of the law, it would be very difficult to argue that that interpretation was not “as likely as not to be correct”. Accordingly, where a taxpayer relies on an interpretation in a ruling, they will not have taken an “unacceptable tax positon” and shortfall penalties will not apply. If the taxpayer continues to apply the same interpretation following expiry of the ruling, 25. it is highly unlikely that a “shortfall penalty” would apply, unless, for example the ruling has ceased to be valid due to factual or legislative changes, there have been relevant developments in case law or the Commissioner has advised the taxpayer of a change in interpretation (either specifically or through a public statement). This would need to be considered on a case by case basis. Other matters It might be considered that the Court of Appeal decision in Simunovich Fisheries Ltd v 26. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2002) 20 NZTC 17,456 (CA) requires a different outcome from the position outlined above. In that case, the Court of Appeal held that it was inconsistent for the Commissioner to treat an asset of the taxpayer as having a different character on sale from its characterisation at the time of purchase in a situation where the statute linked the treatment between the two. There may be rare situations involving particular types of legislative provisions where 27. parallels can be drawn with Simunovich and the existence of a ruling means the Commissioner cannot apply a different approach in the future. This is more likely to be the case if there were a statutory requirement to carry over a treatment from one period to another, such as in the trading stock and loss carry forward provisions. QB 17/08: 13 April 2018 5 UNCLASSIFIED However, the general anti-avoidance provisions do not contain or give rise to such a requirement, so the principle in Simunovich does not require a different outcome. The position outlined above for the general anti-avoidance provisions would also 28. generally apply for specific anti-avoidance provisions, although its application is slightly more complex and will depend on the nature of the specific provision. For specific anti- avoidance provisions that apply to ongoing arrangements (such as s GB 35(2) of the ITA), the Commissioner will be bound for only the period of the ruling. For specific anti-avoidance provisions that apply to a single event or a set point in time (such as s GB 21 of the ITA), the existence of a ruling that applies for that point in time will have the practical effect that the Commissioner is unable to change her mind. The following examples are included to help in explaining the application of the law. 29. Examples Example 1 - Commissioner changing view on application of s BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 following expiry of a ruling The Commissioner has issued a ruling that s BG 1 does not apply to a complex financing transaction. The period of the ruling is three years, but the transaction is ongoing. The applicant did not apply for a reissue of the ruling. In year five, following the expiry of the ruling, the Commissioner determines that the transaction is a “tax avoidance arrangement” and that s BG 1 should apply. The Commissioner can apply s BG 1 to the periods following expiry of the ruling, including year four, as long as doing so does not change the treatment for the period to which the ruling applies. Example 2 – impossible to apply new interpretation An applicant has entered into an ongoing management agreement, under which they pay a lump sum fee on day one. The Commissioner has issued a ruling that an amount is deductible in full when it is paid, which results in the taxpayer having a loss to carry forward. Following the expiry of the ruling, the Commissioner determines that s BG 1 applies to the Arrangement, and that the amount should have been treated as not being deductible, with the effect that the taxpayer should not be able to carry forward the loss. As denying the loss carry forward would have the effect of reversing the decision in the ruling, the Commissioner is unable to do so.

Date of issue: 23 May 2018 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question Can sharemilkers and contract milkers use the approach in IS 17/02 and claim a 20% deduction for farmhouse expenditure? Answer Yes – sharemilkers and contract milkers may use the approach in IS 17/02 to claim a 20% deduction for farmhouse expenditure (for example, power and insurance bills) without calculating actual business use of the farmhouse, if:  they carry on a sharemilking or contract-milking business as sole traders or a partnership independent from the farm owner’s business;  the business is of sufficient scale to require its own home office and centre of operations in the sharemilker’s or contract milker’s farmhouse; and  the sharemilker or contract milker’s farmhouse is used in a similar manner to and to a similar extent as other farmhouses on type 1 farms. QB 18/09 Income tax – can sharemilkers and contract milkers deduct farmhouse expenditure using the approach in IS 17/02? QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED The Commissioner’s view on the appropriate treatment of farmhouse expenses in different circumstances is set out in the interpretation statement “IS 17/02: Income tax – deductibility of farmhouse expenses”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 4 (May 2017): 82. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) clarifies the approach for sharemilkers and contract milkers. Key references “IS 17/02: Income tax – deductibility of farmhouse expenses” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 4 (May 2017) called “IS 17/02” in this QWBA. Key terms Type 1 farm: a farm where the cost or value of the farmhouse is less than 20% of the cost or value of the farm. IS 17/02 allows sole traders and partnerships on type 1 farms to claim an automatic 20% of certain farmhouse expenditure. All other farms are type 2 farms and have to do a home office calculation. sharemilker: a person working on a dairy farm under a sharemilking agreement who is entitled to receive a share of the profits from the dairy farming operations. Contract milker: a person carrying on a business like a “sharemilker” except they operate under a contract milking agreement and are paid on the basis of production instead of a profit share. QB 18/09: 23 May 2018 2 UNCLASSIFIED Explanation 1. IS 17/02 concerns deductions for farmhouse expenditure where that expenditure has both private and business elements. A deduction is available only to the extent that the expense is incurred in carrying on the farming business. IS 17/02 draws a distinction between how type 1 and type 2 farms calculate business use. The Commissioner allows sole traders and partnerships on type 1 farms to claim automatic deductions for farmhouse expenditure at fixed rates (although they can do a calculation if they wish). Type 2 farms must do a home office calculation, or use the formula in s DB 18AA of the Income Tax Act 2007, to calculate actual business use. 2. Sharemilkers and contract milkers who live on the farm are likely to incur farmhouse expenditure that has some nexus with their business. The Commissioner has been asked to clarify whether sharemilkers and contract milkers can claim a 20% deduction of farmhouse expenditure following the type 1 approach. Scope of this QWBA 3. “Sharemilking” is the arrangement where a farm owner supplies the dairy farm and the sharemilker provides the labour and resources to run the farm. The sharemilker runs the milking shed, oversees milk production, is responsible for herd management and manages some aspects of the farm (this will vary depending on the terms of the sharemilking agreement). Herd owning sharemilkers usually provide the herd and commonly receive around a 50% share of the dairy company pay-out. Variable order sharemilkers usually work with a herd belonging to the farm owner (although they may also own cows) and receive 20-29% of the pay-out. Contract milking is very similar to sharemilking in terms of the contractual obligations, but they are primarily paid based on a set number of cents per kilo of milk solids, instead of a share of the profits. For both sharemilkers and contract milkers a direct correlation exists between the level of milk production achieved and their income. 4. A sharemilker undertakes to perform the work of a dairy farmer under a sharemilking agreement and is entitled under the agreement to receive a share of the returns or profits from the dairy farming operation. This definition of “sharemilker” is consistent with s 2 of the Sharemilking Agreements Act 1937 and the similar definition in the schedule of the Sharemilking Agreements Order 2011. 5. In this QWBA, a “contract milker” carries out the same role on a dairy farm and performs the same tasks as a sharemilker. The difference is that they operate under a contract milking agreement (rather than a sharemilking agreement) and are paid based on production rather than receiving a share of the profits. 6. This QWBA applies only to sharemilkers and contract milkers who are operating as sole traders or as partners in a partnership and are provided with a farmhouse on the farm. Where a sharemilker or contract milker is operating through a company or trust they should refer to the principles in IS 17/02 to determine deductibility. 7. This QWBA applies only to sharemilking and contract milking where the scale of the business requires the sharemilker’s or contract milker’s farmhouse to be used as an integral part of their business. As well as carrying out administrative tasks and business planning from the farmhouse, the business will often have employees and employee meetings will be held there. The farmhouse is often used to store farm equipment owned by the sharemilker or contract milker as part of their business. QB 18/09: 23 May 2018 3 UNCLASSIFIED 8. This QWBA does not apply to employees or other farm contractors. For guidance in determining whether a person is an employee, see the interpretation guideline IG 16/01: “Determining employment status for tax purposes (employee or independent contractor?)”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 3 (April 2016): 97. Deductibility of farmhouse expenses 9. For an expense to be deductible under s DA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, a sufficient relationship (nexus) must exist between the expense incurred by the taxpayer and the deriving of assessable income or the carrying on of a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. Also, a deduction is not available under s DA 1 to the extent the general limitations in s DA 2 apply, including in this context, a limitation on private expenses. 10. Whether an expense is deductible will depend on the particular facts of each case. In the context of farmhouse expenses, it will be necessary to determine who has incurred the expense and in what capacity. The farmhouse expenditure incurred by sharemilkers and contract milkers is likely to be relatively modest and include gas, power and insurance. Where sharemilkers and contract milkers incur this type of expenditure, s DA 1 will usually be satisfied. However, s DA 1 is only satisfied to the extent that the farmhouse is used for business purposes. To the extent that the farmhouse is used for private purposes, s DA 1 is unlikely to be satisfied, and s DA 2 will prohibit the deduction for private expenditure. Whether sharemilkers and contract milkers may be treated as farmers on a type 1 farm and claim a 20% deduction for farmhouse expenditure 11. Usually, taxpayers would do a home office calculation to ascertain business use of a private residence. However, using IS 17/02 some farmers operating as sole traders or partnerships can adopt a practical approach. This approach balances the strict application of the law with the associated compliance cost of doing so, while maintaining equity between taxpayers and protecting the integrity of the tax system. Farmers on a type 1 farm are allowed an automatic 20% deduction for farmhouse expenses and 100% deductions for rates and interest (rates and interest will be incurred by the farm owner rather than the sharemilker or contract milker). 12. Type 1 farms are those where the value of the farmhouse is less than 20% of the total value of the farm. The Commissioner accepts that sharemilkers and contract milkers will operate only on type 1 farms, because of the scale of operations carried out on dairy farms. Because of the amount of land required, the milking shed and plant, barns, stand-off and run-off pads and other assets, the farm’s value is usually quite significant, so the type 1 farm definition is met. 13. In terms of business use, the 20% deduction is intended to be a reasonable approximation of business use of the farmhouses on all type 1 farms across the country. It will not be correct in every instance (and farmers may still do their own calculation if they wish). For sharemilkers and contract milkers, actual business use of the farmhouse will depend on their particular circumstances. This is no different to other type 1 farms where the use of the farmhouse varies from farm to farm. 14. Although use of the farmhouse will vary from dairy farm to dairy farm the Commissioner accepts that sharemilkers and contract milkers (as described in this QWBA) will generally use the farmhouse for staff meetings, preparing food, feeding staff and farm visitors, business meetings, administration, record keeping, storing equipment, business planning and office work, completing regulatory requirements and so on. On this basis, the use of the farmhouse occupied by the sharemilker or contract milker is equivalent to that on other type 1 farms. QB 18/09: 23 May 2018 4 UNCLASSIFIED 15. As sharemilkers and contract milkers are on type 1 farms and using the farmhouse they occupy in an equivalent way to other type 1 farmers they are permitted to use the approach in IS 17/02 to claim a 20% deduction for farmhouse expenditure. QB 18/09: 23 May 2018 5 UNCLASSIFIED 16. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Examples Example 1 – Sharemilkers Luke and Betty are herd owning sharemilkers in Taranaki operating as a partnership. They have just signed a sharemilking agreement and will take their herd of 300 cows to Justin’s farm. The agreement provides for a 50:50 split of proceeds from the dairy company. Under the sharemilking agreement, Luke and Betty are provided with land on the farm for their cows and a farmhouse for their family. They are responsible for providing equipment, working dogs and farm labour. In terms of farmhouse expenditure Luke and Betty pay for gas, power and contents insurance. Justin pays the rates, interest on loans and buildings insurance. As sharemilkers on a type 1 farm Luke and Betty can use the approach for farmers on type 1 farms in IS 17/02. They may claim a deduction of 20% for their gas, electricity and insurance expenses without having to calculate actual business use. Example 2 – Contract milkers Marion and Barry are contract milkers in the Wairarapa operating as a partnership. They have a year-to-year contract milking agreement with the farm owner Ted. Ted has spent the last few years building up a beef and lamb farm with his son in another district. Ted lives on the beef and lamb farm but intends to return to his own farm in a couple of years. Ted owns the herd of 440 cows, and Marion and Barry milk and manage the herd. Ted is “hands off” but he deals with the dairy company and visits regularly to check on things such as the amount of feed on hand and the health of the cows. Day-to-day running of the farm is left to Marion and Barry. They have Alan working for them full time. Alan stays in a separate cottage on the farm. During busy periods, they also employ other farm workers to work in the milking sheds or on the farm. Marion and Barry were previously variable order sharemilkers but changed to contract milking because of the volatility in dairy prices. Their day-to-day work remains the same but they are now paid a set amount per kilo of milk solids. As part of the contract milking agreement they live in the main farmhouse on the farm. Marion and Barry run their contracting milking business and manage the farm from their farmhouse. They use their farmhouse for meetings with their staff and for other business meetings and planning. The farmhouse kitchen is used to prepare food for the staff and Alan often eats his meals at the kitchen table. The farmhouse has a home office where Marion and Barry complete the many administrative and regulatory requirements. The farmhouse is also used to store farm equipment. Marion and Barry are contract milkers and can use the approach for farmers on type 1 farms in IS 17/02 to claim 20% of relevant farmhouse expenditure without having to do a home office calculation. Alan may not use this approach because he is not a “contract milker” for the purposes of the QWBA.

Date of issue: 21 June 2018 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question What payments by parents to state schools are gifts for donation tax credit purposes? Answer Payments by parents to state schools are gifts for donation tax credit purposes where the payment is voluntary and is a payment to the school:  to assist generally with funding its costs, including the cost of delivery of the school’s curriculum; or  for a specific purpose or project to benefit the school as a whole where no material benefit or advantage is obtained in return for making the payment; or  to assist with the school’s cost of delivering individual subjects or activities forming part of the school’s curriculum and in which the student may participate regardless of whether any payment is made. Explanation Scope of this Question We’ve Been Asked 1. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) addresses payments made by parents to state non- integrated schools and partnership schools kura hourua in New Zealand. In this QWBA state non-integrated schools are referred to as “state schools”, and include partnership schools kura hourua. Any references to a state school’s board of trustees should be read as including a reference to the sponsor of a partnership school kura hourua. Further, the word “parents” includes guardians and caregivers of students who also make payments to state schools. No payments to state schools are compulsory except for optional goods and services that parents have agreed to purchase. Therefore, many payments made by parents to state schools may qualify as gifts for donation tax credit purposes. School boards and administrators need to understand which payments made by parents may qualify as gifts so schools can issue donation tax receipts. Key provisions Income Tax Act 2007, ss LD 1 to LD 3 Education Act 1989, s 3 Key term State schools are state non- integrated schools, and include partnership schools kura hourua. Also see: Inland Revenue QB 16/05 Income tax – donee organisations and gifts QB 18/11 Income tax – state integrated schools and donation tax credits BR Pub 18/06 Goods and services tax - payments made by parents to state and state integrated schools Ministry of Education Circular 2018/01 Payments by parents of students in schools QB 18/10 Income tax – state schools and donation tax credits QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED 2 UNCLASSIFIED 2. This QWBA does not address payments:  by parents to state integrated schools or private schools in New Zealand (state integrated schools are addressed in QB 18/11 Income tax – state integrated schools and donation tax credits);  made for international students to attend state non-integrated schools; or  payments to entities (such as charitable trusts or parent–teacher associations) that are associated with a state non-integrated school but are separate entities from the school. 3. This QWBA refers to Circular 2018/01 Payments by parents of students in schools (Ministry of Education, 2018), which provides guidance on payments by parents of students in state and state integrated schools, and partnership schools kura hourua. 4. The examples from \[47\] illustrate how the donation tax credit rules apply for state schools. State school statutory environment 5. In New Zealand, students attending state schools (other than international students) from the ages of 5 to 19 are entitled to free enrolment and free education. International students are generally any students who are not New Zealand citizens or residents. 6. Section 3 of the Education Act 1989 provides: 3 Right to free primary and secondary education Except as provided in this Act, every person who is not an international student is entitled to free enrolment and free education at any State school or partnership school kura hourua during the period beginning on the person’s fifth birthday and ending on 1 January after the person’s 19th birthday. 7. The Education Act 1989 does not define what free enrolment and free education means for schools. However, it involves the delivery of the national curriculum by schools. The Education Act 1989 establishes the overall framework for the delivery of education by state schools, by publishing various curriculum statements, guidelines, and national performance measures under s 60A of the Education Act 1989. The central component of that framework is the national curriculum, which comprises the New Zealand Curriculum and Te Marautanga o Aotearoa. The national curriculum sets out a common direction for teaching and learning in New Zealand schools. 8. The board of trustees of every state school must develop a charter (or, from 2019, a four-year strategic plan and an annual implementation plan) and a detailed curriculum for its school, that align with the intent of the national curriculum and the school community’s values and expectations. The board is then required to implement its school’s curriculum in accordance with the priorities set out in the National Education Goals and the National Administration Guidelines. Ministry of Education guidance in Circular 2018/01 9. The Education Act 1989 does not give any guidance on the types of payments boards of trustees of state schools may ask for from parents, but it is implicit that state schools cannot charge for something that is part of a student’s statutory entitlement to free enrolment and free education. The Ministry of Education confirms this in Circular 2018/01. 10. According to Circular 2018/01, a school may ask parents for donations to assist with funding its costs, including the cost of delivering the school’s curriculum. The donations requested 3 UNCLASSIFIED may be general donations (that is, donations for an unspecified purpose) or specified donations (that is, donations for a particular purpose such as books or sports equipment). Circular 2018/01, advises schools that if a specified donation is requested for an activity forming part of the delivery of the school’s curriculum, students cannot be excluded from participating in the activity if the parent chooses not to make all or part of the contribution. 11. Sometimes schools may offer for sale consumables, take-home items (such as items made in technology classes), stationery, clothing and optional activities that are not part of the delivery of the school’s curriculum. Schools may charge for these optional consumables and activities where the parents have agreed to buy them, but parents are not obliged to buy them. Any payment for these optional things is not a donation. 12. Circular 2018/01 also explains that schools must not pressure parents to make donations. No payments sought from parents of students attending state schools are compulsory except for charges for optional goods and services that parents have agreed to purchase. Schools cannot withhold education services, information or privileges from students if their parents choose not to make the requested donations or make only part of the requested donation. Donation tax credit rules 13. Under the Income Tax Act 2007, a donation tax credit may be available for charitable or other public benefit gifts made by a parent to a state school if the requirements in ss LD 1 to LD 3 are met. The phrase “charitable or other public benefit gift” is defined in s LD 3(1) to mean a monetary gift of $5 or more paid to a qualifying organisation (referred to as a donee organisation). 14. Since 2008, the boards of trustees of state schools have been listed as donee organisations in s LD 3(2)(bb). Before 2008, state schools qualified as donee organisations because the advancement of education is a charitable purpose and they otherwise met the requirements of s LD 3. 15. As the boards of trustees of state schools are donee organisations a parent who makes a monetary “gift” of $5 or more to such a board can claim a donation tax credit of one third of the payment amount at the end of the relevant tax year, provided the parent meets the other requirements for claiming a tax credit. These requirements include the parent holding a donation tax receipt from the school. Inland Revenue processes all claims for donation tax credits, and, ultimately, it is the Commissioner who decides whether a parent is entitled to a tax credit for a payment made to a state school on the basis that she is satisfied the parent has made a qualifying charitable or other public benefit gift to the school. Charitable or other public benefit gifts 16. While the phrase “charitable or other public benefit gift” is defined in s LD 3(1), the term “gift” is not defined in the Income Tax Act. In the absence of a statutory definition of “gift”, the Commissioner considers “gift” should be given its ordinary meaning. This is consistent with the Court of Appeal’s decision in Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154. New Zealand case law on the ordinary meaning of “gift” is limited, so the Commissioner considers it appropriate to take guidance from overseas case law. 17. It is likely the New Zealand courts (like the Canadian courts before them) will follow the approach taken by the Australian courts on the ordinary meaning of “gift”. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that, for the purposes of s LD 3(1) and state schools, a “gift” is a payment by a parent to a school of money of $5 or more: 4 UNCLASSIFIED  made voluntarily;  by way of benefaction; and  in return for which the parent receives no material benefit or advantage. For a more general discussion on what is a gift see QB 16/05 Income tax – donee organisations and gifts. 18. When deciding whether a parent’s payment to a state school is a gift, the true nature of the payment is to be determined by considering the overall arrangements and transactions giving rise to the payment. The name or description given to a payment is not determinative of its true nature. Voluntary payment 19. According to Circular 2018/01 the only compulsory payments parents are required to make to a school are attendance dues payable to the proprietor of a state integrated school. In all schools, payment can be enforced where the parents have agreed to purchase optional goods and services from the school. Otherwise, all other payments parents may be asked to make to schools are voluntary in the sense that the school cannot compel parents to make the payments. Parents can choose whether to make requested voluntary payments in full, in part, or not at all. However, just because these payments are “voluntary” does not mean they are automatically gifts for income tax purposes. 20. To qualify as a gift, a parent’s payment to a school must be made voluntarily. For gifting purposes, this means that the payment is made willingly, freely by choice and for benevolent reasons. It also means that a parent’s payment must not be made under an arrangement (contractual or otherwise) where the payment is made in return for a material benefit or advantage. Similarly, a payment may not be voluntary where there is some agreement, understanding or expectation that the school is to do or provide something in return for the payment. (The link between the payment and the material benefit is discussed from \[30\].) 21. The absence of a contract or a legal obligation on a parent to contribute to a school does not automatically mean payments are voluntary and therefore gifts. There may be circumstances where, even though a parent has no legal obligation to make a payment to a school, the payment will still not be a gift for donation tax credit purposes. For example, where a student’s participation in an activity is dependent on the parent’s payment. 22. Occasionally, pressure might be applied (by the school or by other parents) on a parent to make a contribution. This pressure can create a sense of moral obligation on the parent to contribute. While a payment may be voluntary even if it is made under a sense of moral obligation, in some circumstances the Commissioner considers pressure might also be evidence that a payment is being made under an arrangement between the school and the parent where the payment is being made in return for a material benefit or advantage. In those circumstances, the payment will not be voluntary, and so will not be a gift. Benefaction 23. The requirement that a gift is made voluntarily is connected with the concept of benefaction and the belief that gifts usually proceed from a “detached and disinterested generosity”. Benefaction is the idea that a gift is made to provide an advantage to or to do good for the recipient. Benefaction is an important element of a gift in its ordinary sense; when it is absent there can be no gift (Leary v FCT (1980) 32 ALR 221). 5 UNCLASSIFIED 24. In the context of contributions made by parents to state schools, benefaction is the idea that a parent’s payment will provide an advantage to or do good for the school in some way. For example, a voluntary contribution by a parent towards the school’s cost of delivering the curriculum will help the school achieve its charitable purpose of advancing education. Material benefit or advantage in return 25. A parent’s voluntary payment to a state school will not be a gift if it is made under an arrangement where the parent expects a material benefit or advantage in return for making the payment. It is sufficient that an understanding or expectation (clear or implicit) exists between the parent and the school that the payment is being made in return for a material benefit or advantage. 26. In Case M128 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,825 Judge Barber held that payments by a parent for the cost of a field trip for his son to Mount Aspiring was not a gift because the payment gave the student the right to participate in the trip and was not for the common good of the school. He similarly found that other school charges were not gifts as they all conferred rights on the student, such as the right to attend camp, the right to use and own stationery and the right to own a manual. 27. The Commissioner considers a parent’s payment to a state school will not be a “gift” where:  the parent’s payment is made in return for a material benefit or advantage; or  the school is placed under an obligation to do or provide something in return for the parent making the payment. 28. A material benefit or advantage does not need to come directly from the school and does not need to be received directly by the parent who made the payment (for example, the student may receive the benefit) so long as under the arrangement the material benefit or advantage is in return for the parent making the payment. 29. A benefit or advantage will be considered “material” if it is of substance and can be valued or owned or both. (Sometimes these benefits are referred to as pecuniary or proprietary benefits.) A benefit or advantage will not be material if it is intangible and cannot be valued or owned. Non-material benefits or advantages include such things as public acknowledgement (for example, when a parent’s name is printed in a school newsletter to acknowledge their gift). This is different from a material benefit such as where a parent’s business is advertised in the school’s newsletter in return for the parent making the payment. Sufficient link between payment and benefit or advantage 30. Importantly, not every material benefit or advantage will necessarily disqualify a voluntary payment from being a gift. Sometimes a voluntary payment may be a gift even if the parent obtains a material benefit or advantage. This happens when the connection between the payment and the benefit is weak (for example, where a benefit will be obtained by the giver regardless of whether the gift is made). In this example, although a benefit is received, the payment cannot be said to be made in return for the benefit, as the benefit will be obtained anyway. The extent and strength of any link between the parent’s payment and a benefit or advantage can be an important factor in determining whether a payment is a gift. 31. This point is illustrated by two Australian Board of Review decisions concerning payments made to two different ambulance services: Case D55 72 ATC 339 and Case F40 74 ATC 223. 6 UNCLASSIFIED In Case D55 the board held payments to an ambulance service were gifts, while in Case F40 the same board considered payments to a different ambulance service were not gifts. 32. In Case D55 the giver made payroll-giving–type payments to a free ambulance service operating in his home district. The payments were not made under a contract between the giver and the ambulance service. The giver was already entitled to a free service from the ambulance service and there was no evidence of any representation that by making the payments he would receive any material benefit or quid pro quo in return. Given these factors, and even though the giver was entitled to free ambulance services, the board concluded that the payments were gifts. This was because the payments were made voluntarily by the giver, not in return for the ambulance services and the payments were for what the giver considered to be a good cause. A sufficient link did not exist between the benefits to the giver and the payments to prevent the payments from being gifts. 33. In Case F40 the ambulance service operated under different rules. A person who made a payment to the ambulance centre was entitled to receive a free treatment and transport service within the area for one year and would be eligible to be elected to the centre’s committee and to vote in elections for the committee. The board held that a contract existed between the centre and the payer under which the centre had an obligation to provide free services to the payer in return for the payment. If the payment had not been made, the payer would not have been entitled to free services. A strong dependency existed between the payment and the free services, so the payment was not a gift. Unlike in Case D55, the payer was not entitled to the benefit of free ambulance services regardless of whether the payment was made. 34. In New Zealand, the statutory right to free education means students attending state schools are statutorily entitled to the delivery of the school’s curriculum regardless of whether their parents make donations in full, in part or not at all to assist with the cost of the delivery of that curriculum, or even if no parents make donations. The Commissioner considers that, generally, a student’s statutory right to free education will mean a sufficient link does not exist between a parent’s voluntary payment to assist a state school and any benefit obtained by the student in return. This is because the school is obliged to deliver the school’s curriculum to the student regardless of whether the parent’s payment is made, so the payment is being made to benefit the school rather than being made in return for education. 35. Case J76 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,451 provides some support for the view that a state school student’s statutory right to free education means a sufficient link does not generally exist between a parent’s voluntary payment to assist the school and any benefit obtained by the student. Case J76 concerned a claim by the objector, a parish priest, that payments he made to ensure disadvantaged children obtained appropriate schooling were gifts and he should be entitled to a rebate under s 56A(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 36. Judge Keane found there was no doubt that the payments were made out of charity. But he found no suggestion that the schools would have educated the children if the priest had not made the payments. Therefore, the payments placed the schools under a contractual duty to educate the children. The priest’s payments were not gifts. Judge Keane’s decision suggests that if the schools had had an existing obligation to educate the children, then the priest’s payments might have been gifts, because they would have been made to fund the schools’ charitable purposes (that is, the advancement of education). Instead, in the absence of the schools having any pre-existing obligations, the payments were held to be made in return for the schools’ educational services. 7 UNCLASSIFIED 37. The strength of any link between a payment and a benefit or advantage can usually be determined by considering all the circumstances surrounding the gift, including, in the case of state schools, a student’s statutory right to free education. However, the stronger the connection between a parent’s payment and any material benefit or advantage obtained in return, the less likely it is that the payment will qualify as a gift. It is also important to remember that gifts ordinarily proceed from an intention on the part of the giver to provide an advantage or to do good for the recipient – (that is, the school). Gifting in the state school environment General donations 38. State schools may ask parents for donations to assist generally with funding their costs, including the cost of delivering the school’s curriculum. Where the donations requested are general donations (that is, donations for an unspecified purpose), the school may issue a donation tax receipt, providing the payments are made voluntarily by the parents to benefit the school. 39. The benefit parents and students get from making general donations to assist a school with its costs, including the cost of delivering its curriculum will not prevent the parent’s payments from being gifts. This is because students attending state schools are entitled to free education. Therefore, parents of students at state schools are entitled to expect their children will receive the education their school has undertaken to provide regardless of whether the parent makes any general donations. As a result, the Commissioner considers an insufficient link exists between a parent’s general donation and any benefit obtained, so the parent’s payment is not made in return for the benefit. Voluntary payments for specific purposes or projects 40. Sometimes parents are asked to assist schools with funding special projects for a school (for example, to assist with developing a computer lab or for books for the school library). Gifts for specific purposes or projects may not always be a contribution towards the cost of delivering the school’s curriculum, so they can be different from general school donations in that regard. However, the fact a school seeks donations for a specific project will not, in itself, prevent the payment being a gift. In the Commissioner’s view, a payment made for a specific purpose or project will be a gift so long as it has the attributes of a gift. 41. Further, the fact the parent or their child may be among those who ultimately benefit from a project may not disqualify the payment from being a gift if the payment is not made in return for the relevant benefit or advantage. 42. However, it is acknowledged that when schools request contributions for specific purposes rather than as general donations, this could give rise to circumstances where a parent’s payment is sufficiently linked to a relevant benefit or advantage for the payment to be viewed as made in return for the benefit or advantage. The stronger the connection between a parent’s payment and any material benefit or advantage obtained in return, the more likely it is that the payment will not qualify as a gift. This is particularly so where the school requests a payment for a specific purpose that benefits an individual student or a narrow group of students rather than the school as a whole. 43. Therefore, a gift made for a specific purpose may qualify for a donation tax credit even where it is not a contribution towards the cost of delivering the school’s curriculum. The fact the parent or their child may be among those who ultimately benefit from a project may not disqualify the payment from being a gift. However, where the benefit obtained is more direct 8 UNCLASSIFIED and more closely linked to the payment, there may be circumstances that mean the payment is not a gift for donation tax credit purposes. Voluntary payments for individual subjects or curriculum activities 44. Where a parent makes a voluntary payment towards the school’s cost of delivering an individual subject or activity that forms part of the school’s curriculum for their child, that payment will be a gift only if it can be clearly established that the student has a right to participate in the subject or activity regardless of whether their parent makes a requested payment. If a student has a right to participate in the subject or activity regardless of whether their parent makes all or part of the requested payment to the school, then in the Commissioner’s view the voluntary payment is made to advantage the school and is not made in return for participation. Voluntary payments for non-curriculum activities 45. Where a parent makes a voluntary contribution towards the cost of delivering an activity or thing that does not form part of the school’s curriculum, that payment will be a gift only if, in fact, it is voluntary, it is to do good for the school, and a sufficient link does not exist between the payment and the activity or the thing for the payment to be viewed as made in return for the relevant benefit. The statutory right to free education does not apply in those circumstances to weaken the link between the payment and the benefit. 46. Therefore, in many cases payments for a student’s right to participate in non-curriculum activities will not be gifts. This is because those payments are made for the right to participate in the activities, or for the thing. 47. The following examples explain the application of the donation tax credit rules for state schools. The examples are consistent with the guidance in Circular 2018/01. None of the students in the examples are international students. Example 1: Annual donation 48. Along with the first newsletter for the school year, Cindi receives a printed statement from her son’s primary school showing a request for an annual donation of $125 to assist the school with its general operating costs for the year. Cindi wants to help her son’s school but on top of having to buy a new school uniform she cannot afford the full requested amount so she pays $80. This is a gift for donation tax credit purposes, so the school issues Cindi with a donation tax receipt for $80. 49. Cindi’s payment will be a gift for donation tax credit purposes, whether she chooses to pay:  $125 as requested; or  less than $125; or  more than $125. Examples 9 UNCLASSIFIED Example 2: Books for the library 50. Jillian has two children, Finn and Anna, at the local primary school. The school is trying to improve literacy throughout the school and has asked families if they would like to donate towards the school purchasing books for the school library. Jillian thinks it is a great idea. She particularly likes that the books will be an enduring benefit for the whole school to enjoy. Jillian happily donates $50 to the school for books for the library. 51. This is a gift for donation tax credit purposes and the school can issue Jillian with a donation tax receipt. The fact the gift is for a specific purpose (to purchase books) does not prevent the payment being a gift. Also, the fact Finn and Anna may benefit from the gift also does not prevent the payment being a gift because a sufficient link does not exist between the payment by Jillian and the benefit her children may obtain by being able to borrow books from the library. Example 3: School stationery pack 52. At the beginning of the school year, Fiona’s daughter Tui’s school offers parents the choice of purchasing a stationery pack from the school or taking a stationery list and purchasing the stationery from a local store. Fiona chooses to purchase a stationery pack from the school for Tui. 53. Fiona can voluntarily choose whether to purchase the pack from the school, so the payment for the pack is not a gift to the school. It is a payment made in return for the stationery pack. The school does not issue Fiona with a donation tax receipt. Example 4: NCEA level 2 biology contribution 54. Jack is in Year 12 at his local college and has chosen to study National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) level 2 biology. The college has requested the following voluntary payments from Jack’s parents given his biology subject selection:  $20 to assist the school with the cost of a biology field trip to the local mud flats (attendance is a compulsory part of course requirements for the internal achievement standard); and  $30 for a biology work book (optional but recommended). 55. Jack’s parents agree to purchase the workbook and make the requested voluntary contribution to assist the college with the cost of the field trip. 56. The school administrator issues a donation tax receipt to Jack’s parents for $20. The school provides Jack with a biology workbook. The voluntary payment towards the school’s field trip is a gift, but the $30 payment for the purchase of the optional workbook is not a gift. 57. The reason the contribution to assist the school with the cost of the biology field trip is a gift is because there a sufficient link does not exist between the payment and the benefit obtained by Jack. Under the Education Act 1989, Jack is entitled to free education. The field trip is part of the delivery of the school’s curriculum. Jack can attend even if his parents choose not to make any or part of the requested payment. The field trip will go ahead regardless of whether Jack or any of his classmate’s parents make the payment. Payments by the parents are not made in return for the biology field trip. 58. If the biology workbook was required (rather than optional) it becomes part of the delivery of the college’s curriculum. In that case Jack’s parents could not be compelled to purchase the 10 UNCLASSIFIED workbook, but the college could ask for a voluntary contribution towards the college’s cost of providing it. Jack would be entitled to use the workbook regardless of whether his parents make any voluntary contribution. Any contribution towards the cost of the workbook is a donation, so the school could issue a donation tax receipt. Example 5: Overnight camping trip 59. Cameron is in year 5 at Mountain Ridge Primary School. Every year the school arranges an overnight camping trip to the Mountain Ridge Forest Park for its year 5 and 6 classes. The camping trip forms part of the school’s curriculum and all year 5 and 6 students are expected to attend. The students travel in buses to the forest park and camp overnight, cooking their own meals and practising bush craft skills. 60. The school asks Cameron’s parents for a voluntary contribution towards the cost of the camping trip. Payment is not compulsory, and Cameron’s parents are free to pay all, part or none of the requested amount. Cameron can participate in the camping trip along with his year 5 and year 6 classmates regardless of whether his parents make a contribution. 61. Cameron’s parents choose to make a generous contribution to the school to assist the school with the cost of the camping trip. The contribution is a gift, and the school issues a donation tax receipt to Cameron’s parents. 62. The reason the contribution towards the school’s overnight camping trip is a gift is because a sufficient link does not exist between the payment and the benefit obtained by Cameron. Under the Education Act 1989, Cameron is entitled to a free education. Participating in the camping trip is part of the delivery of the school’s curriculum. The camping trip will go ahead regardless of whether Cameron or any of his year’s parents make any payment. Payments by the parents are not made in return for the camping trip. Example 6: High-performance sports coach 63. Roisin is a member of her secondary school’s premier hockey team, which plays in the Tuesday night inter-college competition. Her coach has organised for the team to have a skills training session with a high-performance coach. All team members are expected to attend the session, and parents have been asked to contribute $30 each towards the cost of the session. Even though the training session does not form part of the delivery of the school’s curriculum, the school office has helped by adding the requested amount to each team member’s school account. 64. The parents’ payments are in return for the training session. This payment is not a gift so the school does not issue a donation tax receipt. Example 7: Cloud storage offer 65. High Tops Intermediate School has chosen to deliver the curriculum to its students using a software package that requires each student to have a minimum amount of cloud storage space available to them. The school has asked for voluntary contributions of $20 towards the cost of this storage space. 66. These contributions are gifts, and the school can issue a donation tax receipt to parents who choose to contribute, at whatever level. 67. The school also advises parents that they can purchase an additional amount of cloud storage space for their child (over and above the minimum required for effective curriculum delivery) 11 UNCLASSIFIED for $30. This additional storage space is not needed for delivery of the curriculum, therefore the payment, if made by a parent who takes up the school’s offer, is not a gift. The parent makes the payment in return for the additional storage space. The school does not issue a donation tax receipt.

Date of issue: 21 June 2018 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question What payments by parents to state integrated schools are gifts for donation tax credit purposes? Answer Payments by parents to state integrated schools are gifts for donation tax credit purposes where the payment is voluntary and is a payment to:  the board of trustees to assist generally with funding its costs, including the cost of delivery of the school’s curriculum; or  the board of trustees or a qualifying proprietor for a specific purpose or project to benefit the school as a whole where no material benefit or advantage is obtained in return for making the payment; or  the board of trustees to assist with the school’s cost of delivering individual subjects or activities forming part of the school’s curriculum and in which the student may participate regardless of whether any payment is made; or  a qualifying proprietor to assist the proprietor with its cost of supporting the delivery of the school’s curriculum with special character. Explanation Scope of this Question We’ve Been Asked 1. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) addresses payments parents make to boards of trustees and proprietors of state integrated schools. The word “parents” includes No payments to state integrated schools are compulsory except for attendance dues and optional goods and services that parents have agreed to purchase. Therefore, some payments made by parents to state integrated schools may qualify as gifts for donation tax credit purposes. School boards, proprietors and administrators need to understand which payments made by parents may qualify as gifts so the school can issue donation tax receipts. Key provisions Education Act 1989, s 3 and Part 33 Income Tax Act 2007, ss LD 1 to LD 3 Key terms State integrated school: A previously private school that has been integrated into the state school system. Proprietor: The proprietor owns (or leases) and maintains a state integrated school’s land and buildings and is responsible for determining and maintaining the school’s special character. A proprietor may qualify as a donee organisation if it is a not- for-profit organisation established for the charitable purpose of advancing education. Special character: A particular or general religious or philosophical belief, as defined in a state integrated school’s Deed of Integration with the Crown. Attendance dues: Compulsory payments parents are required to pay to proprietors as a condition of their child’s enrolment at the school. They are approved by the Minister of Education, and must be spent for specified purposes. QB 18/11 Income tax – state integrated schools and donation tax credits QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED 2 UNCLASSIFIED guardians and caregivers of students who also make payments to state integrated schools. 2. This QWBA does not address:  payments parents make to state non-integrated schools, partnership schools kura hourua or private schools in New Zealand. (State non-integrated schools and partnership schools kura hourua are addressed in QB 18/10 Income tax – state schools and donation tax credits);  payments made for international students to attend state integrated schools;  payments to entities (such as charitable trusts or parent–teacher associations) that are associated with a state integrated school but are separate entities from the school. 3. This QWBA refers to the Ministry of Education’s Circular 2018/01 Payments by parents of students in schools (Ministry of Education, 2018), which provides guidance on payments by parents of students in state schools and state integrated schools. 4. The examples from \[59\] illustrate how the donation tax credit rules apply for state integrated schools. Education with a special character 5. State integrated schools provide education within the framework of a particular or general religious or philosophical belief (referred to as the school’s “special character”). A state integrated school establishes a partnership with the Crown by its Deed of Integration, which defines the special character of the school. The special character shapes the school’s curriculum, enrolments, staffing processes and culture. Types of special character include such things as denominational and non-denominational Christian religions, Judaism, Islam, or the Steiner or Montessori philosophies. 6. Part 33 of the Education Act 1989 sets out the rules for state integrated schools. (Previously, these rules were in the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975, which was re-enacted as an amendment to the Education Act 1989 in May 2017). Section 414(1) of the Education Act 1989 defines “education with a special character” as: education within the framework of a particular or general religious or philosophical belief, and associated with observances or traditions appropriate to that belief 7. Like state schools, state integrated schools are governed by an elected board of trustees, but they differ from state schools in that they also have proprietors. Section 414 of the Education Act 1989 defines proprietor as: the body corporate that— (a) has the primary responsibility for determining the special character of a school registered under section 35A and for supervising the maintenance of that special character; and (b) owns, holds in trust, or leases the land and buildings that constitute the premises of the private school or a State integrated school Also see: Inland Revenue: QB 16/05 Income tax – donee organisations and gifts QB 18/10 Income tax – state schools and donation tax credits BR Pub 18/06 Goods and services tax – Payments made by parents to state and state integrated schools Ministry of Education: Circular 2018/01 Payments by parents of students in schools 3 UNCLASSIFIED 8. The proprietor is a person or entity that provides and maintains the land and buildings and is responsible for determining and supporting the maintenance of the school’s special character. The board of trustees of a state integrated school includes representatives of the proprietor. State integrated school statutory environment 9. In New Zealand, students attending state integrated schools must be given free education on the same conditions as students enrolled at a state school (see s 441 of the Education Act 1989). Under the Education Act 1989, any reference to a state school includes any reference to a state integrated school (see s 414(2)). 10. Section 3 of the Education Act 1989 provides: 3 Right to free primary and secondary education Except as provided in this Act, every person who is not an international student is entitled to free enrolment and free education at any State school or partnership school kura hourua during the period beginning on the person’s fifth birthday and ending on 1 January after the person’s 19th birthday. 11. International students are generally any students who are not New Zealand citizens or residents. 12. The Education Act 1989 does not define what free education means for state integrated schools. However, it involves the delivery of the national curriculum by schools. The Education Act 1989 establishes the overall framework for the delivery of education by state integrated schools, by publishing various curriculum statements, guidelines and national performance measures under s 60A of the Education Act 1989. The central component of that framework is the national curriculum, which comprises the New Zealand Curriculum and Te Marautanga o Aotearoa. The national curriculum sets out a common direction for teaching and learning in New Zealand schools. 13. The board of trustees of every state integrated school must develop a charter (or from 2019, a four-year strategic plan and an annual implementation plan) and a detailed curriculum for its school that align with the intent of the national curriculum, the school’s special character and the school community’s values and expectations. The school’s proprietor supervises and ensures the school’s special character, as defined in its Deed of Integration, is reflected in the school’s curriculum. The board of trustees is then required to implement its school’s curriculum in accordance with the priorities set out in the National Education Goals, the National Administration Guidelines and the school’s Deed of Integration. Therefore, in the state integrated school context free education involves the delivery of the national curriculum with special character. Ministry of Education guidance on fund raising by state integrated schools 14. According to Circular 2018/01 all payments requested from parents by state integrated schools (whether requested by the board of trustees or the proprietor) must be voluntary, unless the payments are attendance dues payable to the proprietor or payments for the purchase of optional goods or services that the parent has agreed to purchase. 15. The Education Act 1989 provides limited guidance on the payments proprietors may request from parents and no guidance about the types of payments boards of trustees of state integrated schools may ask for from parents. However, it is implicit that state integrated schools cannot charge for something that is part of a student’s statutory 4 UNCLASSIFIED entitlement to free education. The Ministry of Education confirms this in Circular 2018/01. 16. Circular 2018/01 also explains that pressure must not be placed on parents to make donations. No payments sought from parents of students attending state integrated schools are compulsory except for attendance dues payable to the proprietors and charges for optional goods and services that parents have agreed to purchase. Schools cannot withhold education services, information or privileges from students if their parents choose not to make requested donations or to make only part of a requested donation. Proprietors 17. Part 33 of the Education Act 1989 provides guidance for proprietors. Part 33 provides that the only payments proprietors of a state integrated school may require parents to pay as a condition of a child’s enrolment at the school are attendance dues (see s 447(1) of the Education Act 1989). The amount of attendance dues that proprietors may charge parents is approved by the Minister of Education, and the attendance dues must be applied for specific purposes. 18. Otherwise, proprietors are permitted to conduct fund-raising activities and request voluntary financial contributions from parents in accordance with s 451 of the Education Act 1989. The Appendix to Circular 2018/01 explains (at pages 1 and 4): Section 451 makes provision for proprietors to seek contributions (donations) for any purpose. Those contributions must be voluntary. Proprietors must make audited accounts of those contributions available on request to parents and other contributors. ... Fundraising by Proprietors Under Part 33 of the Act, Proprietors may fundraise. This means Proprietors of state-integrated schools may request donations. Parents cannot be compelled, however, to pay donations or to become involved in fundraising activities. Boards of trustees 19. Boards of trustees of a state integrated school may ask parents for donations to assist with funding its costs, including the cost of delivering the school’s curriculum. In this context the “school’s curriculum” is the delivery of the education the board of trustees has agreed with the Ministry of Education to provide to its students and that aligns with the intent of the national curriculum, the school’s special character and the school community’s values and expectations. 20. The donations requested may be general donations (that is, donations for an unspecified purpose) or specified donations (that is, donations for a particular purpose such as library books or sports equipment). In Circular 2018/01, schools are advised that if a specified donation is requested for an activity forming part of the delivery of the school’s curriculum, students cannot be excluded from participating in the activity if the parent chooses not to make the contribution or makes only part of the contribution. 21. Sometimes schools may offer for sale consumables, take-home items (such as items made in technology classes), stationery, clothing and activities that are not part of the delivery of the school’s curriculum. Schools may charge for these optional consumables and activities, but students are not obliged to buy them. Any payment for these consumables or activities is not a donation. 5 UNCLASSIFIED Donation tax credit rules 22. Under the Income Tax Act 2007, a donation tax credit may be available for charitable or other public benefit gifts made by a parent to a state integrated school, if the requirements in ss LD 1 to LD 3 are met. The phrase “charitable or other public benefit gift” is defined in s LD 3(1) to mean a monetary gift of $5 or more paid to a qualifying organisation (referred to as a donee organisation). 23. Since 2008, the boards of trustees of state integrated schools have been listed as donee organisations in s LD 3(2)(bb). Before 2008, state integrated schools qualified as donee organisations because the advancement of education is a charitable purpose and they otherwise met the requirements of s LD 3. 24. As the boards of trustees of state integrated schools are donee organisations a parent who makes a “gift” of money of $5 or more to such a board may claim a donation tax credit of one third of the payment amount at the end of the relevant tax year, provided the parent meets the other requirements for claiming a donation tax credit. These requirements include the parent holding a donation tax receipt from the school. Inland Revenue processes all claims for donation tax credits, and, ultimately, it is the Commissioner who decides whether a parent is entitled to a tax credit for a payment made to a state integrated school on the basis that she is satisfied the parent has made a qualifying charitable or other public benefit gift to the school. 25. A donation made to a proprietor of a state integrated school will qualify for a donation tax credit only if the proprietor is a donee organisation. The proprietors of state integrated schools may qualify as donee organisations if they are not-for-profit organisations established for the charitable purpose of advancing education. Charitable or other public benefit gifts 26. While the phrase “charitable or other public benefit gift” is defined in s LD 3(1), the term “gift” is not defined in the Income Tax Act. In the absence of a statutory definition of “gift, the Commissioner considers “gift” should be given its ordinary meaning. This is consistent with the Court of Appeal’s decision in Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154. New Zealand case law on the ordinary meaning of “gift” is limited, so the Commissioner considers it appropriate to take guidance from overseas case law. 27. It is likely the New Zealand courts (like the Canadian courts before them) will follow the approach taken by the Australian courts on the ordinary meaning of “gift”. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that, for the purposes of s LD 3(1) and state schools, a “gift” is a payment by a parent to a school of money of $5 or more:  made voluntarily;  by way of benefaction; and  in return for which the parent receives no material benefit or advantage. 28. For a more general discussion on what is a gift see QB 16/05 Income tax – donee organisations and gifts. 29. When deciding whether a parent’s payment to a state integrated school is a gift, the true nature of the payment is to be determined by considering the overall arrangements and transactions giving rise to the payment. The name or description given to a payment is not determinative of its nature. 6 UNCLASSIFIED Voluntary payment 30. As noted above, according to Circular 2018/01 the only compulsory payments parents are required to make to state integrated schools are attendance dues payable to the proprietor and payments where the parents have agreed to purchase optional goods and services from the school. All other payments parents may be asked to make to state integrated schools are voluntary in the sense that the school cannot compel parents to make the payments. Parents can choose whether to make requested voluntary payments in full, in part, or not at all. However, just because these payments are “voluntary” does not mean they are automatically gifts for income tax purposes. 31. To qualify as a gift, a parent’s payment to the board of trustees or proprietor must be made voluntarily. For gifting purposes, this means that the payment is made willingly, freely by choice and for benevolent reasons. It also means that a parent’s payment must not be made under an arrangement (contractual or otherwise) where the payment is made in return for a material benefit or advantage. Similarly, a payment may not be voluntary where there is some agreement, understanding or expectation that the school or proprietor is to do or provide something in return for the payment. (The link between the payment and the material benefit is discussed from \[41\]). 32. The absence of a contract or a legal obligation on a parent to contribute to a school does not automatically mean payments are voluntary and, therefore, gifts. There may be circumstances where, even though a parent has no legal obligation to make a payment to a school, the payment still will not be a gift for donation tax credit purposes. For example, where a student’s participation in an activity is dependent on the parent’s payment. 33. Occasionally, pressure might be applied (by the school or by other parents) on a parent to make a contribution. This pressure can create a sense of moral obligation on the parent to contribute. While a payment may be voluntary even if it is made under a sense of moral obligation, in some circumstances the Commissioner considers pressure might also be evidence that a payment is being made under an arrangement between the school and the parent where the payment is being made in return for a material benefit or advantage. In those circumstances the payment will not be voluntary, so will not be a gift. Benefaction 34. The requirement that a gift is made voluntarily is connected with the concept of benefaction and the belief that gifts usually proceed from a “detached and disinterested generosity”. Benefaction is the idea that a gift is made to provide an advantage to or to do good for the recipient. Benefaction is an important element of a gift in its ordinary sense; when it is absent there can be no gift (Leary v FCT (1980) 32 ALR 221). 35. In the context of contributions made by parents to the board or proprietor of a state integrated school, benefaction is the idea that the parent’s payment will provide an advantage to or do good for the school in some way. For example, a voluntary contribution to the proprietor to assist with the cost of building a new music studio for the school will assist the school. Material benefit in return 36. A parent’s voluntary payment to the board of trustees or proprietors of a state integrated school will not be a gift if it is made under an arrangement where the parent expects a material benefit or advantage in return for making the payment. It is sufficient that an 7 UNCLASSIFIED understanding or expectation (clear or implicit) exists between the parent and the school that the payment is being made in return for a material benefit or advantage. 37. In Case M128 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,825 Judge Barber held that payments by a parent for the cost of a field trip for his son to Mount Aspiring was not a gift because the payment gave the student the right to participate in the trip, and was not for the common good of the school. He similarly found that other school charges were not gifts as they all conferred rights on the student, such as the right to attend camp, the right to use and own stationery and the right to own a manual. 38. The Commissioner considers a parent’s payment to the board of trustees or proprietor of a state integrated school will not be a “gift” where:  the parent’s payment is made in return for a material benefit or advantage; or  the school is placed under an obligation to do or provide something in return for the parent making the payment. 39. A material benefit or advantage does not need to come directly from the school and does not need to be received directly by the parent who made the payment (for example, the student may receive the benefit) so long as under the arrangement the material benefit or advantage is in return for the parent making the payment. 40. A benefit or advantage will be considered “material” if it is of substance and can be valued or owned or both. (Sometimes these benefits are referred to as pecuniary or proprietary benefits.) A benefit or advantage will not be material if it is intangible and cannot be valued or owned. Non-material benefits or advantages include such things as public acknowledgement (for example, when a parent’s name is printed in a school newsletter to acknowledge their gift). This is different from a material benefit such as where a parent’s business is advertised in the school’s newsletter in return for the parent making the payment. Sufficient link between payment and benefit or advantage 41. Importantly, not every material benefit or advantage will necessarily disqualify a voluntary payment to the board of trustees or proprietor of a state integrated school from being a gift. Sometimes a voluntary payment may be a gift even if the parent obtains a material benefit or advantage. This happens when the connection between the payment and the benefit is weak (for example, where a benefit will be obtained by the giver regardless of whether the gift is made). In this example, although a benefit is received, the payment cannot be said to be made in return for the benefit, as the benefit will be obtained anyway. The extent and strength of any link between the parent’s payment and a benefit or advantage can be an important factor in determining whether a payment is a gift. 42. This point is illustrated by two Australian Board of Review decisions concerning payments made to two different ambulance services: Case D55 72 ATC 339 and Case F40 74 ATC 223. In Case D55 the board held payments to an ambulance service were gifts, while in Case F40 the same board considered payments to a different ambulance service were not gifts. 43. In Case D55 the giver made payroll-giving–type payments to a free ambulance service operating in his home district. The payments were not made under a contract between the giver and the ambulance service. The giver was already entitled to a free service from the ambulance service and there was no evidence of any representation that by making the payments he would receive any material benefit or quid pro quo in return. 8 UNCLASSIFIED Given these factors, and even though the giver was entitled to free ambulance services, the board concluded that the payments were gifts. This was because the payments were made voluntarily by the giver, not in return for the ambulance services and the payments were for what the giver considered to be a good cause. A sufficient link did not exist between the benefits to the giver and the payments to prevent the payments from being gifts. 44. In Case F40 the ambulance service operated under different rules. A person who made a payment to the ambulance centre was entitled to receive a free treatment and transport service within the area for one year and would be eligible to be elected to the centre’s committee and to vote in elections for the committee. The board held a contract existed between the centre and the payer under which the centre had an obligation to provide free services to the payer in return for the payment. If the payment had not been made, the payer would not have been entitled to free services. A strong dependency existed between the payment and the free services, so the payment was not a gift. Unlike in Case D55 the payer was not entitled to the benefit of free ambulance services regardless of whether the payment was made. 45. In New Zealand, the statutory right to free education means that students attending state integrated schools are statutorily entitled to the delivery of the school’s curriculum with special character regardless of whether their parents make donations (in full, in part or not at all) to assist with the cost of the delivery of that curriculum, or even if no parents make donations. The Commissioner considers that, generally, a student’s statutory right to free education with special character will mean a sufficient link does not exist between a parent’s voluntary payment to assist a state integrated school and any benefit obtained by the student in return. This is because the school is obliged to deliver the school’s curriculum with special character to the student regardless of whether the parent’s payment is made, so the payment is being made to benefit the school rather than being made in return for the education. 46. Case J76 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,451 provides some support for the view that a state integrated school student’s statutory right to free education generally means a sufficient link does not exist between a parent’s voluntary payment to assist the school and any benefit obtained by the student. Case J76 concerned a claim by the objector, a parish priest, that payments he made to ensure that disadvantaged children obtained appropriate schooling were gifts and he should be entitled to a rebate under s 56A(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 47. Judge Keane found there was no doubt that the payments were made out of charity. But he found no suggestion that the schools would have educated the children if the priest had not made the payments. Therefore, the payments placed the schools under a contractual duty to educate the children. The priest’s payments were not gifts. Judge Keane’s decision suggests that if the schools had had an existing obligation to educate the children, then the priest’s payments might have been gifts because they would have been made to fund the schools’ charitable purposes (that is, the advancement of education). Instead, in the absence of the schools having any pre-existing obligations, the payments were held to be made in return for the schools’ educational services. 48. The strength of any link between a payment and a benefit or advantage can usually be determined by considering all the circumstances surrounding the gift, including, in the case of state integrated schools, a student’s statutory right to free education with special character. However, the stronger the connection between a parent’s payment and any material benefit or advantage obtained in return, the less likely it is that the payment will qualify as a gift. It is also important to remember that gifts ordinarily proceed from an 9 UNCLASSIFIED intention on the part of the giver to provide an advantage to or to do good for the recipient (that is, the school). Gifting in the state integrated school environment General donations 49. Boards of trustees of state integrated schools may ask parents for donations to assist generally with its costs, including the cost of delivering the school’s curriculum. Similarly, proprietors may request contributions from parents to assist with the cost of supporting the delivery of the school’s curriculum with special character. Where the donations requested by the board of trustees are general donations (that is, donations for an unspecified purpose), the school may issue a donation tax receipt, providing the payments are made voluntarily by the parents to benefit the school. Similarly, where proprietors request contributions to assist with the cost of supporting the delivery of the school’s curriculum with special character, the Commissioner considers those contributions are gifts. If the proprietor is a donee organisation it may issue a donation tax receipt, providing the payments are made voluntarily by the parents to benefit the school. 50. The benefit parents and students get from making general donations to assist a school with its costs, including the cost of delivering its curriculum with special character will not prevent the parents’ payments from being gifts. This is because students attending a state integrated school have a statutory right to free education with special character. Therefore, parents of students attending a state integrated school can expect their children to receive an education with special character regardless of whether the parent makes any general donations. As a result, the Commissioner considers an insufficient link exists between a parent’s general donation and any benefit obtained, so the parent’s payment is not made in return for the benefit. Voluntary payments for specific purposes or projects 51. Sometimes parents are asked to assist schools with funding special projects for a school (for example, to assist with developing a computer lab or for books for the school library). Gifts for specific purposes or projects may not always be a contribution towards the cost of delivering the school’s curriculum, so they can be different from general school donations in that regard. However, the fact a school seeks donations for a specific project will not, in itself, prevent the payment being a gift. In the Commissioner’s view, a payment made for a specific purpose or project will be a gift so long as it has the attributes of a gift. 52. Further, the fact the parent or their child may be among those who ultimately benefit from a project may not disqualify the payment from being a gift, if the payment is not made in return for the relevant benefit or advantage. 53. However, it is acknowledged that when schools request contributions for specific purposes rather than as general donations, this could give rise to circumstances where a parent’s payment is sufficiently linked to a relevant benefit or advantage for the payment to be viewed as made in return for the benefit or advantage. The stronger the connection between a parent’s payment and any material benefit or advantage obtained in return, the more likely it is that the payment will not qualify as a gift. This is particularly so where the school requests a payment for a specific purpose that benefits an individual student or a narrow group of students rather than the school as a whole. 54. Therefore, a gift made for a specific purpose may qualify for a donation tax credit even where it is not a contribution towards the cost of delivering the school’s curriculum. The 10 UNCLASSIFIED fact the parent or their child may be among those who ultimately benefit from a project may not disqualify the payment from being a gift. However, where the benefit obtained is more direct and more closely linked to the payment, there may be circumstances that mean the payment is not a gift for donation tax credit purposes. 55. Proprietors may request building contributions to assist with the cost of upgrading and maintaining the school’s buildings and facilities, providing infrastructure and preserving the special heritage of the school. Contributions may be set aside for long-term capital developments. In the Commissioner’s view, generally, contributions to proprietors to assist with funding building costs will be gifts. It is unlikely a sufficient link exists between any benefit obtained by the student and the parent’s donation. This is because, usually, school buildings will be enjoyed by the wider school community as a whole and over many generations. This makes it hard to identify a sufficient link between a parent’s payment and any benefit or advantage obtained by their child. Voluntary payments for individual subjects or activities 56. Where a parent makes a voluntary contribution towards the school’s cost of delivering an individual subject or activity forming part of the school’s curriculum with special character, that payment will be a gift only if it can be clearly established that the student has a right to participate in the subject or activity regardless of whether their parent makes all or part of the requested payment. If a student has a right to participate in the subject or activity regardless of whether their parent makes a requested payment to the school, then in the Commissioner’s view the voluntary payment is made to advantage the school and is not made in return for participation. Payments for non-curriculum activities 57. Where a parent makes a voluntary contribution to the board or proprietor of a state integrated school to assist with the cost of delivering an activity or thing that does not form part of the school’s curriculum, that payment will be a gift only if, in fact, it is voluntary, it is to do good for the school, and a sufficient link does not exist between the payment and the activity or the thing for the payment to be viewed as made in return for the relevant benefit. The statutory right to free education does not apply in those circumstances to weaken the link between the payment and the benefit. 58. Therefore, in many cases payments for a student’s right to participate in non-curriculum activities will not be gifts. This is because those payments are made for the right to participate in the activities, or for the thing. 11 UNCLASSIFIED 59. The following examples explain the application of the donation tax credit rules for state integrated schools. The examples are consistent with the guidance in Circular 2018/01. None of the students in the examples are international students. Example 1: Annual donation to the board of trustees 60. Along with the first newsletter for the school year, Charlotte receives a printed statement from her son’s state integrated primary school showing a request for an annual donation of $350 to assist the board of trustees with its general operating costs for the year. Charlotte wants to help her son’s school but on top of having to buy a new school uniform she cannot afford the full requested amount so she pays $200. This is a gift for donation tax credit purposes, so the school issues Charlotte with a donation tax receipt for $200. 61. Charlotte’s payment will be a gift for donation tax credit purposes, whether she chooses to pay:  $350 as requested; or  less than $350; or  more than $350. Example 2: Books for the library 62. Thomas has two children, Dermot and Bill, at the local church state integrated primary school. The school is trying to improve literacy throughout the school and has asked families if they would like to donate towards the school purchasing books for the school library. Thomas thinks it is a great idea. He particularly likes the idea that the books will be an enduring benefit for the whole school to enjoy. Thomas happily donates $50 to the school for books. 63. This is a gift for donation tax credit purposes, so the school can issue Thomas with a donation tax receipt. The fact the gift is for a specific purpose (to purchase books) does not prevent the payment being a gift. Also, the fact Dermot and Bill may benefit from the gift also does not prevent the payment being a gift because a sufficient link does not exist between the payment by Thomas and the benefit his children may obtain by being able to borrow books from the library. Example 3: School stationery pack 64. At the beginning of the school year, Julie’s daughter Aroha’s school, a state integrated primary school, offers parents the choice of purchasing a stationery pack from the school or taking a stationery list and purchasing the stationery from a local store. Julie chooses to purchase a stationery pack from the school for Aroha. 65. Julie can voluntarily choose to purchase the pack from the school, so the payment for the pack is not a gift to the school. It is a payment made in return for a stationery pack. The school does not issue Julie with a donation tax receipt. Examples 12 UNCLASSIFIED Example 4: NCEA level 2 biology contribution 66. Cameron is in year 12 at his state integrated college and has chosen to study National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) level 2 biology. The college has requested the following voluntary payments from Cameron’s parents in respect of his biology subject selection:  $20 to assist the college with the cost of the biology field trip to mud flats (attendance is a compulsory part of the course requirements for the internal achievement standard); and  $30 for a biology work book (optional but recommended). 67. Cameron’s parents agree to purchase the workbook and make the requested payment to the college to assist with the cost of the field trip. 68. The school administrator issues a donation tax receipt to Cameron’s parents for $20. The college provides Cameron with a biology workbook. The voluntary payment towards the college’s field trip is a gift, but the $30 payment for the optional workbook is not a gift. 69. The reason the contribution to assist the school with the cost of the field trip is a gift is because a sufficient link does not exist between the payment and the benefit obtained by Cameron. Under the Education Act 1989, Cameron is entitled to free education. The field trip is part of the delivery of the college’s curriculum. Cameron can attend even if his parents choose not to make any or part of the requested payment. The field trip will go ahead regardless of whether Cameron’s parents or any of his classmate’s parents make the payment. Payments by the parents are not made in return for the biology field trip. Example 5: High-performance sports coach 70. Krish is a member of his state integrated secondary school’s premier hockey team which plays in the Tuesday night inter-college competition. His coach has organised for the team to have a skills training session with a high-performance coach. All team members are expected to attend the session, and parents have been asked to contribute $80 each towards the cost of the session. Even though the training session does not form part of the delivery of the school’s curriculum with special character, the school office has helped by adding the requested amount to each team member’s school account. 71. The parents’ payments are in return for the training session. This payment is not a gift so the school does not issue a donation tax receipt. Example 6: Special character contribution 72. Edward’s state integrated school undertakes to provide students with a Christian education. The school’s proprietor (a donee organisation) asks each family for an annual $100 voluntary contribution towards the cost of chaplaincy services, religious education and pastoral support. 73. Because the voluntary payment relates to the delivery of the school’s curriculum with special character, as defined in the school’s Deed of Integration, the payment is a gift for donation tax credit purposes, so the proprietor can issue Edward’s parents with a donation tax receipt for $100. This is on the basis that Edward is statutorily entitled to an education with special character regardless of whether his parents choose to make the payment or even if no parents make the payment. 13 UNCLASSIFIED 74. The school also asks for a $25 voluntary contribution towards the cost of providing a religious education workbook. This workbook is compulsory and comprises part of the delivery of the school’s curriculum. Edward will receive the workbook regardless of whether his parents make the voluntary contribution. The workbook stays at school and is not taken home. 75. The contribution towards the cost of the workbook is a donation, so the school can issue a donation tax receipt. If the workbook had been optional and not part of the delivery of the curriculum, then the school could have charged Edward’s parents for the cost of the workbook if they agreed to purchase it.

Date of Issue: 13 June 2018 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question What is the tax treatment of allowances and benefits paid or provided to farm workers? Answer Reimbursing allowances an employer pays for expenses that the employee incurs or is likely to incur in connection with their employment can generally be paid tax-free. However, a reimbursing allowance of a capital or private nature is taxable as employment income to the employee and subject to PAYE. Benefit allowances an employer pays to an employee are taxable as employment income to the employee and subject to PAYE. The expenditure an employer incurs on providing reimbursing allowances or benefit allowances is deductible to the employer, provided the employee’s salary or wages are deductible. Non-cash benefits an employer provides to an employee may be subject to fringe benefit tax payable by the employer. Expenditure incurred in providing non-cash benefits to an employee is deductible to the employer, as is any fringe benefit tax paid. QB 18/13 Income Tax – What is the tax treatment of allowances paid and benefits provided to farm workers? QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) considers the income tax treatment of allowances or benefits paid or provided to employees in a farming context. This QWBA consolidates, updates and replaces items previously published by the Commissioner. It will be of interest to those paying or receiving allowances in the farming sector. Key provisions Sections CE 1, CW 17 and CX 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (references in this QWBA are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated) Key terms Farm worker: an “employee” as defined in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. For some purposes this definition includes independent contractors who receive “schedular payments” (that is, contractors subject to withholding tax under Schedule 4). Reimbursing allowance: an amount an employer pays to an employee as a regular or one-off payment that is related to expenditure the employee is likely to incur or has incurred in connection with the employee’s employment or service. These allowances are generally not taxable. Benefit allowance: an amount an employer pays to an employee to compensate the employee for the conditions of their service, such as using a dangerous piece of equipment, working in a dangerous or dirty environment or working in a remote location. These allowances are generally taxable. QB 18/13: 13 June 2018 2 UNCLASSIFIED Explanation Scope of this QWBA 1. This QWBA relates to “farm workers” who meet the definition of an “employee” in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. An employee is a person who receives, or is entitled to receive, a PAYE income payment. A PAYE income payment includes salary or wages paid to permanent and casual employees. 2. A PAYE income payment also includes a schedular payment subject to withholding tax made to contract workers. A schedular payment is defined in s RD 8 as a payment of a class set out in schedule 4 to the Act. Schedule 4 includes payments made for work or services relating to primary production (see part C of the schedule). Part C includes farming and cultivation contract work, shearing, droving, forestry or bush work and the work described in ss DO 1 and DO 2. Sections DO 1 and DO 2 describe various types of farm-related work including weed and pest destruction, flood or erosion repair, scrub clearing and fencing. 3. A contractor is not an employee in the current context if they hold a Certificate of Exemption issued under s 24M of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This is because the definition of “schedular payment” excludes any payments covered by an exemption certificate. The definition also excludes payments for services a company provides unless the company is an “agricultural, horticultural, or viticultural company”. Such a company is defined in the Act as, effectively, a company involved in supplying labour in orchards, vineyards or market gardens. 4. Accordingly, a “farm worker” in this QWBA includes employees and some contract workers. 5. The term “farm workers” in this QWBA does not include employees with an indirect or direct financial interest in the business of their employer (for example, shareholder-employees or partners in a partnership). This is because additional tax considerations may arise for these types of employees under other provisions of the Act not considered in this QWBA. Items withdrawn and replaced This QWBA withdraws and replaces the Commissioner’s view on the tax treatment of the types of allowances referred to in the following items (except those concerning accommodation):  “How Allowances Received By Farm Employees Are Taxed” Public Information Bulletin No 19, (February 1965):9.  “Farming Supplement ‘No 2’ – Allowances to Farm Employees – Tax Position Explained”, Public Information Bulletin No 25, (August 1965):7  “Some Farm Employees Living in Remote Areas Not to Pay Tax on School Boarding Allowances”, Public Information Bulletin No 25 (August 1965):11.  “Allowances for Shepherds, Musterers and Drovers”, Public Information Bulletin No 40, (May/June 1967):8.  “Allowances – Shearers and Shed Hands”, PIB No 92, (December 1977):2.  “Cost of Keep of Farm Employees”, Public Information Bulletin 171, (March 1988):1. The allowances referred to in the items listed above cover cash allowances paid to certain farm employees:  to reimburse them for expenses incurred in providing their own dogs, horses, saddlery or hand pieces;  in lieu of the employer providing food (“stores and rations”);  to reimburse employees’ travelling expenses; or  to reimburse employee’s costs associated with boarding school-age children off the farm. This QWBA also replaces the above items that covered the provision of non-cash benefits of food or stores and rations. It also deals with the fringe benefit tax (FBT) implications since FBT did not exist when the items were published. This QWBA does not consider the aspects of the PIB items dealing with free board or lodgings and accommodation provided to farm workers. The Commissioner’s position relating to employees and accommodation issues is covered in:  “CS 16/02: Determining ‘market rental value’ of employer-provided accommodation”, Commissioner’s Statement (24 November 2016); and  “CS 12/01: Income tax treatment of accommodation payments, employer-provided accommodation and accommodation allowances”, Commissioner’s Statement (6 December 2012). CS 12/01 is being updated to reflect changes contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014, which are detailed in Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 26, No 7 (August 2014). QB 18/13: 13 June 2018 3 UNCLASSIFIED What is the tax treatment of allowances paid to employees? Meaning of allowance 6. An allowance is a payment of an agreed amount by an employer to an employee. It is paid on a regular basis (such as daily or weekly) or when certain events happen. It is taxable to the employee as employment income under s CE 1(1)(a) unless an exemption applies. 7. The two main types of allowances are reimbursing allowances and benefit allowances. Reimbursing allowances 8. In this context the QWBA is only concerned with “employees” who are subject to the employment limitation. A reimbursing allowance is an allowance an employer pays to an employee for expenses that an employee incurs or is likely to incur in connection with their employment. A reimbursing allowance need not be an exact reimbursement of the employee’s expenses but it should be a reasonable amount. 9. Some reimbursing allowances may be paid tax-free to an employee under s CW 17. For this to apply, the allowance must reimburse the employee for expenses that the employee incurs or is likely to incur in connection with their employment. Under s CW 17(2B), the expenses will be treated as incurred in connection with an employee’s employment, if it is a necessary expense incurred in doing the job from which they earn income. 10. Further, the expenses must be of a type that the employee could have been allowed a deduction for against their income but for the employment limitation in s DA 2(4). Employees cannot usually deduct expenses incurred in deriving their employment income because of the employment limitation. However, s CW 17(2) suspends the employment limitation for the purpose of determining whether the reimbursing allowance is exempt income of the employee. 11. Effectively, this means a reimbursing allowance cannot be paid tax-free to an employee if it reimburses the employee for expenses that would not have been deductible for a business taxpayer. The main limitations that might apply to prevent certain expenses from being deductible (and any corresponding reimbursing allowance paid tax-free) are the capital limitation in s DA 2(1) and the private limitation in s DA 2(2). 12. The capital limitation prevents deductions for capital expenses. Therefore, if any reimbursing allowance reimburses the purchase or replacement of a capital asset it cannot be treated as tax-free (for example, an allowance for the purchase of a motor bike rather than for its running expenses). There are two exceptions; firstly, under s CW 17(4), the relevant expenses reimbursed tax-free can include an amount for depreciation. This means if the reimbursing allowance includes an amount for depreciation of an asset, then that amount would be treated as deductible if the asset is used for work purposes. This is because s DA 4 provides that the capital limitation does not apply to an amount of depreciation loss. Secondly, subject to some limitations, the capital costs of low value assets may be deducted in full as depreciation under s EE 38. Items of low value under this provision must have cost $500 or less. This means an allowance could reimburse the capital costs of low value assets tax-free. 13. The private limitation prevents deductions for private or domestic expenses. “Private” expenditure is expenditure that relates to an individual living as a member of society. Examples of private expenditure are food, clothing and shelter. “Domestic” expenditure is QB 18/13: 13 June 2018 4 UNCLASSIFIED expenditure that relates to the household or family. Examples of this include the cost of a home telephone or an internet connection or other expenditure related to running a household. 14. An example of an allowance subject to the private limitation is one provided to help meet the cost of boarding school-aged children away from the farm. While the expenditure may be prompted by a farm worker’s employment in a remote location, the costs associated with the provision of basic needs such as the education of children is expenditure of a private or domestic nature. The employee would not be able to deduct the costs, despite the employment limitation, because of the private limitation. 15. The private limitation may also arise where farm equipment or machinery has both a business use and a private or domestic use. For instance, farm vehicles may be used for work purposes and private purposes. An apportionment is required for any part of the allowance that relates to expenditure incurred for the private or domestic use. In such cases the portion of the allowance relating to the expenditure incurred for business use would be exempt and not taxable. The portion of the allowance relating to the expenditure incurred for the private use would be taxable in the hands of the employee as employment income (and subject to PAYE). However, the allowance may be adjusted to reimburse for only the business use and remain exempt. 16. Contractors are included in the definition of “employee” if they receive a schedular payment. Unlike employees, contractors can (in most cases) deduct expenses. Being able to deduct expenses makes exempt allowances unnecessary. The Commissioner understands that the usual practice is for most employers to pay contractors a single contract price and not to pay separate reimbursement allowances. The outcome is essentially the same as if they were paid an exempt allowance because although they receive a single contract amount subject to withholding tax, the expenses will be deductible to the contractor. Expenses a reimbursing allowance may cover 17. Examples of the kinds of reimbursing allowances that may be paid to farm workers and the type of expenses they might reimburse are listed in the table at \[36\]. This is not an exhaustive list, and the items are exempt only to the extent that the capital or private limitations do not apply. In all cases, the onus is on the employer to justify treating the allowance as a tax-free reimbursing allowance. Estimates of expenses 18. In setting the allowance amount, the employer may estimate the total amount of expenditure an employee is likely to incur. Section CW 17(3) allows employers to make a “reasonable estimate” of the amount of expenditure likely to be incurred by an employee or a group of employees. The onus is on the employer to establish the estimate is reasonable. 19. A reasonable estimate is one that has some basis. For example, the estimate might be based on historical data, industry standards or employee survey information. Employers must retain sufficient information about how the estimate was calculated to substantiate the allowance amount. Employers should review their estimates periodically to ensure they remain “reasonable”. Benefit allowances 20. A benefit allowance is an allowance an employer pays to compensate an employee for the conditions of their service, such as using a dangerous piece of equipment, working in a QB 18/13: 13 June 2018 5 UNCLASSIFIED dangerous or dirty environment, or working in a remote location. Another example of a benefit allowance is a cash allowance paid in lieu of the employer providing stores and rations. 21. These types of allowances have been described as “benefit allowances” because they give a financial benefit to the employee rather than to compensate the employee for expenses they incur or are likely to incur in carrying out their employment duties. Unlike a reimbursing allowance, a benefit allowance is taxable to the employee as employment income under s CE 1(1)(a) and subject to PAYE. This is because the benefit allowance does not qualify for an exemption under s CW 17. However, s CW 17CB may exempt a reimbursement allowance for work-related meals where the employee is required to travel for work. 22. If the allowance paid is a mixture of a reimbursing allowance and a benefit allowance, then only that part of the total allowance that is a reimbursing allowance that meets s CW 17 can be paid tax-free. What is the tax treatment of non-cash benefits provided to employees? 23. Under s CX 2, a “fringe benefit” is a “benefit” that an “employer” provides to an “employee” (which includes contract workers who receive schedular payments) in connection with their employment and is:  a benefit specified in ss CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, or CX 12 to CX 16; or  an unclassified benefit under s CX 37. 24. Also, some benefits are excluded from being fringe benefits by specific provisions in subpart CX. Notably CX 4 prevents a benefit that is assessable income begin taxed again as a fringe benefit. 25. The provision of food (stores and rations) is a non-cash benefit that may be provided to farm workers. The Commissioner’s view is that the provision of food is a “benefit” to the employees. It provides an economic advantage to the employees because it gives them benefits (food) to which they would otherwise not be entitled. Food includes goods produced on the employer’s premises such as eggs, vegetables and meat. 26. The provision of food is not one of the benefits listed in ss CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, and CX 12 to CX 16. However, it may still be an “unclassified benefit” under s CX 37. Section CX 37 applies to benefits that an employer provides to an employee in connection with their employment that are not included or are excluded by a specific provision. 27. The only potentially relevant exclusion is in s CX 23, which deals with benefits the employee uses or consumes on the employer’s premises. Food consumed on the employer’s premises is excluded from being a fringe benefit by s CX 23(1)), so will not be subject to FBT. The meaning of employer’s premises is set out in s CX 23(2). Of relevance to farm workers is that the employer’s premises do not include premises an employee occupies for residential purposes (s CX 23(2)(c)). Whether food provided to employees is consumed on the employer’s premises is a question of fact in each case. 28. This means if the food is provided in connection with an employee’s employment and it is not excluded by a specific provision, then the benefit will be a “fringe benefit” as an unclassified benefit. As a result, the employer may be liable for FBT as calculated under subpart RD . 29. However, s RD 45 limits the employer’s FBT liability when providing unclassified benefits to situations where the taxable value of all unclassified benefits provided exceed certain thresholds. QB 18/13: 13 June 2018 6 UNCLASSIFIED  Where the employer pays FBT quarterly, the employer is liable for FBT only if: o the total taxable value of all unclassified benefits provided in the quarter to the employee is more than $300; or o the total taxable value of all unclassified benefits provided in the last four quarters (including the current quarter) to all employees is more than $22,500.  Where the employer pays FBT annually or on an income year basis, the employer is liable to pay FBT only if: o the total taxable value of all unclassified benefits provided in the tax year or income year to the employee is more than $1,200; or o the total taxable value of all unclassified benefits provided in the tax year or income year to all employees is more than $22,500. 30. The above figures are based on all unclassified benefits the employer provided in the relevant period, not just the provision of food. The figures are based on the “taxable value” of the fringe benefits provided. Section RD 54 provides that the taxable value of a fringe benefit is its value. For unclassified benefits comprising food, the relevant value of the benefit is that given by s RD 40(1) which applies to goods. The value (and taxable value) of the food will be the:  market value where the employer manufactured, produced or processed the goods (which may occur in a farm setting);  cost to the employer where the employer acquired the goods when dealing at arm’s length with the supplier. 31. If an employee contributes an amount towards the fringe benefit the taxable value is reduced by the amount of the contribution. 32. In the case of goods produced by the employer, the value may be reduced if the market value is greater than the amount the employer would have received for selling the goods under normal sale conditions to an arm’s length customer (s RD 40(2)). 33. In the case where cost applies, this is the GST-exclusive cost if the employer is a registered person and able to claim an input tax deduction for the goods (s RD 40(3)). Can the employer deduct allowances or the cost of providing non-cash benefits? 34. A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent that it is incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income (s DA 1). In most cases, salary and wage costs will be deductible because they will satisfy the test in s DA 1 and none of the general limitations will apply. The payment of an allowance or the provision of a benefit in connection with an employee’s employment is a business cost just like the employee’s basic salary or wages. Therefore, provided the costs of an employee’s basic salary or wages are deductible, then, generally, the costs of paying reimbursing or benefit allowances or providing non-cash benefits will also be deductible. 35. The costs incurred in providing a fringe benefit may also be deducted if the general permission is met and none of the general limitations applies. Also, if the employer is liable to pay any FBT, the FBT itself is a deductible expense. Examples of allowances 36. The following table lists examples of the types of allowances paid to employees. The amounts specified in the withdrawn items listed on the second page of this item no longer apply. The QB 18/13: 13 June 2018 7 UNCLASSIFIED reimbursement allowances in the table are exempt only to the extent that they do not reimburse private expenses or capital expenses (subject to the low value asset rule (that is, they are below the $500 limit)). Employee allowances should be deductible to the employer where the employee’s salary or wages are deductible. 37. The following example uses sheep farming as its basis because this relates the most closely to the allowances in the items now withdrawn. It is included solely to assist in explaining the Category Payment or benefit provided Type of allowance Tax treatment Employee Employer Working dogs Allowance for food, registration or vet bills Reimbursing allowance Exempt Deductible Horses Allowance for food, saddlery and accessories (less than $500), saddlery repairs, vet or farrier’s bills Reimbursing allowance Exempt Deductible Motor bikes and quad bikes Allowance for depreciation, interest, fuel, tyres (less than $500), servicing or repairs Reimbursing allowance Exempt Deductible Protective clothing Allowance for purchase (less than $500) of protective clothing such as boots, chaps, leggings, gloves, and hearing or eye protection Reimbursing allowance Exempt Deductible Wet weather gear Allowance for purchase (less than $500) of wet weather gear, such as waterproof coats, hats and leggings Reimbursing allowance Exempt Deductible Shearing equipment Allowance for acquisition (less than $500) of hand-pieces or shearing equipment, repairs and maintenance and depreciation of equipment Reimbursing allowance Exempt Deductible Boarding school fees School boarding away allowance Benefit allowance Taxable Deductible Travel costs Reimbursement of work travel Reimbursing allowance Exempt Deductible Rations and stores Provisions of stores and rations, meat or farm produce Non-cash benefit Not assessable FBT (subject to exemptions) Deductible Payment in lieu of stores and rations Benefit allowance Taxable Deductible Remote location Allowance for working in a remote location Benefit allowance Taxable Deductible Dangerous or dirty conditions Allowance for working in a dangerous or dirty environment Benefit allowance Taxable Deductible QB 18/13: 13 June 2018 8 UNCLASSIFIED application of the law as set out above. The same principles would apply to farm workers on other types of farms or other primary production sectors. Example Frank is a sheep farmer in a remote area. The following people work at various times on Frank’s farm: • Mike, the farm manager; • Pete and Jake, full-time live-in farm hands; • a shearing gang employed by Sharp Shearing Services Ltd with which Frank has a contract for the provision of shearing services. The shearing gang is from another district and because of the distance and remoteness of the farm they stay in the shearers’ quarters for the duration of the job. Mike, his partner and their two children live in the manager’s house on the farm. Because of the remote location of the farm, the children attend boarding school. Frank pays Mike an allowance every term to assist with boarding school costs. Mike is also paid the following amounts regularly as part of his salary:  an allowance to reimburse Mike for the costs (depreciation, interest, fuel, tyres, and servicing and repairs) he is likely to incur in using his own quad bike;  an allowance for Mike to provide his own wet weather gear;  a remote living allowance of $50 per week. Pete and Jake live on the farm in separate staff quarters provided by Frank. On work days, Frank provides them breakfast that has been prepared and is consumed in Frank’s kitchen. From time to time, Frank gives them meat for the freezer that they store and consume in their own quarters. Sharp Shearing Services Ltd pays each employee an allowance to reimburse them for the costs they are likely to incur in using their shearing gear for work depending on the job they do. The allowances cover repairs and maintenance of hand-pieces, and the replacement of combs and cutters and for the employees to provide their own protective clothing. Sharp Shearing Services also pays its employees a daily allowance in lieu of providing stores or rations when the employees are on site. It is accepted that any reimbursement allowances are paid in connection with the relevant employee’s employment and, with the exception of Mike’s remote living allowance, has been based on an amount incurred or a reasonable estimate. The $50 per week remote living allowance was negotiated as a condition of Mike’s employment. Implications for Mike The reimbursing allowances paid to Mike to reimburse him for the costs he is likely to incur in using his quad bike for work and for providing wet weather gear are exempt from tax under s CW 17(2). This exemption is because these expenses are expenses that would have been deductible to Mike if the employment limitation did not exist. In the case of the wet weather gear, the conclusion that s CW 17 applies to treat this allowance as exempt income assumes that if any part of the allowance was for the capital cost to acquire the gear, the acquisition costs would have been deductible as a depreciation allowance under the low value asset provision s EE 38. The allowance paid to assist Mike with the costs of his children attending boarding school is a benefit allowance because it provides Mike with a benefit in reducing the boarding school costs paid by him. Expenditure on boarding QB 18/13: 13 June 2018 9 UNCLASSIFIED school fees for his children is of a private or domestic nature. It is taxable to Mike as employment income under s CE 1(1)(a) and subject to PAYE. The remote living allowance paid to Mike is also a benefit allowance because it provides him with a benefit by reducing his private or domestic expenditure. Therefore, it is taxable as employment income under s CE 1(1)(a) and subject to PAYE. Implications for Pete and Jake The food Frank provides Pete and Jake for breakfast is not a fringe benefit because the exclusion for benefits provided on an employer’s premises applies (s CX 23). The meat for the freezer is a fringe benefit and the exclusion in s CX 23 does not apply. The taxable value can be worked out using s RD 40(1) and will be the meat’s market value. Implications for the shearing gang The reimbursing allowance paid to each member of the shearing gang to reimburse them for the costs of providing their own shearing gear is exempt from tax under s CW 17. This exemption is because these expenses are expenses that would have been deductible to them if the employment limitation did not exist. In the case of protective clothing, the conclusion that s CW 17 applies to treat these allowances as exempt income assumes that if any part of the allowance was for the capital cost to acquire the clothing, the acquisition costs would have been deductible as a depreciation allowance under the low value asset provision s EE 38. The allowance in lieu of rations paid to the gang is also exempt from tax. Generally such allowances would not satisfy s CW 17(2) because of the private limitation. However, s CW 17CB(1) allows exempt meal allowances to be paid for short periods where the employment duties of an employee require them to travel and work away. In this case the shearers are working away in another district and staying in shearers’ quarters so can be paid an exempt meal allowance to the extent that they receive an allowance rather than food. Implications for Frank Frank is not liable for FBT for the food he provides to Pete and Jake. All the allowances paid to Mike and the costs of providing food to Pete and Jake are deductible to Frank because they are paid in connection with their respective employment. They are business expenses that satisfy the test in s DA 1. Sharp Shearing Services The reimbursing allowances paid to the shearing gang are all deductible to Sharp Shearing Services because they are paid in connection with the employment of the company’s employees. Accordingly, they are business expenses that satisfy the nexus test in s DA 1.

1 UNCLASSIFIED Question What is the GST treatment of the fee that suppliers charge their customers for using a credit or debit card to purchase goods or services? Answer Where suppliers charge their customers a fee for using a credit or debit card to purchase goods or services, that fee will form part of the consideration for the goods or services being supplied where:  the supplier supplies the payment facility directly to the customer;  the supplier arranges for an agent to supply the payment facility to the customer on the supplier’s behalf; or  the supplier contracts with a third party to supply a payment facility to the customer. The fee will have the same GST treatment as the goods or services being supplied. If the goods or services are taxable, output tax must be returned on the amount of the fee. Explanation Background 1. All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 2. Suppliers that accept payment by credit or debit card may sometimes impose a fee on their customers to recover the cost of providing credit or debit card payment facilities. Sometimes the supplier charges this fee directly to the customer and sometimes a third party or an agent of the supplier charges the fee to the customer. QB 18/14 GST treatment of fees that suppliers charge customers for using a credit or debit card QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This item will be of interest to suppliers who charge their customers a fee for using a credit or debit card to pay for goods or services. The GST treatment of credit or debit card fees almost always follows the GST treatment of the underlying goods or services. Key provisions Sections 3, 14 and 60(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Key terms Payment facility: a service for processing credit or debit card transactions. Payment facility provider: a company (often a third party) appointed by a supplier to process credit and debit card payments on the supplier’s behalf. QB 18/14: 7 Sep 2018 2 UNCLASSIFIED 3. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) considers the GST treatment of these fees. The issue is whether the fee forms part of the consideration for the goods or services being supplied (so there is a single composite supply of the goods or services and the payment facility) or whether the fee is a separate supply of a payment facility. This QWBA therefore expands on the analysis in Interpretation Statement “IS 17/03: Goods and services tax – single supply or multiple supplies” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 4 (May 2017):102. 4. Inland Revenue has previously published items on the GST treatment of credit card fees charged by suppliers: see Agents Answers No 142 (December 2011); Business Tax Update No 26 (December 2011); Large Enterprises Update No 18 (February 2012); Business Tax Update No 4 (July 2016). These items concluded that the fee was part of the underlying supply of goods or services and should therefore be treated in the same way as the underlying supply for GST purposes. This means that if the underlying supply is subject to GST, the fee will be too. This QWBA is consistent with the position taken in these items. Analysis 5. This QWBA explains how to determine the GST treatment of credit or debit card fees charged by suppliers to customers. This involves:  Identifying who is actually making the supply of the payment facility. In some cases, the supplier may provide the customer with the payment facility directly. In other cases, the supplier may engage an agent or third-party to provide the customer with the payment facility.  Determining whether a supplier has made one composite supply or multiple separate supplies. Identifying who makes the supply 6. In some cases, a supplier may provide the payment facility directly to the customer. In other cases, a supplier may contract with a third party or an agent to provide a credit or debit card payment facility to the supplier’s customer. It is therefore necessary to determine who makes the supply of the payment facility to the customer. 7. The approach of the New Zealand courts is to consider the true nature of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out by the supplier and the recipient in light of the surrounding circumstances. The contractual arrangements between the parties must be examined to determine who is supplying what to whom: Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,086 (CA); CIR v Databank Systems Ltd (1990) 12 NZTC 7,227 (PC); Auckland Institute of Studies v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,685 (HC) and Wilson & Horton Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 (CA). 8. In Auckland Institute the High Court stated that it is necessary to “examine the supply from the point of view of the consumer” by considering “the true and substantial nature of the consideration given for the payment by the consumer”. 9. Overseas courts have considered consumer perspectives where customers use credit or debit cards to purchase goods or services. In HMRC v Debenhams Retail plc \[2005\] EWCA Civ 892, the English Court of Appeal observed that where the customer uses a credit or debit card to pay for the goods, they must be taken to appreciate that the purchase of goods in this way will give rise to rights and duties with the credit card company or issuing bank. The general understanding of the public is that once the supplier has accepted payment by way of the credit or debit card, the customer has discharged their obligations to the business and they will need to pay the credit card company for the goods or services purchased. The court noted that ordinary customers would also be taken to be aware that some businesses levy a QB 18/14: 7 Sep 2018 3 UNCLASSIFIED small additional charge on their customers to cover the cost to them of their customers’ use of some cards. The Debenhams decision is discussed in more detail from \[28\]. 10. In Case C-276/09 Everything Everywhere Ltd v HMRC \[2010\] ECJ (2 December 2010), and Case C-607/14 Bookit Ltd v HMRC \[2016\] ECJ (26 May 2016), the Court of Justice of the European Union noted that customers expect suppliers to make available an infrastructure enabling them to pay for the goods or services they purchase. It also stated that access to the payment facility was not an end in itself for customers who can have no interest in accessing that infrastructure independently of purchasing the goods or services. In both cases, the court concluded that there was a single composite supply of the goods or services and the payment handling services. A single composite supply or multiple supplies 11. Where the supplier is supplying both the payment facility and the goods or services it is necessary to determine whether the supplier is making two separate supplies or a single composite supply. 12. IS 17/03 sets out the Commissioner’s approach for determining whether a supplier has made one composite supply or multiple separate supplies. The approach involves identifying the multiple elements being supplied and deciding whether it is reasonable for those elements to be treated as a single composite supply or separate supplies. The Commissioner’s approach is to ask three key questions:  What is the true and substantial nature of what is supplied to the recipient (the customer) for their payment?  This question is determined objectively, by examining what is supplied from the recipient’s perspective.  The fact that elements could have been supplied separately does not mean those elements should be severed from the rest of the supply.  Simply because a single price is charged for multiple elements does not determine whether one or more than one supply is made. It is the actual supply made to the recipient that must be considered and not how the supply is invoiced or charged to the recipient.  What are the relationships between the elements supplied?  This question involves determining whether one element is merely ancillary or incidental to, or a necessary or integral part of, any other element being supplied in the transaction.  Factors that indicate whether an element is ancillary or incidental to, or a necessary or an integral part of, a dominant element include whether the element is: o not an aim in itself; instead, the element facilitates, contributes to, or enables the supply of the dominant element; o a means of better enjoying the dominant element; o an optional extra and is not in any real or substantial sense part of the consideration for which a payment is made.  Is it reasonable to sever the elements into separate supplies? QB 18/14: 7 Sep 2018 4 UNCLASSIFIED  This question requires taking an overall view and looking for the essential purpose of the transaction.  An element should not be artificially split from what, from an economic point of view, is a single supply. Applying the law to the facts 13. A supplier can supply a payment facility to a customer in a number of ways. The supplier supplies the payment facility directly to the customer 14. In this scenario, the supplier has acquired the payment facility from the payment facility provider. The supplier then supplies the payment facility directly to the customer (for example, by presenting the customer with an EFTPOS terminal at the point of sale). 15. From the customer’s perspective, the supplier is supplying them with goods or services for consideration. In addition, the supplier is supplying the customer with the payment facility. The additional fee charged to the customer is consideration for the supply of the payment facility. Applying the principles from IS 17/03, there is a single composite supply of the goods or services and the payment facility. 16. Overseas courts have also held that a supplier who supplies a payment facility directly to a customer is making a single composite supply of the goods or services and the payment facility: see Waverley Council v FC of T 2009 ATC 10-095 (AAT) and Everything Everywhere Ltd. Example 1 – Meal at a restaurant Li takes her parents out for a meal at a restaurant. After they finish the meal, Li goes to pay the bill using her credit card. The waiter informs Li there is a 2% surcharge for using a credit card. The true nature of the legal arrangement is that the restaurant has made a supply of multiple elements, namely the meal and the credit card facility. Viewing the arrangement between Li and the restaurant from Li’s perspective, the dominant supply is the supply of the meal in a restaurant. For Li, the ability to use the credit card is not an aim in itself. Instead, the facility to pay by credit card is ancillary to the dominant supply of the meal, in the sense that it enables the supply to occur. There is therefore a single composite taxable supply of a meal, with the surcharge being part of the consideration for that supply. This means the restaurant is required to return GST output tax on the total consideration. Payment facility provider Supplier Customer Payment facility Money Payment facility Money Goods / Services QB 18/14: 7 Sep 2018 5 UNCLASSIFIED An agent supplies the payment facility to the customer on the supplier’s behalf 17. In this scenario, a supplier enters into an agency agreement with an agent. The agent agrees to supply the goods or services to the customer as agent for the supplier. The agent also provides the supplier’s customers with access to a payment facility on behalf of the supplier. 18. Unless the parties have agreed otherwise, where an agent makes a supply of goods or services to a recipient for and on behalf of their principal, that supply is deemed to be made by the principal to the recipient: s 60(1). Therefore, if a supplier’s agent provides goods or services and a payment facility to a customer for and on behalf of the supplier, the supply of those goods or services and the payment facility will be deemed to be made by the supplier to their customer. The position is the same if the agent only provides the payment facility on behalf of the supplier and not the goods or services. 19. Applying the principles from IS 17/03, in both cases there will be a single composite supply of the goods or services and the payment facility. 20. Bookit Ltd supports the view that from the customer’s perspective there is a single composite supply. In this decision, the Court of Justice of the European Union concluded that the supply of the card handling services by a booking agent was part of the supply of the tickets by the cinema (as principal). Example 2 – Ticketing agency Wiremu purchases a theatre ticket for $50 from Book Now Ltd. Because Wiremu uses his credit card to pay for the ticket, Book Now charges him a $2 card-handling fee. Book Now has an agency agreement with the theatre. Under this agreement, Book Now sells the tickets on behalf of the theatre as its agent; agrees to provide purchasers with a credit or debit card payment facility; and is permitted to charge purchasers a $2 fee for using the payment facility. In addition, the theatre pays Book Now an agency fee. Book Now is supplying Wiremu with the ticket (to be redeemed for entertainment services) and the payment facility as agent for the theatre. Therefore, the theatre (as principal) and not Book Now (as agent) is treated as supplying the ticket and the payment facility to Wiremu (s 60(1)). Agent Supplier Customer Agency agreement Goods / Services Payment facility (as agent) Goods / Services (under s 60) QB 18/14: 7 Sep 2018 6 UNCLASSIFIED The issue is whether this supply is a single composite supply or two separate supplies. The true nature of the legal arrangement is for the supply of multiple elements, namely the ticket and the payment facility. Viewing the arrangement between Wiremu and Book Now (as the theatre’s agent) from Wiremu’s perspective, the dominant supply is the supply of the ticket. The payment facility is ancillary to that supply. Accessing the payment facility is not an aim in itself for Wiremu; it only facilitates the supply of the ticket in the sense of enabling Wiremu to pay for it. There is therefore a single composite taxable supply of a ticket with the card handling fee being part of the consideration for that supply. As a consequence, all the elements of the supply under the agreement are subject to GST. The supplier contracts with a third party to supply a payment facility to the customer 21. Section 60(1) will not apply where a payment facility provider supplies goods or services to the supplier under a contract between them, and the supplier then subsequently supplies those goods or services to the customer. In this situation there are two separate supplies: a supply between the payment facility provider and the supplier and a supply between the supplier and the customer of the payment facility: see CIR v Databank Systems Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,093 (CA) and Databank (PC). 22. Where there is no agency arrangement, Databank is authority for the principle that where a supplier contracts for a third party to supply it with goods or services that the supplier then uses to make an overall supply to the customer, two separate supplies are made: the supply by the third party to the supplier and the supply by the supplier to its customers. In such cases, the third party does not make a supply to the customer. Therefore, where a supplier contracts with a third party to provide a payment facility to the supplier’s customers, the supplier – not the third party – will be treated as supplying the payment facility to the customers where the customers contract only with the supplier. 23. In Databank, Databank provided banks with computer data-processing services. The services involved processing cheques, crediting and debiting the banks’ customers’ accounts, and Payment facility provider Supplier Customer Payment facility Money Money Goods / Services Payment facility Physically provides payment facility QB 18/14: 7 Sep 2018 7 UNCLASSIFIED general account maintenance. The issue was whether Databank supplied GST-exempt “financial services” to the banks under s 3 of the Act or GST standard-rated taxable computing services. 24. The Privy Council recognised that the banks used Databank’s computing services to supply financial services to customers. However, it held that the computing services Databank supplied did not satisfy the definition of “financial services”. Delivering the majority judgment, Lord Templeman rejected the relevance of s 60 and noted that it does not address the supply of agency services by an agent to its principal for consideration; rather, s 60 addresses supplies made by an agent for and on behalf of its principal. The terms of the agreements between Databank and the banks meant Databank was supplying its services to the banks, not to the banks’ customers. The agreements showed that the banks supplied the financial services to the customers. Consequently, there were two supplies: the supply of computing services by Databank to the banks and the supply of financial services by the banks to their customers. 25. This approach is consistent with Auckland Institute. In Auckland Institute, the taxpayer was an educational institute which provided tuition to overseas students. The institute contracted with a subsidiary to provide pre-arrival services to the students. The pre-arrival services included arranging the payment of tuition fees to the institute and completing enrolment and application forms for other services the institute provided. Under the institute’s contract with the subsidiary, the institute agreed the subsidiary was permitted to charge an “overseas assistance fee” for the pre-arrival services. The students only contracted with the institute. The subsidiary’s overseas assistance fee was not separately charged to the students; instead, the students paid the institute a global fee for all the services they received. 26. The High Court stated that the issue was to determine the true and substantial nature of the consideration given for the payment by the customer. This involved examining the contractual agreements between the students, the institute and its subsidiary to identify what the customer sought and was given. 27. The High Court held that the pre-arrival services were provided to facilitate the students undertaking a course of study. Viewing the arrangements between the students and the institute from the customer’s (the student’s) perspective, the dominant element of the transaction was the provision of tuition. That was the true and substantial nature of the consideration given for the payment. The pre-arrival services were necessary, but incidental to that tuition. Therefore, the services the institute provided to students through its subsidiary comprised a single supply of tuition services by the institute to the students. 28. The English Court of Appeal’s decision in Debenhams is consistent with Databank and Auckland Institute. In Debenhams, the court held that there was no separate supply of card- handling services by a third-party payment processor to Debenhams’ customers. Debenhams had contracted with the payment processor, but the customers had not, so the third-party payment processor could not be treated as making a supply of card-handling services to Debenhams’ customers. Consequently, Debenhams was treated as supplying the card- handling services to the customers. This is consistent with Auckland Institute because, from the customer’s perspective, the customer paid the fees as consideration for the supply of the payment facility. QB 18/14: 7 Sep 2018 8 UNCLASSIFIED Example 3 – Paying online using a payment facility provider Andrew has a monthly plan with his mobile phone company Ember. His $100 mobile phone bill is due for payment. He goes to the “Pay Online” page of Ember’s website. Before making the $100 payment, Andrew is advised that paying online with a debit or credit card will incur an additional 2% processing fee that will appear on his next statement as a separate transaction. Andrew proceeds and is redirected to a third-party payment facility provider. He provides his debit card details and his payment is processed. Ember has entered into a contract with the third-party payment facility provider to process its customers’ credit and debit card payments. Ember, not the third-party payment facility provider, has supplied the payment facility to Andrew. A contract exists between Ember and the third- party payment facility provider, but no contract exists between Andrew and the third-party payment facility provider. Andrew has only contracted with Ember. This is made clear in the terms and conditions of Andrew’s monthly plan and the invoice that shows that Ember is charging the fee to Andrew. The true nature of the legal arrangement is that Ember has supplied Andrew with multiple elements – mobile phone services and a payment facility – with each element itemised and charged for separately. Viewing the arrangement between Andrew and Ember from Andrew’s perspective, the dominant supply is the supply of mobile phone services, even though he is paying a fee as consideration for using the payment facility. Andrew’s ability to use his debit card is not an aim in itself. The payment facility is ancillary to the dominant supply of the mobile phone services in that it enables that supply to occur. Consequently, the card processing fee is part of the $102 of consideration for a single composite supply of mobile phone services. It is not consideration for a separate supply. Therefore, Ember should return GST on the phone charges and the processing fee when calculating GST on the supply of mobile phone services. Example 4 – Buying furniture on an interest-free deal Mariana’s favourite furniture store, IKEO is advertising 12 months’ interest- free credit on purchases over $1,000 made using a Wow credit card. Wow credit cards are issued by a finance company. Mariana decides to purchase a $2,500 lounge suite using her Wow credit card, taking advantage of the 12 months’ interest-free deal. The consultant tells Mariana there will be a 2% credit card fee on her purchase ($50) and an advance fee ($35). The advance fee is a one-off fee the Wow credit card company charges to cover the costs of processing the interest-free credit offer. The consultant provides Mariana with a sales voucher from the Wow credit card company that she asks Mariana to sign. The voucher states that Wow is advancing Mariana $2,550 for the furniture purchase and $35 for the advance QB 18/14: 7 Sep 2018 9 UNCLASSIFIED fee at 0% per annum for 12 months. IKEO is not a party to the agreement between Mariana and Wow. Wow is not a party to the agreement between Mariana and IKEO. Based on the legal arrangements, there are two separate supplies for GST purposes. IKEO is supplying furniture to Mariana and Wow is supplying finance to Mariana. The $50 credit card fee relates to the supply of furniture by IKEO. It is charged and invoiced by IKEO as consideration for Mariana using the credit card payment facility IKEO offers to its customers. The credit card fee is calculated by reference to the amount of the furniture purchase. The $35 advance fee relates to the supply of the interest-free credit. The advance fee is charged by Wow under its credit contract with Mariana and is identified as consideration for the processing services required to supply the credit. The $50 credit card fee is part of the consideration for a single composite supply of furniture by IKEO. It is not consideration for a separate supply of the payment facility by IKEO. The payment facility is ancillary to the dominant supply of the furniture. Accessing the credit card payment facility is not an aim in itself for Mariana; instead, it only facilitates the supply of the furniture in the sense of enabling Mariana to pay for it. Therefore, there is a single, composite, taxable supply of furniture, so all the elements of the supply under the agreement (that is, the furniture and the credit card fee) are subject to GST. The $35 advance fee is part of the consideration for a single composite supply of interest-free credit by Wow. It is not consideration for a separate supply of processing services by Wow. The true nature of the legal arrangement is for the supply of multiple elements, namely the interest-free credit and the documenting and processing services. Viewing the arrangement between Mariana and Wow from Mariana’s perspective, the dominant supply is the supply of the interest-free credit. The processing services are ancillary to the dominant supply of the interest-free credit. Obtaining the processing services is not an aim in itself for Mariana. She has obtained these services only as a necessary pre-condition for securing the interest-free credit. Therefore, there is a single, composite supply of interest-free credit, which is an exempt supply of “financial services”. As a result, the processing service element of that supply is also exempt from GST. A third party supplies the payment facility directly to the customer 29. Depending on the contractual arrangements, it may be that instead of the supplier supplying the payment facility to the customer, a third party supplies the payment facility to the customer under a separate contract. In these cases, the contract between the supplier and the customer will only be for the goods or services. A separate contract will occur between the third party providing the payment facility and the customer. Payment facility provider Supplier Customer Payment facility Money Money Goods / Services QB 18/14: 7 Sep 2018 10 UNCLASSIFIED 30. If it can be established that there is a separate supply of a payment facility to a customer by a third party, the GST treatment of that separate supply will not be determined by the GST treatment of the supply of goods or services by the supplier. This is because the supply of the payment facility is a separate supply between different parties. The GST treatment of the supply of the payment facility will need to be determined by considering the nature of what has actually been supplied. 31. Even where the supply of the payment facility is a separate supply, the Commissioner’s view is that it will not be an exempt supply of a “financial service” if the payment facility only provides access to the payment network and facilitates the exchange of information between the card issuer, the acquiring bank and the supplier. 32. The provision of such a payment facility does not amount to the “arranging” of “financial services” under s 3(1)(l), because whether the credit or debit card is charged or settlement occurs, depends on the card issuer’s overriding decision. The payment facility provider’s role on these facts is limited to transmitting and recording the information that is relied on by the card issuer in making these decisions. Example 5 – a third party supplies the payment facility directly to the customer Lucas has set up an online shop called Cheap Feet to sell his animal print socks. Customers select socks and add them to an online shopping cart. When it comes time to pay for their order, customers are automatically directed to an online payment website called PAYBO. PAYBO is an online payment platform that provides access to the payment network and facilitates the exchange of information between the card issuer, the acquiring bank and Cheap Feet. It does not debit or credit the customer’s account nor does it provide a guarantee to Cheap Feet that settlement will occur. Customers using this service must agree to the PAYBO terms and conditions, which includes permitting PAYBO to charge a 2% credit card surcharge on top of the purchase price. That charge is paid directly to PAYBO. The true nature of the legal arrangements is that there are two separate supplies being made. Cheap Feet has made a supply of goods (the socks) to the customer. PAYBO has made a supply of credit card payment facilities to the customer. Cheap Feet is not a party to the agreement between the customer and PAYBO. The supply of goods from Cheap Feet to the customer is subject to GST at the standard rate. PAYBO will need to determine how to treat the supply of payment facilities to the customer by analysing the services provided under its contract with the customer. Summary 33. The relevant legal principles for determining the GST treatment of fees that suppliers charge customers for using a credit or debit card to purchase goods or services are:  To identify what has been supplied, consider the true nature of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out by the supplier and the recipient in light of the surrounding circumstances: see Marac Life Assurance. QB 18/14: 7 Sep 2018 11 UNCLASSIFIED  Where two (or more) persons are involved in supplying goods or services to a customer, contractual arrangements between all the parties need to be examined to determine who is supplying what to whom: see Databank (PC) and Auckland Institute.  It is necessary to examine the supply from the point of view of the consumer (the customer) by considering the true and substantial nature of the consideration given for the payment by the consumer: see Auckland Institute.  If an agent makes a supply of a payment facility to the supplier’s customer, then the supplier will be treated as making the supply of the payment facility to the customer: see s 60(1) and Databank.  Where a supplier contracts with a third-party to provide a payment facility to the supplier’s customers, the supplier and not the third-party will be treated as supplying the payment facility to the customers: see Databank; Auckland Institute and Debenhams.

19 December 2018 UNCLASSIFIED Question When is the sale of a section subdivided from a residential property sold within the bright-line period excluded from the bright-line test? Answer The sale is excluded when the main home exclusion applies. The main home exclusion will apply when: • more than 50% of the area of the land in the subdivided section has been used for a dwelling that was the seller’s main home; and • the seller has used the land in the subdivided section in that manner for more than 50% of the time since the seller acquired the undivided land. Explanation The bright-line test 1. The bright-line test taxes residential land sold within the bright-line period. 2. This bright-line test applies to residential land that a person first acquired an interest in on or after 1 October 2015. The period of the bright-line test increased from 2 years to 5 years for residential land that a person first acquired an interest in, on or after 29 March 2018 (see s 6(2) of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018). Therefore, this QWBA refers to QB 18/16 Income tax — bright-line test — main home exclusion — sale of subdivided section QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) explains when a section subdivided from a residential property sold within the bright-line period will be excluded from the bright-line test. It will be of interest to sellers seeking to rely on the main home exclusion. Key provisions Income Tax Act 2007, ss CB 6A and CB 16A Key terms Bright-line period: The bright-line period is 2 years or 5 years, depending on the rules in place when the seller acquired the land. Bright-line test: The bright- line test applies to tax sales of residential land occurring within the bright-line period. Curtilage: An area of land attached to a dwelling and forming one enclosure with it, such as a yard or garden. Subdividing involves the legal division of land into multiple sections and the creation of new legal titles for each section. QB 18/16: 19 December 2018 2 UNCLASSIFIED the “bright-line period” (which will be 2 years or 5 years, depending on when the seller first acquired an interest in the land). Scope of this QWBA 3. This QWBA is about whether the main home exclusion to the bright-line test can apply in a situation where: • there is undivided land which contains a dwelling (which is the seller’s main home); • the land is subdivided into new sections, one which contains the dwelling and another (or others) which does not contain a dwelling; and • the subdivided section (or one of the sections) without a dwelling is sold. 4. Under the main home exclusion, if residential land has been used predominantly for a dwelling that is the seller’s main home and used in this manner for most of the time the seller has owned the land, then the sale of that land within the bright-line period is excluded from being taxed under the bright-line test. 5. In this QWBA, it is assumed that none of the other land rules in ss CB 6 to CB 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply to the sale of the subdivided section, eg s CB 6, which applies to the sale of land acquired for the purpose of re-sale. The bright-line test needs to be considered only where the sale is not taxed under any of the other land rules in ss CB 6 to CB 12. 6. Additionally, for simplicity this QWBA assumes that the person disposing of the land is not the trustee of a trust. However, the analysis and conclusions in this QWBA are equally applicable if: • The person disposing of the land is the trustee of a trust, and • The dwelling was the main home for a beneficiary of the trust; and either o A principal settlor of the trust does not have a main home; or o The dwelling was the main home of a principal settlor. How does the bright-line test apply to a sale of the subdivided section? 7. Before considering the main home exclusion further, it is useful to consider how the bright-line test applies to the sale of a subdivided section. Section CB 6A(1) sets out the basic bright-line test for sales of residential land within the bright-line period, and s CB 6A(2) sets out a special rule that applies to sales of residential land that the seller has subdivided. 8. Essentially, under s CB 6A(2), when a person sells a section of land that they have subdivided, the bright-line period that applies is the bright-line period that would have applied to the undivided land. Therefore, the bright-line period for the subdivided section does not begin when that subdivided section is registered; rather it begins when the transfer of the undivided land to the seller was registered. The fact that separate computer registers (previously certificates of title) are created for the subdivided sections is irrelevant to the bright-line period. 9. The bright-line test applies to “residential land”, which is a broadly defined term. The broad definition means that a subdivided section of land can still be residential land even where there is no dwelling on the land. For land to be residential land, it is sufficient that it is land for which the owner has an arrangement that relates to erecting a dwelling, or that the land is bare land that may be used for erecting a dwelling under the operative district plan. QB 18/16: 19 December 2018 3 UNCLASSIFIED 10. The definition of residential land also excludes land that is: • “farmland”, or • used predominantly as business premises. 11. If a subdivided section of land is not residential land, the sale of the section will not be subject to the bright-line test. Can the main home exclusion apply to a sale of a subdivided section of land? 12. The main home exclusion can apply to the sale of a subdivided section of land. This is despite the subdivided section of land being recorded in a different computer register (certificate of title) from the undivided land and despite the land having no dwelling on it. This is because the land in the subdivided section may still have been used predominantly, for most of the time the person owns the land, for a dwelling that was the seller’s main home, as required by s CB 16A(1). The onus is on the seller to prove the main home exclusion applies and, therefore, that the bright-line test does not apply. 13. The following discusses the requirements of the main home exclusion generally before discussing how these requirements can be satisfied by a subdivided section of land. The main home exclusion 14. The main home exclusion in s CB 16A(1) provides: CB 16A Main home exclusion for disposal within 5 years Main home exclusion (1) Section CB 6A does not apply to a person who disposes of residential land, if the land has been used predominantly, for most of the time the person owns the land, for a dwelling that was the main home for— (a) the person; or (b) a beneficiary of a trust, if the person is a trustee of the trust and— (i) a principal settlor of the trust does not have a main home; or (ii) if a principal settlor of the trust does have a main home, it is that main home which the person is disposing of. \[Emphasis added\] 15. For the main home exclusion to apply, the land in question must have been used predominantly, for most of the time the seller owned it, for a dwelling that was the seller’s main home. This test has a number of elements, which are discussed below. 16. The land in the subdivided section must have been used predominantly for a dwelling that was the seller’s main home for more than 50% of the seller’s period of ownership. “Main home” is defined in s YA 1: main home means, for a person, the 1 dwelling— (a) that is mainly used as a residence by the person (a home); and (b) with which the person has the greatest connection, if they have more than 1 home 17. There are three points to note from the “main home” definition: • A person can only have one “main home” under this definition. • To be the “main home” of a person, a dwelling must be mainly used as a residence by the person (ie, a home). QB 18/16: 19 December 2018 4 UNCLASSIFIED • If the person has more than one home, the main home is the home with which the person has the greatest connection. 18. The Commissioner’s guidance on the “permanent place of abode” test can assist in determining which property the seller has the greatest connection with. That guidance is in “IS 16/03: Tax residence” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 10 (October 2016): 2. 19. Land that is “used... for a dwelling” is not limited to the land on which the dwelling is situated or to the surrounding curtilage (like a yard and garden). Land used for a dwelling can also include other areas the seller uses frequently, repeatedly or customarily in connection with or for the benefit of the dwelling. In the Commissioner’s view, for an area of land to be “used for a dwelling” the land must be actually used for the dwelling. It is the actual use of the land, rather than any intended use, that is relevant. 20. The extent to which residential land is used in connection with or for the benefit of a dwelling is a question of fact that turns on the circumstances of each case. Factors that may indicate land is being used for a dwelling include whether the land is: • set aside exclusively for private residential purposes; • being used for an activity that complements or adds to the enjoyment of the dwelling; • clearly identifiable as being used in connection with or for the benefit of the dwelling; and • incidental to the enjoyment of the dwelling. 21. The area of land in question must have been used for a dwelling by the seller. 22. For the main home exclusion to apply, the land in the subdivided section needs to have been used predominantly for a dwelling that was the seller’s main home. This is a physical area test. The test involves a comparison of the physical area of land used by the seller for the dwelling and the total area. “Predominantly” in this context means more than 50%. 23. From time to time, particularly where the split between the seller’s private residential use of the land in the subdivided section and their use of the land in the subdivided section for other purposes is close, the nature and the importance of the different uses could be taken into account to determine the seller’s predominant use. The Commissioner considers this is the best interpretation of the exclusion because it is consistent with the scheme of the land rules and the purpose of the provision. It also takes into account case law on the interpretation of words like “predominantly” in the context of the land rules. 24. The words “for most of the time the person owns the land” require a comparison between the length of time the land was predominantly used for a dwelling by the seller and the length of time the seller owned the land. “Most” means more than 50%. The main home exclusion can apply to a subdivided section of land 25. The main home exclusion can apply to a subdivided section of land. There is no need for there to be a dwelling on the subdivided section. Land in a subdivided section without a dwelling can satisfy the requirement of being used predominantly, for most of the time the seller owned it, for a dwelling that was the seller’s main home. 26. Section CB 23B clarifies that the land taxing provisions and the exclusions apply to an amount derived from the disposal of land where that land is part of the land to which the relevant section applies, the whole of the land to which the relevant section applies QB 18/16: 19 December 2018 5 UNCLASSIFIED or disposed of together with other land to which the relevant section applies. The Commissioner considers that s CB 23B does not affect the conclusion that the main home exclusion can apply to a subdivided section of land and that there is no need for there to be a dwelling on the subdivided section. 27. The Commissioner considers the seller of a subdivided section of land owns the land in the subdivided section from the date they acquired the undivided land. The fact that new computer registers (certificates of title) are created on subdivision does not mean that the seller did not already own the land in the subdivided section. The seller had an interest in the land in the subdivided section while it was part of the estate of the undivided land. 28. The land in the subdivided section could satisfy the requirements of the main home exclusion based solely on the use of the land in the subdivided section prior to the subdivision. The use of the land in the subdivided section after subdivision could also be relevant if, before being sold, the land continues to be used for a dwelling on one of the other sections resulting from the subdivision. Example 1 – sale of subdivided section of land with no new dwelling Simon acquires a property as his main home and, due to a change of circumstances, decides to subdivide it after 2 months. New computer registers (certificates of title) are created for the subdivided section with the dwelling and the subdivided section at the rear of the property that was used as the backyard for Simon’s home (the backyard section). While attempting to sell the backyard section, Simon continues to enjoy the land in the section as his backyard. Simon eventually manages to sell the section 12 months later. The sale of the backyard section is within the bright-line period that would have applied for the undivided property. Simon can use the main home exclusion for the sale because the land in the backyard section was predominantly used in connection with a dwelling that was Simon’s main home for most of (in fact, all of) the time he owned the land. 29. Some activities undertaken on land in a subdivided section, before or after subdivision, may mean that the land is not being used for a dwelling that was the seller’s main home. The period of ownership while that activity was being undertaken will need to be taken into account when calculating whether the seller has used the land in the subdivided section for a dwelling that was their main home for most of the time it was owned. QB 18/16: 19 December 2018 6 UNCLASSIFIED Example 2 – sale of subdivided section of land with new dwelling Same facts as in Example 1 except that immediately after subdividing the backyard section Simon clears the area and begins constructing a new dwelling with surrounding curtilage (a small garden and a garage). The main home exclusion will not apply to the sale of the backyard section of land because the land in the section was not used predominantly for a dwelling that was Simon’s main home for most of the time he owned the land. Simon owned the land for a period of 14 months, but only used the land in the subdivided section for his main home for 2 months. Example 3 – Delay in using the land as the main home Hugo purchases empty land with the intention of building his dream home on it. It takes 18 months to obtain finalised architectural plans, the relevant building consents and engage a builder. Construction and final sign off take a further 18 months to complete. While the house is under construction Hugo lives with family in a nearby suburb. Hugo finally moves into the house 3 years after purchasing the land. The cost of construction was more than Hugo had anticipated and he decides to subdivide and sell off a portion of his backyard to help pay his mortgage. It takes a further year after moving into the house for Hugo to subdivide and sell the portion of his backyard. At all times during this period the subdivided portion of the backyard remained part of the backyard and Hugo continued to use it. Even though the subdivided portion of Hugo’s backyard was used predominantly for his dwelling (as the backyard), the sale of the subdivided portion of the backyard is not excluded from the bright-line test by the main home exclusion. Hugo has owned the land for 4 years, but only lived in the house for 1 of the 4 years (25% of the time he owned the land). Hugo has not used the subdivided portion of the backyard for a dwelling that was his main home for more than 50% of the time that he has owned the land. How many times can a seller use the main home exclusion? 30. Under s CB 16A(2) the main home exclusion will not be available where a seller disposes of residential land and: • the seller has already used the main home exclusion two or more times within the 2 years immediately preceding the bright-line date (eg, in the case of a sale of land, within 2 years of the date the sale agreement is entered into); or • the seller has engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of residential land. 31. Each section of land that results from a subdivision is a separate piece of residential land. If the main home exclusion is applied to the sale of multiple sections of land resulting from a subdivision (which could include the section with the dwelling), the application of the exclusion to each section will count as a separate use of the exclusion for the purposes of s CB 16A(2)(a). 32. This means, for example, if an area of residential land was subdivided into three sections of land and all three sections were sold and the main home exclusion was relied on for the sale of the first two sections, the main home exclusion could not be relied on for the sale of the third section (or for any other sales made by the seller in the following 2 years). 33. Additionally, the acquisition of undivided land and subsequent sales of subdivided sections will be taken into account when determining whether the seller has engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of residential land.

1 UNCLASSIFIED Question What are the provisional tax implications when a person earning salary or wages subject to PAYE receives a one-off amount of income without any tax withheld and their residual income tax exceeds $2,500? Answer An employee who receives an amount of income without tax withheld and whose residual income tax exceeds $2,500 is a provisional taxpayer even if their prior year’s residual income tax was $2,500 or less. If the residual income tax is $60,000 or more, the person will be exposed to use-of-money interest if they do not pay provisional tax instalments. If their residual income tax is less than $60,000, the person will not have exposure to use-of-money interest provided they pay the residual income tax on or before the terminal tax date. If they file a tax return they will need to indicate in that return what provisional tax method they will use for the following year and make the instalments accordingly. If their tax position is automatically calculated, they will be treated as required to pay provisional tax in the following year under the standard method and notified accordingly before each instalment date, unless they elect to use the estimation method. If their residual income tax in the following year is $2,500 or less, they will not be a provisional taxpayer, but will still have an obligation to pay instalments under either the standard or estimation methods. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) considers the impact of the provisional tax rules on employees who receive one-off amounts of income not taxed at source. Key provisions Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA), ss RC 2(2), RC 3, RC 4, RC 5, RC 7, RC 9(9), RC 12 Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), ss 3(1) (“new provisional taxpayer”) 120KB, 120KBB, 120KE Key terms Provisional Tax: income tax paid as instalments Residual income tax: Income tax liability minus tax credits Terminal tax date: Generally, 7 February of the following tax year Use-of-money interest: money charged on late or underpaid tax or paid on overpaid tax QB 19/03 Provisional tax – impact on employees who receive one- off amounts of income without tax deducted QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED WITHDRAWN replaced by QB 23/05 QB 19/03: 24 April 2019 2 UNCLASSIFIED Explanation 1.This Question We’ve Been Asked has arisen because salary and wage earners can sometimes receive significant one-off lump sum amounts of income without tax deducted at source, such as: •an amount of recovered depreciation on the sale of a rental property; •the receipt of beneficiary income from a trust where s HD 4(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) applies; •the transfer of shares to an employee under an employee share scheme where the employer has chosen not to deduct PAYE; and •gains made on the redemption of a bond that has been acquired at a discount to face value. 2.Because such people have PAYE deducted at source on their normal income, and do not usually have residual income tax exceeding $2,500, they may not have previously been a provisional taxpayer. 3.If they continue as employees in the tax year in which they receive the one-off amount of income, they will not be classed as a “new provisional taxpayer” under the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) (identified as a “person who has an initial provisional tax liability” under the ITA). However, if the one-off income amount without tax deducted results in residual income tax that is over $2,500 the person will become a provisional taxpayer (as defined in the TAA) because they are a person who is liable to pay provisional tax under s RC 3(1) of the ITA. 4.It is common for people in this situation (who have filed their return by 7 July) to have had residual income tax of $2,500 or less in the year before they receive the one-off amount of income. This means that s RC 3(3) of the ITA applies, so they have “no obligation to pay provisional tax” in the income year in which they derive the one-off amount of income. 5.This Question We’ve Been Asked explores what having “no obligation to pay provisional tax” means in a practical sense and what the consequences are in terms of interest exposure if provisional tax is not paid or is voluntarily paid when residual income tax is $60,000 or more. It also examines the implications for a person if their residual income tax is less than $60,000. Finally, it discusses the following tax year provisional tax consequences in both instances. Application of provisional tax rules to one-off amounts of income where no tax has been deducted 6.A salary and wage earner with PAYE deducted at source will become subject to the provisional tax rules if they have residual income tax that exceeds $2,500 in any tax year. Section RC 3(1) of the ITA makes such a person liable to pay provisional tax for that tax year, so they are a “provisional taxpayer” as defined in s 3(1) of the TAA. A person who is liable to pay provisional tax then has a choice of methods to calculate the tax payable under s RC 5 of the ITA. For an employee receiving a one-off income amount the choice is practically limited to the standard method or the estimation method or a combination of the two methods. 7.If that person has had residual income tax of $2,500 or less in the prior tax year, s RC 3(3) of the ITA applies, and they will have “no obligation to pay provisional tax” in the relevant tax year. The intention behind this provision is to provide flexibility for taxpayers who will often have difficulty predicting receipt of income that has had no or insufficient tax deducted. It does not, however, remove them from the provisional tax WITHDRAWN QB 19/03: 24 April 2019 3 UNCLASSIFIED rules as they continue to retain their status as a provisional taxpayer under the TAA by being “liable to pay provisional tax” under s RC 3(1) of the ITA, despite having no obligation to pay provisional tax under s RC 3(3) of the ITA. 8.A person who chooses to pay provisional tax under s RC 4 of the ITA is also treated under s RC 3(1)(b) of the ITA as a person liable to pay provisional tax. Section RC 2(2) of the ITA re-emphasises that “the provisional tax rules apply to a person who is required or who chooses to pay provisional tax”. Choosing to pay can assist with mitigating exposure to use-of-money interest when residual income tax is $60,000 or more. Application of provisional tax rules when residual income tax on income without tax deducted is $60,000 or more 9.Because the prior year residual income tax was $2,500 or less, an employee who has residual income tax of $60,000 or more arising from receipt of income without tax deducted at source has no obligation to pay provisional tax on instalment dates. However, such a person may choose to pay provisional tax using a method prescribed by s 120KBB of the TAA to limit exposure to use-of-money interest. Voluntary payments of the expected residual income tax amount by the last instalment date will mitigate exposure to use-of-money interest. 10.To be eligible for use-of-money interest relief, the person must be an “interest concession provisional taxpayer.” This expression is defined in s 120KBB(4)(a) of the TAA: interest concession provisional taxpayer means a person that is liable to pay provisional tax for an income year if— (i)the person uses 1 of the standard methods described in section RC 5(2) or (3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 for the tax year: (ii)the person uses the estimation method described in section RC 5(5) of that Act but their payments of provisional tax on or before the instalment dates for the tax year, other than the last 1, are not under the estimation method and are equal to the amounts given by section RC 10 of that Act, using section RC 10(3)(a)(i) or (ii) as applicable, for those relevant instalments: 11.Under s 120KBB of the TAA, if the person adopts the standard method and they top up their last instalment payment to pay any difference between the residual income tax and the three instalment payments made, they will not have any exposure to use-of- money interest. For taxpayers with a standard 31 March balance date, these provisional tax instalments are on 28 August (P1), 15 January (P2) and 7 May (P3). 12.If the person had no residual income tax assessed the previous year or their residual income tax was $2,500 or less in that year, their instalment payments using the standard method at P1–P3 will be zero on each occasion. The standard method is the default option, so if the person does not advise Inland Revenue of the option selected this is what they will be treated as having adopted. They can then top up the instalment made on P3 to ensure they pay the entire residual income tax for the current year on that date. If this course is followed, the person will be exposed to use-of- money interest from P3 if they underpay, or entitled to credit interest if they overpay, the RIT on or before P3. If they did have residual income tax exceeding $2,500 in the prior year, then they must pay the amounts identified in \[11\] above at each of P1–P3 plus top up to the full residual income tax amount at P3, to not be exposed to use-of- money interest. 13.A further option to obtain the interest concession is to use the standard method for the P1 and P2 instalments and on or before P3 switch to the estimation method. There is still a requirement to top up the P3 payment by the balance required to pay the residual WITHDRAWN QB 19/03: 24 April 2019 4 UNCLASSIFIED income tax less the value of instalments paid at P1–P3 to manage the use-of-money interest exposure. However, this option will provide more flexibility for a person who expects their residual income tax to be lower than the prior year or who does not know what their residual income tax is by P3 (usually on 7 May) even though this is some time after the standard balance date of 31 March. Application of provisional tax rules when residual income tax on income without tax deducted is under $60,000 14.Employees whose income without a tax deduction results in residual income tax of less than $60,000 may avail themselves of the use-of-money interest safe harbour under s 120KE of the TAA by making payment of all the residual income tax in one instalment on the terminal tax date. For most taxpayers with a standard 31 March balance date this is 7 February the following year. This can be extended if their tax account is linked to a tax agent with an extension of time. 15.A person who meets this criterion will qualify for this safe harbour if they have no obligation to pay provisional tax under s RC 3(3) of the ITA because their residual income tax for the prior year was $2,500 or less. 16.They will also qualify where they did have residual income tax over $2,500 in the prior year but paid all amounts due on or before P1–P3 using the standard method set out in ss RC 5(2) and (3) of the ITA and calculated under the formula in s RC 10(2) of the ITA. Refer to Inland Revenue Department NZ, Provisional tax, Paying your income tax in instalments IR289 for more detail on the standard method (the standard option). 17.This terminal tax safe harbour is not available if the person has adopted the estimation method to pay their provisional tax under s RC 7 of the ITA. Provisional tax consequences in the following tax year 18.As a result of having residual income tax that is over $2,500 in a tax year, a person has an obligation to pay provisional tax the following year. If their tax position has been automatically calculated, they will be advised in that following tax year to pay provisional tax on instalment dates based on the standard method unless they elect to use the estimation method. Such an election can be made using secure email via myIR or by phone or letter. If they file a tax return in the year when they derived the one-off income and their residual income tax exceeded $2,500, they must in that return indicate what provisional tax method they will adopt for making payments in the following tax year. 19.Often an employee in receipt of a one-off amount of income without tax deducted will not be expecting to derive any further income of this nature in the following year. If they elect to use, or by default use, the standard method this will result in payments being made in the following year of at least 105% of the prior year’s residual income tax. As a result, they may choose to adopt the estimation method and estimate their provisional tax at nil and then make no payments at each instalment in that subsequent year. 20.When a person chooses the estimation method, they are exposed to use-of-money interest on any shortfall at each instalment date if their residual income tax for that year exceeds $2,500. They are also obliged to revise their estimate during the year to ensure its accuracy if their residual income tax exceeds $2,500. Consequently, if the employee adopts the estimation method for the succeeding year, they need to understand these risks when making that choice should it turn out that their residual income tax is more than $2,500. WITHDRAWN QB 19/03: 24 April 2019 5 UNCLASSIFIED Summary 21.A salary and wage earner who receives income without tax deducted at source resulting in residual income tax of $60,000 or more in a tax year and who did not have residual income tax over $2,500 in the prior year, will have exposure to use-of-money interest if they do not pay all the residual income tax by P3. P3 is 7 May for taxpayers with a standard 31 March balance date. 22.A salary and wage earner who receives income without tax deducted resulting in residual income tax of less than $60,000, and who did not have residual income tax over $2,500 in the prior year, will not be exposed to use-of-money interest if they pay the residual income tax on or before the terminal tax date. 23.In both situations, the person will be obliged to pay provisional tax in the income year following receipt of the amount if the residual income tax in the year of receipt exceeded $2,500. If their tax position has been automatically calculated, they will be advised to pay provisional tax on instalment dates based on the standard method, unless they elect to use the estimation method. Alternatively, if they file a tax return they must elect to pay provisional tax under the standard method or the estimation method when they file their return, and by P1 of the following year at the latest. If no election is made, the person is treated by default as adopting the standard method. 24.If they do not expect to derive any further income without tax deducted, they may choose to adopt the estimation method, but this will expose them to use-of-money interest on any shortfalls at each of P1–P3 if they do in fact have residual income tax that exceeds $2,500. Adopting the standard method is likely to result in over payment but their use-of-money interest exposure at each of P1–P3 will be limited to the lesser of one-third of the residual income tax where it exceeds $2,500 or the amount payable under the standard method. This might be more suitable if there is uncertainty about the income without tax deducted they will derive in that subsequent year. 25.The following flowchart and examples illustrate these points: WITHDRAWN QB 19/03: 24 April 2019 6 UNCLASSIFIED Provisional Tax / Use-Of-Money Interest Exposure Are you an employee with one-off income not taxed at source and prior year residual income tax of $2,500 or less? Use-of-money interest does not apply Yes No Is your residual income tax less than $60,000? Is your residual income tax $60,000 or more? Yes No No use-of-money interest if residual income tax paid by terminal tax date No use-of-money interest if residual income tax is fully paid by the last instalment date Is your residual income tax more than $2,500? Yes Yes WITHDRAWN QB 19/03: 24 April 2019 7 UNCLASSIFIED Examples Example 1 – One-off income amount derived by salary and wage earner resulting in residual income tax of $60,000 or more Facts: Jackie is the chief executive of Goboy Ltd with a salary of $150,000 per year and no residual income tax in the 2017 tax year. She is advised in December 2017 that she is immediately entitled under the executive share scheme to shares in Goboy with a market value of $200,000. Goboy elects not to treat this benefit as subject to PAYE but it is still reported to Inland Revenue as a benefit under the PAYE rules. Jackie derives the benefit as income not taxed at source in the 2018 tax year. Question: What is Jackie’s liability to pay provisional tax in the 2018 and 2019 tax years and her exposure to use-of-money interest due to receipt of that benefit when she continues throughout this time as a salaried chief executive? Answer – 2018 tax year: As Jackie never ceases being an employee, she will not have an “initial provisional tax liability” under s RC 9(9) of the ITA in the 2018 tax year. She will have a residual income tax liability on the share benefit of $66,000. Since her residual income tax is more than $2,500, she is “liable to pay provisional tax” under s RC 3(1) of the ITA, so is a “provisional taxpayer” under s 3(1) of the TAA. This is despite Jackie having no residual income tax in the 2017 income year, so having “no obligation to pay provisional tax” for the 2018 income year under s RC 3(3). Jackie can qualify as an “interest concession provisional taxpayer” under s 120KBB of the TAA if she voluntarily uses the standard or estimation methods in the prescribed manner. Because her residual income tax is $60,000 or more, the terminal tax payment concession under s 120KE does not apply. Jackie is not exposed to use-of-money interest until P3 but can make voluntary payments at any time between P1 and P3. While Jackie could also file an estimate for P3 this is not necessary as her use-of-money interest liability will be determined by her actual residual income tax either way. Jackie would be best to make voluntary payments of the amount she expects to be her 2018 residual income tax by P3 (7 May 2018) as she will have exposure to use-of-money interest from that date on any payments (or over payments) of her actual 2018 residual income tax. Answer – 2019 tax year: Jackie is likely to have her tax position automatically calculated in the 2019 tax year and will be advised to pay provisional tax before each instalment date under the standard method unless she elects to use the estimation method. If Jackie did file a 2018 income tax return, Jackie must make an election as to the method she wants to adopt for paying provisional tax in the 2019 tax year because her residual income tax exceeds $2,500. She is not expecting any further benefits under the Goboy executive share scheme, nor any other income receipts without tax deducted at source, so is reluctant to adopt the standard method, which would demand three payments of $23,100. So, she considers adopting the estimation method and then making payments of zero on the assumption she will not have any residual income tax exceeding $2,500 in 2019. If Jackie adopts the estimation method, it must be a fair and reasonable estimate of her residual income tax and she must inform Inland Revenue of the estimate on or before P1. WITHDRAWN QB 19/03: 24 April 2019 8 UNCLASSIFIED Jackie’s tax agent advises that if Jackie does use the estimation method, she needs to consider the risks. If Jackie does have residual income tax over $2,500 in the 2019 tax year, including from untaxed income that unexpectedly arises, she must re-estimate her 2019 provisional tax when she becomes aware of this income. The revised estimate will apply to the remaining 2019 provisional tax payments. Jackie will have an exposure to use-of-money interest where her 2019 residual income tax exceeds $2,500 equal to that residual income tax amount divided by three at each instalment date, less any amounts paid. Jackie can make voluntary payments at the time of revising her estimates to help mitigate use-of-money interest for instalments already paid or use tax pooling funds at backdated effective dates within the applicable time frames. Jackie should file her nil estimate on or before P1, otherwise if she does not pay $23,100 by P1 she risks late payment penalties if her 2019 residual income tax is more than $2,500. Even if Jackie’s 2019 residual income tax is not more than $2,500, by not paying P1 Jackie also risks late payment penalties if her 2019 residual income tax is later reassessed to more than $2,500. Alternatively, Jackie could use the standard method for her 2019 tax return. The required payments will be 105% of $66,000 divided by three at each of P1–P3. If she has not filed her 2018 return because of an extension of time she can use 110% of her 2017 residual income tax of $0 divided by 3 (ie pay nothing) for P1, but must then use 105% of 2018 residual income tax x 2/3rds (ie $46,200) for her P2 payment if the 2018 return is filed by then, which would usually be the case. If she pays nothing at P1–P3, she will have an exposure to use-of-money interest on the lesser of the actual residual income tax (if it exceeds $2,500) and the amounts payable under the standard method. Jackie can make voluntary top-up payments to mitigate her use-of-money interest risk or use tax pooling funds at backdated effective dates within the applicable timeframes if her untaxed income unexpectedly arises. Jackie faces the same late payment penalty risks as she would for estimating if she is required to make any payments under the standard option and fails to make these if her 2019 residual income tax turns out to be more than $2,500. Given these risks, the agent advises Jackie that she should adopt the estimation method and make no payments only if she is certain about not having any residual income tax that exceeds $2,500 in 2019. If Jackie is less certain about her untaxed income position for 2019, she could choose the standard method and pay all amounts required. If this results in an overpayment Jackie will receive a refund once her 2019 residual income tax has been assessed. Example 2 – One-off income amount derived by salary and wage earner resulting in residual income tax of less than $60,000 Facts: The facts are the same as in Example 1 except Jackie’s share entitlement is worth only $100,000 so her residual income tax is $33,000. Question: What are the provisional tax and use-of-money interest implications for the 2018 and 2019 tax years? Answer – 2018 tax year: Jackie has residual income tax of $33,000 so she is a provisional taxpayer under s RC 3(1) of the ITA despite her having no obligation to pay provisional tax under s RC 3(3) of the ITA due to having residual income tax of $2,500 or less in the 2017 tax year. Jackie qualifies under s 120KE of the TAA for payment of the RIT on the terminal tax date for the 2018 tax year because her residual income tax in 2018 was under $60,000. Jackie’s only exposure to use-of-money interest will occur if she does not pay the residual income tax amount on the terminal tax date. Answer – 2019 tax year: Jackie is most likely to have her tax position automatically calculated in the 2019 year and will be treated as liable to pay provisional tax based on the standard method unless she elects to use the estimation method. If Jackie files her 2018 tax return she will need to identify in that return what option she is going to use for paying provisional tax in 2019. As she is not expecting another share scheme benefit or any other income untaxed at source, Jackie notifies Inland Revenue that she WITHDRAWN QB 19/03: 24 April 2019 9 UNCLASSIFIED is adopting the estimation option of nil and then pays zero at each instalment date for the 2019 tax year. The same risks and options when selecting the estimation method as are discussed in Example 1 above are brought to her attention by the tax agent. If Jackie has residual income tax of more than $2,500 in the 2019 tax year, she will be exposed to use-of- money interest from P1 on shortfalls over the actual residual income tax divided by three at each payment date.

1 UNCLASSIFIED Question When should a person pay tax in their first year of business to prevent use-of-money interest charges? Answer A person who starts a business and has residual income tax of $60,000 or more should pay provisional tax in one to three equal instalments (dependent on the start date) to prevent use-of-money interest charges. A person who starts a business and has residual income tax of less than $60,000 must pay the residual income tax for their first year of business by the terminal tax date to prevent use-of-money interest charges. Explanation 1. The provisional tax rules apply to a person who is required or chooses to pay provisional tax. A person has no obligation to pay provisional tax for a tax year, if their residual income tax for the preceding tax year is $2,500 or less. But when a person starts a taxable activity that results in residual income tax of $60,000 or more in their first year they become a new provisional taxpayer and need to pay provisional tax instalments, or they will be exposed to use-of-money interest. The number of instalments required depends on when the business commenced. Use-of-money interest under s 120KC of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), is charged on any instalment shortfalls or paid on any instalment overpayments. Key provisions Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, s 6 Income Tax Act 2007, ss RC 3(3), RC 9(9), YA 1 (“initial provisional tax liability” and “taxable activity”) Tax Administration Act 1994, ss 3(1) (“new provisional taxpayer”), 120KC Key terms Provisional tax: income tax paid as instalments Residual income tax: income tax liability minus tax credits Terminal tax date: the date terminal tax is due Use-of-money interest: money charged on late or underpaid tax or paid for overpaid tax QB 19/04 Income tax – provisional tax and use of money interest implications for a person in their first year of business QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) has arisen because the provisional tax rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 apply to a “taxable activity”. Taxable activity is a term borrowed from the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. QB 19/04: 24 April 2019 2 UNCLASSIFIED 2. Originally, a “new provisional taxpayer” was a person who was GST registered and starting a taxable activity. However, this first requirement was removed in 2007 to ensure that someone who was not GST registered could also be treated as a new provisional taxpayer. But the requirement to “start a taxable activity” was left in. 3. The same term is also used in the resident withholding tax rules where it was thought necessary to use the GST definition of “taxable activity” with its inclusion of the phrase “whether or not for pecuniary profit” to capture the activity of the not-for-profit sector that is liable for income tax when income exceeds $1,000. The same approach applies to the provisional tax rules. 4. The GST concept of “taxable activity” is used for determining liability to pay provisional tax when starting a business. It includes anything done in connection with the beginning or ending of a taxable activity as well as any activity carried on continuously or regularly, irrespective of profit, involving or intended to involve the supply of goods and services. 5. However, unlike for GST, taxable activity also applies to the making of exempt GST supplies, such as financial services or providing residential accommodation. This is because income tax is payable on income arising from such activities but not GST. 6. The sort of questions that can arise include the following: • What sort of preliminary activities might, or might not, be treated as taxable activities? • What happens if an intention exists to carry on a business that then comes to a premature end? • If a start-up business has been running at a loss for several years and finally comes into profit will they be treated as starting a taxable activity in that profit year? 7. Numerous court decisions have explored what is meant by “taxable activity” in the GST context. These decisions can be equally applied to determine whether a person is starting a taxable activity for the purposes of s RC 9(9) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA). That section applies to a person with an “initial provisional tax liability”, an expression defined in s YA 1 of the ITA that also means a “new provisional taxpayer” in the TAA. Meaning of initial provisional tax liability 8. A person with an “initial provisional tax liability” under s RC 9(9) of the ITA is also described as a “new provisional taxpayer” in s 3(1) of the TAA. Section YA 1 defines the term: initial provisional tax liability, means— (a) for a person who is not a natural person, a provisional tax liability for a tax year in which the person starts to derive income from a taxable activity when— (i) they did not derive income from a taxable activity in any of the 4 previous tax years; and (ii) they have residual income tax of $60,000 or more in the tax year; and (b) for a person who is a natural person, a provisional tax liability for a tax year when— (i) they did not have residual income tax of more than $2,500 in any of the 4 previous tax years; and (ii) they have residual income tax of $60,000 or more in the tax year; and QB 19/04: 24 April 2019 3 UNCLASSIFIED (iii) in the tax year, they stopped deriving income from employment and then started to derive income from a taxable activity 9. This Question We’ve Been Asked focuses on the meaning of taxable activity and the residual income tax threshold for exposure to use-of-money interest. It, therefore, assumes the remaining requirements for having an initial provisional tax liability, as defined above, have been met. For example, it only applies to an individual who has stopped deriving income from employment and to taxpayers with residual income tax of $60,000 or more. 10. Section RC 9(9) of the ITA exposes new provisional taxpayers to use-of-money interest if they do not pay provisional tax on the number of provisional tax instalment dates determined by the start date of the taxable activity: Persons with initial provisional tax liability (9) A person with a new provisional tax liability who starts a taxable activity in a tax year is liable to pay interest calculated under section 120KC of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as if they were liable to pay provisional tax for the tax year— (a) in 3 instalments under subsection (3) if they start a taxable activity at some time in the period that starts at the beginning of the corresponding income year and ends 30 days before the date of instalment B: (b) in 2 instalments— (i) in a case to which section RC 13 applies; or (ii) if they pay GST on a 6-monthly basis and start a taxable activity at some time in the period that starts at the beginning of the corresponding income year and ends 30 days before the date of instalment C: (c) in 1 instalment in a case to which section RC 14 applies. \[Emphasis added\] 11. For taxpayers with a standard 31 March balance date, provisional tax instalments are on 28 August (P1), 15 January (P2) and 7 May (P3). The instalments referred to in s RC 9(9)(a) will be on these dates for such a taxpayer. 12. The expression “\[a\] person with a new provisional tax liability” is not defined in the ITA. However, the heading of s RC 9(9), “Person with initial provisional tax liability”, is an aide to the interpretation of this phrase. Section 5 of the Interpretation Act 1999 indicates that the meaning of an enactment must be ascertained from its text and in the light of its purpose. Headings may be considered as an indicator to the meaning of the provision. 13. The TAA defines a “new provisional taxpayer” in s 3(1) as a person who has an initial provisional tax liability as described in s YA 1 of the ITA. A person with an initial provisional tax liability is identified in s RC 9(9) as a person with a new provisional tax liability. Consequently, all three terms have the same meaning. 14. Section RC 9(9), from the 2018 tax year, treats both individuals and non-natural persons (such as companies) as new provisional taxpayers when they start a new taxable activity and have residual income tax of $60,000 or more. They usually will have no obligation to pay provisional tax under s RC 3(3), because their prior year’s residual income tax was $2,500 or less. But if they do not make one to three equal instalments of provisional tax (depending on the start date of the taxable activity) as set out in s 120KC of the TAA, they will be exposed to use-of-money interest on any shortfall. Overpayments at these instalment dates will entitle new provisional taxpayers to receive interest. QB 19/04: 24 April 2019 4 UNCLASSIFIED Meaning of taxable activity 15. In the provisional tax rules, “taxable activity” is defined as having the same meaning as it has in s 6 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GSTA) except that the exclusion in s 6(3)(d) (the making of exempt supplies) does not apply. GST exempt supplies such as financial services are subject to income tax, so the GST exclusion for these supplies is not relevant for provisional tax purposes. 16. Section 6(1)–(3)(d) of the GSTA defines “taxable activity”: (1) For the purposes of this Act, the term taxable activity means— (a) any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club: (b) without limiting the generality of paragraph (a), the activities of any public authority or any local authority. (2) Anything done in connection with the beginning or ending, including a premature ending, of a taxable activity is treated as being carried out in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity. (3) Notwithstanding anything in subsections (1) and (2), for the purposes of this Act the term taxable activity shall not include, in relation to any person, — (a) being a natural person, any activity carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby; or (aa) not being a natural person, any activity which, if it were carried on by a natural person, would be carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby; or (b) any engagement, occupation, or employment under any contract of service or as a director of a company, subject to subsection (4); or (c) any engagement, occupation, or employment— (i) pursuant to the Members of Parliament (Remuneration and Services) Act 2013 or the Governor-General Act 2010: (ii) as a Judge, Solicitor-General, Controller and Auditor-General, or Ombudsman: (iia) pursuant to an appointment made by the Governor-General or the Governor- General in Council and evidenced by a warrant or by an Order in Council or by a notice published in the Gazette in accordance with section 2(2) of the Official Appointments and Documents Act 1919: (iii) as a Chairman or member of any local authority or any statutory board, council, committee, or other body, subject to subsection (4); or (d) any activity to the extent to which the activity involves the making of exempt supplies. \[Emphasis added\] 17. The words in bold text are particularly relevant to the question asked. To be a “taxable activity”, the activity is described as: • being carried on continuously or regularly; • whether or not for pecuniary profit; • involving or intended to involve, in whole or part, the supply of goods and services; and QB 19/04: 24 April 2019 5 UNCLASSIFIED • includes anything done in connection with the beginning or ending (including a premature ending) of the taxable activity. 18. The courts have clarified the meaning of “activity” and what is meant by the phrase “carried on continuously or regularly”, and these are now well understood. Activity is a broad concept involving a combination of tasks undertaken, or a course of conduct pursued by, the taxpayer: CIR v Newman (1995) 17 NZTC 12,097 (CA), per Gault J at \[32\] and CIR v Bayly (1998) 18 NZTC 14,073 (CA), per Richardson P at \[23\]. 19. To be carried on “continuously or regularly”, the activity must not have ceased in a permanent sense or have been interrupted in a significant way. It must be carried on at reasonably short intervals with a steadiness or uniformity of action so that it recurs or is repeated at fairly fixed times or at generally uniform intervals to be of a habitual nature and character: Newman per Richardson J at \[20\]; Case N27 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,229 (TRA), Judge Bathgate at \[26\] and \[27\]; Allen Yacht Charters Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,270 (HC). 20. The activity must involve, or be intended to involve, the supply of goods or services for consideration. 21. Judge Bathgate in Case N27 at \[28\] noted the actual supply of goods and services is not necessary so long as there is an intention to be involved in that supply. He considered this introduced a subjective element to an otherwise objective provision. It would then be “a matter of fact and degree to be ascertained from all the evidence in a particular case”. If no actual supplies are made, there may still be a taxable activity if there is an intention that the activity will involve the making of supplies. 22. Judge Barber considered the application of s 6(2) of the GSTA in Case P73 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,489 (TRA), concluding that commencement work can be only added under that provision to the establishment of a taxable activity. Commencement work cannot by itself amount to a taxable activity. Therefore, if something is done in connection with the beginning of a taxable activity, that beginning activity is treated as part of that taxable activity. However, if no taxable activity is subsequently commenced, the commencement actions are not sufficient on their own to be treated as a taxable activity. Summary 23. The start of a taxable activity is a concept well understood in the GST context and it also applies to the provisional tax rules. It includes anything done in connection with the beginning or ending of a taxable activity as well as any activity carried on continuously or regularly, irrespective of profit, involving or intended to involve the supply of goods and services. Under the provisional tax rules, a taxable activity includes GST-exempt supplies and applies to persons who are not GST registered. 24. When a new provisional taxpayer starts a taxable activity, they will have an exposure to use-of-money interest where their residual income tax in that year is $60,000 or more if they do not pay one to three instalments on the provisional tax instalment dates as set out in s RC 9(9) of the ITA in conjunction with s 120KC of the TAA. Where two or three instalments are required, each payment must be of equal amounts. Where only one payment is required, it must be a lump sum payment on or before the third instalment date. This is despite a new provisional taxpayer not having an obligation to pay provisional tax under s RC 3(3) where their prior year’s residual income tax was $2,500 or less. 25. A new provisional taxpayer starting a taxable activity with residual income tax in that first year below $60,000 will, because of s 120KE of the TAA, be exposed to use-of- money interest only if they do not pay the residual income tax by the terminal tax date. QB 19/04: 24 April 2019 6 UNCLASSIFIED The terminal tax date is on 7 February of the following year for taxpayers with a 31 March balance date whose tax account is not linked to an agent with an extension of time arrangement. 26. The following flowcharts and examples illustrate these points: QB 19/04: 24 April 2019 7 UNCLASSIFIED Examples Example 1 – New business deriving only passive income with residual income tax of $60,000 or more Facts: Marnie Oil Ltd is established on 1 April 2018 and crowd-funds to grow plantation mānuka on the East Cape for mānuka oil production. It raises capital of $6 million that it invests at 4%, resulting in income of $240,000 and $67,200 residual income tax by 31 March 2019 (it holds a resident withholding tax exemption certificate). In the next tax year, it secures a forestry right over a block of land and begins planting with a view to harvesting and pressing leaves in years 4–10. It will also earn a share of income from bee-hives placed on the property by a mānuka honey producer. Question: Did Marnie Oil have an “initial provisional tax liability” for the 2019 tax year? Answer: Yes. Marnie Oil has residual income tax exceeding $60,000 at 31 March 2019. It has not at that date commenced a taxable activity, but it has raised capital and earned passive income on that capital while preparing to commence the mānuka plantation. This preparatory work in year 1 is treated as being the start of the taxable activity subsequently commenced in year 2, and Marnie Oil also had a firm intention in year 1 to be involved in the mānuka oil business when it sought and raised capital for this purpose. QB 19/04: 24 April 2019 8 UNCLASSIFIED This is the impact of the meaning of “taxable activity” for the provisional tax rules in the ITA that references to s 6 of the GSTA. Section 6(2) of the GSTA states, “\[a\]nything done in connection with the beginning or ending of a taxable activity is treated as being carried out in the furtherance of the taxable activity”. This approach was confirmed in Case P73. Furthermore, s 6(1)(a) of the GSTA states that a taxable activity can be an activity that “involves or is intended to involve” the making of taxable supplies. The plain meaning of the provision is that a taxpayer may have a taxable activity before any supplies are ever made. Consistent with this, Judge Bathgate in Case N27 held that the supply of goods and services is not necessary, provided an intention exists to be involved in that supply. Numerous examples of this occur in primary products industries such as establishing kiwifruit orchards, vineyards and forestry ventures where expenses are incurred for long periods before income is derived. Marnie Oil will have an initial provisional tax liability as it did not have residual income tax of more than $2,500 in any of the four prior years and it will have residual income tax of $60,000 or more in the 2019 tax year. Consequently, if it does not voluntarily pay provisional tax in three equal instalments (that is, on P1, P2 and P3) of $22,400 under s RC 9(9)(a) of the ITA and s 120KC of the TAA, use-of-money interest will be charged on any shortfall from the date of the shortfall until the amount is paid. Example 2 – New business deriving only passive income with residual income tax less than $60,000 Facts: The same facts as in example 1 apply but the income is invested at 3% so residual income tax is only $50,400 for the 2019 tax year. Question: Did Marnie Oil have an initial provisional tax liability for the 2019 tax year? Answer: No. Marnie Oil has residual income tax that is under $60,000 for the 2019 tax year and no residual income tax in the four prior tax years. Consequently, it does not have an “initial provisional tax liability” in that tax year and is not exposed to use of money interest. It will have an obligation to pay the residual income tax on the terminal tax date of 7 February 2020. Example 3 – New business with residual income tax of $60,000 or more ends prematurely Facts: An Australian tea tree oil producer, TTO Pty decides to expand into New Zealand mānuka oil production as it has greater therapeutic benefits than tea tree oil against certain types of bacteria and only small quantities are being produced. It makes an application for Overseas Investment Office approval on 30 September 2018 to buy a large block of land covered in mānuka on the East Cape and has plans to augment this with additional planting of mānuka seedlings. While the application is being processed, TTO hires staff, incurs legal fees and receives a $2.4 million capital contribution from a mānuka honey producer who wants to have an exclusive right to place hives on the property. The capital contribution is taxable under s CG 8 of the ITA and must be spread equally over 10 years. Consequently, $240,000 is allocated to the 2019 tax year, and residual income tax exceeds $60,000. On 1 October 2019, the Overseas Investment Office turns down the application because all the mānuka leaf is going to be processed in Australia at the company’s existing tea tree facilities and there is not enough benefit flowing to New Zealand. TTO is forced to repay the $2.4 million and abandon its business plans. QB 19/04: 24 April 2019 9 UNCLASSIFIED Question: What are TTO’s provisional tax obligations and use-of-money interest exposure for the 2019 and 2020 tax years? Answer: TTO has carried on an activity in the 2019 tax year that is intended to involve the supply of goods. The work undertaken is beyond mere preparation as it has received a significant contractual payment, incurred expenditure and followed up on a detailed land acquisition and harvesting plan. TTO, therefore, had a “taxable activity” in the 2019 tax year in terms of s 6(1)(a) of the GSTA despite the land purchase being subsequently thwarted on 1 October 2019 and the business being terminated in the 2020 tax year. Consequently, TTO has an initial provisional tax liability in the 2019 tax year and is exposed to use-of-money interest if it does not voluntarily make the payments determined under s 120KC of the TAA. As a new provisional taxpayer commencing a taxable activity on 30 September 2018 (being after 29 July but before 16 December) the number of provisional tax instalments required under s 120KC of the TAA is two in the 2019 tax year, assuming a balance date of 31 March. Anything done in connection with the premature ending of a taxable activity is expressly treated as being carried out in the course of the taxable activity under s 6(2) of the GSTA. In the 2020 tax year, TTO has only expenditure and deductions to claim and no income, as it has repaid the entire capital contribution made by the honey producer. However, because its residual income tax exceeded $2,500 in the 2019 tax year it is a provisional taxpayer for the 2020 tax year and opts to use the standard option to pay provisional tax of 105% of 2019 residual income tax divided by three at P1 on 28 August 2019. Having learnt of the Overseas Investment Office decision on 1 October 2019, TTO decides to swap to the estimation method. It sends a secure email to Inland Revenue advising of this using myIR and estimates zero for P2 on 15 January 2020. The nil estimate is still reasonable at P3 and no revised estimate is required to be filed. TTO also files an IR348 showing each employee’s finish date, then it files a final tax return in July 2020 seeking a refund of tax paid on 28 August 2019 and includes a letter to Inland Revenue advising the date it ceased to carry on business and the reason why. TTO also confirms it no longer has any assets and encloses a balance sheet and profit and loss account up to the date it ceased to carry on business. Example 4 – Start up business with losses comes into profit Facts: Sateconnect Ltd is a start-up firm and has incurred tax losses for 5 years while it develops intellectual property that is based on the provision of satellite internet cover to support the Internet of Things connectivity. Following the successful launch of the first satellite it is able to quickly monetarise its IP and in year 6 the residual income tax is over $60,000 and all carried forward tax losses are used up. Question: Is Sateconnect a new provisional taxpayer starting a taxable activity in year 6? Answer: No. Sateconnect incurred tax losses testing and developing its IP with the full intention of monetarising this when satellite internet became a reality. As a result, it commenced a taxable activity when it was first set up in year 1. As the residual income tax in year 5 was less than $2,500, Sateconnect has no obligation to pay provisional tax in year 6 under s RC 3(3) of the ITA. However, because the residual income tax in year 6 exceeds the use-of-money interest terminal tax safe harbour of less than $60,000, the residual income tax will need to be voluntarily paid by the last instalment date for provisional tax for year 6 if use-of- money interest is to be avoided. If Sateconnect makes no payments on the first and second instalment dates for provisional tax for year 6 this will correctly reflect its default status of adopting the standard method which requires 3 instalment payments of one third of the 5 th year’s residual income tax multiplied by 105% (or if that year has yet to be filed, the 4 th year’s residual income tax multiplied by 110%). Both those amounts are nil. Sateconnect will be a provisional taxpayer in year 7 and needs to choose what method it wishes to adopt for that year or default to the standard method.

Date of issue: 19 Dec 2019 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question If property held in a discretionary trust is rented out by a beneficiary of the trust for short-stay accommodation, who should declare the income, and what deductions can be claimed? Answer If property is held in a discretionary trust and a beneficiary rents all or part of it out for short-stay accommodation (eg, the property is the beneficiary’s home), the income belongs to the beneficiary as they’re the one granting the licence to the guests to stay. Non-capital costs 1 related to earning the income can be deducted, though some of these costs will only be partly deductible because they also relate to private use of the property. 1 See \[19\]. QB 19/15 If property held in a trust is rented out by a beneficiary of the trust for short-stay accommodation, who should declare the income, and what deductions can be claimed? QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This “Question We’ve Been Asked” (QWBA) explains how the income tax rules apply if property held in a trust is rented out by a beneficiary of the trust for short-stay accommodation (eg, through Airbnb, Bookabach or Holiday Houses). The most common situation where it will be a beneficiary renting out a property held in trust is where the property is the beneficiary’s family home. Key provisions Income Tax Act 2007 – ss CC 1, DV 9, GC 5 and YA 1 Tax Administration Act 1994 – s 43B Key terms Guest means a person provided with short-stay accommodation in return for payment. Renting out and similar terms are used in this QWBA to refer to granting a licence for the use of the property by short- stay accommodation guests. Short-stay accommodation means accommodation provided for up to four consecutive weeks in a dwelling that is not the guest’s ordinary residence. It doesn’t include accommodation provided to residential tenants, boarders or care home residents, and it doesn’t include student or emergency accommodation. Trust is sometimes used in this QWBA as meaning the trustees of the trust, where this is helpful for simplicity. QB 19/15: 19 Dec 2019 2 UNCLASSIFIED Explanation Who is renting out the property? 1. Under New Zealand’s tax rules, rental income from land belongs to the owner of the land and they must declare it to Inland Revenue. 2. Owning land is not limited to having the legal title. Under the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act), someone will own land if they have an estate or interest in land. This could be freehold, leasehold, or any other interest in land. 3. Beneficiaries of a discretionary trust do not have an interest in the trust property simply by virtue of being beneficiaries. So in many situations where a property is held in a trust, it will be only the trustees, who legally own the land, who have an interest in the land. This will generally be the case, for example, for a dedicated short-stay accommodation property, or for a holiday home that is also sometimes rented out to third parties. Where only the trustees have an interest in the land, it will be the trustees renting out the property, and the rental income will belong to the trustees. 4. However, in some situations there will be different people with interests relating to the same underlying piece of land, and they will all be “owners” of land for income tax purposes. If this is the case, and the property is rented out, the rental income will belong to the person whose land interest is affected. 5. For example, if a beneficiary of a trust has a right to the possession of the property, or if they in fact occupy it, they will have an interest in land as defined in the Act. A right to possession of land is specifically defined as an “interest in land” (s YA 1). Even if a beneficiary did not have the right to possession of the property, if they occupy it there will be, legally, what’s called a “tenancy at will”, 2 which gives rise to an interest in land. 3 The most common situation where a beneficiary will have an interest in the land is where the property is the beneficiary’s family home. 6. Where a beneficiary has an interest in the land and they rent the property out to short- stay accommodation guests, it is their interest that is affected. It is their right to possession of the property, or their interest as tenant at will, that is impinged on by the property being rented out, not the trustees’ legal interest in the land. As such, if a beneficiary has an interest in the land and rents out all or part of the property for short- stay accommodation, the income will be theirs. 2 Hinde, McMorland & Sim, Land Law in New Zealand (online ed.), LexisNexis NZ Limited, at 11.022, and The Laws of New Zealand (online ed.), LexisNexis NZ Limited, “Lessor and Lessee” paras 108–112, and “Trusts” para 99. 3 Hinde, McMorland & Sim, Land Law in New Zealand (online ed.), LexisNexis NZ Limited, at 10.010(c). This QWBA deals with situations where it is a beneficiary of the trust renting out the property for short-stay accommodation. QB 19/16 deals with situations where it is the trustees of the trust renting out the property for short-stay accommodation. QB 19/15: 19 Dec 2019 3 UNCLASSIFIED A beneficiary of the trust is renting out the property 7. As noted above, the most common situation where a beneficiary of a trust is deriving the short-stay accommodation income from renting out a property held in a trust, is where the property is the beneficiary’s home. Summary of the income tax implications 8. In this situation, it will be the beneficiary deriving the short-stay accommodation income because it is their interest in land that is affected by the property being rented out. 9. The beneficiary may be eligible to use a simplified method for meeting their tax obligations, known as the “standard-cost method”. This is discussed from \[17\]. Otherwise, the deductibility of the (non-capital) property-related expenses depends on whether the expense is incurred by the person deriving the income – in this case the beneficiary. Sometimes in a family trust situation this will not be the case. 10. In addition, while some expenses will be fully-deductible, others may be only partly deductible because they also relate to private use of the property. 11. Table 1 summarises the income tax implications for short-stay accommodation properties held in trust, where the income is derived by a beneficiary of the trust. TABLE 1: SHORT-STAY ACCOMMODATION PROVIDED IN TRUST PROPERTY THAT IS A BENEFICIARY OF THE TRUST’S HOME − INCOME DERIVED BY BENEFICIARY Income Generally, all amounts received from paying guests are income to the beneficiary. However, some amounts may be exempt. This will be the case: - if DET 19/02 (discussed below) is used; or - if DET 19/02 isn’t used and the “mixed-use asset rules” (the MUA rules) apply ( see from \[14\]). Expenditure incurred by the trustees and paid by a beneficiary OR Expenditure incurred by a beneficiary For the beneficiary • If the beneficiary pays all of the property-related outgoings, they may be eligible to use standard-cost determination DET 19/02 . This is a simplified method for meeting the tax obligations for the short-stay accommodation activity. If DET 19/02 is used: - the short-stay accommodation income the beneficiary gets from the property is exempt up to the amount of the standard-costs; - only income over the amount of the standard-costs needs to be declared; - the beneficiary can’t deduct any of their actual expenditure, unless it’s for something not covered by the standard-costs and they have assessable income from providing the short-stay accommodation (ie, their income from providing the short-stay accommodation exceeds their standard- costs). • If DET 19/02 isn’t used, the expenditure is deductible to the beneficiary, subject to apportionment for private use (usually as per QB 19/05). QB 19/15: 19 Dec 2019 4 UNCLASSIFIED For the trustees • The amount of any expenses incurred by the trustees and paid by the beneficiary is rental income to the trustees. This will be cancelled out by the expenditure being deductible to the trustees because it’s incurred by them. If the trust is a “non-active trust” and has filed a non-active trust declaration (IR633 ), the trustees don’t need to file a return (s 43B of the Tax Administration Act 1994). Otherwise, the trustees do need to file a return and include the rental income and deduction. Expenditure incurred by and paid by trustees The expenditure is not deductible to anyone, unless the beneficiary pays rent to the trustees (including through reimbursement of the expense, on account of the right to use the property). The beneficiary’s income and deductions Income 12. Generally, all of the amounts received from paying guests will be income, and, for the reasons discussed at \[ 1\] to \[6\], the income is derived by the beneficiary. 13. The beneficiary may be eligible to use a simplified method (in DET 19/02 ) for meeting their tax obligations from providing the short-stay accommodation (discussed from \[ 17\]). If they use this method, some or all of the income will be exempt, and it will only be necessary to return income over a certain level. This reflects the typical costs incurred in providing short-stay accommodation in your home. 14. If DET 19/02 isn’t used and the MUA rules apply there may also be some exempt income. The MUA rules could apply, for example, if a separate dwelling (eg, a sleepout) on the same property as the beneficiary’s home is rented out, or if the home is vacant for 62 days or more in the year (eg, if the beneficiary was away for an extended holiday and the home was unused during that time). 15. If the MUA rules apply, the following amounts will be exempt income: • amounts received for renting the property to associated natural persons (eg, close relatives of the beneficiary such as their children, grandchildren, siblings or in -laws); and • amounts received from renting the property at “mates’ rates” (less than 80% of the market value rent). What will be income or exempt income under the MUA rules is discussed in detail in QB 19/07 . Deductions 16. Often where a beneficiary’s home is held in a trust the beneficiary will pay all of the outgoings for the property, irrespective of who the expenses are legally incurred by (eg, rates, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and any loan repayments for the property). 17. Where the beneficiary’s home is used to earn short-stay accommodation income (ie, through renting out a room or the whole property from time to time) and the beneficiary pays all of the property-related outgoings, they may be eligible to use standard-cost determination DET 19/02 . This is a simplified method for a taxpayer meeting their tax obligations from providing short-stay accommodation in all or part of their home. QB 19/15: 19 Dec 2019 5 UNCLASSIFIED 18. If DET 19/02 is used, income up to the amount of set standard-costs is exempt. Only income in excess of the standard-costs needs to be returned. No deductions for expenditure actually incurred are allowed, unless the expenditure is for things not covered by the standard-costs in the determination. 19. If DET 19/02 isn’t used, non-capital property-related expenses the beneficiary pays will be deductible to the beneficiary, subject to appropriate apportionment for any expenses that don’t solely relate to the income-earning use of the property. Deductible expenses would include things like: • interest payments; • property and contents insurance premiums; • rates; • repairs and maintenance; • utility bills; • advertising costs; and • any commission or fee the beneficiary pays to an advertising platform or transaction facilitator (this does not include any service fee the guests pay the platform, just fees the beneficiary pays). 20. Expenses that relate solely to the rental activity (eg, advertising fees) will be 100% deductible. But mixed expenses – those that relate to both the private use of the home and the rental activity – need to be apportioned. These mixed expenses would include things like rates, insurance, utility bills, and loan interest. 21. Generally, the appropriate basis for apportionment will be as discussed in QB 19/05 . But in some situations a different basis may be required. For example, if a separate dwelling (eg, a sleepout) on the same property as the beneficiary’s home is rented out, or if the home is vacant for 62 days or more in the year (eg, if the beneficiary was away for an extended holiday and the home was unused during that time). In those situations, QB 19/06 explains how to work out which tax rules apply. If the MUA rules apply, there is a formula for apportioning expenses, and periods of private use (including use that gives rise to exempt income) will restrict the availability of deductions. If the MUA rules don’t apply, QB 19/06 will refer readers to the appropriate guidance on apportionment. 22. Depreciation losses on chattels in the property owned by the beneficiary and available for use by paying guests will also be deductible either in full or in part (depending on whether the chattels are used solely by paying guests). QB 19/05 explains how to calculate the percentage of depreciation losses that is tax deductible (except if the home was vacant for 62 days or more in the year – in which case see QB 19/07). Allocation of deductions if the rental activity is loss-making 23. If the rental activity is loss-making, the residential rental ring-fencing rules in subpart EL of the Act may potentially limit the deductions that can be allocated to the income year. 24. Those rules will often not apply where the property the beneficiary is renting out is their main home. However, the rules could apply in some situations, for example, if a principal settlor of the trust has a separate main home, or if the property the beneficiary is renting out is not their main home. 25. Any deductions that can’t be allocated to the year because of the ring-fencing rules will be carried forward to the next year the beneficiary derives residential income. QB 19/15: 19 Dec 2019 6 UNCLASSIFIED 26. The ring-fencing rules will not apply if the short-stay accommodation is provided in a dwelling that is a mixed-use asset for the purposes of the MUA rules. For example, this could be the case for a separate dwelling (eg, a sleepout) on the same property as the beneficiary’s home. There are separate rules called the “expenditure quarantine rules” that may apply in this situation if the rental activity is loss-making – see QB 19/07 . 27. There is more information about the residential rental ring-fencing rules in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31, No 8 (September 2019), from page 53. The trustees’ income and deductions 28. In the family home context, it’s likely that most of the property-related expenditure will be incurred by the beneficiary who lives there. However, some expenditure will be incurred by the trustees, for example, the rates and possibly property insurance. 29. Often the beneficiary who lives in the property will pay the property -related outgoings incurred by the trust as part of the arrangement that allows them to live in the property. The payment of those amounts by the beneficiary would be rental income to the trustees under s CC 1. 30. However, this rental income would be offset by the trustees being able to deduct the expenditure, as it’s incurred by them in deriving the rental income. 31. If the trust is non-active, the trustees may not need to file a tax return. A return would not be required if the trust: • is a complying trust (an ordinary New Zealand trust with New Zealand resident trustees and settlors); • is a non-active trust; • has submitted a non-active trust declaration (IR633 ) to Inland Revenue; and • hasn’t stopped being a non-active trust since making the declaration. 32. Essentially, a trust will be a non-active trust if it hasn’t derived (or been deemed to have derived) any income for the year and doesn’t have any deductions for the year. There also can’t have been any transactions involving assets of the trust that give rise to income to any person, or to fringe benefits to any employee or former employee. 33. In determining whether a trust is “non-active”, the following payments aren’t taken into account (s 43B(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994): (a) reasonable fees paid to professional trustees to administer the trust; or (b) bank charges or other minimal administration costs totalling not more than $200 in the tax year; or (c) interest earned on trust assets in any bank account during the tax year, to the extent to which the total interest does not exceed $200; or (d) insurance, rates, and other expenditure incidental to the occupation of a dwelling owned by the trust and incurred by the beneficiaries of the trust. \[Emphasis added\] 34. So if a beneficiary is paying the trustee-incurred outgoings for the property because they live there, while those amounts may technically be rent, if the trust doesn’t otherwise have income or make any payments other than those mentioned at \[33\], it may be able to submit a non-active trust declaration (see the requirements at \[31\]). If the trust meets the requirements and does this, the trustees won’t need to file a tax return so long as the trust continues to be non-active. 35. Trusts that aren’t non-active trusts will have to file a tax return. Example 1 explains what rental income the trustees will have and what deductions they can claim when a QB 19/15: 19 Dec 2019 7 UNCLASSIFIED beneficiary lives in property held in the trust, uses it to provide short-stay accommodation, and pays the outgoings incurred by the trustees. Could s GC 5 apply to deem adequate rent to be paid from the beneficiary to the trust? 36. Section GC 5 is a provision in the Act that may apply where property is leased to someone who uses the property in deriving income. If no rent is payable by the lessee, or the rent is inadequate, s GC 5 could deem “adequate rent” to be paid by the lessee and derived by the lessor. 37. “Lease” is defined in s GC 5(5) as meaning a tenancy of any duration (it also includes a sublease or bailment). As noted at \[5\], where a beneficiary of a trust lives in property held in the trust, there will be a tenancy at will, which meets the definition of “lease”. 38. Section GC 5 will only apply to certain leases (listed in s GC 5(2)). This includes a lease by a person to a relative. “Relative” (defined in s YA 1) includes a person connected with another person by being the trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefitted or is eligible to benefit. 39. So in a family trust situation, where a beneficiary is living in trust property and using it to derive income (eg, renting out a room for short-stay accommodation), s GC 5 could potentially apply to deem “adequate rent” to be paid by the beneficiary to the trust. 40. However, the Commissioner would not apply s GC 5 in this situation. This is because s GC 5 is aimed at ensuring income can’t be assigned to someone else through leasing income-producing property to a relative or related company at a nominal rent. That mischief isn’t present in the trust context, where a trust can legitimately allocate any income as beneficiary income. The Commissioner will not use s GC 5 to deem there to be “adequate rent” paid for a lease in a situation where the lease isn’t creating an opportunity for a tax benefit through the shifting of income from one person to another. Provision of below market value accommodation to the beneficiary 41. If the trust is a complying trust (an ordinary New Zealand trust with New Zealand resident trustees and settlors), the trustees allowing a beneficiary to live in the trust- owned property rent-free or for less than market rent will be an exempt distribution from the trust (ss CW 53 and HC 20). However, if the trust is a foreign trust or a non- complying trust, this will be a taxable distribution from the trust, and not subject to the ordering rules (s HC 15(6)). As to the value of the distribution, see from \[8.6\] of IS 18/01: Taxation of Trusts . QB 19/15: 19 Dec 2019 8 UNCLASSIFIED Example 1 Trust income and deductions when a beneficiary living in trust property pays property outgoings Harry and Theresa’s home is held in a family trust. They settled the trust when they bought the home, and they are beneficiaries of the trust. They have a spare room and rent it out on Airbnb, earning $5,000 from this during the year. Because they live in the property, Harry and Theresa pay the following outgoings that are incurred by the trust: the rates ($3,300 for the year) and the property insurance ($1,200 for the year). Harry and Theresa have other expenses related to earning the Airbnb income: loan interest (the home loan is in their names), utility bills, contents insurance, and Airbnb host service fees. They also have depreciation losses for chattels in the home that guests can use. Because Harry and Theresa are paying the outgoings for the property that are incurred by the trust (the rates and property insurance), on the basis they can live there, those amounts would be rent to the trust. The trust can deduct the amount of the rates and property insurance because it has incurred them, having a legal liability to pay them. The result is that the rent and the deductions for the trust net off. However, the trust has $10,000 income from other investments so is not a “non-active trust”. As such, the trustees need to file a tax return, which will need to include the rental income and associated deductions (even though they net off). If Harry and Theresa meet the criteria to use Inland Revenue’s “standard-cost” determination (DET 19/02), they might choose to do that, to simplify their tax obligations. But otherwise, they’ll need to return all of the Airbnb income they receive, and can deduct a portion of the rates, property insurance and other expenses (and depreciation losses) they have. QB 19/05 will help them work out what proportion of their expenses they can claim as deductions. •Airbnb income $5,000 •Harry and Theresa pay these property outgoings (incurred by the trust): −rates $3,300 −property insurance $1,200 •Other expenses/losses (incurred by Harry and Theresa): −loan interest −utility bills −contents insurance −Airbnb host service fees −depreciation losses for chattels used by guests T Harry and Theresa pay these outgoings (incurred by the trust) •Rent from Harry and Theresa = $4,500 (rates and property insurance paid) •Associated deductible expenses (incurred by trust): −rates $3,300 −property insurance $1,200 •$10,000 income from other investments Rent $4,500 (payment of outgoings incurred by the trust) Legal liability •Rates $3,300 •Property insurance $1,200 QB 19/15: 19 Dec 2019 9 UNCLASSIFIED References Subject references income tax short-stay accommodation trusts Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007 – ss CC 1, CW 53, DV 9, GC 5, HC 15, HC 20, subpart EL and the definitions of “estate in relation to land, interest in relation to land, estate or interest in land, estate in land, interest in land, and similar terms ”, “land”, “own” and “relative” in s YA 1 Tax Administration Act 1994 – s 43B Other references DET 19/02: Standard-cost household service for short-stay accommodation providers (Inland Revenue) Hinde, McMorland & Sim, Land Law in New Zealand (online ed.), LexisNexis NZ Limited IR633: Non-active trust declaration (Inland Revenue) IS 18/01: Taxation of Trusts (Inland Revenue) QB 19/05: What are my income tax obligations if I rent out my home or a separate dwelling on my property as short-stay accommodation?

Date of issue: 19 Dec 2019 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question If property held in a discretionary trust is rented out by the trustees for short-stay accommodation, who should declare the income, and what deductions can be claimed? Answer If property is held in a discretionary trust and the trustees rent it out for short-stay accommodation (eg, a holiday home or dedicated short-stay accommodation rental property), the income belongs to the trustees, and will generally have to be declared in the trust’s tax return. However, some or all of the income may be allocated as beneficiary income, which would mean it’s ta xed at the beneficiary’s tax rate rather than at the trust rate. Non-capital costs 1 related to earning the income can be deducted. However, such costs will only be partly deductible where the expenditure also relates to private use or non income-earning use of the property. 1 See \[23\]. QB 19/16 If property held in a trust is rented out by the trustees for short-stay accommodation, who should declare the income, and what deductions can be claimed? QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This “Question We’ve Been Asked” (QWBA) explains how the income tax rules apply if property held in a trust is rented out by the trustees for short-stay accommodation (eg, through Airbnb, Bookabach or Holiday Houses). It will usually be the trustees renting out the property where the property is either a dedicated short-stay accommodation property, or a property that’s sometimes rented out and sometimes used for other purposes (eg, it’s used by beneficiaries of the trust). Key provisions Income Tax Act 2007 – ss CC 1, DV 9 and YA 1 Key terms Guest means a person provided with short-stay accommodation in return for payment. Renting out and similar terms are used in this QWBA to refer to granting a licence for the use of the property by short- stay accommodation guests. Short-stay accommodation means accommodation provided for up to four consecutive weeks in a dwelling that is not the guest’s ordinary residence. It doesn’t include accommodation provided to residential tenants, boarders or care home residents, and it doesn’t include student or emergency accommodation. Trust is sometimes used in this QWBA as meaning the trustees of the trust, where this is helpful for simplicity. QB 19/16: 19 Dec 2019 2 UNCLASSIFIED Explanation Who is renting out the property? 1. Under New Zealand’s tax rules, rental income from land belongs to the owner of the land and they must declare it to Inland Revenue. 2. Owning land is not limited to having the legal title. Under the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act), someone will own land if they have an estate or interest in land. This could be freehold, leasehold, or any other interest in land. 3. Beneficiaries of a discretionary trust do not have an interest in the trust property simply by virtue of being beneficiaries. So in many situations where a property is held in a trust, it will be only the trustees, who legally own the land, who have an interest in the land. This will generally be the case, for example, for a dedicated short-stay accommodation property, or for a holiday home that is also sometimes rented out to third parties. Where only the trustees have an interest in the land, it will be the trustees renting out the property, and the rental income will belong to the trustees. 4. However, in some situations there will be different people with interests relating to the same underlying piece of land, and they will all be “owners” of land for income tax purposes. If this is the case, and the property is rented out, the rental income will belong to the person whose land interest is affected. 5. For example, i f a beneficiary of a trust has a right to the possession of the property, or if they in fact occupy it, they will have an interest in land as defined in the Act. A right to possession of land is specifically defined as an “interest in land” (s YA 1). Even if a beneficiary did not have the right to possession of the property, if they occupy it there will be, legally, what’s called a “tenancy at will”, 2 which gives rise to an interest in land. 3 The most common situation where a beneficiary will have an interest in the land is where the property is the beneficiary’s family home. 6. Where a beneficiary has an interest in the land and they rent the property out to short- stay accommodation guests, it is their interest that is affected. It is their right to possession of the property, or their interest as tenant at will, that is impinged on by the property being rented out, not the trustees’ legal interest in the land. As such, if a beneficiary has an interest in the land and rents out all or part of the property for short- stay accommodation, the income will be theirs. 2 Hinde, McMorland & Sim, Land Law in New Zealand (online ed.), LexisNexis NZ Limited, at 11.022, and The Laws of New Zealand (online ed.), LexisNexis NZ Limited, “Lessor and Lessee” paras 108–112, and “Trusts” para 99. 3 Hinde, McMorland & Sim, Land Law in New Zealand (online ed.), LexisNexis NZ Limited, at 10.010(c). This QWBA deals with situations where it is the trustees of the trust renting out the property for short-stay accommodation. QB 19/15 deals with situations where it is a beneficiary of the trust renting out the property for short-stay accommodation. QB 19/16: 19 Dec 2019 3 UNCLASSIFIED Trustees of the trust renting out the property 7. The most common situations where trustees of a trust may rent out property for short- stay accommodation are where the property is: • a dedicated short-stay accommodation property; or • a family holiday home that’s also sometimes rented out. 8. In these situations, the income will usually belong to the trustees as they would usually be the only ones with an interest in the land. 9. There could be circumstances where this is not the case, f or example, if a beneficiary has leased the property from the trustees, or if it can be shown that a beneficiary has been given the right to possession and use of the property. But the most common situation is that the income will belong to the trustees, so the following discussion is based on that being the case. 10. There are slight differences in the tax treatment where trustees of a trust are renting out property for short-stay accommodation, depending on which rules apply. Summary of the income tax implications 11. In the situation covered by this QWBA – where the trustees rent out the property – any income from renting the property out for short-stay accommodation will belong to the trustees and will need to be returned by them. 12. The deductibility of the (non-capital) property-related expenses depends on whether the expense is incurred by the person deriving the income – in this case the trustees. Sometimes in a family trust situation this will not be the case. 13. Although some expenses will be fully deductible, others may be only partly deductible because they also relate to private use or non income-earning use of the property. 14. Table 1 summarises the income tax implications for short-stay accommodation properties held in trust, where the income is derived by the trustees. T ABLE 1: SHORT-STAY ACCOMMODATION PROPERTY — INCOME DERIVED BY THE TRUSTEES Income Generally, all amounts received from paying guests are income to the trustees. However, if the property is subject to the “mixed-use asset rules” (the MUA rules) – see from \[15\], the following amounts are exempt income:  amounts received for renting the property to associated natural persons (eg, settlors and beneficiaries); and  amounts received from renting the property at “mates’ rates” (less than 80% of the market value rent). Expenditure incurred by and paid by the trustees The expenditure is deductible to the trustees. However, for properties that are also used for non income-earning purposes (eg, used by the beneficiaries of the trust), this is subject to apportionment. See from \[31\] for how to apportion expenditure for property subject to the MUA rules, or from \[35\] for property not subject to the MUA rules. QB 19/16: 19 Dec 2019 4 UNCLASSIFIED Expenditure incurred by the trustees and paid by a beneficiary For the beneficiary The expenditure isn’t deductible to the beneficiary, as there is no connection between the expenditure and the beneficiary earning income. For the trustees • The expenditure is deductible to the trustees. However, for properties that are also used for non income-earning purposes (eg, used by the beneficiaries of the trust), this is subject to apportionment. • But if the beneficiary isn’t reimbursed by the trustees, the amount of the expense paid by the beneficiary is income to the trustees as either: - rental income under s CC 1, if paid by the beneficiary for use of and/or ability to use the property, provided the property is not subject to the MUA rules; or - income under s CG 4, to the extent of the deduction the trustees have been allowed, if not paid by the beneficiary for use of and/or ability to use the property, or if the property is subject to the MUA rules. The net effect of this is that if the beneficiary isn’t reimbursed, the trustees don’t get the benefit of the deduction. This reflects that the trustees haven’t borne the expense. Expenditure incurred by a beneficiary • If the trustees reimburse the beneficiary (by actual payment or through their ‘beneficiary current account’), this is deductible to the trustees. However, for properties that are also used for non income-earning purposes (eg, used by the beneficiaries of the trust), this is subject to apportionment. • If the trustees don’t reimburse the beneficiary, the expense can’t be deducted by anyone. In this case, the amount may be rental income, and there may be a settlement on the trust by the beneficiary or a distribution to the beneficiary from the trust. The amount could only be rental income if the property is not subject to the MUA rules, and the beneficiary incurred the expense for the use of and/or ability to use the property. Whether there is a settlement on the trust or a distribution from the trust depends on the value of what the beneficiary and the trust are providing each other under the arrangement. This includes the value of expenses incurred by the beneficiary that are of value to the trust and the market value of any use of and/or ability to use the property they get in return for incurring those expenses. Which tax rules apply? 15. If the property is sometimes rented out and sometimes used by people associated with the trust (eg, a family holiday home that’s sometimes rented out), there are different rules that could apply to determine the precise tax treatment for the property – in particular what counts as income, and the proportion of the expenses that can be deducted. QB 19/16: 19 Dec 2019 5 UNCLASSIFIED 16. For these properties, the first step will be to work out which rules the property falls into for the particular year: • the “mixed-use asset rules” (the MUA rules); or • the standard tax rules. 17. QB 19/06 explains how to work out which rules apply for each income year. The factor that determines which rules apply is whether the property is unused for 62 days or more during a year. 18. If property is a mixed-use asset, there are some situations in which the taxpayer can choose to opt out of the tax rules. This is explained in QB 19/06 . 19. It’s necessary to revisit which tax rules apply each year. The income is derived by the trustees 20. As noted above, where the trustees are the ones renting out the short-stay accommodation, the income will belong to the trustees. 21. Generally, all amounts the trustees receive from paying guests will be income. However, this doesn’t include minor contributions from family or friends who aren’t charged rent (eg, if they pay $20 towards their power usage). 22. In addition, if the MUA rules apply, the following amounts will be exempt income: • amounts received for renting the property to associated natural persons (eg, the settlor and beneficiaries); and • amounts received from renting the property at “mates’ rates” (less than 80% of the market value rent). What will be income or exempt income under the MUA rules is discussed in detail in QB 19/07 . Expenditure incurred by the trustees is deductible to them 23. Because the rental income in this situation belongs to the trustees, non-capital property-related expenditure that’s incurred by the trustees will be deductible to them under s DA 1 , subject to any apportionment required. These expenses could include things like: • int erest payments; • property and contents insurance premiums; • rates; • repairs and maintenance; • utility bills; • advertising costs; and • any commission or fee the trust pays to an advertising platform or transaction facilitator (this does not include any service fee the guests pay the platform, just fees the trust pays). 24. Expenses incurred by the trustees will be deductible to the trustees ( subject to any apportionment), regardless of whether the expense is paid by the trustees or by a beneficiary. QB 19/16: 19 Dec 2019 6 UNCLASSIFIED 25. Expenditure will be incurred by the trustees if they either paid or became definitively committed to the expenditure in the income year. 26. This would include where the trustees have incurred the obligation themselves (eg, rates and property insurance). It would also include situations where the trustees have agreed that they’ll reimburse a beneficiary for expenditure incurred by the beneficiary. For example, if a beneficiary gets the power, pay-TV or internet connected in their name ( which would often be the case, as this would be easier than getting those services connected in the trustees’ names). In those situations, the agreement to reimburse the beneficiary is an obligation incurred by the trustees. 27. It may be that s omeone who is a beneficiary of the trust is also a trustee, and connects services such as power or internet in their individual name. Generally, in this case the person would be incurring the expenditure in their capacity as trustee, so the expenditure would be incurred directly by the trustees. 28. Some or all of the rental income may be allocated as beneficiary income, which would mean it’s taxed at the beneficiary’s tax rate rather than at the trust rate. However, for the purposes of determining the deductions the trust is allowed, the beneficiary income is treated as trustee income (s DV 9(2)). This means that all the non-capital expenses the trust incurs in relation to the rental activity will be deductible to the trustees, subject to any apportionment required. Dedicated short-stay accommodation property 29. If the property is a dedicated short-stay accommodation property, the above expenses will be fully deductible; no apportionment is necessary. Depreciation losses on the property’s chattels would also be fully deductible. A holiday home that is sometimes rented out 30. However, if the property is sometimes rented out and sometimes used by people associated with the trust (eg, a family holiday home that’s sometimes rented out), the proportion of the expenses that can be deducted will depend on whether the MUA rules or the standard tax rules apply (see from \[15\]). If the MUA rules apply to the holiday home 31. If the MUA rules apply to the holiday home, expenses that relate solely to the rental activity (eg, advertising fees) will be 100% deductible. But mixed expenses – those that relate to both the rental activity and “private use” of the property – need to be apportioned. These mixed expenses would include things like rates, insurance, utility bills, and loan interest. 32. Use by natural persons who are associated with the trustees counts as “private use” for the apportionment formula in the MUA rules. Use by anyone else for less than 80% market value rent (eg, friends staying and paying “mates’ rates”) will also be “private use”. 33. Persons associated with the trustee will (relevantly) be: • beneficiaries of the trust; • settlors of the trust; • persons associated with beneficiaries of the trust under the “two relatives” test in s YB 4; and QB 19/16: 19 Dec 2019 7 UNCLASSIFIED • persons with a power of appointment or removal of trustees – unless within the exclusion for providers of professional services (s YB 11). 34. QB 19/07 explains how to calculate the percentage of the mixed expenses that is tax deductible under the MUA rules. The same formula is generally used to calculate the portion of depreciation losses for the property’s chattels that i s deductible. The exception to this is depreciation losses or depreciation recovery income on disposal, which is dealt with by the depreciation provisions in subpart EE. If the standard tax rules apply to the holiday home 35. If the standard tax rules apply to the holiday home, expenses that relate solely to the rental activity (eg, advertising fees) will be 100% deductible. But mixed expenses – those that relate to both the rental activity and non income-earning use of the property (eg, use by beneficiaries or settlors of the trust) – need to be apportioned. These mixed expenses would include things like rates, insurance, utility bills, and loan interest. 36. These mixed expenses will usually be deductible based on the total number of nights in the year the property is rented out or available to be rented out. The discussion and examples in QB 19/08 (from \[20\]) explain how to calculate the percentage of the mixed expenses that i s tax deductible. Although QB 19/08 refers to expenditure not being deductible for “private use” (which a trust can’t have), the same approach can be used. This is because there will only be the required nexus between the expenditure and the earning of income to the extent the property is rented out or available to be rented out. 37. Depreciation losses on the property’s chattels will also be partly deductible. QB 19/08 explains how to calculate the percentage of depreciation losses that is tax deductible. Income to the trustees if beneficiary not reimbursed for paying trustees’ expense 38. For properties that are either dedicated short-stay accommodation properties or holiday homes that are sometimes rented out, the trust will likely have a bank account that guests pay into. Therefore, where the trustees have incurred an obligation themselves (eg, rates and property insurance), they will likely have the funds to pay the expense. 39. But if for whatever reason they didn’t, and a beneficiary pays the expense instead, the expense would still be deductible to the trustees as they have incurred the legal obligation. 40. However, if the trustees didn’t reimburse the beneficiary (either in cash or through the ‘beneficiary’s current account’), the amount of the expense paid by the beneficiary will be income to the trustees either: • under s CC 1, if: o the amount is paid by the beneficiary for the use of and/or ability to use the property; and o the property is not subject to the MUA rules; or otherwise • under s CG 4, to the extent of the deduction the trustees have been allowed. 41. The net effect of this is that if the beneficiary isn’t reimbursed, the trustees don’t get the benefit of the deduction. This reflects that the trustees haven’t borne the expense. The IR620 guide explains how to work out if someone is associated with the trustees. QB 19/16: 19 Dec 2019 8 UNCLASSIFIED Reimbursement of expense incurred by beneficiary 42. As noted above, it may be that a beneficiary (who is not also a trustee) incurs an obligation to pay some property-related expenses (such as power bills or internet), because it’s easier to have those services connected in an individual’s name. 43. Those expenses aren’t deductible to the beneficiary, as there’s no nexus between the expenditure and the beneficiary earning income. The income from the rental activity belongs to the trustees. 44. However, the trustees may have agreed that they’ll reimburse the beneficiary for this expenditure. If they have, the agreement to reimburse the beneficiary is an obligation incurred by the trustees. The trustees can therefore deduct the amount they reimburse the beneficiary (w hether by actual payment or through the ‘ beneficiary’s current account’), subject to any apportionment required (see from \[30\]). Expenditure incurred by a beneficiary and not reimbursed by the trustees 45. If a beneficiary has incurred a property-related expense that the trustees don’t reimburse them for, the expense can’t be deducted by anyone. 46. In this case the amount of the expense the beneficiary has paid will be rental income to the trustees, if: • the amount is paid by the beneficiary for the use of and/or ability to use the property; and • the property is not subject to the MUA rules. 47. There may also be a settlement on the trust or a distribution from the trust. Whether there is a settlement on the trust or a distribution from the trust, and the amount of any such settlement or distribution, will depend on the value of what the beneficiary and the trust are providing each other under the arrangement. This includes the value of property-related expenses incurred by the beneficiary that are of value to the trust and the market value of any use of and/or ability to use the property they get in return for incurring those expenses. Allocation of deductions if the rental activity is loss-making 48. If the property is not within the mixed-use asset rules and the rental activity is loss- making, the residential rental ring-fencing rules in subpart EL of the Act may limit the deductions that can be allocated to the income year. Any deductions that can’t be allocated to the year because of the ring-fencing rules will be carried forward to the next year the trustees derive residential income. 49. There is more information about the residential rental ring-fencing rules in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31, No 8 (September 2019), from page 53. QB 19/16: 19 Dec 2019 9 UNCLASSIFIED Examples Example 1: Trust income and deductions for a dedicated rental property The B-F Family Trust owns an investment property in Queenstown that’s rented out on Airbnb. The property isn’t used at all by the settlors (who are deceased) or beneficiaries of the trust – it’s a dedicated Airbnb rental property. The corporate trustee pays all of the property-related expenses from its bank account. This includes the power, internet and pay-TV bills. The connections for those services are in the names of Ani and Charlie, who are beneficiaries (but not trustees) of the trust. The connections were signed up for in Ani and Charlie’s names as this was easier. But there’s an agreement that the trustee will pay all those expenses. All of the rental income is income to the trustee. All of the (non-capital) property- related expenses are deductible to the trustee. This includes the power, internet and pay-TV bills, as the trustee pays those. Because the property is only used for rental purposes, the expenses are all fully deductible. Example 2: Trust income and deductions for a holiday house that’s subject to the MUA rules The Fab Five Family Trust owns the Brown family’s holiday house. The Browns use the holiday house for 45 nights during the tax year. The trustees of the Fab Five Family Trust rent it out to friends of the Browns for 15 nights in the year for “mates’ rates” of $50 a night, and the trustees rent it out to others for 80 nights in the year for $200 a night. The trustees have used QB 19/06 to work out the holiday house is a mixed-use asset for the tax year. This is because it was: (a) used privately (by the Browns, who are beneficiaries and settlors of the trust, and by friends for less than 80% of the market value rent), (b) used to earn income, and (c) vacant for 62 days or more. Therefore, the MUA rules apply. The trustees pay most of the property-related expenses from their bank account. This includes the power and internet bills, even though the connections for those services are in the name of Mrs Brown, who is a settlor and beneficiary of the trust. The connections were signed up for in Mrs Brown’s name as this was easier. But there’s an agreement that the trustees will pay those expenses. However, Mr and Mrs Brown have a loan (in their names, with a guarantee provided to the bank by the trustees) from when they bought the property and settled it on the trust, and they pay the loan repayments. The trustees reimburse Mr and Mrs Brown for the interest component of the loan repayments. This is recorded in Mr and Mrs Brown’s ‘beneficiary current accounts’. The rental income from the full-rate paying guests is income to the trustees. The $50 a night “mates’ rates” paid by the Browns’ friends isn’t income to the trustees – it’s exempt because it’s less than 80% of the market value rent. Some of the trustees’ expenses are fully deductible. This includes the fees they pay to Airbnb and Bookabach, and the cost of cleaners who come in after the full-rate paying guests. Other expenses the trustees incur need to be apportioned under the formula in the MUA rules, as they relate to both the rental activity and the private use of the holiday home (by the Browns and their friends who pay less than 80% of market value rent). These expenses include the power and internet bills, as the trustees pay those, and the loan interest that the trustees reimburse Mr and Mrs Brown for. The trustees use QB 19/07 to work out the deductible portion of these mixed expenses. There may be a settlement on the trust or a distribution from the trust. This depends on the value of what Mr and Mrs Brown and the trust are providing each other under the arrangement. QB 19/16: 19 Dec 2019 10 UNCLASSIFIED Example 3: Trust income and deductions for a holiday house that is subject to the “standard rules” not the MUA rules The We Are Family Trust owns the Miller family’s holiday house in a popular tourist destination. The Millers use the holiday house for 90 nights during the tax year, and rent it out as short-stay accommodation for 220 nights in the year. The trustees have used QB 19/06 to work out the holiday house is not subject to the MUA rules for the tax year, so the “standard rules” apply. This is because the holiday house was not vacant for 62 days or more during the year. The short-stay accommodation guests pay into the trustees’ bank account, and the trustees pay most of the property-related expenses from their bank account. This includes the power, pay-TV and internet bills, even though the connections for those services are in the name of Mr Miller, who is a settlor and beneficiary of the trust. The connections were signed up for in Mr Miller’s name as this was easier. But there is an agreement that the trustees will pay those expenses. However, Mr and Mrs Miller have a loan (in their names) from when they bought the property and settled it on the trust, and they pay the loan repayments. The trustees reimburse Mr and Mrs Miller fo r the interest component of the loan repayments. This is recorded in Mr and Mrs Miller’s ‘beneficiary current accounts’. The rental income from the short-stay accommodation guests is income to the trustees. Some of the trustees’ expenses are fully deductible. This includes the fees they pay to the Holiday Houses and Bookabach websites, which they advertise on, and the cost of cleaners who come in after the paying guests’ stays. Other expenses the trustees incur need to be apportioned, as they relate to both the rental activity and the non income-earning use of the holiday home (when it’s used by the Millers). These expenses include the power and internet bills, as the trustees pay those, and the loan interest that the trustees reimburse Mr and Mrs Miller for. The trustees use QB 19/08 to help them work out the deductible portion of these expenses. There may be a settlement on the trust or a distribution from the trust. This depends on the value of what Mr and Mrs Miller and the trust are providing each other under the arrangement.

2 April 2019 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question Could depreciation recovery income arise when a business becomes a charity? Answer Yes. Depreciation recovery income may arise where a change of use of depreciable property results in depreciation deductions no longer being available. For these purposes, a change of use refers to the use of property in deriving assessable income. Because a charity’s income is exempt, the property will no longer be available for use in deriving assessable income, so will no longer qualify as being “depreciable property”. This change of use results in depreciation deductions being denied. The recent introduction of s EE 47(2B) means that the change of use (and any depreciation recovery income) will occur immediately before the income exemption applies. Explanation We have been asked to clarify whether a change of use of depreciable property occurs where a business becomes a charity and derives exempt income. This issue is relevant as a change of use could give rise to depreciation recovery income. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated. Depreciation recovery income Under s EE 1 a person has depreciation recovery income for an income year if: • they own an item of depreciable property; • the property is disposed of or a relevant event occurs; and • an amount of depreciation recovery income is calculated under a relevant provision, including s EE 48 (effectively where the consideration exceeds the adjusted tax value of the property). QB 19/02 Depreciation – change of use event QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED We have been asked to clarify whether a change of use event occurs for depreciation purposes when a business becomes a charity but continues to apply its assets in the same way it did before becoming a charity. The question has been raised because the change of use ev ent could give rise to depreciation recovery income. Key provisions Sections EE 47(2) and EE 47 (2B) of the Income Tax Act 2007 Key term Depreciable property - property expected to decline in value while used or available for use in deriving assessable income. QB 19/02: 2 April 2019 2 UNCLASSIFIED The provisions relating to the calculation of depreciation recovery income in ss EE 44 to EE 48 apply where either a disposal or an other relevant event occurs. One such event is a change of use of the property, as a result of which a person is denied a depreciation deduction for the next income year. Sections EE 47(1) and (2) provide: EE 47 Events for purposes of section EE 44 Events to which sections EE 48 to EE 52 apply (1) For the purposes of section EE 44, this section describes the events to which sections EE 48 to EE 52 apply. Change of use or location of use (2) The first event is the change of use, or change of location of use, of an item of property, as a result of which a person is denied a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss for the item for the next income year. The event is treated as occurring on the first day of the next income year, and includes a change in use of an item for the purposes of the definition of commercial fit-out and a change in the status of a building related to an item for the purposes of that definition. Where s EE 47(2) applies, the consideration for the property is treated as being the market value of the property at the time the change of use occurs (s EE 45). If the market value of the property exceeds the property’s adjusted tax value on the date that the change of use event occurs (or is treated as occurring), the difference in these amounts is the depreciation recovery income that arises (although this income is capped at the total amount of depreciation loss claimed). Similarly, if the market value of property is less than its adjusted tax value on that date, the difference in those amounts may give rise to an amount of depreciation loss under s EE 48(2) (excluding buildings under s EE 48(3)) which may be deductible in accordance with ss DA 1(1) and DA 1(4). A new provision, s EE 47(2B), provides for the timing of the change of use event in certain circumstances as follows: Event timing for person’s becoming tax exempt (2B) Despite subsection (2), if the event is connected to a person’s income becoming exempt income, the event is treated as occurring immediately before the person’s income becomes exempt. What is a “change of use”? Where a business becomes a charity but continues to be carried on in the same way, it has been suggested that there is no change of use as the property is still being applied in the same way as before the exemption. The word “use” has various meanings. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (11th ed, 2012) defines the term “use” as: Take, hold or deploy as a means of achieving something.... Treat in a particular way. ... In Thornton Estates Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,577 Richardson P commented: As any dictionary will show, “use” and “used” have a wide range of meanings. Thus in relation to property, the Oxford English Dictionary (2ed) defines “use” as: “8. a. To employ or make use of (an article, etc), esp. for a profitable end or purpose; to utilize, turn to account”; and also “12. To expend or consume (a commodity, etc) by use; 13. to use up: a. To consume (a commodity or stock) by use.” In turn, “used” means “1. b. That is or has been made use of; utilized” and also “II. Used up ...” and “7. Reduced, exhausted, or consumed by using”. Similarly, the Tasman Dictionary defines “use” as “1. To employ for some purpose” and “3. To expend or consume in use”. Which meaning is intended must be taken from the context. Accordingly, the relevant event could relate to a change of the holding, deployment or treatment of an asset in a particular way. Relevantly, it could mean to employ or make QB 19/02: 2 April 2019 3 UNCLASSIFIED use of for a particular purpose or aim, or it could mean to consume. The first of these potential meanings supports a view that a “change of use” refers to the purpose for which property is employed. The second potential meaning of “use”, being to “consume”, supports a narrower meaning relating to the application of the property in a particular way (for example, its physical use). Assistance in determining which is the correct interpretation can be taken from the wider context of the depreciation regime. “Depreciable property” is defined in s EE 6 as property that might be expected to decline in value while used or available for use in either deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. If an item is used or available for use in deriving exempt income, or for a private use, the property is not depreciable. Specific rules apply to property that is partly used for deriving assessable income and partly used for other (non-taxable) purposes at the same time (see ss EE 49 and EE 50). Accordingly, it can be seen from these provisions that the use (or availability) of the property in deriving assessable income or for carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income (and not for deriving exempt income nor private use) is the important background context for depreciation purposes. In summary, depreciation recovery income may arise where a change of use of depreciable property results in depreciation deductions no longer being available. For these purposes, a change of use refers to the use of property in deriving assessable income. When will depreciation deductions be denied? Relevantly, s EE 47(2) requires that the change of use has a result that the person is denied a depreciation deduction for the next income year. A person will be denied a depreciation deduction where property is not used or available for use in deriving assessable income. This indicates that the relevant change of use must be one that relates to a change in the depreciable status of the property. This supports the wider meaning of “use” referred to above, as being one for a relevant purpose (that is, a purpose of deriving assessable income), rather than just its application in the business. A person is allowed a deduction for depreciation loss where property is “depreciable property” and the general permission in s DA 1 is satisfied. That is, a depreciation deduction is available to the extent it is incurred in deriving assessable income or excluded income or is otherwise incurred in the course of carrying on a business for the purposes of deriving such income. Under s DA 2, a deduction is not available to the extent that expenditure or loss is incurred in deriving exempt income or for private use (amongst other things). Section BD 1(2) provides that an amount of income is “exempt income” if it is a person’s exempt income under subpart CW. In the context of charities, ss CW 41 and CW 42 exempt all income derived by a charity or a charitable business. Accordingly, where s CW 42 applies to a previously taxable business (for example, because its shares were acquired by a charity, or it becomes a charity itself), the business is no longer deriving “assessable income” but is deriving exempt income. Accordingly, as a charity’s income is exempt, its property will not be available for use in deriving assessable income, and so will not qualify as being “depreciable property”. This change of use results in depreciation deductions being denied. QB 19/02: 2 April 2019 4 UNCLASSIFIED Will ss EE 47(2) and EE 47(2B) apply? A change of use under s EE 47(2) is not limited to referring to a change in the application of an asset but refers to a change in its use for a particular purpose, being the derivation of assessable income. This could still involve a change in the application of the item (such as property being taken out of a business and used for private use) but also extends to an item being applied in the same way in a business, but for a purpose of deriving exempt income. This conclusion is consistent with the purpose of depreciation recovery income, which is to recover excess deductions for depreciation that was not actually experienced on the property, at the time the property is no longer available for use in deriving assessable income. Accordingly, the context and purpose of the depreciation regime supports the view that when a business becomes a charity (or any other entity deriving exempt income) there will be a change of use event under ss EE 47(2) and EE 47(2B). This is because the property is no longer used in a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income, but instead is used for the purpose of deriving exempt income. A result of this change is that depreciation deductions are no longer available. The recent enactment of s EE 47(2B) changes the timing of the change of use (and therefore the derivation of any depreciation recovery income or loss on disposal). The change of use will occur, and any depreciation recovery income will be derived (or loss incurred) immediately before the entity’s income becomes exempt. For completeness, depreciation deductions will be denied from the beginning of the income year in which the change of use is treated as occurring under s EE 47(2B). Conclusion Section EE 47(2) will apply where a business becomes a charity and begins to derive exempt income, even though assets are still being applied in the business in the same way. This change of use of depreciable property is treated as if there were a disposal of the depreciable property for market value. A consequence of this conclusion is that the business may have a depreciation gain (or loss) on disposal. The recent enactment of s EE 47(2B) provides that the change of use occurs immediately before the entity’s income becomes exempt (and therefore any depreciation gain or loss also arises immediately before the entity’s income becomes exempt). As an aside, the same conclusion would also be reached for any business which begins to derive exempt income under subpart CW. Also, the same conclusion about a change of use occurring would also apply to any other change in the use of an item that was used or available for use in deriving assessable income (for example, where an item is no longer used for deriving assessable income and instead is used for private use). Examples 1 and 2 illustrate the application of this approach. QB 19/02: 2 April 2019 5 UNCLASSIFIED Examples Example 1 - Business acquired by a charity Warm Feelings Ltd is in the business of manufacturing and selling sustainably sourced woollen blankets. The shares in Warm Feelings Ltd are acquired by a registered charity, with the intention that Warm Feelings Ltd would continue to operate in the same way, although all profits would be used for charitable purposes (and its constitution amended accordingly). Once Warm Feelings Ltd satisfies the requirements in s CW 42, it will begin to derive exempt income. Warm Feelings Ltd had been depreciating various items of equipment used in manufacturing the blankets. After satisfying the requirements in s CW 42, those items are no longer available for use in deriving assessable income. Accordingly, there will be a change of use of the items under ss EE 47(2) and EE 47(2B) that results in deductions for depreciation loss being disallowed. Warm Feelings Ltd may be liable for depreciation recovery income if the market value of its depreciable property exceeds the adjusted tax value of that property on the relevant date under s EE 47(2B). Similarly, it may have a depreciation loss on disposal if the market value of depreciable property is less than the adjusted tax value of that property. The change of use (and any depreciation recovery income or loss) is treated as occurring immediately before its income became exempt. Any other depreciation loss is denied in that income year. Example 2 – Calculation and timing The shareholders of Warm Feelings Ltd register as a charity (and satisfy s CW 42) with effect from 1 April 2019. Warm Feelings Ltd has a standard balance date. As with example 1, at the time Warm Feelings Ltd ceases to derive assessable income, there is a change of use event and ss EE 47(2) and EE 47(2B) apply. Section EE 47(2B) treats the change of use as occurring immediately before the income becomes exempt, on 31 March 2019. As with example 1, Warm Feelings Ltd may be liable for depreciation recovery income if the market value of its depreciable property exceeds the adjusted tax value of that property on that date. On 31 March 2019, an amount of depreciation recovery income or loss will need to be calculated and will be taxable or potentially deductible in that income year. No other amount of depreciation loss will be deductible for that year. Warm Feelings Ltd had acquired its manufacturing equipment on 1 April 2013 for $10,000. Using the DV depreciation rate of 13%, it had claimed depreciation loss deductions for the last five years. The adjusted tax value of the equipment as at 31 March 2019 was $6,098. However, at that date the market value of the equipment was valued at $6,500. Accordingly, Warm Feelings Ltd will derive an amount of depreciation recovery income of $402 in the income year ended 31 March 2019.

QUESTIONS WE’VE BEEN ASKED | PĀTAI KUA UIA MAI When is a subdivision project a taxable activity for GST purposes? Issued | Tukuna: 21 June 2024 QB 24/04 This Question We’ve Been Asked sets out when a subdivision project is an activity carried on continuously or regularly in the definition of “taxable activity” for GST purposes. It also sets out when the sale of subdivided land is a supply made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Ke y provisions | Whakaratonga tāpua Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 – s 6 REPLACES | WHAKAKAPIA: Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7 No 2 (August 1995), “GST and subdivisions – Court of Appeal decision in the Newman case”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995): 10. A ll legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) unless otherwise stated. Page 1 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 Question | Pātai When is a subdivision project a taxable activity for GST purposes? Answer | Whakautu A subdivision project is a taxable activity when it is carried on continuously or regularly and involves, or is intended to involve, the making of supplies to another person for consideration. Whether a subdivision project is carried on continuously or regularly needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis. There are two steps to determining whether a subdivision project is continuous or regular. These are to consider: the number of lots created and sold; and the level of activity involved in the subdivision project, such as the scale of the subdivision and level of development work involved. Broadly, the more lots created and sold (and therefore the more supplies made), the less activity is needed for a taxable activity to be continuous or regular. Generally, a subdivision leading to only one supply will not be a taxable activity unless the scale of the activity and level of work involved is very high. This is because cases indicate an activity leading to one supply that is not repeated is a “one-off” activity and therefore not continuous or regular. On the other hand, a subdivision leading to four or more supplies is likely to be a taxable activity unless the level of activity is very low. This does not mean a subdivision activity leading to only one sale can never be a taxable activity or a subdivision activity leading to four or more sales will always be a taxable activity. The facts of each case must be considered individually. An example of an activity leading to one supply that would be a taxable activity is the construction and sale of a large office building. However, the construction and sale of a regular residential dwelling as part of a subdivision will generally not be a taxable activity. Key terms | Kīanga tau tāpua Subdivision means dividing a parcel of land into two or more, or changing an existing boundary location. For the purpose of this item, references to a subdivision also include any development or building work on the land carried out as part of a subdivision project, unless otherwise specified. Page 2 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 Explanation | Whakamāramatanga 1.A policy statement titled “GST and subdivisions – Court of Appeal decision in the Ne wman case” was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995): 10. 2.That policy statement outlined the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s position f ollowing the decision in Newman v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,097 (CA). According to the statement, whether a subdivision project is a taxable activity for GST purposes depends on the facts of each case, considering factors such as the scale of the subdivision, level of development work, time and effort involved, amount of financial investment, and commerciality of the transaction. 3.The Commissioner considers many of these factors are still relevant when considering whether a subdivision is a taxable activity. This Question We’ve Been Asked outlines factors that might affect whether a subdivision project is continuous or regular, provides guidance on factors that are not likely to be relevant, and addresses som e o ther related considerations regarding subdivisions and GST registration. Legislation 4.Section 8(1) imposes GST on the supply of goods and services in New Zealand by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. A Taxpayer who is carrying on a taxable activity may be required to register for GST. 1 For general guidance on GST registration and requirements, see the Inland Revenue guide IR 375, GST Guide: Working with GST. 5.“Taxable activity” is defined in s 6. Under s 6(1)(a), the main features of a taxable a ctivity are: there is an activity; the activity is carried on “continuously” or “regularly”; and the activity involves, or is intended to involve, the supply of goods and services to another person for a consideration. 6.The courts have held that an “activity” is a broad concept involving a combination of tasks undertaken, or a series of acts or course of conduct pursued by a person. 2 Subd ividing land is almost always an activity for GST purposes. 1 The requirements and conditions for GST registration are set out in ss 51 and 51B. 2 See, for example, CIR v Bayly (1998) 18 NZTC 14,073 (CA) at 14,078, and Case 14/2016 (2016) 27 NZTC 3,036 at \[63\]. Page 3 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 7.Subdivision is also usually an activity that involves, or is intended to involve, the supply of goods or services to another person for a consideration. This is usually satisfied a s, i n most instances, some or all of the subdivided land is sold or otherwise used for supplying goods and services. However, this is not always the case, such as where t he s ubdivided land is kept for private use or for making exempt supplies . 8.This means that, in the context of a subdivision project, the most relevant factor will g enerally be whether the activity is carried on continuously or regularly. This Questio n W e’ve Been Asked focuses on this factor. Carried on continuously or regularly 9."Carried on” has been described as “the habitual pursuit of a course of conduct, and as implying “a repetition of acts, and excluding the case of an association formed for doing one particular act which is never to be repeated. 3 10.In general terms, an activity is carried on continuously if it is carried on over a period or in a sequence uninterrupted in time or if it is connected. 4 An activity is carried on regularly if it is carried on accordance with a definite course or a uniform principle of action or conduct, or if a proper correspondence exists between the elements of the activity. 5 11.It can be difficult to work out whether a subdivision project is a continuous or regular activity. This is because activities involving land usually involve a lot of work, time, an d c ost, but the number of supplies made is often low. 12.Cases confirm it is the activity that must be continuous or regular, not the making of supplies. However, the meaning of “continuously or regularly” must be considered i n t he context of the definition of taxable activity and the wider scheme of the GST Act. 6 I n this context, the types of activities contemplated seem to be those leading to t he m aking of multiple supplies over time. 7 13.The following guidance has been developed from comparing the facts, analysis, and outcomes of cases concerning the GST treatment of subdivisions. This is designed to assist taxpayers in working out whether a subdivision project they are involved in or 3 Newman (CA) per Richardson J at 12,100, citing Premier Automatic Ticket Issues Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1933) 50 CLR 268 at 298; Smith v Anderson (1880) 15 CH D 247 at 277, 278 respectively. 4 Wakelin v CIR ( 1997) 18 NZTC 13,182 (HC). 5 Wakelin at 13,185-13,186. 6 Newman (CA) per Gault J at 12,102. 7 Consistent with the position taken in Newman (CA). Page 4 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 plan to be involved in is an activity carried on continuously or regularly, potentially requiring GST registration. 14.This item first provides a brief overview of the reasoning in the two most prominent cases concerning whether a subdivision activity is a taxable activity. It then outlines t he r elevant factors when determining whether a subdivision project is a taxable activity following the reasoning in these cases and other subsequent Taxation Review Authority decisions. The QWBA then briefly addresses some other relevant considerations. 15.Before Newman, courts and the Taxation Review Authority found almost all subdivisions to be taxable activities. The Commissioner considers these cases are no longer relevant as the interpretation of “continuously or regularly” differs from that taken in Newman and later cases. Newman 16.The leading case on the meaning of “carried on continuously or regularly” in the c ontext of subdivisions is Newman (CA). 17.The taxpayer in Newman was a GST-registered builder who bought 2.7 hectares of land to build a family home. Due to financial difficulties, he subdivided the land to fund t he c ompletion of the family home. Minimal development work was undertaken, but som e d rainage and electrical work was done. Eventually, the taxpayer sold the subdivided lot. 18.The Commissioner determined this subdivision was a taxable supply. The Taxation Review Authority and High Court both found that the sale of the subdivided lot was a taxable supply. 8 This was consistent with most cases before Newman, where almost all s ubdivisions were found to be taxable activities. 19.However, on appeal, the Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the taxpayer’s appeal and found the sale of the subdivided land was not, by itself, a taxable activity as it was not an activity carried on continuously or regularly. 20.In reaching its decision, the Court of Appeal stated that dissection of what was done into a series of sequential steps does not answer the statutory test of whether t he a ctivity was carried on continuously. 9 The Court used examples of shopping or selling a car as activities which, if broken down into a series of steps, could be described as carried on continuously. Instead, what is relevant is whether the activity (of which t he 8 Case P4 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,024, Newman v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,229 (HC). 9 Newman (CA) per Richardson J at 12,101. Page 5 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 series of steps formed part) was one that was carried on continuously or regularly. On the topic of sale of a motor car, McKay J considered that if the sale was of only one car, the amount of work, time, and effort required to effect the sale cannot determine whether the activity of selling the car was continuous or regular. Instead, the one-off nature of the transaction prevents the activity from being continuous. 10 21.The Court of Appeal in Newman deliberately did not express a view as to what would make a particular subdivision a taxable activity. 11 The Court acknowledged that some f actual circumstances will be hard to classify but stated it will be a matter of fact an d d egree. 12 Wakelin 22.The High Court decision in Wakelin v CIR is often contrasted with Newman. 13 T he ta xpayer in Wakelin carried out subdivision work on a block of land. The taxpayer subdivided the land into six residential lots over a period of three years, and then sol d a ll of the lots over the following six years. The case concerned five of the sales. 23.The High Court found that although there was not a “great deal” of work involved, and it could have been done in a relatively short time, the taxpayer continuously and regularly subdivided a portion of land and supplied five sections to the market over several years. 14 24.The High Court distinguished Newman primarily based on the number of supplies made. While Paterson J acknowledged it is the activity that must be continuous o r r egular, not the supply of goods, the number of supplies made is still relevant. 15 25.Following Newman, there have been several Taxation Review Authority cases concerning the GST treatment of subdivisions. Where relevant, these cases ha ve been r eferenced and relied on in the guidance below. Relevant factors 26.Newman and Wakelin provide contrasting examples of what is and it not a taxable a ctivity in the context of subdivision projects. The taxpayers in both cases did a similar 10 Newman (CA) per McKay J at 12,104. 11 Newman (CA) per Richardson J at 12,101. 12 Newman (CA) per Richardson J at 12,101, per Gault J at 12,103, per McKay J at 12,104. 13 Wakelin v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,182 (HC). 14 Wakelin at 13,186. 15 Wakelin at 13,185. Page 6 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 amount of work to effect the subdivisions, but one led to one supply and the other led to five supplies. These cases indicate the first step to consider is the number of lots created and sold. Number of lots created and sold 27.There is no specific number of lots created that determines whether a taxable activity exists. However, Newman and Wakelin, other cases considering the meaning of continuously and regularly in this context, such as Case S70 16 and Case T62, 17 as well as the general scheme of the GST Act, demonstrate that ordinarily a subdivision activity leading to only one supply is not a taxable activity. Such an activity is more accurately described as a single “one-off” activity comprising many steps, rather than an activity carried on continuously or regularly. 28.For example, Paterson J in Wakelin was clear that in the case of an activity leading to the supply of one item or one section, “it is difficult to see how in normal circumstances, that activity can be carried on continuously or regularly, because it is i n ef fect, a one-off transaction supplying one item”. 18 29.Similarly, in Case T62, Judge Barber found that the subdivision of land into two, and the construction and sale of one apartment on one of the created lots, had the air of a “one-off” transaction. 19 Relating the facts to Newman, Judge Barber considered this case did not involve repeated acts by the taxpayers, but merely the components or sequential steps of one activity. 20 30.On the other hand, where a subdivision activity involves the creation and sale of multiple lots, this may be a taxable activity even if the level of development work is similar to that in Newman. 21 This does not mean a subdivision involving the creation a nd sale of multiple lots will always be a continuous activity. 22 In some circumstances a 16 Case S70 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,431. 17 Case T62 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,468. 18 Wakelin at 13,185, cited with approval in Case T62. 19 Case T62 at \[50\]. 20 Case T62 at \[53\]. 21 In Wakelin, Paterson J distinguished a one-off transaction supplying one item as in Newman from the sale of several sections. In Case T40 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,267, the taxpayer intended to sell four lots but at the time had sold only two. Judge Barber stated it was not a one-off, as it was intended to involve the sale of four, or possibly five, sections. In Case S70, Judge Barber stated the level of development work was similar to that in Newman, but the increased number of resulting sections (four) was a distinguishing factor. 22 In Case S70 Judge Barber acknowledged that the sale of more than one section may not amount to a taxable activity. Page 7 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 subdivision may be so straight-forward that even if multiple lots are created and sold, the activity is not continuous or regular. However, a court is much more likely to consider an activity ”continuous” if it involves the sale of multiple lots. 31.The lots do not need to have already been created and sold when considering this. 23 U sually a taxpayer will need to work out whether they are going to be carrying on a taxable activity at the outset or before the bulk of the work has been done. However, if the subdivision project does not proceed as planned, the Commissioner will need to determine whether there is enough for a taxable activity to exist. See from \[74\] fo r m ore information about the beginning of a taxable activity. Effect of number of supplies on other factors 32.Applying this in practice, the Commissioner considers the number of supplies made a ffects the relevance of other factors when determining whether a taxable activity exists. Broadly, w here the activity leads to only one supply, there is a presumption that the activity is not continuous or regular, unless the level of work involved is very high. Where the activity leads to many supplies, there is a presumption that the activity is continuous or regular. While there is no specific number that will determine whether a taxable activity exists, the Commissioner considers generally a subdivision project involving the creation and sale of four or more lots will be a taxable activity, unless t he l evel of work involved is very low. 24 33.Cases use the example of the construction and sale of a commercial building as an activity leading to one supply that is a taxable activity. 25 The Commissioner considers t his is because of the usually high scale of such a project. The level of time and effort, development work, and financial investment in building something like a large office building will usually be very high. The commercial nature of such a project on its ow n i s not relevant. Please see from \[57\] below on the relevance of commerciality for mor e information on this. 34.On the other hand, cases indicate a subdivision project that involves the construction a nd sale of a single residential dwelling is not, on its own, enough for an activity to be c ontinuous or regular. 26 23 Such as in Case T40 where only two of the lots had been sold. 24 This is consistent with Case S70, which concerned the creation and sale of four new lots. 25 Newman (HC) at 11,233; Newman (CA) at 12,103; Case S70 at 7,440; Case T62 at \[53\]. 26 Consistent with Case T62 and comments in Newman (CA) and Wakelin. Case 7/2012 25 NZTC 1,019 is a case where renovation work on a single dwelling was relevant. However, that was in the context of a much larger high-end residential subdivision project that was intended to lead to multiple Page 8 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 35.The following diagram illustrates the relevance of the level of activity involved in the pr oject in relation to the number of supplies made (or planned to be made): 36.In summary, when the subdivision activity leads to one supply, a very high level of activity is needed for the activity to be continuous or regular. When the subdivisio n a ctivity leads to four or more supplies, only a low level of activity is needed for t he a ctivity to be continuous or regular. When the subdivision activity leads to two or three supplies, considering the level of activity involved will be particularly important. 37.The relevant factors in considering the level of activity in a subdivision project are d iscussed below. 38.While the same approach will generally apply to other activities involving the d evelopment of land, the same criteria may not apply for other types of activity. T he l evel of work involved in the development of land, and the scale of projects relating to it, relative to the number of supplies made, makes land development project s d istinguishable from most other activities. supplies. Case N59 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,457 is a case where the construction and sale of a single residential dwelling was found to be a taxable activity. However, this case predates Newman (CA) and is therefore no longer relevant. Page 9 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 Level of activity 39.The second step is to look at the level of activity involved in the subdivision project, in light of the number of supplies made. In considering this, the following factors may be r elevant when determining whether the activity is continuous or regular: the scale of the subdivision; the level of development work; the time and effort involved; the level of financial investment; and the level of repetition. 40.This is a general guide and is not an exhaustive list. If a taxpayer’s circumstances share some elements in common with statements or examples in this QWBA, this does no t nec essarily mean that the taxpayer’s tax treatment will be the same as that indicated by the statements or examples. Ultimately, the activity must be considered as a whole, realistically as it is carried on, and all relevant factors must be considered together. 27 Scale of the subdivision 41.Scale in this context means how large or extensive the subdivision is. The greater the s cale of the subdivision project, the more likely it is to be an activity carried o n c ontinuously or regularly. This factor is likely to overlap with the level of development work, as the greater the scale of the project, generally the more development work that is needed. 42.Subdividing land to construct and sell a block of townhouses, or to construct an office bui lding or apartment building, would almost certainly be a subdivision project of sufficient scale for it to be an activity carried on continuously or regularly, even if it leads to only one supply. Similarly, subdividing a large plot of land to be used as a new housing development would be an activity carried on continuously or regularly. Level of development work 43.It is common for subdivision projects to involve some development of the land, particularly as this is often a requirement for council consent. This item only concerns development work in the context of a subdivision, but similar factors are relevant w hen 27 Newman (CA) per Gault J at 12,102. Page 10 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 determining whether a land development project with no subdivision is a taxable activity. 44.The more development work involved in a subdivision project, the more likely it is to be an activity carried on continuously. 28 While Newman (CA) confirmed that an activity should not be broken down into sequential steps, it is still necessary to consider t he s teps involved in the activity to take a real and holistic view of the activity. 29 45.Development work might include: earthworks and landscaping; roading and installation of driveways and paths; the installation of facility infrastructure, such as sewerage, power, wastewate r dr ainage and so on; the erection of retaining walls or dividing fences; the demolition, removal, or renovation of existing structures or buildings on t he la nd; and construction of structures or buildings on the land. Larger and more complex structures and buildings usually require a higher level of activity, but this w ill d epend on the particular facts of each case. 46.In all cases, it is the level of development work which is relevant, rather than the s pecific form the subdivided land takes after development is completed. Time and effort involved 47.If a project is carried on over a long period, this might point towards the subdivision a ctivity being continuous, particularly where the length of time is due to the level of work required. Similarly, if there is a large amount of effort involved on the taxpayer’s part, this may point towards the activity being continuous. This would include any work on the taxpayer’s part to effect the subdivision, such as organising consent, finance, or new titles, speaking with lawyers, surveyors and real estate agents, and any other general project management work. 48.It is noted that the time and effort involved in carrying out a subdivision project is likely to be higher if the taxpayer is carrying out development or project management work themselves, rather than hiring contractors to manage the project. This does no t 28 In Newman (CA), the low level of development work was relevant to the conclusion that a taxable activity did not exist. 29 Case S70 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,431 at 7,441. Page 11 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 mean work carried out by contractors is irrelevant. I t may well be relevant to other factors such as the scale of the subdivision and the level of development work. However, if the taxpayer (as an individual or as an entity capable of being a registered person) is putting in very little time and effort to effect the subdivision, this is one factor that might support the view that the taxpayer’s activity is not continuous or regular. On its own, this is unlikely to change whether a taxable activity exists, but it is still relevant as part of the broader enquiry. 49.If a subdivision project is interrupted in time or sequence, then it is not continuous or regular. Provided the intention to complete the activity is not interrupted, then a n a ctivity being carried on in “fits and starts” does not necessarily prevent it being continuous or regular, as Paterson J found in Wakelin. 30 That said, a continuous intention to complete the activity is not enough on its own. The more time in whic h t here is no or only very little activity, t he less likely an activity is to be continuous or regular. Tompkins J in Allen Yacht Charters said an activity that is intermittent or occasional does not qualify as continuous or regular. 31 This means the amount of time t aken is irrelevant if it is due to the activity being only intermittent or occasional. 50.In some cases, there may be circumstances outside the taxpayer’s control preventing a subdivision from proceeding for an extended period, such as delays in obtaining resource consent. A taxable activity could in some cases continue even when facing extended delays, but each case and all the surrounding circumstances need to be c onsidered. Relevant factors for this might include the reason for the delay, the lengt h of the delay, the level of activity before the delay, and the steps the taxpayer is taking or has taken to ensure the subdivision proceeds as soon as possible. Level of financial investment 51.The level of financial investment is unlikely to be a significant factor on its own. However, it may provide further support for other factors, such as the scale of t he s ubdivision or level of development work. 52.If a subdivision project is unusually costly because of specific factors relating to the location of the land (for example, if the land is in an area with a labour or material shortage leading to increased prices or extended delays), this is unlikely to affect whether the activity is continuous or regular. Equally, if a subdivision project is particularly cheap due to the taxpayer doing some of the work themselves or receiving 30 Wakelin at 13,186. 31 Allen Yacht Charters Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,279 (HC) at 11,274. Page 12 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 assistance, such as if the taxpayer’s solicitor is a relative who works for no fee, this is unlikely to affect whether the activity is continuous or regular. Level of repetition 53.In the context of subdivisions, an activity is likely to be carried on “regularly” if a person c arries out the subdivision process on a regular or repeated basis. This will be the cas e even i f each individual subdivision project would not be a taxable activity on its own. 54.This could apply where a person has a pattern of acquiring land to subdivide, or where a person subdivides a single piece of land in a way that involves repeatedly supplying new lots over time. The High Court in Wakelin found that subdivision of the taxpayer’s land and supply to market of five sections over nine years was an activity carried o n bo th continuously and regularly. 32 Similarly, the TRA in Case 7/2012 indicated that if the taxpayer’s planned subdivision project (which was to involve the development and sale of several high-end residential properties over time) had proceeded as intended, it would have been an activity carried on regularly. 33 Factors that are not likely to be relevant 55.When considering whether a subdivision activity is continuous or regular, the following factors are not likely to be relevant: Commerciality; Activity before there is an intention to make supplies; and Actions that relate to subdivided land not used for making supplies. 56.This is not an exhaustive list of factors that are unlikely to be relevant. Commerciality 57.The policy statement and some older cases referred to the relevance of the “ commerciality” of a subdivision project, or distinguished between the sale of commercial assets and private assets, when determining whether a taxable activity exists. 58.The Commissioner considers commerciality is no longer significant following Newman (CA) and Wakelin. Richardson J in Newman disagreed with the approach taken by t he 32 Wakelin at 13,186. 33 Case 7/2012 at \[99\]. Page 13 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 Taxation Review Authority in Case P4. The Authority relied on the conclusion that the subdivision project was “commercial in nature” in reaching its conclusion that the taxpayer was carrying on a taxable activity. 34 59.Richardson J stated that determining whether a transaction was commercial in nature w as not the relevant enquiry: 35 As I see it, it is not a matter of importing any overlay of commercial dealing or of trying to draw a distinction between the divestment of commercial assets and private assets. Rather it is whether the process engaged in, whatever the asset or its location or the occupation of the taxpayer, comes within the statutory language. 60.Judge Barber in Case S70 later accepted the Newman (CA) view that whether a commercial element exists in the relevant activity is “beside the point”. 36 61.Similarly, Paterson J in Wakelin stated that lacking a commercial or businesslike flavour does not preclude a taxable activity from existing: 37 The fact that the venture may lack a commercial or businesslike flavour or that it may be a sale of private assets is not sufficient to preclude the application of s 6(1). A transaction which involves the sale of private assets, if carried out continuously or regularly, falls within the provisions of the section (see McKay J in Newman v C of IR...). 62.As previously stated, comments in Newman (CA) and other cases indicate that the c onstruction and sale of a single commercial building on subdivided land is an activity carried on continuously or regularly. 38 The Commissioner’s view is that this does not m ean the commercial nature of such a project on its own is significant, but instead this reflects the level of activity generally involved in such a project. 63.In some circumstances, constructing and selling a commercial building as part of a subdivision project will not be a taxable activity. The policy statement included a n ex ample involving the construction and sale of a tea shop on subdivided land. T he ex ample concluded the taxpayer was carrying on a taxable activity as it involved t he c onstruction and sale of a commercial building. The Commissioner now considers this example is lacking information, and may be incorrect depending on relevant facts. T he le vel of work involved in building a tea shop may, in some cases, not be notably higher 34 Case P4 at 4,034. 35 Newman (CA) at 12,100-12,101. 36 Case S70 at 7,440. 37 Wakelin at 13,185. 38 Newman (CA) at 12,101. Page 14 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 than that involved in constructing a residential dwelling. 39 As previously stated, the Commissioner considers the level of activity involved in the construction and sale of a single residential dwelling is not enough for the activity to be continuous or regular, given it leads to only one supply. 64.These views are consistent with the requirements of s 6. No requirement exists for an a ctivity to be commercial or business-like for it to be a taxable activity. On t he c ontrary, s 6(1)(a) specifies that an activity need not be carried on for pecuniary profit, and non-business structures such as clubs are explicitly included as ways in which a n a ctivity can be carried on. This also means a subdivision project need not be profitable for a taxable activity to exist. Judge Barber made this clear in Case 7/2012. 40 However, an activity carried on essentially as a private pursuit or hobby is not a taxable activity. 41 Activity before intention to make supplies 65.The definition of “taxable activity” refers to any activity that involves, or is intended to involve, the supply of goods and services for a consideration. The “or” in “involves or is intended to involve” suggests it is enough for one of these requirements to be met. 66.In Case T62, referred to above, two taxpayers bought land with the intention of building two units for their families to live in, but when the units were approximately 65% completed, one of the taxpayers decided to remain in their existing home. Both units were sold to the company the taxpayers operated, with one unit being used as the family home of one of the taxpayers, and the other unit being sold to a third party at a profit. 42 67.Judge Barber found that because the building activity of the taxpayer’s apartment led to its sale, then the activity must have “involved” that supply even though it was not contemplated when the building work began. 43 Judge Barber found neither of the t axpayers were carrying on a taxable activity in relation to the sale of one of the units. One reason given in support of this decision was that the unit was “by then, being built 39 However, if the taxpayer operated the tea shop or leased the shop to commercial tenants, rather than selling it, the costs involved in the relevant part of the subdivision and construction would form part of any taxable activity of running or leasing the shop. 40 Case 7/2012 at \[102\]. 41 Section 6(3)(a) and (aa). 42 Judge Barber did not treat the sale to the company as significant. 43 Case T62 at \[48\]. Page 15 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 to achieve profit for S by resale, but until then had been for \[the purpose of housing S’s family\]”. 44 He considered the work done before that point was not relevant. 68.For this reason, the Commissioner considers it is not necessary for a taxpayer to intend from the outset to sell some or all of the subdivided lots. In this situation, anything done in the course or furtherance of making that supply after the intention to make supplies for consideration arose is relevant to whether the activity is carried on continuously or regularly. If a taxpayer’s intention changes during a subdivision project, the taxpayer has the onus of proving that intention changed and when, as wit h o ther factual matters. Actions that relate to subdivided land not used for making supplies 69.Subdivision and development work that does not relate to the making of supplies is not relevant in determining whether a taxable activity exists. For example, if a taxpayer builds two units on subdivided land, lives in one unit and sells the other, only work and expenditure relating to the unit and land that is sold is relevant in determining t he ex istence of a taxable activity. 45 However, consistent with the previous paragraphs, if a t axpayer intends to live in one of the units but changes their mind and sells both, t hen a ll the work involved in the subdivision and development after that intention changed is relevant when determining whether a taxable activity exists. 70.For similar reasons, the use of the land before its subdivision is not relevant. If a taxpayer lives on the land to be subdivided, this is not treated any differently from a subdivision project on land purchased specifically for that purpose. That said, buying a piece of land to subdivide is likely to involve higher upfront cost. It is also likely to require more time and effort in finding the right piece of land, and going through t he pr ocesses to acquire it. As previously stated, these factors are relevant as part of t he o verall enquiry. 44 Case T62 at \[44\]. 45 Tout v Cook (1991) 13 NZTC 8,053 (HC) concerns a similar situation where a taxpayer built a house on subdivided land but then moved into the new house and sold the existing house. The High Court found the taxpayer was not carrying on a taxable activity, and did not consider any activity relating to the new house as relevant. Page 16 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 Other considerations Existing taxable activity 71.Regardless of other factors, if a taxpayer is already registered for GST, whether any subdivision activity is part of that taxable activity depends on whether the subdivisio n w as carried on in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. This in tur n d epends on its connection, if any, to the taxable activity in question. 72.A subdivision activity that might not constitute a taxable activity on its own still gives rise to GST obligations if it was done in the course or furtherance of an existing taxable activity. 73.In Case P4, which led to the Newman (CA) decision, the Taxation Review Authority found that, even though the taxpayer had a taxable activity as a builder, th e s ubdivision activity was not done in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. 46 T his meant the existence of a taxable activity needed to be established separately, an d t he subdivision did not become part of the taxpayer’s existing taxable activity. Beginning of a taxable activity 74.Under s 6(2), anything done in connection with the beginning or ending of a taxable a ctivity, including a premature ending, is treated as being carried out in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity. This means that preparatory steps to t he c ommencement of a taxable activity can form part of the taxable activity. 75.That said, preparatory steps on their own are not enough for a taxable activity. 47 A person can register for GST if they have started preparatory steps to carry on a taxabl e a ctivity, or if they plan to do so from a specific date. However, if the activity does not proceed beyond these preparatory steps, the person must notify the Commissioner, and their registration may be cancelled from the date on which the person was registered. 48 In this situation, the person will not be entitled to any inputs claimed. 76.For anyone who believes they are carrying on a taxable activity but has not registered for GST, the date GST registration takes effect will depend on when the taxpayer applies to register and whether they are liable to register or are registering voluntarily. Please see the IR 375 GST Guide: Working with GST for more information about GST 46 While the Court of Appeal overturned the decisions of the Taxation Review Authority and High Court, this element of the Authority’s decision was not appealed. 47 Confirmed in Case 7/2012. 48 Section 52 GST Act. Page 17 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 registration, and SPS 18/03: Effective date of GST registrations for details on effective dates for registration. 77.Note that when a person is registered for GST, if they acquire land with the intention of using it to make taxable supplies, they will usually be required to disclose this to t he C ommissioner under s 61B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Income tax 78.This item addresses only GST treatment. Even if a subdivision activity is not a taxable a ctivity for GST purposes, the resulting sale may still be subject to income tax. 79.For example, if a taxpayer buys land with a purpose or intention of disposing of it, an a mount derived from the disposal may be taxable income under s CB 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Sections CB 7 to CB 15B of the Income Tax Act 2007 also include in a person’s income certain amounts relating to disposal of land, including sections CB 10, CB 12, and CB 13 which specifically refer to subdivisions. They may also need to consider whether the sale is caught by the bright-line property rules. 80.The Commissioner has released several items on the treatment of a sale or disposal of la nd for income tax purposes. Search the Inland Revenue Tax Technical w ebsite for more information. Avoidance 81.All of the guidance in this item is subject to the GST avoidance provision in s 76. Under s 76, a tax avoidance arrangement entered into by a person is void against t he C ommissioner for tax purposes. “Tax avoidance arrangement” is an arrangement which has tax avoidance as its purpose or effect, or one of its purposes or effects, if t he pur pose or effect is not merely incidental. If a tax avoidance arrangement is void against the Commissioner, the Commissioner may adjust the amount of tax payable by, or the amount of tax refundable to, a registered person affected by the arrangement, to counteract any tax advantage obtained. 82.Please see the Commissioner’s Interpretation Statement IS 23/01: Tax avoidance and the interpretation of the general anti-avoidance provisions sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 for more information about tax avoidance. 49 49 While this statement is primarily concerned with avoidance for income tax purposes, it is also relevant to s 76 as s 76 is aligned with s BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This is specified at para \[1.3\] of IS 23/01. Page 18 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 Examples | Tauira 83.These examples/tauira assume the resulting sales of subdivided land exceed the GST registration threshold of $60,000. These examples/tauira also assume that t he a rrangements are not tax avoidance arrangements under s 76. Example | Tauira 1 – Basic subdivision Mike and Megan are not registered for GST. They have owned their own home in Auckland for 20 years. They subdivide their section into two to sell one lot and put the proceeds towards retirement savings. Mike and Megan carry out development work to meet Auckland Council’s requirements for consent. They engage contractors to: construct sealed road access and an extended driveway to the rear section; level terrain and improve drainage for stormwater management; and install water, wastewater, telecommunications and power infrastructure an d connections. In addition to the fees for contractors and materials, and the time and effort of managing the project, Mike and Megan incurred costs to apply for consent, as well as professional fees (for surveyors, lawyers, real estate agents and so on), development contribution fees, and Land Information New Zealand fees. Once a new certificate of title is issued for the lot, Mike and Megan put the land up for sale, and it sells within a month. Mike and Megan continue to live in their house on the front section. Are Mike and Megan carrying on a taxable activity? GST treatment Mike and Megan’s subdivision activity is not a taxable activity as it is not carried on continuously or regularly. The subdivision is a straight-forward subdivision into two lots. While there is development work to meet Council consent requirements, and associated time, effort, and cost to meet these requirements, this is a one-off activity leading to only one supply that is not to be repeated. The level of activity is not sufficiently high for the activity to be carried on continuously. Page 19 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 Example | Tauira 1B – Creation of three lots The background is the same as that in Example | Tauira 1, but Mike and Megan have a large section that can be subdivided to create three extra lots. The work required to carry out the subdivision is similar, but on a somewhat larger scale due to the increased number of lots created and larger section. More terrain-levelling work is required, and there is more work to create the extended driveway. As with Example | Tauira 1, Mike and Megan put the extra three lots up for sale once new certificates of title have been issued. They continue to live in their house on the front section. Are Mike and Megan carrying on a taxable activity? GST treatment Mike and Megan are likely to be carrying on a taxable activity. While the facts are similar to those in the previous example, the increased number of sections created is a notable distinction. Courts are much more likely to consider an activity to be continuous or regular if it involves making multiple supplies. There is some level of development work to meet Council requirements, and the scale, time, effort, and cost is higher than that in Example | Tauira 1. Together, this may be enough for the activity to be continuous or regular. However, this is a borderline case where a more detailed factual analysis would be required, as specific facts and details may affect whether a taxable activity exists. Example | Tauira 2 – Subdivision and small-scale development Jensen is a GST-registered sole trader who runs a business inspecting and repairing ventilation systems. Jensen’s house is leaky and requires substantial repairs and full re-cladding. He receives advice that it would be more cost-effective to demolish the existing house and re-build two townhouses on his land, so he can sell one to offset costs. Jensen arranges for the land to be subdivided and engages architects and contractors to design and construct the townhouses. Each is a two-storey, three-bedroom townhouse. After demolition and construction, Jensen moves into one townhouse and sells the other. Page 20 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 Is Jensen carrying on a taxable activity of subdivision? GST treatment Jensen’s subdivision activity is not a taxable activity for GST purposes. This is because it is not an activity carried on continuously or regularly. Only one new lot was created and sold. Therefore, even though the level of financial investment and development work for the units is fairly high compared to subdividing and selling a bare lot, the work involved is still part of a single one-off activity, and should not be broken down into individual steps. The level of activity is not so large as to make it continuous or regular despite this. Further, the cost and level of work involved in constructing the unit he later lives in is not relevant when considering whether the activity was one carried on continuously or regularly. While Jensen is GST registered, the subdivision activity was not an activity carried on in the course or furtherance of his taxable activity of ventilation maintenance. It was not done as part of his business and had no connection with it. Example | Tauira 2B – Subsequent sale of residence Jensen from Example | Tauira 2 lived in his new house for a few months before deciding to sell it to move to the United States to expand his business. Is the later sale of his house relevant when determining whether his subdivision project is a taxable activity? GST treatment No, the sale of Jensen’s house is not relevant when determining whether his subdivision project is a taxable activity. The subdivision, development, and building of Jensen’s house was not part of an activity involving, or intending to involve, the supply of goods for consideration. It was not until after the activity concluded that the intention to sell the house formed. If the intention to sell both houses formed earlier in the project, the work done on Jensen’s house after that point would need to be considered. There are many variables that could affect whether this would be enough to be a taxable activity, but the sale of two lots means more relevance would be placed on the level of activity than in Example | Tauira 2, where only one lot was sold. Page 21 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 Example | Tauira 3 – Subdivision and large development Manaia is not registered for GST. They inherited a run-down block of farmland from a relative years ago. After retiring, they take the opportunity to get the land in good working order, including renovating the farmhouse, with the intention of keeping some animals and running a lifestyle block. However, part-way through renovation, Manaia decides instead to move closer to their elderly mother who has fallen ill. While the exterior and roof still need work, the kitchen and bathroom have been completely upgraded and a dividing wall has been removed to make the living area open plan. Given the location of the land, Manaia, who has received several enquiries from developers, knows the land would be perfect for extending a new housing development in the area. Rather than selling the land to another developer, Manaia decides to subdivide the land and sell the lots directly to potential owner-occupiers looking to build. Manaia: arranges for a surveyor to prepare a site plan; obtains the necessary approvals from the local council; engages contractors to construct a new road and driveways, and to level parts of the terrain to enable foundations to be laid; and organises the installation of water and power infrastructure. The land is subdivided into six lots, one of which contains the partially renovated farmhouse. As Manaia is busy looking after their mother, work on the project continues on and off over three years. After new titles are issued, four of the new lots are sold but Manaia is unable to sell the others due to a recent downturn in the market. Is Manaia carrying on a taxable activity for GST purposes? GST treatment Yes, Manaia is carrying on a taxable activity of subdivision. While the level of development work is similar to that in Example | Tauira 1, the number of lots created is a distinguishing factor. As the subdivision involved the intention to supply six lots, it is very likely to be continuous or regular. The level of activity, the large scale, and corresponding cost, time and effort are relevant factors. Work on the final two lots is relevant even though they have not yet sold. Any renovation work on the farmhouse done after the intention to subdivide and sell arose is also relevant. Page 22 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 The length of time taken and the fact the work was done on-and-off does not mean the activity was not carried on continuously, as Manaia always intended to complete the project and it did not cease at any point. The activity was more than intermittent or occasional. Example | Tauira 4 – Part of existing taxable activity Loammi and Marissa are GST registered as a partnership with a taxable activity of residential property development. They buy dilapidated houses and renovate them to sell for a profit. When considering purchasing an old dwelling in Island Bay, Loammi realises that with the large backyard, she and Marissa could make a greater profit if they subdivided the land before sale. They purchase the property and begin work. Loammi and Marissa focus most of their time and money on renovating the existing dwelling, and do only the minimum required to get resource consent and approval from Wellington City Council for the subdivision. Once they obtain a certificate for the new lot, they manage to secure a quick sale, which helps them fund the remainder of the renovation work on the dwelling. Is the sale of the subdivided lot a taxable supply for GST purposes? GST treatment Yes, the sale of the subdivided lot is a taxable supply for GST purposes. Even though the level of work, effort, and cost involved in the subdivision was relatively low, and the subdivision and sale would not be a taxable activity on its own (ignoring the wider renovation project), the subdivision was done in the course or furtherance of Loammi and Marissa’s existing taxable activity of property development. Example | Tauira 5 – Regularly subdividing land Mario-Ken discovers he can make a good profit from subdividing beachfront land, as prices are getting cheaper due to coastal erosion and global warming. He buys a parcel of land, subdivides it in two, carrying out no development on the land beyond installing water and creating easements for stormwater discharge, and then sells the bare lots. Page 23 of 24 QB 24/04 | 21 June 2024 Mario-Ken makes a good profit from the sales, so he decides to buy another lot further down the coast and subdivides it for sale, using the profits from his last subdivision to help fund the purchase. A year later he finds a good price on the neighbouring lot and subdivides it into three, again doing little development work and selling the subdivided land. Is Mario-Ken carrying on a taxable activity? GST treatment Yes, Mario-Ken is carrying on a taxable activity. Even though the first subdivision would likely not be enough on its own to be a taxable activity, the repeating pattern of buying and subdividing land indicates the activity is one carried on regularly.

Qualifying foreign private annuity exemption from the Foreign Investment Fund regime
====================================================================================

QB (Feb 2001) clarifies the operation of the qualifying foreign annuity exemption from the Foreign Investment Fund regime.

### Section CG 15(2)(g), Income Tax Act 1994 - what constitutes an interest in a Foreign Investment Fund

A taxpayer has asked for clarification of the operation of the qualifying foreign private annuity ("QFPA") exemption in section CG 15(2)(g).  In particular, she has asked at what point the test for a QFPA is to be applied.  This query was raised in the context of Example 2 of Part 2, and Example 9 of Part 5, of the Appendix to _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 8, No 5 (September 1996) which contains a description of the QFPA rules. 

Section CG 15(2)(g) states:

An interest held by a person in a foreign entity **at any time** during an income year shall not be treated as an interest in a foreign investment fund -  
...

7.  If, subject to subsections (3) and (4), **at the time**, the interest is a **qualifying foreign private annuity**. (Emphasis added)

Section OB 1 defines the qualifying foreign private annuity in part as follows:

"Qualifying foreign private annuity" means an entitlement of a natural person to benefit from a pension or annuity provided by a foreign entity while the person is resident in New Zealand, if-

1.  The consideration for the entitlement to the pension or annuity is provided to the foreign entity-

1.  At a time when the person is not resident in New Zealand; or
2.  At a time when the person is resident in New Zealand falling before the first day of the 4th income year succeeding the income year in which the person last becomes a resident of New Zealand; or
3.  From the accumulated balance or proceeds of an interest of the person in a superannuation fund and that interest is commuted or transferred in anticipation of, or following, the person ceasing to be a resident of New Zealand; and ...

To be a QFPA within the definition of that term in section OB 1, a pension or annuity must meet certain criteria.  One requirement is that the consideration for the QFPA must be provided "at a time when the person is resident in New Zealand falling before the first day of the 4th income year succeeding the income year in which the person last becomes a resident of New Zealand". 

 The exemption in section CG 15(2)(g) uses the words "at the time", indicating that it is the QFPA status at a particular time that is important.  The taxpayer has asked if, when a breach occurs, this means that:

*   the annuity was never a QFPA at any time; or

*   it fails to be a QFPA only from the time of the breach.

Example 2 in the above mentioned _Tax Information Bulletin_ implies that if taxpayers breach the above criterion they will be said never to have met the QFPA definition, and will therefore have been subject to the foreign investment fund ("FIF") regime from the point when they last became resident in New Zealand.  

The test is whether the consideration is paid before the first day of the 4th income year after the taxpayer becomes resident in New Zealand.  There are two possible interpretations of the Act as to the consequences of this requirement.  One is to say that if the time limit is breached, the taxpayer has failed to meet the definition from the beginning of the grace period, i.e. from the point when the person last became resident.  In that case a breach would mean that the FIF interest was never a QFPA. 

The alternative interpretation is to say that the definition may be met up until the beginning of the income year in which the time limit requirement is breached.  This would mean that the FIF interest ceases to be a QFPA when this particular criterion is not met.

The legislation is ambiguous as to when the test is to be applied.  In _CIR v Alcan New Zealand Ltd_  \[1994\] 3 NZLR 43 the Court of Appeal said that words in legislation must be given their ordinary meaning, but that if the meaning is unclear it is permissible to consider the purpose of the legislation, having regard to the total context of the words used while still being constrained by the actual words used in the section, in order to arrive at the meaning intended by the legislature.  This ensures that an anomalous interpretation is not favoured when two or more interpretations are available.  The Court also said that one should approach the question of statutory interpretation on the premise that the legislature will not have intended absurdity or injustice.  Therefore, it is worth considering the scheme and purpose behind the QFPA definition and section CG 15(2)(g) to see which of the two possible interpretations is to be preferred.

The QFPA exemption (relating to returning residents) may be compared with the "new resident exemption" in section CG 15(2)(f).  It is arguable that the two exemptions were intended by the legislature to parallel each other, and that accordingly the same result should be reached under both types of exemption.  The new resident exemption does not require that consideration be provided within any particular time period.  New residents with interests in foreign pension plans simply have 3 years before they must return FIF income.  The QFPA exemption was introduced some time after the new resident exemption.  It is not clear why the QFPA exemption imposes the time limit on consideration paid to foreign annuities while the new resident exemption does not.  However, it is strongly arguable that Parliament did not intend returning residents to be treated more harshly than new residents. 

Also, interpreting the exemption so that taxpayers who breach fall outside the exemption from when they last became resident, would have practical consequences as taxpayers breaching the 4-year limit would have to amend their returns for the previous 4 years in order to comply with the FIF regime.  In addition to these compliance costs, potentially harsh interest and penalties may be imposed on taxpayers that breach the time limit but have not previously returned their FIF income.

It is considered that the correct interpretation of this exemption is that taxpayers who breach the consideration requirement are deemed to hold a FIF interest from the first day of the 4th income year from when they last became resident.  In other words, a FIF interest ceases to be a QFPA from the beginning of the income year in which the time limit requirement is breached.  

This means that in Example 2 in Part 2 of the Appendix to _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 8, No 5 (September 1996) (pages 4-5) the taxpayer's interest in her foreign superannuation scheme would cease to be a QFPA from the 1 April 2001 (the fourth income year), as Mrs P (the taxpayer in that example) continues to make contributions after this date.  The definition of a QFPA would be met for the period from 11 July 1997 (the date that she returned to New Zealand) until 31 March 2001.

It should be noted that although a QFPA is not taxable under the FIF regime, distributions may still be taxable under other provisions of the Act.

Qualifying trust and corpus
===========================

2008 case note – Section BD 1 (2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 includes reference to section 242 (c) of the 1976 Income Tax Act - qualifying trust, corpus.

Case

TRA decision 05/08

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994(TAA), Income Tax Acts 1976 and 1994

### Summary

Section BD 1 (2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 includes reference to section 242 (c) of the 1976 Income Tax Act.

### Facts

A family trust was set up in 1985 by four children for the benefit of their parents. They each granted a sum of money of US$99,750 to the trust which they termed as an interest free loan. The sole trustee of the trust, one of the children, resided in the United States. The other three children resided in New Zealand.

On 16 January 2004 the death of the children's widowed mother meant the assets of the trust were vested in equal shares in each of the four children. The vesting was treated as repayment of the loans.

It was accepted by the parties that the vesting attracted income tax liabilities for the three children residing in New Zealand and that the amount of tax depended on whether the trust was a "qualifying trust" or a "non-qualifying trust".

### Decision

#### Qualifying trust

The issue of the qualifying trust, in this case, turns on the question of whether the provision excludes foreign-sourced income and non-residence, namely section BD 1(2) \[as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996\] in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 which picks up the former definition of a qualifying trust in section 242 (c) of the Income Tax Act 1976. If this applies, then the trust is looked at from 1985 to determine whether it is subject to New Zealand income tax in its life time. On the other hand if it does not, the trust is looked at from 1997 and section HH 4(3A) in the 1996 Act \[as in section 228 (3) of the 1988 Act\] becomes relevant as it deems foreign-sourced income of a non-resident trustee subject to New Zealand income tax if there is a resident settlor.

The Authority held that BD 1 (2) referred to section 242 (c) because section YB5 (4) of the 1994 Act permitted reference to it. This was held to be permissible in this case notwithstanding that section YB 5 (4) did not cover certain income periods of the trust in the legislative scheme of looking back at the life of the trust.

That being the case, it was held that the trust was not subject to New Zealand income tax from 1986 to March 1988 and therefore it was not a qualifying trust.

#### Corpus

In the context of taxable distribution of the trust, the corpus is a value excluded in its calculation. The definition of corpus means "an amount equal to the market value at the date of settlement of any property".

It was accepted by both parties and was held by the Authority that there were multiple settlements on a yearly basis because of the interest-free nature of the loan.

The taxpayers' method of valuing the corpus was to treat the loan like a commercial loan attracting compound interest on a quarterly basis. At the end of 2004 they estimated the corpus to be $4,048,919. The Commissioner's approach was to take the original amount of the loan in 1985 and to treat the foregone interest of the amount for each year as settled to the trust. He estimated the corpus to be $1,414,174.

The Authority agreed with the taxpayers' methodology but could not accept their figure and invited parties to negotiate or make further submissions.

Queenstown Airport’s eastern runway safety area found not to be depreciable under the Income Tax Act 2007
=========================================================================================================

2016 case note – High Court confirmed CIR's view that eastern runway and safety area not depreciable - schedule 13, airport runways, hardstanding, roads.

Case

Queenstown Airport Corporation Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2016\] NZHC 1299

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2007

### Summary 

The Court dismissed Queenstown Airport Corporation Limited's tax challenge and confirmed the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") view that the eastern runway and safety area ("East RESA") was not depreciable. 

### Impact 

The decision provides useful commentary on the parameters of the items listed in sch 13, specifically airport runways, hardstandings, and roads. It confirms that unless a runway and safety area ("RESA") can satisfy one of the existing criteria in sch 13, it will not be depreciable under sch 13. Permanent embankments will be considered land and so not depreciable.

### Facts

In April 1998 the International Civil Aviation Organisation set as a new standard the creation of a minimum 90 metre RESA at the end of airport runways used for international flights. That standard was implemented in November 1999, and adopted into New Zealand law in October 2006.

In order to provide an East RESA of the Queenstown Airport runway, where there was a steep drop-off down to the Kawerau/Shotover River delta 45 metres below, the plaintiff constructed an engineered fill embankment out from the existing cliff at a cost in excess of $8.5 million.

The plaintiff filed its income tax returns for the 2012 and 2013 income years on a conservative basis, namely the plaintiff did not claim depreciation deductions for the East RESA. Instead, the plaintiff issued Notices of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPAs") proposing to amend its 2012 and 2013 returns to include amounts of depreciation deduction. The amounts claimed by the plaintiff were as follows:

On the basis that the East RESA is a runway (the published depreciation rate being 4% on a straight line value basis (SL)):

1.  $417,078.34 for the 2012 income year; and
2.  $419,062.66 for the 2013 income year.

Alternatively, on the basis that the East RESA is hardstanding or road (the published depreciation rate being 3% SL):

3.  $312,808.75 for the 2012 income year; and
4.  $314,062.66 for the 2013 income year.

The Commissioner notified the plaintiff that she rejected the plaintiff's NOPAs.

### Decision

His Honour noted that by the end of the hearing it appeared that the plaintiff did not contest whether the embankment and the East RESA constituted land. His Honour found it nevertheless desirable to note the Commissioner's argument and his view on it.

His Honour held there was an air of unreality in characterising the very large amount of compacted engineered fill as either a chattel or a fixture. Instead, applying the principles in _Elitestone Ltd v Morris_ \[1997\] 2 All ER 513 he was satisfied that the degree and purpose of the annexation of the embankment, comprised of compacted engineered fill, to the 45m bluff at the end of the runway strip plainly indicate that the embankment (and the East RESA atop it) became part and parcel of the plaintiff's land.

His Honour was unable to accept that, beyond the ambit of the individual listed items themselves, sch 13 has a penumbra of meaning such that a land improvement could qualify as depreciable property even though it did not in fact come within any one of the 18 listed items purposively construed. It is not sufficient for such a land improvement to be "similar to" or "consistent with" (say) reservoirs, dams, bridges and tunnels. If a land improvement does not actually come within one of those specified depreciable land improvements it is not open to a taxpayer to contend that, by analogy with some listed items, the land improvement falls within the general purview of sch 13, and it is not the function of the Court to recognise additional new items in sch 13.

_Is the East RESA within the term "airport runways"?_

His Honour inferred that in selecting the phrase "airport runway" for inclusion in sch 13, the legislature was intending to identify runways comprising paved areas constructed in such a manner as to safely cater for the landing and take-off of the kind of aircraft engaged in the delivery of passenger and cargo services. A RESA could only fall within the phrase "airport runway" as used in sch 13 if the RESA was constructed to the standard required for an airport runway. The East RESA is not so constructed, and so His Honour concluded that the East RESA does not come within the phrase "airport runways" in sch 13 and is not thereby excised from the ambit of "land" in s EE7(a).

_Is the embankment within the term "airport runways"?_

His Honour found that even if the East RESA itself, which lies atop the embankment, qualified as one of the specified depreciable land improvements in respect of airport runways (and likewise hardstanding and roads), the underlying embankment, which was constructed to enable the East RESA to be provided, is captured by the "land" exclusion and not encompassed by the specified depreciable land improvement.

_Is the East RESA within the term "hardstanding"?_

His Honour accepted the Commissioner's submission that hardstanding refers to an area that has been paved or surfaced with material that is both strong and hard. While the subgrade of the embankment was compacted, it is not hardstanding. The fact that RESAs are designed so that jet aircraft will sink into their surface is inconsistent with their being categorised as hardstanding. Further, if a RESA was to be used for parking aircraft or other vehicles, other than for emergency use, it might reasonably be expected to have a hard surface. However, parking is not permitted in the RESA.

_Is the East RESA within the term "roads"?_

His Honour found that the function of the East RESA was not as a road, save to the extent that it is used as a service access road. Depreciation could only be claimed to the extent of the formed access road.

_Might the East RESA reasonably be expected to decline in value?_

So far as the relevant "identifiable asset" was concerned, his Honour did not accept that the identifiable asset comprised the entirety of the plaintiff's runway system. In his Honour's view the identifiable asset is no more extensive than the embankment and the East RESA.

Any damage to the East RESA is most likely to occur only in the rare event of an aircraft undershooting or overrunning the runway. Even then it is to be expected that only a small portion of the top layer of the embankment would be damaged. The evidence was that such damage could be repaired by grading and resowing grass, which is minor work similar to regular maintenance. His Honour concluded that the plaintiff had not established that the East RESA and the embankment are property that, in normal circumstances, might reasonably be expected to decline in value while they are used or available for use.

His Honour dismissed the challenge and found the RESA was not a depreciable asset.

R&D tax credit eligible R&D activity guidance: March 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Legislation: (1) Core research and development activity— (a) means an activity that— (i) is conducted using a systematic approach; and (ii) has a material purpose of creating new knowledge, or new or improved processes, services, or goods; and (iii) has a material purpose of resolving scientific or technological uncertainty; but (b) does not include an activity, if knowledge required to resolve the uncertainty, described in paragraph (a)(iii), is— (i) publicly available: (ii) deducible by a competent professional in the relevant scientific or technological field; ... What this document does The R&D tax credit is intended to support and increase the amount of R&D being performed in NZ by providing a 15% tax credit on eligible activities and expenditure to reduce the cost of doing R&D. R&D has a specific statutory definition for the purposes of tax credit which is not the same as the commercial, engineering or accounting definitions. The tax credit is not just for scientific research but also for development activity that meets the eligibility criteria. This document introduces core R&D activities. If you have core R&D activities, you may also receive the tax credit for supporting R&D activities which are referenced later in the guidance. What R&D activities are eligible? An R&D activity is eligible for the tax credit if its purpose is to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty, unless the knowledge required to resolve the uncertainty is publicly available, or deducible by a competent professional in the relevant field. To be eligible, an R&D activity must also be conducted using a systematic approach, and have the main purpose of creating new knowledge, or new or improved processes, services, or goods. Where this is happening, the business has “core R&D activities”. Core R&D activities should encompass all the activities in your planned approach which collectively serve to resolve the scientific or technological uncertainty – it could include a number of different sub-activities. This document provides guidance on what these concepts mean and how to interpret them to determine whether an R&D activity is eligible for the tax credit. R&D tax credit eligible R&D activity guidance: March 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] To enable this, it is first necessary to understand what science and technology are. What is science? Science is the systematic study of the nature and behaviour of the physical and material universe. Work in the arts, humanities and social sciences, including economics, is not science for the purpose of the tax credit. Mathematics is the language of all sciences and can be both a science and method of applying the science. What is technology? Technology is the practical application of scientific principles and knowledge, where ‘scientific’ is based on the definition of science above. Examples of technology include the application of: • Physics in engineering, product development and manufacturing process improvement • Chemistry and biology in medical or food industries • Computer science in information technology including software development, software engineering and hardware development Resolving scientific or technological uncertainty Scientific or technological uncertainty exists when knowledge of whether something is scientifically possible or technologically feasible, or how to achieve it in practice, is not publicly available or deducible by a competent professional working in the field. Scientific or technological uncertainty includes the following: — A problem of a scientific or technological nature, whether an objective is scientifically or technologically possible or how it can be achieved. — An uncertainty of a scientific or technological nature using the adaptation of knowledge or capability: — within the same field of science or technology; or — from another field of science or technology. — Where limitations in the current state of technology hinder the development of a new or improved capability. — A technological constraint that needs to be overcome, uncertainty arising in relation to: — Whether the output will meet desired specifications such as response time, reliability or cost; or — How the desired specifications can be achieved amongst possible alternative methodologies or solutions. R&D tax credit eligible R&D activity guidance: March 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] — The use of known processes, technologies and methodologies where the result or outcome is unknown. — system uncertainty, wherein the components of a system and their interactions are known, but the outcome/result of the system cannot be deduced from the outset. — Technological uncertainty may also arise where something has already been shown to be possible but needs further work to make the technology more cost-effective, reliable or reproducible. An uncertainty may be encountered during the course of ordinary work. For example, ordinary design and prototyping for the purpose of product development may encounter an unanticipated technological uncertainty. In this case, a systematic approach to resolve the identified technological uncertainty may be eligible, but the ordinary work that preceded this is not. In product development, there will be times when a solution needs to meet commercial constraints. Commercial constraints do not themselves create scientific or technological uncertainty, but trying to meet them might. For example, commercial constraints may require that technologically uncertain paths be attempted, although proven alternatives exist. Even if the resolution of the scientific or technological uncertainty sought by an activity is not achieved or not fully realised, R&D may still take place. Activities that are on the list of excluded core R&D activities are not eligible for the tax credit. Qualifying your Scientific or technological uncertainty When considering the benchmark of a scientific or technological uncertainty you must consider whether the knowledge required to resolve the uncertainty is publicly available, or deducible by a competent professional in the relevant field. The ‘knowledge required to resolve the uncertainty’ essentially means the solution to the problem. If this knowledge is publicly available or deducible by a competent professional in the relevant field, then this is not an eligible scientific or technological uncertainty. Publicly available Knowledge that resolves the uncertainty is considered publicly available if it is reasonably accessible.. This may include knowledge published in professional journals, on the internet, or in published patents. Reasonably accessible does not mean the knowledge must be available for free. Knowledge that is reasonably accessible on commercial terms is considered publicly available. Some knowledge may not be reasonably accessible through commercial means. For example, knowledge may be disclosed in a granted patent, but cannot be licenced from the patent owner on reasonable terms. Deducible by a competent professional in the relevant field The competent professional is a hypothetical person with ordinary knowledge and experience in the relevant scientific or technological field. The competent R&D tax credit eligible R&D activity guidance: March 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] professional possesses relevant skills and experience and/or relevant qualifications, and understands common practices for solving common problems in the field. ‘Deducible by a competent professional’ means that a competent professional, faced with the scientific or technological uncertainty in question, could resolve the uncertainty without undertaking a systematic course of investigation. They do not have to be able to resolve the uncertainty off the top of their head, but can use their knowledge and abilities to resolve the uncertainty without undertaking a systematic course of investigation. Conversely, an uncertainty is considered not deducible by a competent professional if the competent professional would need to undertake a systematic course of investigation to resolve the uncertainty (having identified the scientific or technological uncertainty). The competent professional may be confident they can resolve the uncertainty, and may even see a number of options to do so, however the question is not one of confidence. The question is whether they can in fact resolve the uncertainty without undertaking a systematic course of investigation. Systematic approach A systematic approach involves a planned, logical investigation to solve the problem. A systematic approach can be flexible and adaptive, changing in response to results, but the approach remains logical and focused on solving the problem. Random or unplanned trial and error is not a systematic approach, regardless of whether this produced something useful. An accidental discovery is not disqualified from meeting this test provided it was produced while undertaking a systematic approach. Purpose of creating new knowledge, or new or improved processes, services, or goods This test is intended to identify “why” you are undertaking your R&D activities. The R&D must have a material (important or significant) purpose of seeking to create new knowledge, or to create new or improved processes, services or goods. New or improved processes, services or goods are created when something is changed or adapted to the point where it is “better” than the original. Supporting R&D activity If you have core R&D activity there may be related activities which, although do not meet the definition of core R&D activity are directly related to it and are required for the conduct of the core R&D activity. These activities are known as “supporting R&D activities”. Supporting R&D activities may be eligible for the tax credit. R&D tax credit eligible R&D activity guidance: March 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Supporting activities must only be performed for the relevant core activity or must have supporting the core activity as its main purpose. Activities that are on the list of excluded supporting R&D activities are not eligible for the tax credit and can be found at ird.govt.nz/research-and-development/tax- incentive/eligibility/eligible-activities/ineligible-activities

R&D tax credits and imputation accounts (sections OB 4(3)(eb), OB 7C, OK 2(3)(cb), OK 4B, OP 5(2)(bb), OP 7(3)(fb) and OP 11B
=============================================================================================================================

Research and development tax credits in relation to imputation credit accounts or a Maori authority credit account – how to claim the credit and examples.

In other jurisdictions, such as Australia, tax credits to companies are "clawed back" when paid out as dividends. The New Zealand credit has been designed to reduce such "clawback".

If an entity has an imputation credit account or a Maori authority credit account, an R&D tax credit will lead to a credit to that account. A refund of R&D tax credit (including a transfer of surplus credit) will lead to a debit. The net result is that the entity receives an imputation credit for the income tax liability satisfied byway of the credit.

The credit is equal to the amount of the R&D tax credit (sections OB 7C, OK 4B and OP 11B), and the debit is equal to the amount of the refund (or transfer). The credit arises on the day the relevant income tax return is received by Inland Revenue.

##### Examples: Tax credit leads to credits and debits to imputation credit account

1.  Company A receives a tax credit of $10,000 for expenditure incurred in its 2008-09 income year, reducing its tax-to-pay to $100,000. Company A's income tax return for the 2008-09 year is received by Inland Revenue on 1 June 2009. On 1 June 2009, there is a credit to A's imputation credit account of $10,000.
2.  Company B receives a tax credit of $10,000 for expenditure incurred in its 2008-09 income year, pushing it from tax-to-pay of $5,000 to a tax refund of $5,000. Company B's income tax return for the 2008-09 year is received by Inland Revenue on 1 March 2010. B receives a cash refund of $5,000, being the amount of the surplus refundable tax credit, on 1 April 2010. On 1 March 2010, there is a credit to B's imputation credit account of $10,000. On 1 April 2010, there is a debit to B's imputation credit account of $5,000.

To prevent more than one imputation credit arising because of an R&D tax credit, there is no credit for income tax paid by an R&D tax credit (sections OB 4(3)(eb), OK 2(3)(cb) and OP 7(3)(fb)). In addition, where a consolidated imputation group has a credit to its imputation credit account for an R&D tax credit, the same credit does not arise in the accounts of any of the members of the group (section OP 5(2)(bb)).

**Claiming the credit**

Businesses will claim the tax credit in an income tax return. The claimant will work out the liability for tax in the normal way, and then subtract the amount of the credit. If the amount of the credit exceeds the tax liability the balance is used to reduce other tax liabilities, or is refundable in cash.

The credit will reduce residual income tax, which will reduce provisional tax liability, allowing taxpayers to receive the benefit of the credit closer to the time the related eligible expenditure is incurred. This reduction will be immediate for people who estimate provisional tax, but delayed for people who use the "uplift" method for calculating provisional tax.

To be eligible for the credit, the claimant must provide - in addition to the income tax return - a detailed statement of R&D activities and expenditure, containing essential information for administrative purposes, by a due date.

##### Example: Claiming the tax credit

In 2010, Company A has assessable income of $200,000 and allowable deductions of $170,000, $100,000 of which is eligible expenditure on R&D. A claims an R&D tax credit of $15,000 and files a detailed statement by the due date.

#### Requirement for a detailed supporting statement (section LH 2(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 68D and 68E of the Tax Administration Act 1994

A business claiming a tax credit in an income tax return is required to file electronically a detailed supporting statement. The detailed statement contains essential information to be used for audit, forecasting, statistical and evaluation purposes.

If a business is a member of an internal software development group, the detailed statement must be filed by a nominated member of the group on behalf of all group members.

A partnership may elect to file the detailed statement, in relation to the partnership's R&D activities, on behalf of all the partners, for convenience.[**17**](#17)
 A partnership which elects to file a statement on behalf of all the partners, and does internal software development, is not an internal software development group merely because it makes this election. Alternatively, if the partnership does not make this election, partners must separately file their own detailed statements, including their share of the partnership's eligible expenses and tax credit.

The statement must be filed by the due date. If a statement is filed late, there will be no tax credit for the year and there could be use-of-money-interest and penalties to pay.[**18**](#18)

Because businesses and their agents need sufficient time to prepare the statement, the statement is never required to be filed before the due date for the associated income tax return.

The due date for the detailed statement for an individual is 30 days after the due date for the business's income tax return (including any extensions of time). The due date for an internal software development group is 30 days after the latest income tax return due date of any of the group's members. The due date for a partnership which elects to file a statement for all the members of the partnership is 30 days after the latest income tax return due date of any of the partners.

##### Example: Due date for filing a detailed statement

A's income year runs from 1 April to 31 March. B and C have income years which run from 1 November to 31 October. A, B and C are members of an internal software development group and have amounts eligible for a tax credit. B and C have a tax agent who is granted an extension of time, until 31 March 2020, to file B and C's 2018-19 income tax returns. A's internal accountant files its income tax return.

A must file its 2018-19 income tax return by 7 July 2019. B and C have until 31 March 2020. The group's detailed statement must therefore be furnished by 30 April 2020

It is possible that a business will be required to file (or have filed on its behalf by a group or partnership) more than one detailed statement for an income year.

**Special rules for 2008-09 and 2009-10 years**

In the early years of the R&D tax credit, it is recognised that some businesses will still be coming to grips with the requirements of the new rules. Some additional flexibility has been provided for businesses which do not initially file a claim for an R&D tax credit, enabling them in some cases to file their detailed statements at a later date.

In the 2008-09 and 2009-10 years, if a business has not claimed an amount of R&D tax credit in the relevant income tax return, the due date for the detailed statement for an individual is two years after the due date for the income tax return. If none of the members of an internal software development group have claimed an amount of R&D tax credit in the relevant income tax returns, the due date for the group's detailed statement is two years after the latest due date for filing an income tax return for any of the group members. If none of the partners in a partnership electing to file a detailed statement on behalf of all partners has claimed an amount of R&D tax credit in the relevant income tax returns, the due date for the partnership's detailed statement is two years after the latest due date for filing an income tax statement of any of the partners.

If a business (or any member of an internal software development group or any partner) has claimed an amount of R&D tax credit in the relevant income tax return, the special rules for 2008-09 and 2009-10 do not apply. A detailed statement must be filed by the normal due dates.

**Provisional tax (section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 - definition of residual income tax)**

The R&D tax credit reduces residual income tax. Taxpayers therefore have the option of reducing their provisional tax payments in anticipation of an R&D credit at the end of the year.

##### Example: Estimating provisional tax, including a tax credit

Company A expects to have a tax liability of $100,000 for the 2008-09 income year (before credits). A also expects to receive a credit of $40,000, so estimates its residual income tax to be $60,000. A furnishes this estimate to Inland Revenue and thereby elects to use the estimated provisional tax method. On each provisional tax instalment date, A pays provisional tax payments of $20,000.

**17** This ability to elect is being reviewed and may be removed in a future tax bill.

**18** There may be an exception in one situation: when a group return is filed on time but is incorrect because of a simple oversight, the Commissioner has discretion to grant an extension of time to file a corrected version. This exception was created to avoid the situation in which a group accidentally omits a member from its group return, causing the other members of the group to lose entitlement to their credits. It is not intended that the exception would be used in other situations.
