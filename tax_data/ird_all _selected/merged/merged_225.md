IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 3 New Legislation Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Bill The Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Bill was introduced into Parliament in November 1998 and passed in May 1999. The main feature of the new legislation is its reform of the accrual rules in the Income Tax Act 1994. Also included are improvements to the binding rulings system, and a wide range of other amendments. The latter include changes that clarify the law or reinforce its policy intent, revenue protection measures, and remedial legislative amendments. Enactment of the legislation has resulted in amendments primarily to the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, and the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992. Minor amendments have been made to the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968, Income Tax Act 1976, Taxation (Simplification and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1998, and Taxation (Tax Credits, Trading Stock, and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1998. The bill was divided into the following Acts: Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 - 99/59 Student Loan Scheme Amendment (No.5) Act - 99/60. The new legislation is described in detail in this Tax Information Bulletin. THE TAXATION OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS Subpart EH Introduction The accrual rules in Subpart EH of the Income Tax Act 1994, which govern the taxation of financial arrangements, have been reformed. These amendments give effect to some of the changes outlined in the Government discussion document The Taxation of Financial Arrangements, released in December 1997. The aim of the changes is to resolve problems, anomalies and inadequacies in the rules that have been identified over recent years. The basic policy objectives underlying the rules have not changed. Most of the amendments are aimed at simplification and clarification of the law. They should improve the administration and application of the accrual rules and make them more workable. Background Before the accrual rules were introduced, in 1986, the law permitted taxpayers to defer, or effectively eliminate, their income tax liabilities by bringing forward deductions or deferring income. This was a major threat to the integrity of the tax base. The main purpose of the accrual rules is to standardise the timing of income and expenditure associated with financial arrangements. This provides a better measure of income, reducing economic distortions and opportunities for tax avoidance. The rules that were introduced were consistent with accrual methods used in financial markets and, where appropriate, reflected accounting treatment. The introduction of the accrual rules was foreshadowed in the Minister of Finance’s Budget speech of 31 July 1986. Since the announcement the rules have been subject to several consultative processes. The first, on the introduction of the accrual rules, began with the release of the Government’s Consultative Document on Accrual Tax Treatment of Income and Expenditure in October 1986. The consultative document contains the basic scheme of the present accrual rules. However, the consultative committee appointed by the Government was concerned that it would be easy to avoid the basic scheme of the accrual rules by using non-traditional debt instruments. As such, the committee widened the scope of the original scheme proposed in the consultative document to include a wider range of commercial dealings. In the early 1990s, the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (the Valabh Committee) reviewed the operation of the accrual rules and pointed to a number of areas that need further review. Some of the issues raised by the Valabh Committee were examined in a recent discussion document, The Taxation of Financial Arrangements, published in December 1997. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 4 The discussion document recognised that although the policy objectives of the accrual rules are sound, the rules are complex and in some cases difficult to apply. The discussion document thus outlined proposals for the simplification of the accrual rules and clarifying areas of uncertainties in the operation of the accrual rules. Most of these proposals have been incorporated in the legislation. Key features The main amendments clarify the boundaries of the accrual rules and simplify the operation of the rules. The definition of “financial arrangement”, which governs the type of arrangements that are within the accrual rules, has been clarified, and the list of “excepted financial arrangements”, which excludes certain arrangements from the rules, has been expanded. The holder/issuer distinction has been removed. The old accruals rules distinguish between holders (usually lenders) and issuers (usually borrowers). This distinction is arbitrary for some financial arrangements and thus encourages taxpayers to structure their transactions to take advantage of the concessions provided to the holders under the old rules. The removal of the holder/issuer distinction has in turn led to a number of major changes: The base price adjustment has been standardised and the allowable deduction available under the base price adjustment to holders of financial arrangements has been removed. The cash basis concession has been extended to all parties to financial arrangements, and the thresholds under which the cash basis rules apply have been raised. The debt remission rules remain in place. “Debt parking” rules and rules for remissions amongst members of consolidated groups have been introduced to close down avoidance opportunities. The treatment of assignments of income and defeasances of debt has been clarified. The tax treatment of trade credits and agreements for the sale and purchase of property has been rationalised. Even though trade credits and agreements for the sale and purchase of property are similar types of financial arrangements, they were treated differently under the old rules. Furthermore, agreements for the sale and purchase of services were not within the scope of the accrual rules. These inconsistencies have been removed, thus simplifying the tax treatment of these types of financial arrangements. The exception for debts forgiven in consideration of natural love and affection to trusts set up primarily to benefit family members and charities has been clarified. Leases with financing characteristics have been brought within the accrual rules. A transfer of a financial arrangement is now deemed to occur on the death of a party to a financial arrangement and on the distribution of the arrangement to a beneficiary under a will or on intestacy. A base price adjustment is carried out for the deceased person’s financial arrangements (not for the other party to the financial arrangement). The disclosure requirements have been repealed. Application date The new accrual rules generally apply only to financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999 (the date of enactment). Financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 are still subject to the accruals rules in place before the enactment of this latest legislation. The accrual rules are now set out in two divisions. The old accruals rules, contained in Division 1, apply to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999. Definitions unique to the operation of the old accruals rules, such as “core acquisition price”, “holder”, and “issuer”, have been moved to section EH 14. The amended accrual rules are set out in Division 2, inserted after section EH 18, and contain the amended accrual rules. These rules generally apply to financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999. Special application dates Although the majority of the new rules apply only to financial arrangements entered into from the date of enactment, there are several exceptions to the general application date. The following additions to the list of excepted financial arrangements apply from the income year beginning 1 April 1985, when the accrual rules came into effect, unless a taxpayer has taken a contrary position in tax returns already filed: providing on-demand loans interest free and denominated in New Zealand dollars; IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 5 employment contracts; interests in group investment funds; interests in joint ventures; interests in partnerships; travellers cheques; and warranties over goods or services. Hire purchases of livestock or bloodstock have been added to the definition of “excepted financial arrangement” from 1 April 1993. Earlier legislation had made hire purchase agreements entered into after 1 April 1993 subject to the accruals rules, but the treatment of hire purchases of livestock and bloodstock was unclear. This amendment clarifies that hire purchases of livestock or bloodstock are outside the scope of the accruals rules. Other exceptions to the general application date relate to transfers of debts at a substantial discount to an associate of the debtor, and the disclosure requirements. These amendments apply from 20 May 1999, regardless of when taxpayers entered into the financial arrangements. Detailed analysis DIVISION 1 Subpart EH contains the provisions relating to the taxation of financial arrangements. The Subpart has been broken down into two divisions. Division 1 contains the current accrual rules that have been re- enacted with minor modifications to reflect the new legislative style. These modifications include subsection headings and a list of defined terms at the end of each section. The rules are self-contained and apply to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999. A number of changes have been introduced to ensure that the rules in Division 1 are self-contained. Terms that are not used in Division 2 (such as “acquisition price” and “qualified accruals rules”) continue to be relevant in Division 1. These terms have been moved from section OB 1 to section EH 14. Provisions that relate only to the current accrual rules, such as sections OB 7 and GD 11, have also been moved into Division 1 (sections EH 15 and EH 16 respectively). Minor remedial amendments Two remedial amendments have been made. Section EH 3(7)(a) refers to “trustee income or beneficiary income under the trust rules and sections HI 1 to HI 5”. Sections HI 1 to HI 5 deal with Maori Authorities. The “and” between “trust rules” and “sections HI 1 to HI 5” has been replaced with “or”. The section is meant to exclude trusts, as well as Maori Authorities, from the cash basis concession. Therefore the two provisions should not be inter-related. Section EH 4(6)(a)(ii) applies if a person is released from an obligation to make a payment under a financial arrangement by operation of any of the Inland Revenue Acts. The purpose of the section is to ensure no remission income arises. Section EH 4(6)(a)(iii) applies if a person is released from an obligation to make a payment under a social assistance suspensory loan. There was an “and” between these subparagraphs. The provision in subparagraph (ii) has application beyond debts associated with loans from the Government for social assistance purposes. The two provisions are not, therefore, related. The “and” has been replaced with an “or”. Thresholds Under section EH 1(3), if a person is a holder or issuer of financial arrangements, and the total value of those financial arrangements does not exceed $1,500,000, the person may use the straight line method to allocate income or expenditure to income years. This threshold has been increased from $1,000,000. Under section EH 3, if a person’s gross income from financial arrangements does not exceed $70,000 or the total value of financial arrangements does not exceed $600,000 and the deferral test in section EH 3(1)(b) is not breached, the person is a cash basis person. Following the latest amendments, in determining whether these thresholds have been breached a person must take into account financial arrangements to which Division 2 applies. Natural love and affection The “natural love and affection” rules have been amended to deal with uncertainty in the legislation. These amendments apply to both Division 1 and Division 2 financial arrangements and are contained in sections EH 5 and EH 53 respectively. Section EH 5 applies to debts forgiven in consideration of natural love and affection from 20 May 1999. The exception applies if a natural person forgives a debt to a trust that is established primarily to benefit natural persons for whom the creditor has “natural love and affection”, or charities (qualifying beneficiaries). This test requires an examination of the trust deed and all the circumstances surrounding the establishment of the trust in order to ascertain whether a particular trust qualifies under the exception. A discretionary trust, or a trust with a power of appointment, does not automatically fail to qualify under the exemption. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 6 In addition, given that the policy underlying the “natural love and affection” exception is to exempt genuine gifts, the ambit of the exception has been specifically widened to include charities. The provisions recognise that debt forgiven to trusts that have charities as beneficiaries are as much gifts as debt forgiven to trusts that have family beneficiaries. The trustee is taxed on any distribution to a non- qualifying beneficiary to the extent that the distribution is equal to or less than the debt forgiven to the trust. Future distributions to such beneficiaries are taxed to the extent that debt forgiven to the trust has not already been taken into account in calculating taxable distributions under these provisions. This ensures that an amount equal to the debt forgiven to the trust is taxed if it is ever distributed to a non-qualifying beneficiary. Transfer of financial arrangement to associate of the debtor A new section EH 7 has been inserted into Division 1 to reflect the debt parking rules. This section contains the provision relating to the transfer of a debt at a substantial discount to an associate of the debtor. This provision applies to transfers of debts on or after 20 May 1999 regardless of when the financial arrangement is entered into. The provision applies if the debt is sold to a person associated with the debtor for 80% or less of the market value of the debt. Section EH 7(6) deems a new interest-free loan to have been extended by the associate to the debtor for the amount paid for the debt. Consolidated groups Previously, debts remitted between members of a consolidated group did not normally result in income for a debtor because the consolidation rules treat a group of companies comprehensively as one economic entity and one taxpayer. However, because this treatment of remission income was a concession to the general remission rules, the consolidation rules could be used to avoid the remission provision. An amendment has been made to section HB 2(1)(a) to prevent taxpayers using the consolidation rules to avoid remission income. Amounts remitted amongst members of a consolidated group are exempt from remission income only if the financial arrangement was held by members of the same group at all times during the term of the arrangement. This amendment applies to events or transfers that occur on or after 20 May 1999 irrespective of when the arrangement was entered into. Definition of excepted financial arrangement Additions have been made to the definition of “excepted financial arrangement” in Division 1. These additions have been backdated, and they clarify the original intent of the rules and bring the law into line with the existing practice of both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. Under section EH 13, taxpayers can elect to treat some excepted financial arrangements as financial arrangements if they entered into them between the date their last return of income was filed and the enactment of this legislation (20 May 1999). For example, a taxpayer who filed her 1997-98 tax return on 7 June 1998 and then entered into an employment contract before 20 May 1999 may elect to treat the employment contract as a financial arrangement, although the legislation adds employment contracts to the definition of excepted financial arrangement from 1986. This election is aimed at ensuring business decisions entered into on the basis of the legislation at that time are not compromised by the amendment. A person elects to treat the excepted financial arrangement as a financial arrangement by returning the income derived and the expenditure incurred from the elected financial arrangements under the accruals rules in Division 1 in their return of income. Transitional adjustment Division 1 applies to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999. Taxpayers have the option of electing to move all financial arrangements onto the new rules. They will perform the transitional adjustment and include the resulting income or expenditure in their return for the year of election (section EH 17). However, if the arrangement is not subject to the accrual rules in Division 2, because, for example, it is a small variable principal debt instrument, section EH 17(9) requires the taxpayer to treat the arrangement as transferred at market value. The taxpayer must, therefore, do a base price adjustment under Division 1. Once a taxpayer has elected to apply the accrual rules in Division 2 to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 (those to which the accruals rules in Division 1 would normally apply) there is no provision for the taxpayer to revoke that election and apply the accrual rules in Division 1. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 7 Therefore, when the financial arrangement matures or is sold, for example, the base price adjustment in Division 2 (section EH 47) would be performed. Terminology in other provisions of the Act References in other provisions of the Act have been changed to reflect the new terms used in Division 2 of Subpart EH. For example, references to “holder” and “issuer” have generally been changed to “party”, and references to “acquisition price” changed to “consideration”. If consequential amendments are made, section EH 18 ensures that the amended provisions apply, in respect of a financial arrangement entered into before the date of enactment, as though the consequential amendments had not been made. For example, section CE 1(1)(c) has been amended by this legislation. If a person is a holder or an issuer of a Division 1 financial arrangement, section CE 1(1)(c) should be read as it was before the amendment. If, at a later date, it is necessary to amend a provision of the Income Tax Act outside of Subpart EH, section EH 18 will need to be amended for Division 1 financial arrangements in a manner similar to that set out in section EH 18(2) and (3). That is, an exception is created and the legislation then describes how the exception applies to Division 1 financial arrangements. DIVISION 2 Rewrite style As well as implementing policy changes, the accrual rules in Division 2 have been rewritten in “plain language” and are set out in the drafting style being used to rewrite the Income Tax Act. The new drafting style minimises complexity, repetition and the use of redundant words. Wherever possible, the accrual rules adopt words that are commonly used. To assist readers, descriptive subsection headings have been included and a list of terms used in the section and defined in section OB 1 have been included at the end of each section. Flowcharts and readers’ notes have also been included in the legislation, although they are interpretational aids only. Amounts arising under the accrual rules are treated as income derived or expenditure incurred. The term “income derived” is used in the accrual rules to refer to income arising from applying the spreading methods (including by way of a transitional adjustment calculation under section EH 17 or section EH 44), the cash basis adjustment or the base price adjustment. Section CE 1(1)(c) includes the “income derived under the accrual rules” in gross income. Scope of the accrual rules Purpose provision A purpose provision (section EH 20) has been included at the beginning of the new accrual rules. The provision aims to assist taxpayers and other users of the legislation to understand the general intent of the accrual rules, which is to allocate a fair and reasonable amount of income or expenditure from a financial arrangement over its term and so prevent deferring income and advancing expenditure. The purpose provision guides taxpayers in choosing a spreading method in situations where the accrual rules do not prescribe one. Under those circumstances, taxpayers are required to use a method in accordance with the purpose provision. The provision may also assist in the resolution of any unforeseen ambiguities. When do the accrual rules apply? The accrual rules apply to every arrangement that is a financial arrangement as defined under the accrual rules. No major changes have been made to the rules governing the persons to whom the accrual rules apply. The only exceptions to this are certain arrangements that are explicitly excluded from the operation of the rules (excepted financial arrangements). Figure 1, which has been included in the legislation, also illustrates that there are circumstances under which a person who is a party to a financial arrangement (not being an excepted financial arrangement) need not comply fully with the accrual rules. These are the circumstances if the person is a cash basis person. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 8 FIGURE 1: WHETHER THE ACCRUAL RULES AND THE SPREADING PROVISIONS APPLY Is there a financial arrangement? The definition of financial arrangement in section EH 22 is satisfied; and the arrangement is not an excepted financial arrangement as a financial arrangement under section EH 25; and you do not or cannot elect to treat the excepted financial arrangement as a financial arrangement under section EH 25. Ignore the accrual rules. Do the accrual rules apply to you? See section EH 21. Calculate your BPA under section EH 47. Is this the income year that you must calculate you base price adjustment (BPA)? See sections EH 45 and EH 46. Are you a cash basis person? See sections EH 27 to EH 30. Did you apply a spreading method to your financial arrangement in the immediately preceding income year? Were you a cash basis person in the immediately preceding income year? You must make a cash basis adjustment under section EH 32. You do not need to use a spreading method. You must apply one to the spreading methods. See sections EH 34 to EH 37. YES YES NO YES NO YES NO NO YES NO NO This flowchart illustrates the process a person should follow to determine whether the accrual rules and the spreading methods apply. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 9 Definition of “financial arrangement” Definitions are generally found in section OB 1. However, the definitions of “financial arrangement”, “excepted financial arrangement” and “consideration” have been moved into Subpart EH because they are fundamental to the application of the accrual rules. Section EH 22 defines “financial arrangement”. The definition sets the outer boundary of the accrual rules. It is cast in wide terms to include debt instruments, debt substitutes and derivatives. A wide definition is necessary because of the range of financial instruments and derivatives available in the marketplace, many of which are substitutable for debt. The definition has been redrafted, however, to improve its clarity and to make some minor amendments relating to terminology. Debts created by operation of law have been included within the definition of “financial arrangement”. This change is intended to clarify that a financial arrangement can be created without agreement between the parties to the financial arrangement. Elements of a financial arrangement The definition “financial arrangement” contains five important elements, all of which must be present for an arrangement to be a financial arrangement. A financial arrangement is: 1.an arrangement, whereby 2.a person receives money in consideration for 3.a person providing money 4.to any person 5.at a future time or contingent upon an event. An arrangement satisfies the definition if it satisfies all these criteria. For example, an agreement for the sale and purchase of property with deferred settlement is a financial arrangement because it is an arrangement whereby the purchaser receives money (the property) in consideration for the purchaser providing money (instalment payments for the property) to the vendor at a future time. On the other hand, an instantaneous sale or purchase of property is not a financial arrangement because the fifth element (the futurity) is absent. Subparagraph (iii) of the old definition of “financial arrangement” includes a specific list of arrangements, such as sell-back and buy-back agreements and debt defeasances and assignments of income. The inclusion of a specific list bypasses the tests set out in the definition of financial arrangement. This subparagraph has been excluded from the new definition because arrangements that fall within the scope of the subparagraph are already within the scope of the general definition. The bracketed words “that may include a debt or debt instrument or an excepted financial arrangement” in section EH 22(1)(b) imply that a financial arrangement may consist of more than one arrangement. The notion of a composite financial arrangement and the tax treatment of composites are dealt with in section EH 23 (and discussed in more detail below). Assignments and defeasances Section OB 1 defines “legal defeasance” as: a defeasance in which the release of a party to the financial arrangement from the primary obligation of the financial arrangement is either: (a)acknowledged formally by the creditor; or (b)acknowledged formally by a duly appointed trustee or agent of the creditor; or (c)established by legal judgement. Section EH 22(2) excludes from the definition of “financial arrangement” partial or complete legal defeasances and absolute assignments, not only of financial arrangements but also of excepted financial arrangements. An absolute assignment or legal defeasance merely terminates existing rights or obligations for the assignor or the defeasor. Therefore this type of arrangement does not create new financial arrangements for those parties to the arrangement, although the exclusion does not prevent the assignee or defeasance counter party from becoming a party to a financial arrangement. Nor do the specific exclusions affect arrangements other than absolute assignments and legal defeasances. Whether these other arrangements, such as in-substance defeasances, are subject to the accrual rules depends on whether they satisfy the tests set out in the general definition of financial arrangement. Section EH 22(3) is a specific exception to subsection (2). Under subsection (3), if some or all of the consideration for the assignment or defeasance is deferred the assignment or defeasance is subject to the accrual rules. For example, the original debtor (the defeasor) could enter into a defeasance agreement with a counter party to defease the debtor’s obligations, but the agreement may provide for a settlement of the defeasance agreement at a later date. If the creditor duly acknowledges the release of the debtor (defeasor) from obligations under the original debt, the defeasance becomes a legal defeasance but with a deferred settlement. A defeasance arrangement with deferred settlement possesses all the characteristics of a financial arrangement. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 10 Composite financial arrangements A consequence of the broad definition of “financial arrangement” is that groups of inter-related financial arrangements, which may not be financial arrangements separately, may fall within the definition. Inter-related arrangements are those in which there is a degree of interdependency between the transactions. It is therefore appropriate that they be covered by the rules if they have the same effect as debt instruments or debt substitutes. The Court has noted, in CIR v Dewavrin Segard (NZ) Ltd, that two or more arrangements will be treated as a composite arrangement only if they are inter-dependent. In considering whether a wool contract and its related foreign currency hedge are part of a composite arrangement, Gault J commented that: In our view, even assuming the matching of wool contracts and hedging foreign exchange contracts, the argument is unconvincing. The wool purchaser is not a party to the foreign exchange contract and likely will not even know of it. The bank is not a party to a wool contract. The consideration in each contract moves to and from a party that has no connection with the other contract so there is no interaction or interdependence. This implies that for two or more arrangements to be taken as part of a composite arrangement there must be some inter-dependence, not only in terms of the parties involved in the arrangements but also in terms of the consideration passing under each arrangement. Section EH 2 of the old accruals rules deal with the calculation of income or expenditure in respect of composite financial arrangements. The provision requires that when a composite financial arrangement includes an excepted financial arrangement the amounts “solely attributable” to the excepted financial arrangement are excluded from the accrual rules. Income or expenditure is generally “solely attributable” to an excepted financial arrangement if it could have been expected to arise, or be incurred, without the support of the wider financial arrangement. The words “solely attributable” should not be interpreted strictly. If a gain or loss is attributable to an excepted financial arrangement, it is “solely attributable” unless that gain or loss was also attributable to a financial arrangement. A gain or loss which is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement remains solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangement even if a non- excepted financial arrangement (such as a loan) was a necessary precondition for that gain or loss to be derived or incurred. Using an example from Glazebrook and Oliver 1 , A lends money to B, in consideration for which B subscribes for shares in C. B pays interest to A under the loan and receives dividends from the shares in C. Under the accrual rules, the financial arrangement consisted only of the loan between A and B, the shares in C being attributable to an excepted financial arrangement. The shares subscription and all benefits flowing from it (including the dividends) are “solely attributable” to the excepted financial arrangement and thus are not taken into account in the accrual calculation. There may, however, be other arrangements (such as a buy-back agreement) that can give rise to items which are attributable to those arrangements and therefore not “solely attributable” to an excepted financial arrangement. For example, assume that A sells shares to B for $100 and A agrees to buy them back in one year’s time for $120. The $20 gain to B (and the $20 loss to A) could be said to be attributable to the shares (an excepted financial arrangement). However, that gain (or loss) was secured not by any change in share value but by the agreement to sell at a certain price and repurchase at another, higher price. The gain (or loss) was thus also attributable to the initial buy and sell agreement, which is a financial arrangement. Thus the gain (or loss) is not “solely attributable” to an excepted financial arrangement and should be included in the accrual calculation. The discussion document The Taxation of Financial Arrangements, proposed that the operation of section EH 2 be clarified. Submissions on the discussion document expressed concern, however, that the proposed clarification would create a new concept and add uncertainties to the existing provision. For this reason the proposed amendment was withdrawn and the provision has been re- enacted as section EH 23 with only two minor changes. The “solely attributable” rule has been amended so that it does not apply to arrangements that are excepted financial arrangements for compliance cost reasons only. In other words, these excepted financial arrangements are outside the accrual rules on their own but when used within a wider financial arrangement they are subject to the accrual rules. Those excepted financial arrangements are small variable principle debt instruments, short-term agreements for sales and purchase of property or services, short-term options, private or domestic purpose options over property, private or domestic purpose agreements for sales and purchase of property or services, private or domestic foreign currency loans to cash basis debtors, small prepayments for goods and services and travellers’ cheques. 1 Susan Glazebrook and Robin Oliver The New Zealand Accrual Regime—a practical guide (CCH, Auckland, 1989) 54 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 11 An amendment has also been made to ensure the “lowest price” concession 2 for agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services does not apply if it is part of a wider financial arrangement. A wider financial arrangement containing a group of inter-related arrangements cannot be properly characterised as an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services (even though some of the constituent arrangements may be). Therefore the lowest price concession should not apply. This amendment has been achieved in the definition of “consideration” in section EH 48(4). domestic purpose it should be subject to the accrual rules. Section EH 24(3) provides for this by treating the arrangement as being issued for an arm’s length price at the time the arrangement ceases to be applied for a private or domestic purpose. A number of changes have also been made to the list of excepted financial arrangements to rationalise the tax treatment of trade credits and agreements for the sale and purchase of property. Short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services are also excluded from the accrual rules for compliance cost reasons. Under the new accrual rules the measurement periods for short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services and short-term options have also been rationalised. Under Division 2 the definition of “excepted financial arrangement” excludes leases other than finance leases. A new set of rules has been introduced from 20 May 1999 under which leases with financing characteristics (finance leases) are within the scope of the accrual rules. It is therefore necessary to exclude operating leases (leases that are not finance leases) from the scope of the accrual rules. Election to treat excepted financial arrangements as financial arrangements Under the old accruals rules, taxpayers can elect to treat certain classes of short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property as financial arrangements. Under the new accrual rules, the option to elect has been extended to prepayments for property or services of less than $50,000, short-term options, travellers’ cheques and variable principal debt instruments of less than $50,000 (section EH 25). Nevertheless, unlike the election for short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services which can be made for classes of short-term agreements (section EH 25(3)), when electing to treat the excepted financial arrangements listed above as financial arrangements the election must be made in respect of all such financial arrangements. For example, a taxpayer who has interests in several short-term options and several travellers’ cheques wishes to treat the travellers’ cheques as financial arrangements. The taxpayer can elect to treat all travellers’ cheques as financial arrangements and continue to treat the short-term options as excepted financial arrangements. A taxpayer elects by returning the income or expenditure in respect of the arrangement on an accrual basis in the income year that the election is made (section EH 25(4)). Under Division 1 the 2 The “lowest price” provision in the definition of “consideration” ensures that increase in the value of property that are the subject of the agreements for the sale and purchase of property, for example, are not included as interest income under the accrual rules. Definition of excepted financial arrangement A consequence of the wide definition of “financial arrangement” is that it is necessary to exclude some types of arrangements from the rules. Although these arrangements are prima facie within the definition of “financial arrangement”, they are excluded because of the need to maintain the debt/ equity boundary, for compliance cost reasons or because some transactions are subject to other rules set out in the Income Tax Act 1994. Section EH 24 lists these “excepted financial arrangements”. The list of excepted financial arrangements has been expanded to better reflect the original policy intention of the accrual rules and for compliance cost reasons. It has been made clear that interests in group investment funds, partnerships and joint ventures, employment contracts, warranties over goods or services, interest-free loans and hire purchase agreements for livestock and bloodstock are not arrangements that are subject to the accrual rules. The list of excepted financial arrangements has also been extended to cover small prepayments, small variable principal debt instruments, travellers’ cheques, private or domestic foreign exchange borrowings by a cash basis person and private or domestic agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services. These arrangements have been excluded for compliance cost reasons. Three types of arrangements have been excluded from the accrual rules if the arrangements were entered into for a private or domestic purpose: loans in foreign currency for the borrower if the borrower is a cash basis person and uses the loan for a private or domestic purpose; an option to acquire, sell, or dispose of property, other than an interest in a financial arrangement for a person who becomes a party to the option for a private or a domestic purpose only; and a private or domestic agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services. If the arrangement ceases to be used for a private or IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 12 election is made by giving notice to the Commissioner. This requirement has been omitted from Division 2 in order to reduce compliance costs. The election can only be revoked, however, by giving notice to the Commissioner (section EH 25(6)). Once notice has been given the revocation applies to excepted financial arrangements entered into in the year following the income year in which notice is given. Relationship between accrual rules and other provisions in the Act Section EH 10 governs the relationship between the accruals rules and the rest of the Income Tax Act 1994. It is not clear, however, how the accruals rules relate to the rest of the Act under that provision. Section EH 26 of the new accrual rules clarifies that the accrual rules determine the amount and the timing of income and expenditure relating to financial arrangements, while the core provisions of the Act determine the assessability or deductibility of income or expenditure. Nor is it clear whether section EH 10(1) under the old accruals rules precludes the transfer pricing provisions from applying. Under the new accrual rules it has been made clear in section EH 48(1) that the transfer pricing rules (sections GD 13(3) and GD 13(4)) are intended to have overriding effect to determine the amount of consideration paid or received in applicable cross-border financial arrangements. Cash basis concession Under the old accruals rules, if a natural person is a holder of financial arrangements and if the value of those financial arrangements falls under the thresholds, the person is given a partial exemption from the accrual rules for compliance cost reasons. This concession allows the person to calculate income from financial arrangements on a cash basis rather than applying one of the spreading methods under the accrual rules. The person is still required to perform a base price adjustment when the financial arrangements are sold or mature. Under the old rules, a cash basis concession is available only to holders of financial arrangements. With the removal of the holder/issuer distinction, under the new accrual rules the cash basis concession has been extended to all parties to a financial arrangement who are natural persons (sections EH 27 to EH 32). Thresholds The three thresholds for the cash basis concession have been amended to reflect the extension of the concession to any person who is a party to a financial arrangement. The concession is available to a natural person if the person meets the deferral threshold and at least one of the following thresholds: if in that income year the absolute value of the person’s income or expenditure, calculated under the accrual rules, from the financial arrangements is less than $100,000, or on every day in the income year the absolute value of each of the person’s financial arrangements added together have a total value of not more than $1,000,000. “Absolute value” is defined in section OB 13. 3 Example A person is a party to two financial arrangements. Using the yield to maturity method, the income from one financial arrangement is $50,000 and the expenditure from the other financial arrangement is $20,000. The absolute value of the person’s income and expenditure is $70,000. The income and expenditure threshold is not breached. If the deferral threshold is not breached the person will be a cash basis person. Another person also has two financial arrangements. Using the straight line method, the income from one arrangement is $60,000 and the expenditure from the other financial arrangement is $50,000. The absolute value of the person’s income and expenditure is $110,000. The income and expenditure threshold is breached. Deferral test If a person satisfies one or both of these tests, to qualify as a cash basis person the person must also meet the deferral threshold (section EH 27(2)). A breach of the deferral test occurs if the person creates a deferral of income or an acceleration of expenditure of $40,000 or more in aggregate. The deferral test has been retained because of concerns over the deferral of income and the acceleration of expenditure. The threshold has been increased from $20,000 under the old accruals rules to $40,000 under the new accrual rules. The formula in section EH 27(4) sets out how the amount deferred is calculated. It compares the income calculated under the accrual rules with the income calculated on a cash basis, and the expenditure 3 “Absolute value”, in sections CG 11(5) and EH 27(1) means the value irrespective of whether the value’s sign is positive or negative IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 13 calculated on a cash basis with the expenditure calculated on an accrual basis. The calculation is made for all financial arrangements to which the person is a party at the end of the income year. The amount of deferral for each financial arrangement is calculated from the date the person becomes a party to the financial arrangement until the end of the income year in which the person seeks the cash basis concession. If the deferral across all financial arrangements is more than $40,000 the threshold is breached. In determining whether any of the cash basis person thresholds have been breached the financial arrangements to which Division 1 applies must be taken into account. Other aspects of the cash basis concession remain largely the same even though the concession has been amended to reflect the removal of the holder/ issuer distinction. Special cash basis rules Persons can be cash basis persons if they satisfy the thresholds described earlier. Nevertheless, the legislation provides for circumstances where the value of financial arrangements and expenditure incurred and income derived under the financial arrangements may be disregarded in determining whether a person qualifies for the cash basis concession. These special rules relate to circumstances where the person is a trustee (section EH 28), a trustee of a deceased cash basis person’s estate (section EH 29) or a partner in a partnership (section EH 30). The special rules have remained largely the same. Changes have been made to take into account the rewrite style and to provide for the removal of the holder/issuer distinction. Election to apply the spreading rules Under the old accruals rules, cash basis holders cannot elect to apply a spreading method. Under the new accrual rules, section EH 31 provides that cash basis persons may elect to use a spreading method to calculate income or expenditure in respect of the financial arrangements to which they are a party. A cash basis person cannot, however, elect to apply a spreading method to a financial arrangement in the year the person is required, under section EH 45, to perform a base price adjustment. The election must be made for all financial arrangements the person is a party to at the time of the election and any financial arrangements entered into in subsequent years. The person must continue to use the spreading method for those financial arrangements until the financial arrangements mature. There is no provision for the election to be revoked. In the year a cash basis adjustment is performed the resulting income or expenditure for each financial arrangement from that adjustment is returned in that year. If a person becomes a cash basis person, in that year the person can elect to use a spreading method by continuing to apply the spreading method and no cash basis adjustment is required. Becoming or ceasing to be a cash basis person Becoming a cash basis person, or ceasing to be one, requires a cash basis adjustment, as set out in section EH 32. Taxpayers must make an adjustment for all financial arrangements to which they are a party, apart from those arrangements that are already subject to the new method. For example, if a person was a cash basis person and breached one of the thresholds, the person is required to perform a cash basis adjustment for all financial arrangements apart from those that were already subject to one of the spreading methods. The adjustment compares the income or expenditure that would have resulted had the new method been applied from the time the person became a party to the financial arrangement, with the income or expenditure that did result from using the old method. The result of the cash basis adjustment is the person’s income or expenditure from the financial arrangement in that year. Base price adjustment The base price adjustment is a “wash-up” calculation that is performed when a financial arrangement is sold, matures, is remitted or transferred. The old accruals rules contain a separate base price adjustment for cash basis holders. Under the new accrual rules the new base price adjustment, in section EH 47, applies to both accrual and cash basis taxpayers. Core accrual rules Spreading methods If a person is required to comply with the accrual rules, the purpose provision (section EH 20) requires the person to allocate a fair and reasonable amount of income or expenditure to each income year over the term of the financial arrangement. The only exception is in the income year in which the base price adjustment calculation is required (section EH 33(1)). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 14 To determine the amount to be allocated, section EH 33(2) requires a person to take into account: all consideration paid or to be paid to or by the person for the financial arrangement; an amount remitted or to be remitted by the person or by law under the financial arrangement; and an amount that would have been payable to the person if it had not been remitted by law. The amount to be allocated at the beginning of the term of the financial arrangement is the expected income or expenditure for the financial arrangement. The wording in section EH 33(2) is consistent with the wording of base price adjustment, to ensure that these are comparable amounts. The main spreading methods are set out in sections EH 34 to EH 40. The flowchart in Figure 2 has been included in the legislation to illustrate the process that should be followed to determine which spreading method to use. FIGURE 2: WHICH SPREADING METHOD TO USE This flowchart illustrates the process a person should follow to determine which spreading method to use. Spreading Methods You may use either method, outlined in Box A and Box B if you satisfy the legislative criteria. Otherwise, you must apply section EH 34. Can you use the straight line method under section EH 35? (SL) You must use YTM or you may use an alternative under section EH 35 You may use SL Can you use the market valuation method under section EH 36? (MV) YES You may use MV Can you use the yield to maturity method under section EH 34 (YTM) NO NO YES YESNO Is there a determination? You must use a determination under section EH 38(1), or an alternative under section EH 38(2). Do you meet the criteria of section EH 39? Do you meet the criteria of section EH 40? You must use a method that complies with section EH 39. You should apply to the Commissioner for a determination under section 90AC of the TAA. You must use a method that complies with section EH 40. YESNO YESNO YESNO AB IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 15 Yield to maturity Under section EH 34(1), the primary method of spreading income or expenditure under a financial arrangement is the yield to maturity method (YTM). While YTM is not defined in the legislation, Determination G3 sets out how YTM is applied to financial arrangements, and Determination G1 sets out how the resulting income or expenditure is allocated to income years. The power of the Commissioner to issue determinations under the new accrual rules is set out in section 90AC of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Until new determinations are issued under this section, however, all the existing determinations issued under section 90, or under sections 64B to 64M of the Income Tax Act 1976, continue to apply in principle to all financial arrangements subject to the new accrual rules. YTM can be applied to a financial arrangement only if expected cash flows and payment dates for the financial arrangement are certain. Examples of circumstances where YTM cannot be applied are for financial arrangements with variable rates and when terms and conditions of a financial arrangement are varied. Section EH 34(2) provides that a person may use an alternative method to YTM if the method: has regard to the principles of accrual accounting, and conforms with commercially acceptable practice, and is consistently applied by the person to the same or similar financial arrangements for financial reporting purposes (unless section EH 42 applies), and results in allocated amounts that are not materially different from those that would have been allocated using YTM. Materiality is discussed in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 3, No. 1 July 1991. Method prescribed by determination If YTM cannot be applied to a financial arrangement the Commissioner can issue a determination setting out the appropriate accrual method. Section EH 38(1) deals with determination methods and section EH 38(2) with alternatives available to taxpayers. This type of determination is binding on the taxpayer. For example, Determination G26 provides for a method of spreading income or expenditure under a variable rate financial arrangement. This determination was issued under section 90 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 because YTM could not be applied to this type of financial arrangements. Under the new accrual rules, Determination G26 will be applied, in principle, as if it has been issued under section 90AC until a new determination is issued under section 90AC(1)(d). Under section EH 38(2) a person may use an alternative method to the method prescribed by the Commissioner in a determination if the method: has regard to the principles of accrual accounting, conforms with commercially acceptable practice, is consistently applied by the person to the same or similar financial arrangements for financial reporting purposes (unless section EH 42 applies), and results in allocated amounts that are not materially different from those that would be allocated using the method prescribed in the determination. In the absence of a determination If YTM cannot be applied, and there is no relevant determination, section EH 39 requires a person to apply a method that: conforms with commercially acceptable practice, results in an amount being allocated to each income year in accordance with the purpose provision, and is consistently applied by the person to the same or similar financial arrangements for financial reporting purposes. The last requirement implies that this method is applicable only if the person prepares financial accounts and reports the income or expenditure in relation to financial arrangements for financial reporting purposes. Default method Submissions on proposals in the discussion document The Taxation of Financial Arrangements pointed out that a person who does not comply with the requirements in section EH 39 will have no relevant spreading method and will need to apply to the Commissioner for a specific method of spreading. To alleviate the compliance cost concerns, a specific default method has been provided (section EH 40). A person who does not prepare financial accounts or who does not include income or expenditure of certain financial arrangements for financial reporting purposes has to use a method to calculate income or expenditure for tax purposes that conforms with commercially acceptable practice. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 16 The method must also allocate a fair and reasonable amount to each income year over the term of the financial arrangement in accordance with the purpose of the accrual rules. However, if a person uses different methods to account for income or expenditure under the same or similar financial arrangements for financial reporting purposes, section EH 39 may not be applicable. The new default method also does not apply because being a person that prepares financial accounts, the person does not satisfy the requirements of section EH 40. It is therefore necessary to apply to the Commissioner because, in the absence of a prescribed method, it is important that only one method is used for tax purposes to determine income or expenditure for the same or similar financial arrangements. Because there are no accounting standards on the method of determining income or expenditure, it is possible that several methods could be used to account for the same or similar financial arrangements for financial reporting purposes, and not all of those methods are acceptable for tax purposes. Straight line method Instead of applying YTM a person may apply a straight line method under section EH 35. The straight line method is available to a person who is a party to a small parcel of financial arrangements and is aimed at reducing compliance costs. The straight line method can be used if the person is a party to financial arrangements that have a total value of $1,500,000 or less. In determining whether the value of financial arrangements is $1,500,000 or less a person must take into account all financial arrangements to which Division 1 applies (section EH 35(5)). The straight line method spreads the income or expenditure under a financial arrangement on a straight line basis over the term of a financial arrangement. Market valuation method Under section EH 36, a person who has a business that includes dealing in financial arrangements may apply the market valuation method of accrual for the financial arrangements in which the person deals. From a policy perspective, it is necessary to restrict the availability of the market valuation method because of the need to limit bad debt deductions. Under the market valuation method, any decrease in market prices (including that attributable to decrease in credit worthiness) is recognised as expenditure. A decrease in credit worthiness, however, is generally not recognised as expenditure under the bad debt deduction rules, except for dealers. Under the new accrual rules, it has been clarified (by using the word “includes”) that a person who runs a business and has to buy and sell financial arrangements as part of that business may apply the market valuation method. A person who is a party to forward contracts for foreign exchange, futures and exchange-traded option may also apply the market valuation method of accrual to those financial arrangements. These financial arrangements do not have any principal values, so the question of a bad debt deduction is not a consideration for them. Under the old accruals rules, the market valuation method can only be used if Inland Revenue has approved a market in that instrument. This requirement has been relaxed so that the market valuation method may also be used if taxpayers can show that the market value used is reliable. The objective criteria that should be considered in determining whether markets are reliable include, but are not limited to, the following: the number of participants in the market or having access to the market; the frequency of trading in the market; the existence of an appropriate regulatory body; the existence of industry standards regulating trading practices; and the accessibility of sources of information to market participants. Because the over-riding requirement is that taxpayers must show that the market value used is reliable, the absence of some of these factors does not necessarily mean that market valuation method could not be adopted. Taxpayers can also use information from a related market if there is an inadequate, or no, direct market in the instrument. Taxpayers who adopt the market valuation method are required to maintain records to show the reliability of the market from which the valuation is obtained (section 22A(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). Consistency requirements and change of spreading method Taxpayers must use a method of calculating income or expenditure consistently for the same or similar financial arrangements. Taxpayers are generally required to apply the same spreading method to a financial arrangement for its entire term (section EH 41). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 17 Section EH 42 contains an exception to the general rules that the same spreading method be applied consistently to the same or similar financial arrangements. Under section EH 43, taxpayers are able to change method only if there is a good commercial reason for doing so. Those who change methods are required by section 22A(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to keep a record of the reason for the change. Taxpayers changing methods must do a transitional adjustment, under section EH 44, in the year of change. Changing methods is not permitted, however, if the financial arrangement is subject to either the market valuation or the straight line method. Those methods must be applied to financial arrangements consistently until the financial arrangement is subject to the base price adjustment. Base price adjustment The base price adjustment is a “wash-up” calculation that is generally performed when a financial arrangement is sold, matures, is remitted or transferred. Timing of the base price adjustment Section EH 45 sets out the events that require a base price adjustment. In addition to the sale, transfer, maturity or remission of a financial arrangement, the new accrual rules set out special circumstances in which a base price adjustment is required. These circumstances include: a non-resident leaving the tax base; a debtor whose debt is sold to an associate at a discount; an in-kind, or in specie, distribution of a financial arrangement by a company in liquidation; and for an assignor or defeasor, an absolute assignment or legal defeasance of a debt. Dispositions on the death of a taxpayer Under the old accruals rules, there is uncertainty as to if and when a base price adjustment should be done on the death of a party to a financial arrangement. The new accrual rules (section EH 45(5)) ensure that a transfer of a financial arrangement necessitating a base price adjustment occur: on the death of a party to a financial arrangement; and on the distribution of a financial arrangement to a beneficiary under a will or on intestacy. Exceptions from performing a base price adjustment Taxpayers are required to carry out a base price adjustment when they cease to be New Zealand residents. To ease compliance burdens on them, temporary residents who are cash basis persons are excluded from the requirement to perform a base price adjustment if they become non-resident for tax purposes within three years. The time limit test for this exemption is aligned with the test for temporary residents in the foreign investment fund rules. That is, a resident who becomes a non-resident is exempt from the base price adjustment upon departure if the person leaves on or before the first day of the fourth income year succeeding the income year in which the person initially obtain tax residence. This relief applies only to financial arrangements to which they were a party before first becoming a New Zealand resident (section EH 46(1)). Section EH 4(9)(d) of the old accruals rules requires persons who become non-resident to carry out a base price adjustment for any financial arrangement to which they are a party. This also applies if they continue to carry on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment. In the new accrual rules a base price adjustment is not necessary if a New Zealand resident becomes non-resident and the financial arrangement relates to a business carried on by the person through a fixed establishment in New Zealand (section EH 46(2)). Under subsection EH 46(3) taxpayers who are a party to a debt that has been legally defeased, and are not the defeasor, do not have to carry out a base price adjustment. This is because their rights to receive payments under the financial arrangement defeased have not been terminated. Only the party that is obliged to make the payments has changed. A legal defeasance may be used to renegotiate the terms of a debt because the original debtor is unable to meet the obligation. Under this situation, there is more than just a change in the party that is obliged to make the payment even from the perspective of the creditor. The original debt has been terminated and there is a new debt between the creditor and the new debtor. It is thus necessary to restrict the exemption from the base price adjustment to legal defeasances if the only change is the party that will meet the existing obligations under the financial arrangement. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 18 Base price adjustment formula The amendments to the base price adjustment in section EH 47 and the new definition of “consideration” in section EH 48 are intended to standardise and simplify the base price adjustment calculation. The old accruals rules contain a separate base price adjustment for cash basis holders. Under the new accrual rules, the base price adjustment applies to both accrual and cash basis taxpayers because the holder/issuer distinction has been removed. Other policy changes reflected in the amended base price adjustment calculation include: the inclusion of amounts remitted by operation of law in the variable “amounts remitted”; and amendments to allow for the effect of debt parking arrangements. The new base price adjustment formula is: consideration — income + expenditure + amounts remitted where - considerationis the consideration paid or payable to the person less the consideration paid or payable by the person; income is(a) the income derived by the person from the financial arrangement in previous income years, and (b) dividends within the meaning of section CF 2(1)(b) or section CF 2(1)(k), and (c) gross income derived under section DC 2(1); expenditureis expenditure incurred by the person under the financial arrangement in previous income years; amounts remittedis an amount that is not included in the consideration paid or payable to the person, because it has been remitted (a) by the person, or (b) by law. Example A commercial property is sold for $1,500,000 under a sale and purchase agreement, subject to certain planning consents being obtained. A deposit of $150,000 is paid on 20 December 1999, when the agreement is entered into. The balance of $1,350,000 is payable in two equal instalments due 3 and 6 months after the date of possession. Under the agreement, possession passes to the purchaser on the date the sale becomes unconditional; the purchaser has no other prior rights. On 3 March 2000 the planning consents are obtained and the sale becomes unconditional. The purchaser’s balance date is 31 March. For the purpose of recognising the expenditure incurred in the 1999 and 2000 income year of this agreement for the sale and purchase of property, the taxpayer may apply Determination G17B. By applying that Determination, the taxpayer will determine the value of the property passing under the agreement. The value of the property is determined, on the basis of discounted cash flows, to be $1,435,999. This is part of the “consideration” of the agreement for the sale and purchase of property. The other form of consideration is the cash payment of $1,500,000. Determination G17B, in turn, relies on Determination G3 (alternatively, G11A could be used) and Determination G1A to allocate an amount of expenditure to the 1999 income year. The expenditure allocated to the 1999 income year in accordance with those Determinations is $12,916. On the maturity of the financial arrangement, in the 2000 income year, a base price adjustment is calculated. The base price adjustment formula is: consideration — income + expenditure + amounts remitted where - consideration= the consideration paid to the person less the consideration paid by the person = (the present value of the property transferred to the person) less (the cash payment made by the person) = $1,435,999 - $1,500,000 = –$64,001 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 19 income= (the income derived by the person from the financial arrangement in previous income years), and (dividends within the meaning of section CF 2(1)(b) or section CF 2(1)(k)) and (gross income derived under section DC 2(1)) =0 expenditure= expenditure incurred in previous income years = $12,916 amounts remitted = an amount not included in the consideration paid or payable to the person, because it has been remitted by the person, or by law. =0 The result of the base price adjustment is -$51,085. This amount is expenditure incurred in the 2000 income year. Assessability and deductibility of accrual income or expenditure The main amendment to the base price adjustment, with the removal of the holder/issuer distinction, is the removal of the automatic deduction (a deduction not subject to a nexus or business test) currently available to holders of financial arrangements if the result of the base price adjustment calculation is negative. This automatic deduction for holders has been removed because it: is consistent with the rewrite of the Income Tax Act 1994, which separates the timing rules from assessability and deduction provisions; means that both parties to a financial arrangement are treated in a manner consistent with the rest of the Act (that is, the person receiving the interest has to return it but the person paying the interest may or may not be able to deduct it); and reduces incentives on taxpayers to structure transactions to take advantage of the right to an automatic deduction. A negative result arising from the base price adjustment calculation is expenditure incurred and subject to the core deductibility tests. A positive amount is income derived. This continues to be treated as income under section CE 1(1)(c). Two additional tests have been introduced to overcome the unintended effects of the base price adjustment. If the outcome of the base price adjustment is negative (expenditure) and the amount arises because of an overstatement of income derived in previous income years, the amount is deductible regardless of the core deductibility tests. If the outcome of the base price adjustment is positive (income) and the amount arises because of expenditure incurred in prior years but the expenditure was not allowed as a deduction, the amount is not be treated as income under the base price adjustment. Definition of “consideration” Like the definitions of “financial arrangement” and “excepted financial arrangement”, the definition of “consideration” has been included in Subpart EH (section EH 48) because it is core to the operation of the accrual rules. The definition of “consideration” has been introduced to replace “acquisition price”, “core acquisition price” and “amount of all consideration”. The primary objective of this change is to simplify the calculation of amounts that are spread under the accrual rules (section EH 33) and to simplify base price adjustment. The definition of “consideration” has also incorporated a number of minor policy changes. These include: the extension of the consideration rules to cover finance leases; the exclusion of income or expenditure associated with non-contingent fees; the exclusion from the lowest price concession for an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services if that agreement is part of a wider financial arrangement; and the provision that market value is the appropriate consideration to be used in the accrual rules when a financial arrangement is transferred by way of distribution in specie or treated as being transferred on the death of a party to a financial arrangement and on the distribution of a financial arrangement to a beneficiary under a will or on intestacy. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 20 Forgiveness of debt The accrual rules treat debts that do not have to be repaid as income if they are forgiven. Forgiveness is a benefit to the person who is no longer required to discharge its obligations. The forgiveness of debt rules also act as a clawback for deductions previously taken by taxpayers. This legislation has now been made more robust to ensure that taxpayers cannot structure transactions to avoid recognising forgiveness of debt income. Natural love and affection The accrual rules treat debts that do not have to be repaid as income to the debtor. An exception is made, however, if a natural person forgives a debt in consideration of “natural love and affection”. If a debt is forgiven in these circumstances the amount forgiven is treated as if it had been paid for the purposes of the accrual rules, so is not assessable as income. This exception was previously contained in section EH 4(6). It was uncertain how this provision applied to debt that was forgiven by a creditor to a family trust in consideration of the creditor’s “natural love and affection” for the beneficiaries of the trust. In particular, it was not clear whether the creditor was required to have “natural love and affection” for all of the trust’s beneficiaries. This created uncertainty for: trusts where the trustee has the power to appoint beneficiaries for whom the creditor does not have “natural love and affection”, discretionary trusts with a class of discretionary beneficiaries amongst whom there is an entity for whom the creditor could not have “natural love and affection”, trusts that include a charity as a beneficiary. To address these uncertainties the “natural love and affection” rules have been amended. The amendments apply to Division 1 and Division 2 financial arrangements and are contained in sections EH 5 and EH 52 respectively. They provide that the “natural love and affection” exception applies if a natural person forgives a debt to a trust that is established primarily to benefit natural persons for whom the creditor has “natural love and affection” or charities (qualifying beneficiaries). This test requires an examination of the trust deed and all the circumstances surrounding the establishment of the trust in order to ascertain whether a particular trust qualifies under the exception. It ensures that a discretionary trust, or a trust with a power of appointment, will not automatically fail to qualify under the exemption. In addition, given that the policy underlying the “natural love and affection” exception is to exempt genuine gifts, the ambit of the exception has been specifically widened to include charities. The provisions recognise that debt forgiven to trusts that have charities as beneficiaries are as much gifts as debt forgiven to trusts that have family beneficiaries. The amendments also contain a rule that taxes the trustee on any distribution to a non-qualifying beneficiary to the extent that the distribution is equal to or less than the debt forgiven to the trust. Future distributions to such beneficiaries are taxed to the extent that debt forgiven to the trust has not already been taken into account in calculating taxable distributions under these provisions. This rule ensures that an amount equal to the debt forgiven to the trust is taxed if it is ever distributed to a non-qualifying beneficiary. There is also a new record-keeping requirement for trustees of trusts qualifying under the exemption. Section 22B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires the trustee to keep records of amounts of debt forgiven to the trust, and amounts distributed to the trust’s beneficiaries for the life of the trust. This provision is necessary in order to calculate accurately the extent to which distributions to non- qualifying beneficiaries are taxable. Example In year 1 a father establishes a family trust to benefit his two daughters. The trust deed gives the trustee the power to appoint other beneficiaries - including non-qualifying beneficiaries. In year 1 the father transfers the family home to the trust for its market value of $50,000. A debt is created between the trust and the father for $50,000. The father forgives the debt progressively in years 1 and 2. In each of the years 1 - 7 he makes regular cash gifts of $25,000 to the trust. In year 5 the trustee exercises the power of appointment, appoints the father’s family company as a beneficiary and distributes $40,000 to the company. The trustee also distributes $25,000 to each of the daughters in the same year. In year 7 the trustee distributes $20,000 to the family company and $20,000 to each of the daughters.

Thus, the $50,000 debt that he forgives to the trust in years 1 and 2 is treated as if it is paid under the accrual rules and is, therefore, not taxable to the trust. The distributions to the daughters in years 5 and 7 are distributions to qualifying beneficiaries, so are not taxable under the new rules. The distribution of $40,000 to the family company in year 5 is taxable to the trust in its entirety. This is because the family company is a non-qualifying beneficiary and the trust has received the benefit of $50,000 debt forgiveness in years 1 and 2. The distribution of $20,000 to the family company in year 7 is taxable to the extent of $10,000. This is because only $10,000 of the $50,000 past debt forgiveness has not already been taken into account in calculating taxable distributions under these provisions. Transfers of debts to associates Figure 3 shows an example of how a debt could be sold or transferred to an associate of the debtor to circumvent the debt remission rules. In the example, A owes money that it cannot repay to B. Rather than forgiving the debt (which would give rise to remission income for A) B sells the debt, at a discount, to an associate of A (in this case C). FIGURE 3: DEBT PARKING A acknowledges the debt but C never calls the loan $100 loan to A A (debtor) C (associate of A) B (creditor) C buys debt from B for $60 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 22 B has received $60 for A’s debt and extinguished its rights under the arrangement. Had this money come direct from A (as full and final settlement of the debt) remission income of $40 would have arisen to A. However, because C is an arm’s length party from B, no remission income arises under current law. The difference between this type of arrangement and the sale or assignment of the debt from B to an unrelated third party is that, although A’s debt under the arrangement is still outstanding, A no longer expects to have to repay the loan. Section EH 53 deals with transfers of debts to persons associated with the debtor. If a creditor sells a debt to an associate of the debtor at a discount of 20% or more of the market value of the debt (adjusted for changes in value that are attributable to decreases in creditworthiness), the debt is treated as being forgiven by the creditor. Both the original creditor and debtor will carry out a base price adjustment, and a new financial arrangement will be created between the debtor and the debtor’s associate. For the purpose of the base price adjustment the debtor will be treated as paying the discounted price (in the example $60). The debtor’s associate is treated as providing an interest-free loan of $60 to the debtor, so there is no income or expenditure to spread under the new financial arrangement. Under the new financial arrangement, if the debtor repays an amount in excess of the amount the debtor’s associates paid the original creditor, the excess is an allowable deduction to the debtor and gross income to the debtor’s associate. Amounts remitted When taxpayers perform a base price adjustment they must take into account any amount they have remitted. This ensures that the amount they remitted does not contribute to a negative outcome under the base price adjustment, since a negative outcome may be deductible for tax purposes. The amounts remitted through operation of law are now explicitly included in the base price adjustment. Allowable deductions - bad debts Section EH 54 largely replicates section EH 6 of the old accruals rules. It has been extended to allow bad debt deductions for dealers or providers of goods and services when credit is extended under an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services. The latest review of the accrual rules did not specifically address issues associated with the treatment of bad debts arising from financial arrangements. Bad debt deductions were, however, reviewed in 1993, and the subsequent Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1993 confirmed that the accrual rules operate as a code for deduction of bad debts arising from financial arrangements, and that deductions between associates were inappropriate. The prohibition against the deduction of associated person bad debts was part of the accruals rules when first enacted. At that time it was considered that the non-arm’s length relationship between the borrower and the lender could create avoidance opportunities if bad debt deductions were permitted. The Valabh Committee recommended in 1992 that the accrual rules be modified to allow persons in the business of lending money deductions for losses of principal in respect of loans to associated persons. The Government did not accept the recommendation to change the rules for several reasons: It would make it easier for business lenders to capitalise their subsidiaries with debt instead of equity, thereby allowing any losses from the investment to be deductible while gains would not be included in income. The common law test as to whether a loan that goes bad was on revenue account (meaning a bad debt deduction would be allowed) or on capital account (meaning no bad debt deduction would be allowed) is difficult to apply in practice. A change could also provide scope for taxpayers to claim double deductions. Security arrangements Sections EH 55 and EH 56 consolidate the provisions relating to security arrangements. The discussion document The Taxation of Financial Arrangements proposed removing certain types of security arrangements from the accrual rules. These proposals were not included in the recent legislation, but will be consulted on further and any necessary amendments included in a future tax bill. Agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services The rules applying to trade credits have been integrated with the rules for agreements for the sale and purchase of property. They have also been extended to apply to the provision of services. The integration has been done by widening the definition of “property” for the purpose of the accrual rules. This results in the rules for agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services covering all agreements in which the subject is property, except if the property is foreign exchange or financial arrangements. The provisions in the old rules relating to trade credits are not included in the new rules. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 23 As a result of the integration, the bad debt provisions have been extended to taxpayers in the business of dealing in the goods or services that are the subject of the agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services. In addition, there is only one excepted financial arrangement for short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services. The measurement period to determine short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services runs from the date the contract was entered into. If the date of contract cannot be determined with reasonable certainty, the measurement period runs from the earlier of the date the purchaser makes payment to the vendor or the date the first right in the property is transferred or any services are performed. The same measurement rule applies to short-term options. Interest accumulation rules have been included in the definition of “consideration” to enable the accrual rules to apply if payment is made before the property is transferred. The rules for agreements for the sale and purchase of property were intended to deal with actual transfers of property. They were not intended to apply if the property concerned is being used only as a pricing index. If there is a cash settlement option in a property agreement it indicates this is an indication that the property is being used as a pricing index. The agreement should then be treated as a forward contract. The rules for an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services apply only if the agreement is to be settled by physical delivery of property or the performance of services. It has been made clear that an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services that provides for a cash settlement option is a forward contract, and a futures contract is a forward contract traded on a recognised futures exchange. The treatment of fees Because the fees of a financial arrangement affect the cost of funds, they should be taken into account as consideration in calculating income or expenditure. Under the old accruals rules, the treatment of fees incurred in relation to a financial arrangement is dependent upon whether the fees are contingent or non-contingent. Contingent fees must be spread over the term of the financial arrangement, while non-contingent fees up to 2% of the core acquisition price do not have to be spread. This threshold has been removed from the new accrual rules so that all non-contingent fees are outside the ambit of the accrual rules because they are not readily substitutable with interest. Unlike non-contingent fees, contingent fees, by their very nature, are substitutable for interest and so are spread. The treatment of fees has been reflected in the definition of “consideration” in section EH 48. “Non-contingent fee” is defined in section OB 1 as a fee for services provided in relation to a person becoming a party to a financial arrangement that is payable whether or not the arrangement proceeds. Each fee will need to be considered on a case-by-case basis. For example, depending on the circumstances, brokerage fees can be either contingent or non- contingent; if the brokerage is payable on applications received, and is non-refundable, it is non-contingent, whereas if it is payable on applications accepted it is contingent. Finance leases All leases were previously excepted financial arrangements. Under sections FC 6 to FC 8 the specified lease rules treated certain leases in a similar manner to a sale of the lease asset financed by a “loan” from the lessor to the lessee. As set out in the discussion document The Taxation of Financial Arrangements, specified leases are essentially financing arrangements and similar to deferred property settlements. Therefore leases with financing characteristics have been included within the scope of the accrual rules. Leases entered into on or after 20 May 1999 (the date of enactment) that have financing characteristics are known as “finance leases”. The definition of “excepted financial arrangement” has been amended to exclude leases, other than finance leases, from the accrual rules. The definition of “specified lease” has also been amended so that the definition applies only to leases entered into before 20 May 1999. The definition of “finance lease” is narrower than the definition of “specified lease”. “Finance lease” is defined in section OB 1. A lease of personal property (other than bloodstock and livestock) is a finance lease if, under the lease, any of the following criteria are met: The lease provides for the lease asset to transfer to the lessee at the end of the lease term. The lessee or associate has the option to acquire the lease asset for an amount that is substantially lower than the market value of the lease asset on the date of acquisition. The lease term is longer than 75 percent of the useful life of the lease asset. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 24 Rules similar to those governing the tax treatment of hire purchase agreements have been introduced to deal with finance leases. As with the hire purchase rules the finance lease rules, other than those dealing with the spreading of the interest income or expenditure, are contained in Subpart FC. Leases entered into on or after 20 May 1999 that are not finance leases are known as operating leases. Section EO 2A deals with deductions available to lessees under operating leases. Special rules for finance leases Under section FC 8A, the leasing of an asset under a finance lease is treated as a sale of the lease asset from the lessor to the lessee. The lessor is then treated as providing a loan to the lessee equal to the lessor’s disposition value. The lessee is then treated as using that loan to purchase the asset for the lessee’s acquisition cost. The result of the deemed sale is that any profit from the sale is recognised by the lessor in the year of sale, and the lessee is entitled to claim depreciation if appropriate. The lessor is explicitly denied a deduction for depreciation (section FC 8B(1)). Section FC 8B(2) ensures that if title of the lease asset transfers to the lessee at the termination of the lease, the transfer of title does not result in any tax consequences. In other words, the lessee is treated as purchasing the lease asset at the time of the deemed sale, not when title eventually passes. If, at the end of the lease term, the lease asset is not purchased by the lessee but instead returned to the lessor the lease asset is treated as being sold to the lessor. The consideration for the transfer is the guaranteed residual value (GRV). GRV is defined in section OB 1 as an amount equal to the value of the lease asset as agreed in the lease by the lessor and the lessee being an amount the receipt of which by the lessor is guaranteed by the lessee. If there is no GRV the lease asset is treated as being sold for no value. Section FC 8C deals with early terminations of leases. If a lease is terminated early, the lease asset is treated as being sold to the lessor for the amount by which the outstanding balance of the loan exceeds any additional payment made as a result of early termination. “Outstanding balance” is defined in section OB 1 as including principal, interest, and penalties owing by the lessee to the lessor on the date that the lease is terminated. Both sections FC 8B(3) and FC 8C(1) apply despite the requirements of section EG 19(7) of the depreciation rules. Section EG 19(7) enables the Commissioner to treat property sold, in certain circumstances, at its market value at the time of sale. This is not appropriate in relation to finance leases because such leases are treated as financing transactions, and the deemed sale price is treated as part of that transaction. Section FC 8D deals with the sale of lease assets by the lessor following expiry of the lease. If an asset is sold for more or less than the guaranteed residual value, and a payment is made to or by the lessee, an adjustment is made to the deemed sale price, under the finance lease rules, to ensure that the value of the asset transferred (be it higher or lower than the guaranteed residual value) is reflected in the financing transaction. One of the main practical problems encountered under the specified lease rules is that, in some cases, it is only with the benefit of hindsight that it can be ascertained whether a lease is a specified lease. One of the aims of the definition of “finance lease” is certainty. When taxpayers enter into a lease they should generally be able to ascertain whether the lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition are drafted so that it is clear from the outset whether these factors will be characteristics of the lease. Under paragraph (c), however, it is possible that with the benefit of hindsight a person could determine that a lease is a finance lease. For example, if there are two or more consecutive or successive leases of the same lease asset to the same lessee and the Commissioner treats those leases as one lease, and the lease is for 75% or more of the asset’s estimated useful life, and the second, or subsequent lease, was not contemplated when the first lease was entered into, it is only with the benefit of hindsight that the taxpayer can determine that the lease is a finance lease. Sections FC 8H and FC 8I are aimed at such leases and allow taxpayers to make an adjustment in the income year in which they determine that their lease is a finance lease. Finance leases and the accrual rules The new finance lease rules and the amendment to the definition of “excepted financial arrangement” to exclude operating leases mean that: The interest element of a finance lease is recognised as income or expenditure over the term of the agreement using the yield to maturity or alternative accrual methods. On termination or expiry of the lease there is a base price adjustment to ensure that all income or expenditure is recognised. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 25 Example 1 On 1 April 2000 a person leases a floodlight system, the lease is for three years, and the Commissioner has determined that the estimated useful life of the floodlight system is also three years. The lessee’s acquisition cost is $100,000 (neither the lessee nor the lessor incurred any costs in preparing or installing the lease asset for use). The lease payments are payable annually in one instalment of $32,000. The lessor and the lessee have agreed a guaranteed residual value of $30,000. Their balance dates are both 31 March.

If the proceeds of the sale are more than $30,000 the lessor will return the excess to the lessee, and if the sale proceeds are less than $30,000 the lessee will make up any shortfall. At the end of the lease the lessor sells the floodlight system for $24,000, and the lessee pays the lessor $6,000.

Interest payable under a finance lease is included in the definition of “exempt interest” for the purposes of the RWT rules. Under section NF 1(2), the RWT rules do not apply to exempt interest. Therefore the interest component of a finance lease payment is not subject to RWT. Non-resident withholding taxes (NRWT) The accrual rules do not apply to the calculation of non-resident withholding income (section EH 21(2)(a)), so they have no effect on NRWT. Section FC 8F deems income derived by the lessor, from the deemed loan, to be interest. This section ensures that the interest component of a lease payment is subject to withholding tax. Therefore non-resident withholding tax or approved issuer levy must be deducted in relation to actual payments made rather than the “interest” spread under the accrual rules. Other amendments Branch equivalent income An amendment to the branch equivalent income calculation (section CG 11(5)) clarifies the amount a controlled foreign company must use to value the “consideration” for a financial arrangement. The section applies if there was no attributed foreign income or loss in the previous accounting period. The consideration for the arrangement is relevant for calculating the amount of income or expenditure and the base price adjustment in all years that the company is a party to the arrangement (provided the company remains subject to the controlled foreign company rules). The consideration is the market value or the absolute value of the formula in CG 11(5)(b). “Absolute value” is defined in section OB 1 as the value irrespective of whether the value’s sign is positive or negative. Section CG 11(5)(a) has been repealed, since it does not give the appropriate result. The section provided that the acquisition price of a financial arrangement was the value of that arrangement at the end of the immediately preceding period. This means the acquisition price would fluctuate from year to year because the value of the arrangement changes and would give an incorrect result in the year the base price adjustment applied. Commercial bills Section CE 3(1)(b), relating to commercial bills, has been repealed. A specific anti-avoidance rule (section GC 14A) has been introduced to act as a deterrent to taxpayers entering into arrangements with the purpose of avoiding non-resident withholding tax or approved issuer levy. The provision is designed to prevent non-residents avoiding non-resident withholding tax on redemption payments by disposing of the bills to a resident immediately before maturity of the bills. The provision does this by making a resident liable for tax on the redemption payment. Hire purchase rules A new section (section FC 10(6A)) has been inserted into the hire purchase rules. The section treats the income of a lessor from the loan under a hire purchase agreement as interest. This amendment clarifies the relationship between the accrual rules and interest for the purpose of the withholding tax rules. Non-market transactions Section GD 11 is aimed at transactions that attempt to defeat the intent and application of the accrual rules. The requirement that there be a connection between the parties has been removed, and the section has been extended to apply if an arrangement is issued, acquired, varied, sold or otherwise transferred. Consequential amendments A substantial number of consequential amendments have been made to remove terms such as “holder” and “issuer”. These changes are not intended to affect the way the taxation law applies. Amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 Record-keeping A new section 22A has been inserted. This section requires taxpayers to keep: Sufficient records to verify market prices if they use the market valuation method to work out income or expenditure in any year. Under the old rules, taxpayers can use the market valuation method only if the Commissioner has approved the market. Markets will still be approved by the Commissioner, which will help to minimise compliance costs. Records showing why spreading methods have been changed. It is not intended that taxpayers be able to switch method from year to year simply because another accrual method provides more favourable tax outcomes. If, however, there are valid reasons for change ( for example, a company is taken over and the new owner has different accounting policies ( it will be allowed. The new section 22B requires trustees who qualify under the natural love and affection exemption to keep records of amounts of debt forgiven to the trust, and amounts distributed to the trust’s beneficiaries for the life of the trust. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 28 Disclosure of financial arrangements The disclosure requirements for inter-related financial arrangement contained in section 60 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 have been repealed. This change affects both Division 1 and Division 2 financial arrangements. This amendment is aimed at reducing the costs of complying with the accrual rules. Commissioner’s determination-making powers Extensions to the Commissioner’s determination- making powers have been made to: enable the consideration for the transfer of property to be calculated if there are substantial prepayments (accumulation provisions); and allow the Commissioner to determine the consideration for which a finance lease asset is transferred if it is inappropriate to use the cash price. In the latter case, the determination would refer to “discounted value”. This may occur, for example, if the payment terms are more favourable to the lessee than outright acquisition of the asset. Determinations Owing to the structure of the accrual rules, two sets of determinations will govern the tax treatment of various types of financial arrangements. The existing determinations issued under section 90 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will govern the tax treatment of financial arrangements entered into before the date of enactment. A new provision, section 90A, has been inserted into the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow the Commissioner to issue determinations that will govern the tax treatment of new financial arrangements. Until the new determinations are issued, however, determinations issued under section 90 will apply, in principle, to financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999. For example, two determinations have been issued under section 90 to govern the tax treatment of trade credits and deferred property settlements. The determinations will continue to apply, in principle, to agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services under the new rules, even though trade credits and deferred property settlements will be treated in the same way under the new rules. These determinations will continue to apply until a new determination for agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services is issued under section 90A of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

As a result, employers may base these allowances upon fair and reasonable estimates of work-related expenditure likely to be incurred by employees for related periods. Background The Income Tax Act 1994 allows employers to calculate average tax-free allowances payable to employees. The legislation is intended to provide employers with the low-cost alternative of paying an average tax-free allowance, rather than having to reimburse each individual item of employee work- related expenditure. Employers use a variety of methods to determine the amounts of employee work-related expenditure to be reimbursed by way of average tax-free allowances. In general, average tax-free allowances paid by employers are reasonable estimates of actual work- related expenditure. However, an Inland Revenue review of the law identified that a strict interpretation of the legislation did not allow for employers to take this approach. The legislation required employers to carry out extensive employee surveys and use mathematical formulae to calculate the average tax-free payment they made to each employee. If it had been strictly followed, the legislation would have posed serious difficulties for employers. Even when information concerning total employee work- related expenditure was available (and in many cases, it may not have been), the legislation’s compilation and calculation requirements imposed a very heavy compliance cost burden upon employers. The legislation has been amended by removal of its exacting survey and calculation requirements. Instead it now allows employers to base averages upon fair and reasonable estimates of work-related expenditure likely to be incurred by employees for related periods. Other changes to the Income Tax Act 1994 Key features Section CB 12(3), which governs the averaging of tax-free allowances, has been replaced by a new provision which allows employers to base average tax-free allowances upon fair and reasonable estimates of work related expenditure likely to be incurred by employees for related periods. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 1999. GST TO BE INCLUDED AS PART OF THE COST OF A FRINGE BENEFIT (Sections CI 2, CI 3 and OB 1) Introduction GST is to be taken into account in valuing all fringe benefits, except when the good or service is exempt from GST. Background Fringe benefit tax (FBT) was introduced in 1985 to reverse the effect of certain court decisions which established that non-cash benefits that could not be converted to cash were not subject to income tax. FBT was essential to support the PAYE system and to protect the revenue base, since employers were switching from providing monetary remuneration to remuneration in kind. FBT also increases the equity of the tax system, since equity requires that all forms of remuneration, including non-cash benefits, are taxed consistently. Also, because the incidence of non-cash benefits tends to increase with income, not taxing fringe benefits was eroding the progressive nature of the tax system. In the Atlas Copco case the cost price of a motor vehicle was held to be GST-exclusive if the business could claim a GST input credit. The law was later amended so that the cost price for motor vehicles was GST-inclusive. The policy intention was that the value of fringe benefits would be calculated on a GST-inclusive value . The amendment did not cover other goods or services that employers may provide to their employees at a discount or for free. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 32 Key features The FBT rules have been amended to provide that the calculation of the value of a fringe benefit is GST-inclusive if the employer is a registered person who can claim input tax in relation to the fringe benefit provided or the good or service provided is subject to GST. This involved amendments to the terms “amount”, “cost”, “price”, “fee”, and “sale at retail” in sections CI 2 and CI 3. Consequential amendments were also made to the terms “input tax” and “registered person”. This measure will not affect all fringe benefits; only those that include a GST element will have an increase in the value of the benefit. It will not increase the cost of providing subsidised loans to employees because this is an exempt activity for GST purposes. The benefits affected are the goods and services an employer produces and provides to employees at a subsidised price or at no cost. Also affected are the goods and services an employer purchases and provides at a subsidised price or at no cost to employees. Example of impact of amendment An employer wishes to provide a fishing rod, cost $100 (including GST) to an employee. This table illustrates the various ways to achieve this, presuming the employee’s marginal tax rate is 33%. Description of costFBT (old rules) Additional salaryFBT (new rules) Cost excluding GST$89$89 Cost including GST$100$100 Cost price of rod$89$100 (under FBT rules) GST output tax based on cost price$10$11 of rod for FBT purposes Cash bonus paid$149 Less income tax @ 33%$49 Bonus paid after tax$100 Fringe benefit tax$44$49 Total cost to employer$143$149$149 Total tax revenue$54$60$60 CollectedFBT plus GSTIncome tax plus GSTFBT plus GST on rodon rodon rod The example shows that by calculating the cost price on a GST-exclusive basis, less than the appropriate level of tax was paid, and employers could lower their overall tax bill by providing fringe benefits rather than paying equivalent wages. In the example, the saving to the employer was $6 on the $100 rod. This result was not intended, from a policy perspective, because the total cost to the employer and the total revenue collected should be the same regardless of the way employers pay their employees. Application date This measure applies to fringe benefits provided on or after 1 April 1999. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 33 GUARANTEE FEES PAID TO NON-RESIDENTS (Sections CN 4, OB 1) Introduction Guarantee fees paid to non-residents will attract withholding tax of 3.3% if the payer and recipient are associated persons, or a “more than incidental” purpose or effect of the guarantee is to reduce the amount of interest on a financial arrangement. As a result, these guarantee fees will be taxed in the same way that insurance premiums paid to non-resident insurers are taxed. Background Section CN 4 generally provides that a non-resident insurer (one without a fixed establishment in New Zealand) deriving insurance premiums from New Zealand is subject to a 3.3% tax on the amount of the gross premiums. The person paying the premium is required to deduct the amount of this tax from the premium and pay it to the Commissioner. Section OE 4(1)(o) stipulates the type of insurance premiums that are deemed to be derived from New Zealand. The definition of “insurance” applying for the purposes of sections CN 4 (including its precursors) and OE 4 has always included a reference to guarantee against risk. Key features Section CN 4 and associated definitions in section OB 1 have been amended to ensure that certain guarantee fees paid to non-residents are subject to the withholding tax treatment under section CN 4. The amendments are intended to protect the New Zealand tax base. Two types of guarantee fees paid to non-residents are subject to withholding tax treatment under section CN 4. The first is any guarantee fee payable directly or indirectly or by one or more transactions by a person who is associated with the non-resident deriving the guarantee fee. The definition of “associated persons” in section OD 8(3) applies for this purpose. Also, “payable” is defined to include an amount distributed, credited or dealt with in the interest of or on behalf of a person. The second type is a guarantee fee payable to an unassociated non-resident in respect of money lent if a “more than incidental” purpose or effect of the guarantee is that the guarantee fee is in substitution for interest. Only this type of guarantee fee paid to an unassociated non-resident is subject to section CN 4. This would generally not include fees paid on normal trade and commercial financing transactions such as letters of credit and performance bonds. Furthermore, the reduction in interest must be a “more than incidental” purpose or effect of the guarantee. “Incidental” in this context means naturally flowing from, or a normal result of, the guarantee. If a reduction in interest is not incidental in this sense, the guarantee fee may be subject to section CN 4. The fact that the payment of a guarantee fee to an unassociated non-resident acting at arm’s length results in a lower rate of interest does not of itself mean that the fee is subject to section CN 4. The main amendments are: The definition of “insurance” in section OB 1, applying for purposes of sections CN 4, GD 13, OE 4 and associated definitions in section OB 1, has been amended to include a separate reference to a guarantee against risk. This guarantee reference applies if the person deriving the guarantee fee is associated with the payer, or a non-incidental purpose or effect of the guarantee is that the guarantee fee is in substitution for interest. A new definition of “insured person” has been inserted into section OB 1 and applies for the purposes of sections CN 4 and OE 4. An insured person is defined as a person who incurs a premium for a contract of insurance, regardless of whether the person is also the one who can make a claim under the contract. The definition of “premium” in section OB 1, applying for purposes of sections CN 4 and OE 4, has been amended to include a specific reference to a guarantee fee. An example of the amendment’s application would be to a guarantee fee (including any establishment fee) paid by a New Zealand resident company to a non-resident parent company (or another non- resident associate) in consideration for the non- resident parent guaranteeing the repayment of a loan made by a lender to the New Zealand company. The guarantee fee would be subject to the withholding tax treatment under section CN 4. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 34 Application date The amendments apply from 17 November 1998 (the date of introduction of the bill) in relation to guarantee fees paid to associated persons. In the case of guarantee fees paid to unassociated persons, the amendments apply from 20 May 1999 (the date of enactment). LIMITING DEDUCTIONS UNDER CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS (Sections EO 4A, EO 4B, DM 1A, DM 1B, Income Tax Act 1994) (Section 44AA, Tax Administration Act 1994) Introduction Amendments counter a weakness in the tax law in relation to expenditure on films and petroleum mining exploration. They remove the taxation benefits of certain arrangements, but do not affect the ordinary deductibility of expenditure on films and petroleum mining exploration. Background Investors were previously able to enter into arrangements (usually through a group of companies) to claim, in effect, two deductions for one amount of expenditure. Such arrangements are complex, but in essence involve investors claiming one deduction for expenditure on films or petroleum mining exploration and a second deduction in relation to the disposal of property under the same arrangement. Key features The principal new sections inserted are EO 4A and DM 1A. In general, both sections follow the same form and, as such, the description that follows applies to both. These sections apply to situations in which expenditure is incurred on films or on petroleum mining exploration under an arrangement, and property is disposed for consideration under the same arrangement. The amount of the deduction for such expenditure is reduced by reference to the amount of consideration received for the property. However, the tax treatment of the consideration received for the property is not affected. The amendments also confirm that guarantee fees come within the insurance exclusion provision in the business profits articles in New Zealand’s double tax agreements. More specifically, subsection (2) provides that these sections apply in relation to a person and an arrangement if: the person incurs film or petroleum mining exploration expenditure under the arrangement; and the person or an associated person disposes of property (for example, shares) under the same arrangement or a right given under that arrangement; and the consideration received for the property is not income relating to a film or petroleum exploration. If the criteria in subsection (2) are satisfied, adjustments may be required under subsections (3) and (4). If adjustments are required, special returns must be filed under section 44AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994. A special return must be filed if a taxpayer’s income or loss for an income year is either directly or indirectly affected by reduced deductions. A company may be indirectly affected, for instance, if it belongs to a group of companies and has previously utilised a loss resulting from an arrangement of the kind in question. Sections EO 4B and DM 1B allow the Commissioner to assess taxpayers outside the time bar. Use of money interest may apply when adjustments are made. Sections EO 4A and DM 1A are best illustrated by example. Example A: receipts exceed expenditure A person in year 1 incurs $50 expenditure and in year 2 derives $70 as consideration for property disposed of under an arrangement. Applying the formula in subsection (3) “a - (b - c)” in year 1, item ‘a’, the amount of the expenditure that would be deductible in that income year, is $50. Item ‘b’, the total amount of consideration for the property derived before or during year 1, is $0. Item ‘c’, the lesser of item ‘b’ and the total amount of expenditure that would be deductible in earlier income years, is also $0. So: a - (b - c) Year 1:50 - (0 - 0) = 50 $50 is therefore the amount allowed as a deduction in year 1. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 35 In year 2 item ‘a’ is nil. Item ‘b’, the total amount of the consideration for the property derived before or during that income year, is $70. Item ‘c’, the lesser of item ‘b’ and the total amount of expenditure that would be deductible in earlier income years (year 1), is $50. a - ( b - c ) Year 2:0 - (70 - 50) = -20 The deduction allowed in year 2 is equal to the greater of nil and the amount given by the formula. As the amount given by the formula is negative, the deduction allowed in year 2 is nil. As consideration is also derived in year 2, subsection (4) applies. In the formula “a - b” item ‘a’, the amount of expenditure deducted in earlier income years, is $50. Item ‘b’, the total amount of consideration derived before or during year 2, is $70: a - b Year 2:50-70 = -20 Subsection (4) reduces a person’s deductions in earlier income years to equal the greater of nil and the amount given by the formula, -20 in this example. Accordingly, in year 2 the $50 deduction in year 1 (the earlier income year) is reduced to nil. Example B: expenditure exceeds receipts A person incurs $100 expenditure of which $50 is deductible in year 1 and $50 in year 2. In year 2, $70 is derived as consideration for the disposition of property. The treatment of the $50 of expenditure deductible in year 1 follows that of the example above, giving: a - ( b - c ) Year 1:50-( 0 - 0 ) = 50 Applying subsection (3) for year 2, item ‘a’, the amount of expenditure that would be deductible in year 2, is $50. Item ‘b’, the total amount of consideration derived before or during year 2, is $70. Item ‘c’, the lesser of item ‘b’ and the total amount of expenditure that would be deductible in earlier income years, is the $50 deductible in year 1. a - (b - c ) Year 2:50-(70-50) = 30 Subsection (4) also applies in year 2 to limit the deduction in year 1. Under the formula “a - b”, item ‘a’, the amount of expenditure deducted in earlier income years, is $50 and item ‘b’, the total consideration derived before or during year 2, is $70. a - b Year 2:50 - 70 = -20 As in example A , the deduction for year 1 is reduced to nil. At the end of Year 2 a $30 deduction is allowed. Example C: first in, first out - the order in which deductions are reduced This example is a variation on example B to illustrate subsection (5). As in example B, $50 of expenditure is deductible in both year 1 and year 2. Now, however, $70 consideration is derived in year 3 instead of year 2. Applying subsection (3) as before: a - (b - c) Year 150-(0 - 0) = 50 Year 250-(0 - 0) = 50 Year 30-(70-70) = 0 Applying subsection (4) in year 3, when consideration is derived: a - b 100 - 70 = 30 Subsection (4) reduces the total amount of the person’s deductions in earlier income years so that the total of those deductions is 30. The order in which deductions are disallowed is provided for in subsection (5). As such, deductions are disallowed in the same order as they would have been deductible, that is, on a first in, first out basis. The deduction for year 1 is first reduced to zero before the deduction for year 2 is reduced by $20 to allow the total deduction of $30. Application These provisions apply to expenditure incurred from 17 November 1998, the date of introduction of the bill. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 36 TRADING STOCK - VARIANCES (Sections EE 5(3) and (4) and EE 15) Introduction The trading stock legislation has been amended to provide more flexibility and reduce compliance costs for taxpayers who use a budgeted or standard cost method of allocating costs to trading stock. Background As introduced into Parliament, the amending legislation replaced section EE 5(4) to correct the following deficiencies: The entire variance was included in gross income, rather than the part of the variance allocated to closing stock. The provision did not allow for variances that arise because less is spent on trading stock than was budgeted. The replacement provision, as introduced, provided that the portion of a current year variance that related to closing stock must be taken into account in calculating the value of closing stock in the year in which the variance arises. Variances arising in a previous year were not to be taken into account in calculating the value of the closing stock. This provision was itself replaced during the Select Committee process. A submission to the Committee argued that there should be more flexibility with regard to the inclusion of a previous year’s variances in the value of closing stock. If taxpayers included them for financial reporting purposes, they should be able to do so for tax purposes. The trading stock legislation has been amended to allow this flexibility. Key features Sections EE 5(3) and (4) have been replaced by a new section EE 5(3) which applies if, for financial reporting purposes, taxpayers use a budgeted or standard cost method of allocating costs to trading stock. New section EE 5(3) provides that a taxpayer must allocate any variance between the costs of production included in its financial statements for the year, and the actual costs of production for the year, by pro-rating the variance between the cost of stock sold and the closing value of the stock. The provision does not prevent taxpayers from carrying forward previous year variances (that is, including them in the value of closing stock for the following year) if they do so for financial reporting purposes. The flexibility to do this will reduce compliance costs for such taxpayers. Previous year variances that are not carried forward for financial reporting purposes are not required to be carried forward for tax purposes because they will be deducted as part of the opening stock under section EE 2(4). Section EE 15(1)(e) has been amended to clarify that the income year in which companies need to have years that end with the same balance date is the year in which the trading stock is valued, not the year in which the return is filed. Application dates The new section EE 5(3), and the amendment to section EE 15(1)(e), take effect from the 1998-99 income year. Section EE 5(4) is repealed with effect from 2 October 1997, which is the earliest date on which it could have applied. Example A Co values trading stock for financial reporting purposes using a budgeted cost method of cost allocation. In the 2000-2001 year the taxpayer produced the number of units budgeted for (100,000), but at $10.50 per unit rather than the $10 per unit budgeted for. The actual costs of producing the trading stock therefore differ from the costs used in calculating the value of trading stock under FRS 4. A Co is required to allocate the variance between the costs used for financial reporting purposes and the actual costs between the cost of trading stock sold during the year and the closing stock. However, A Co is not required to carry forward the remaining portion of the variance in calculating the closing value of trading stock in the 2001-2002 year. The taxpayer obtains a deduction for this portion of the variance in the 2001-2002 year because it is included in the opening value of the stock in that year. 1. Calculate variance Production costs used for financial reporting purposes - 100,000 units @ $10 per unit$1,000,000 Actual production costs - 100,000 units @ $10.50 per unit$1,050,000 Variance$50,000 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 37 2. Allocate variance The variance is pro-rated between the cost of goods sold and the cost of closing stock. Cost of trading stock sold = 90,000/100,000 x $1,050,000 = $945,000 Cost of closing stock = 10,000/100,000 x $1,050,000 = $105,000 Portion of variance allocated to closing stock = Variance x cost of closing stock cost of stock sold + cost of closing stock $50,000 x $105,000/$1,050,000= $50,000 x 10% = $5,000 Value of closing stock = FRS 4 + remaining portion of the variance = $100,000 (10,000 @ $10 per unit) + $5,000 = $105,000 The value of opening stock for the 2001-2002 year is $105,000. The taxpayer therefore obtains a deduction for the remaining portion of the variance in that year. It is not required to be carried over into the value of the closing stock for that year. In this example, the variance is allocated only between the goods produced in the 2000-2001 year. It would also be acceptable to allocate the variance over the goods produced in an earlier year and sold in the 2000-2001 year (that is, to pro-rate the variance between opening stock + the cost of goods produced and sold in that year, and closing stock). LOW INCOME REBATE (Section KC 1(2)) The term “absentee” in section KC 1(2) has been replaced with “non resident” to correct an error in the legislation. Section KC 1(2) referred to a taxpayer who is an absentee for part of an income year. Because an absentee is a person who is not resident for any part of an income year, the term “non-resident” should have been used. The amendment applies to the 1999-2000 and subsequent income years. CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS - ADDITIONS (Section KC 5(1)) The Bangladesh Flood Appeal Trust has been granted charitable donee status from the 1998-99 income year. The Humanitarian Aid Account of Mission Without Borders (NZ) has been granted charitable donee status from the 1999-2000 income year. Donations made to these two organisations will entitle individual taxpayers to a rebate of 33 1/3 percent of the amount donated. The maximum rebate for all donations is $500 per annum. A company (other than a closely held company) will be entitled to a deduction from its net income up to the amount prescribed by section DJ 4. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 38 APPLICATION OF SHORTFALL PENALTIES TO DUTIES (Section 3) Introduction The definition of “return period” has been amended to clarify that it covers tax returns provided for a particular transaction or transactions but not tied to a particular period. Background Section 141 requires a tax shortfall calculation each time a taxpayer incurs a shortfall penalty. A shortfall penalty is a penalty imposed on a taxpayer under any of sections 141A to 141K for taking an incorrect tax position or for doing or failing to do anything specified or described in those sections. “Tax shortfall” is a defined term, and the definition sets out how the tax shortfall is to be calculated. A shortfall penalty is imposed for the return period to which the tax return relates. It could previously have been argued that taxes such as cheque duty had no return period because the returns relate to one-off transactions, so shortfall penalties could not be imposed. Furthermore, without a return period the various offsetting provisions in section 141 could not apply. Key features The definition of “return period” in section 3 has been amended to provide that the return period in relation to a tax return that relates to transactions is the day on which the tax return is due. For example, cheque duty is a transaction tax, so the tax return for cheque duty has no period to which it relates. This amendment provides a return period for these taxes so that various offsetting provisions in section 141 can apply and shortfall penalties can be imposed, since the requirements of section 141(3) are now met. Section 141(3) requires a shortfall penalty to be imposed in relation to a return period, a tax type and a tax position. Application date This provision applies on or after 1 April 1999. Changes to the Tax Administration Act 1994 LATE PAYMENT PENALTY (Section 3) The definition of “late payment penalty” in section 3 has been expanded to cover late payment penalties regardless of the period to which they relate, allowing application of the current remission provisions to these penalties. The remission provisions contained in the Tax Administration Act are intended to cover late payment penalties regardless of the period to which they relate. This prevents the situation where one taxpayer might gain remission under the current rules, while another is denied remission in identical circumstances, except that the late payment penalty involved related to an earlier period and was considered under the previous rules. Key features The period-based restrictions previously contained in the late payment penalty definition have been removed. Application date This amendment applies from 1 April 1997. ARRANGEMENTS FOR EXTENSIONS OF TIME (Sections 3 and 37 and MC 1, NC 2 and NC 17) Introduction Several amendments have been made to the provisions relating to the extension of time arrangements for furnishing income tax returns. The provision allowing the Commissioner to cancel an extension of time arrangement has been amended to make it clear that the Commissioner can cancel an arrangement previously granted if tax agents do not meet their return filing percentage obligations. It has also been made clear that such cancellation may apply to one or more returns rather than being required in relation to all tax returns. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 39 The term “linked to a tax agent”, which allows taxpayers so linked to have the extended terminal tax due date 7 April for standard and late balance dates, is being limited to agents with extension of time arrangements. Background The Tax Administration Act 1994 was recently amended to provide that taxpayers with an agent who have an extension of time arrangements would have a terminal tax date of two months after the general terminal tax dates. These measures address additional policy issues arising from the terminal tax date change. Key features Section 37(4A) has been amended to make it clear that the Commissioner has the power to cancel tax agents’ extension of time arrangements during an income year if they do not meet their return filing percentages. Further, a new provision was inserted to make clear that the Commissioner also has the option of cancelling an extension of time arrangement granted to an agent in relation to one or more returns rather than all returns. The definition of “linked to a tax agent” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 has been amended to refer to tax agents with an extension of time arrangement. Clients of a tax agent without an extension of time arrangement do not require the later terminal tax date because their returns are due on 7 June and 7 July following the end of the income year. Consequential amendments have been made to sections MC 1, NC 2 and NC 17 to reflect these amendments. Application date The measures will apply from 20 May 1999, the date of enactment. BINDING RULINGS (Sections 3, 91C, 91DA, 91DB, 91DC, 91DD, 91DE, 91E, 91EA, 91EB, 91EC, 91EH, 91EI, 91EJ, 91F, 91FA, 91FB, 91FC, 91FH, 91FI, 91FJ, 91G, 91GA, 91GAB, 91GAC, 91GAD, 91GAE, 91GB, 91GBA, 91GC, 91GD,91I, 91J and 138E) Introduction The post-implementation review of the binding rulings system has led to a number of changes to the binding rulings legislation. Some are minor technical changes, while other amendments reflect more significant policy changes. Background The binding rulings legislation, enacted by amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994, took effect from 1 April 1995. The primary aim of binding rulings is to give taxpayers certainty about the way the Commissioner will apply tax law to particular transactions. A post-implementation review of the binding rulings system identified a number of areas that could be improved. This has resulted in a number of changes to the binding rulings legislation. Key features Binding rulings continue to apply after a legislative change if that change does not materially affect the ruling. Taxpayers wishing determine whether a ruling is still valid can apply for a status ruling. Binding rulings continue to apply if an assumption used in the ruling proves to be incorrect if the assumption is not material to the ruling. Product rulings will not be published until two months after the applicant receives the ruling. Product rulings, status rulings on product rulings, and public rulings will be published in an Inland Revenue publication. It has been clarified that binding rulings are not disputable decisions and cannot be challenged through the dispute resolution process. Private binding rulings are now permitted on recurring arrangements. This will improve certainty for taxpayers that regularly enter into similar transactions. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 40 Application dates The amendments are generally effective from the date of enactment, 20 May 1999. There are, however, two exceptions: The amendments to section 91I that give the Commissioner the power to waive fees that are payable applies retrospectively from 1 April 1995. The amendments to section 91J that allow the Commissioner to refuse to issue a ruling to an applicant with an outstanding debt relating to an earlier ruling’s application apply on or after 1 June 1999. Detailed analysis Continuation of binding rulings after legislative change Section 91G stated that a ruling terminated if the taxation law on which the ruling was given was repealed. This occurred even if the provision was replaced with a substantially similar provision that did not alter the tax treatment of the arrangement. This meant that rulings had to be re-issued, which resulted in compliance and administrative costs. This defeated the purpose of binding rulings, which was to provide certainty. The policy rationale of section 91G was that the intent of Parliament should always take precedence over a binding ruling. Binding rulings were to terminate, therefore, following a change to the legislation that materially affected that ruling. Immaterial changes were not intended to terminate binding rulings. This intent was not adequately reflected in the legislation, however. Therefore section 91G has been redrafted to ensure that only material changes to a taxation law affect the status of a binding ruling. This change means that taxpayers are now responsible for monitoring the rulings they have obtained. In some cases, however, the effect of a change in the law on a ruling may not be clear to taxpayers. To overcome this problem the Commissioner is now able to issue rulings on the effect of legislative change on an existing ruling. These are known as “status rulings” and are provided for by the new sections 91GA, 91GAB, 91GAC, 91GAD, 91GAE, 91GB, 91GBA, and 91GC, and amendments to sections 91I and 3. This service is charged for at the regular rate. Scope of product rulings Product rulings are Inland Revenue’s interpretation of how the taxation law applies to a particular product rather than how it applies to a person or class of persons in relation to an arrangement. The ruling, therefore, defines the product and specifies the tax treatment. It applies to taxpayers whose identities and tax attributes are not known to Inland Revenue. It was not intended that product rulings should state how the law applied to a person or class of persons. However, the legislation in this area was ambiguous. In practice, Inland Revenue has issued product rulings that include comment on the tax treatment of unknown parties. Section 91FC has therefore been clarified so that product rulings can be issued on the way the taxation law applies to the unknown parties to products. This applies only if the tax characteristics of the persons entering into the arrangement do not affect the content of the ruling. Effect of incorrect assumptions The rulings legislation allows the Commissioner to set out the facts and assumptions on which rulings are based. However, the legislation did not provide a materiality threshold in relation to incorrect assumptions contained in binding rulings. Assumptions are generally made about future events. Thus, if an assumption proved incorrect the whole binding ruling was invalid, despite the fact that the incorrect assumption may not have been relevant to the remainder of the ruling. Therefore sections 91EB and 91FB have been amended so that a ruling does not apply if it contains assumptions about future events or facts that prove to be materially incorrect. These sections, however, provide that the ruling does not apply if the Commissioner stipulates a condition that is not satisfied. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner are not subject to a materiality threshold. Arrangement not seriously contemplated The Commissioner is required to make rulings only on arrangements that are seriously contemplated. It was not clear, however, at what point an arrangement that is the subject of the binding ruling has to be “seriously contemplated”. It could be the time of application or the time the ruling is to be issued, or at all times before the ruling is issued. Section 91E has been amended to clarify that an arrangement that is the subject of a binding ruling must be “seriously contemplated” at the time of application or at any time before the ruling is issued. This ensures that Inland Revenue will be able to stop work on an application if, after the application has been received, it becomes apparent that the arrangement is no longer seriously contemplated. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 41 This approach does not prevent minor amendments being made to an arrangement whilst a ruling application is being considered. Timing of publication of product rulings Section 91FH clarifies that Inland Revenue must publish all product rulings (in a departmental publication). The previous legislation was unclear on this point, and the practice was for product rulings to be published only if the taxpayer had specifically approved publication. The policy underlying this change is that product rulings may affect many people, and it is in the public interest for taxpayers to be aware of Inland Revenue’s interpretation of the law. Under section 91FH Inland Revenue must wait two months after a product ruling is issued before publication is permitted. This is because the publication of rulings could limit the competitive advantage that a new product generates. Introducing this time period means that there is now a suitable compromise between the public’s interest in gaining information and an applicant’s right to benefit from the development of new products. However, the provision allows the Commissioner to publish the product ruling earlier if the applicant requests earlier publication. Vehicle for publication of rulings Sections 91DA and 91FH have been amended, and a new section 91GBA introduced to require that Inland Revenue publish product rulings, status rulings on product rulings, and public rulings in Inland Revenue publications. Tax-orientated publications such as the Tax Information Bulletin are an effective means by which these rulings can reach the appropriate audience. These publications are widely available, both in hard copy and on the Internet. Binding rulings and disputable decisions Section 138E has been amended to make it clear that binding rulings are not disputable decisions. The policy underlying the binding rulings system was that no separate appeal rights to the courts were to be provided. It should not be possible, therefore, to challenge rulings through the dispute resolution process. Recurring arrangements Sections 91E(1) and 91EC have been amended so that private rulings will be permitted on recurring arrangements. This extension of the scope of binding rulings will increase certainty for taxpayers who enter a series of arrangements that are each identical in nature except for the parties that enter them. An example of a recurring arrangement is the retail sale of televisions on hire purchase. Taxpayers entering into recurring arrangements previously had two options. The first was to request a private ruling for each arrangement. Although this provided certainty to applicants, it was costly from both a compliance and administrative perspective. The second option was to request a product ruling on the basis that not all parties to the arrangement would be known at the time of application. The problem with this approach was that the product ruling provided only an interpretation of how the law applied to the arrangement, not how the law applied to a person in relation to the arrangement. The focus of a product ruling is on the tax treatment of a particular transaction rather than on the applicant. The amendment is intended to permit a private ruling to be obtained covering the applicant’s treatment under all the transactions that are the subject of the recurring arrangements. Extension of binding product rulings Section 91FI, which allowed extensions to product rulings, has been repealed. Experience has shown that extending a product ruling has no advantages over making a fresh application for a ruling. Conflicting rulings The provisions in section 91DB(2), 91EA(2) and 91FA(2) dealing with conflicting binding rulings are unnecessary and have been repealed. Where conflicting rulings exist, the taxpayer has the choice of which ruling to apply. Content of a binding ruling Sections 91DA, 91EH and 91FH have been amended to include an explicit requirement to state in a binding ruling how the taxation law applies to an arrangement (and an applicant for private rulings). This reflects current practice. Duration of a binding ruling Sections 91DA, 91DC, 91DD, 91DE, 91E, 91EB, 91EH, 91EI, 91F, 91FB, 91FH, and 91FJ have been clarified to make it explicit that binding rulings can be issued for income years as well as for specific periods. This reflects current practice. Minor mistakes in binding rulings The new section 91GD provides that rulings issued with typographical errors and minor mistakes can, with the consent of the taxpayer, be corrected without the need to withdraw the original ruling and reissue a new ruling. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 42 Disclosure requirements for private binding rulings Section 91EJ required holders of private rulings to disclose to Inland Revenue, using forms IR115 and IR115A, whether they had complied with the content of a ruling and whether any material changes to the arrangement identified in the ruling had occurred. In order to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers section 91EJ has been repealed. Prospective applicants The application provisions in section 91EC have been amended to allow for applications to be made on behalf of applicants not yet in existence (for example, an arrangement to be entered into by a yet to be incorporated company). This reflects commercial reality and current practice. Identification of applicants in product rulings The amended section 91FH(1) requires applicants for product rulings to be identified in the ruling. This is consistent with the original policy intent and current practice. Incorrect rulings Sections 91DC, 91EA and 91FA have been amended to make it clear that a binding ruling has not been applied if a taxpayer has filed a return on the basis of a ruling and has then issued a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) within the specified time period. The issuance of the NOPA effectively retracts the ruling, and the Commissioner will not, in these circumstances, be bound to apply it. Tax due and payable Section 91E(4)(d)(i) provided that the Commissioner could not make a ruling when the matter on which the binding ruling was sought concerned tax that was due and payable. This had the potential to cause problems because of the operation of provisional and other tax credit regimes. In relation to provisional tax, for example, although the tax is due and payable in three instalments throughout the year, it has not been assessed at the date it is paid. The instalment acts as a tax credit until the actual income tax liability has been determined. The provision was not intended to prevent rulings being made in relation to taxpayers who had, for instance, provisional tax payments due and payable. This would substantially limit the ability of the Commissioner to rule on completed transactions. Section 91E(4)(d)(i) has therefore been amended to clarify that all provisional taxpayers may apply for binding rulings, even though the matter may concern a provisional tax payment. Audit undertaken Section 91E(4)(g) provides that once an audit encompassing an arrangement that is the subject of an application for a binding ruling has been undertaken, the Commissioner cannot make a ruling on that arrangement. This restriction applies because the binding rulings system should not overlap with the dispute resolution process. It was unclear from this section what constituted an “audit”. Therefore the section has been clarified so that all types of audit activity carried out by Inland Revenue come within the scope of the provisions. Private rulings and the dispute resolution process The policy intent behind the binding rulings legislation is that it should not overlap with existing dispute resolution procedures. Section 91E(4) has therefore been clarified so that a binding ruling cannot be sought on an arrangement that is within the scope of a NOPA. Outstanding money owing Amendments to sections 91E(3), 91F(3) and the enactment of a new section 91J allow the Commissioner to decline to rule if an applicant has outstanding debts relating to earlier binding ruling applications. EXTENSION OF TIME BAR (Section 108B) Introduction The amended legislation puts it beyond doubt that waivers relating to tax periods before 1 October 1996 are legally valid if entered into on or after 17 November 1998. Background The disputes resolution process allows taxpayers to sign a waiver to extend by six months the four-year period that generally applies to amended assessments. This was a recommendation of the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department and was designed to allow taxpayers and Inland Revenue extra time, if needed, before the issue of a re-assessment. Section 108B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 was introduced in 1996 to provide that taxpayers could do this. As originally proposed, the amendment applied to all waivers. However, the majority of members of the parliamentary select committee that considered the bill were concerned that if it transpired that IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 43 Inland Revenue was incorrect and waivers already entered into for tax periods before 1 October 1996 were invalid, the amendment would have retrospective effect. Therefore the amendment does not apply to waivers signed and delivered to the Commissioner before 17 November 1998. Key feature The amendment to section 108B puts it beyond doubt that waivers relating to tax periods ending before 1 October 1996 are legally valid, although it applies only to waivers signed and delivered on or after 17 November 1998 (the date of the bill’s introduction). Waivers entered into before 17 November 1998 continue to be governed by the unamended legislation. Inland Revenue’s view remains that such waivers are valid. Application date The amendment applies to waivers signed and delivered on or after 17 November 1998. TAX IN DISPUTE AND USE OF MONEY INTEREST RULES (Sections 120 AA, 124 A(1), 128 (5-6) and 138I (4-5)) Introduction Amendments to the rules on tax in dispute and use of money interest confirm their application to disputes begun after the rules came into effect but for income years that predate their introduction. Other amendments confirm that these provisions apply regardless of section 1(2), which provides that the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies only to tax on income derived on the 1995-96 and subsequent income years. Background There has been doubt as to the application of the current tax in dispute and use of money interest rules to periods before the Tax Administration Act 1994 took effect. The amendments clarify the application of the rules to those periods. Key features Section 120AA has been inserted to provide that if the Commissioner is required to refund the qualifying tax in dispute paid, or the taxpayer to pay deferrable tax, the old use of money interest rules in sections 120 and 139 of the Income Tax Act 1994, and their predecessors, sections 34A and 398 of the Income Tax Act 1976, will still apply. The dispute must have begun before 20 May 1999, and the taxpayer must have indicated to Inland Revenue before that date his or her view that the old rules applied. Application date This amendment applies from 1 April 1997 Section 124 A(1) has been replaced, to provide that despite section 1(2), Part VIII of the Act relating to objections, applies to assessments or reassessments issued after 1 April 1995 and before 1 October 1996, regardless of the income year to which they relate. Application date This amendment applies from 1 October 1996 The addition of sections 128(5) and 138I (4) ensures that the use of money interest rules, introduced as part of the compliance and penalty legislation, apply from 1 April 1997 to calculate the interest payable on deferrable and non-deferrable tax. This is irrespective of whether the dispute relates to an income year before the 1997-98 income year. Also, sections 128(6) and 138I (5) provide that if a dispute relates to 1995-96 or an earlier income year and begins on or after 1 April 1997, the use of money interest rules will apply from the beginning of that dispute rather than the original due date. Application date The amendments apply from 20 May 1999. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 44 PROVISIONAL TAX AND USE OF MONEY INTEREST (Sections 120L and 183CA) Introduction Taxpayers will be allowed to specify the provisional tax instalment to which a payment applies. If they do not do so, Inland Revenue must apply the payment to the instalment to which it considers it relates. The amendment applies to the 1998-99 and subsequent years. Use of this provision prevents a payment automatically being applied to an earlier underpaid provisional instalment, effectively causing use of money interest to compound. A supporting refund provision has been introduced to deal with cases where interest on underpayments has compounded for the 1997-98 income year. If interest has been charged on underpaid provisional tax and is more than would have applied had the changes applied for the 1997-98 income year, Inland Revenue will refund the difference. Background It could previously be argued that the use-of-money interest provisions required payments towards a provisional tax instalment to be first applied to meeting accumulated interest in relation to earlier instalments, with any residual amount going towards the tax liability itself. This approach is generally suitable because it ensures that interest does not compound, which would increase the complexity of the calculations, both for taxpayers and Inland Revenue, and increase the overall amount owed. But for provisional tax, which usually has three payments due in relation to one income tax return, the general statutory rule of applying payments to interest first in cases of underpayment actually causes compounding of interest. Payments made on the second and third provisional tax instalment dates are first applied to meet any outstanding interest, rather than the provisional tax due. The policy intent was that payments apply first to provisional tax, with the residual amount, if any, applying to interest outstanding. The legislation has been clarified to confirm that policy intent. Not originally part of the bill, this matter was raised in submissions and later included in the bill on the recommendation of the Finance and Expenditure Committee. Key features Under section 120L, use of money interest on underpaid provisional tax instalments for the 1998-99 income year will be computed on a simple basis. If a provisional tax instalment is short paid, the next provisional tax instalment is not applied against the shortfall and resultant use of money interest, unless the taxpayer specifies that treatment. This ensures that the legislation is consistent with the original and agreed policy intention that use of money interest should not compound. Under section 183CA, taxpayers must apply to the Commissioner for a refund. They may request a use of money interest recalculation by way of an IR 960 form (an adjustment request) or a letter giving their name, IRD number and the relevant income year. In early September 1999 Inland Revenue will attempt to identify all taxpayers due refunds of more than $20 for the 1998/99 income year. Until this date some refunds will be issued with interest calculated on a compounding basis. Any assessment with interest calculated on a compounding basis before early September 1999 exceeding $20 will be corrected. Application date The amendment is effective from the 1998-99 income year. The remission provision applies to the 1997-98 income year. How the changes will be implemented 1998-99 tax year The legislative changes require Inland Revenue for the 1998-99 tax year and future tax years to apply payments of provisional tax instalments to the period to which it considers the payment relates. Interest charged on underpaid provisional tax instalments will be calculated on a “simple” basis, which means that if an instalment is underpaid the next instalment is not applied against the shortfall and resultant interest unless the taxpayer requests this to be done. Taxpayers can specify a particular provisional tax instalment to which a payment is to be applied. Inland Revenue will have the necessary computer changes in place by early September to calculate interest on a “simple” basis and will send a statement of account with details of the use of money interest adjustment to affected taxpayers. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 45 Inland Revenue will check all assessments issued for the 1998-99 income year and recalculate interest in accordance with the amended legislation. If a taxpayer has paid additional interest Inland Revenue will automatically refund amounts greater than $20. Smaller amounts will be transferred to the current income tax year if the account is in credit. For tax assessments for the 1998-99 year received before September, interest will continue to be calculated on a compounding basis. Taxpayers who have paid additional interest and who would like a refund before September can request an adjustment by using the adjustment request form IR 960 or by letter, giving their name, IRD number and the relevant income year. Taxpayers who believe their interest has been miscalculated or have not received a statement of account by the end of September can request an adjustment by using the IR 960 or by letter. 1997-98 income year The legislative change specifies taxpayers must apply in writing to receive an adjustment to use of money interest for the 1997-98 tax year. To minimise compliance costs, however, the computer changes in September will also check assessments issued for the 1997-98 tax year. Amounts of more than $20 will be refunded. Smaller amounts will be credited towards provisional tax due for the 1999-2000 tax year. Taxpayers who believe their interest has been miscalculated or who have not received a statement of account should write to Inland Revenue with details or complete the IR 960 form. Notices of proposed adjustment Some taxpayers have issued notices of proposed adjustment requested recalculation of interest calculated on a compounding basis. These have now been overtaken by the legislative change. These taxpayers should now write to Inland Revenue advising that they intend to withdraw their filed request for an adjustment as a result of the legislative change and await the adjustment to occur in September. Late payment charges The difference in the calculation of use of money interest will not attract the application of either shortfall penalties or a late payment penalty because use of money interest is not “tax” for the purposes of the Tax Administration Act 1994. REMISSION PROVISIONS (Section 174, 174AA and 3) Introduction The remission provisions in Part XI apply regardless of whether the remission relates to a penalty imposed in the 1994-95 or earlier income years. Background The compliance and penalty legislation introduced new remission provisions that provided clear rules for remitting civil penalties (other than shortfall penalties). It was intended that the remission provisions would apply to remissions relating to the 1994-95 income year and earlier years. However, as a result of the application of section 1(2), which states that the Tax Administration Act applies only to tax on income derived in the 1995-96 and subsequent years, this did not occur. This amendment ensures that taxpayers in similar positions receive similar remission treatment. Key features A new section 174 provides that despite section 1(2), an application for remission of penalties must be considered under Part XI of the Act, regardless of whether the remission relates to a penalty imposed in the 1994-95 or earlier income years. The former section 174, relating to the power of the Commissioner in respect of small amounts of refunds or tax payable, has been replaced with section174AA. The definition of “late payment penalty” in section 3 has been expanded to cover late payment penalties regardless of the period to which they relate, allowing application of the current remission provisions to those penalties. Application date The amendments apply from 20 May 1999. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 46 NON-RECOVERY OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF CIVIL PENALTIES (Section 174) Introduction The $20 threshold below which the Commissioner may not recover outstanding tax has been extended to cover late payment penalties, shortfall penalties and late filing penalties. This has been achieved by removing a provision that prevents this threshold applying to civil penalties. Background The restriction on writing off small amounts of civil penalties was carried over from the previous legislation and stemmed from a concern that those who have not complied in some way should not benefit from having small amounts of their tax liability remitted. In practice, the provision imposed both compliance and administrative costs, with little revenue benefit to offset those costs. The amendment provides a direct compliance cost benefit to taxpayers in this circumstance as well as reducing administration costs. Key features Section 174 is being amended to allow the Commissioner to choose not to recover all tax debts under $20 regardless of their nature. This means the Commissioner may now choose not to recover civil penalties, as previously required. Application date The amendment applies from 20 May 1999. TAX RECOVERY AGREEMENTS (Part XA Tax Administration Act 1994) (Section BH 1 Income Tax Act 1994) Introduction Several amendments have been made to the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 to enable tax recovery agreements made with other countries to have effect in New Zealand. Tax recovery agreements provide a mechanism by which participating countries can call on each other’s tax administration to recover tax from absconding debtors. Background Tax recovery agreements are becoming common internationally. Globalisation has prompted a rapid increase in international co-operation in economic and fiscal matters, including co-operation in tax administration. The OECD has recommended that Member countries consider adoption of tax recovery agreements, and is now developing a model agreement for likely inclusion in the OECD Model Tax Convention. It is expected that the New Zealand Government will enter into a tax recovery agreement only if the participating foreign state meets certain fundamental requirements. For example, it will need to have a system for the assessment and collection of tax that is acceptable to New Zealand and have a legal system that gives appropriate recognition to due process concerns. New Zealand will maintain a close working relationship with the competent authority of the foreign state. Therefore should complications arise at any stage of the collection process, the competent authorities will be able to develop a resolution that conforms to the requirements of the empowering legislation and the relevant agreement. Key features A new Part XA, entitled “Tax Recovery Agreements”, has been inserted into the Tax Administration Act 1994, and section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 has been amended. These amendments, together with several minor consequential changes, permit tax recovery agreements to be given force of law in New Zealand by way of Order in Council, and provide a further legislative framework for the operation of those agreements. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 47 They enable the Commissioner to exercise his usual powers of collection in relation to foreign tax claims that are the subject of a tax recovery agreement, or request the other state to collect outstanding New Zealand tax. The amendments also allow tax recovery provisions to be included within new or existing double tax agreements (DTAs). Practical application of a recovery agreement will be a straightforward process of debt collection. A typical case where New Zealand is called upon to collect foreign tax will proceed as follows: 1.New Zealand will receive a request for assistance in recovery, accompanied by relevant documentation, from a foreign state with which New Zealand has a relevant agreement. 2.New Zealand will review the request to ensure that it complies with the provisions of the agreement and the empowering legislation. 3.New Zealand will pursue recovery action, in the same way it would were the claim a New Zealand tax debt. 4.Following recovery (assuming the action is successful) the recovered amount will be paid over to the foreign state. Almost all of the key matters covered by the legislation are included within the new Part XA of the Tax Administration Act 1994: Application of Part XA Section 173A provides that Part XA applies to tax recovery agreements negotiated between the government of a territory outside New Zealand and the government of New Zealand. Definitions Section 173B contains several new definitions relevant to Part XA. These include “contested tax”, used in section 173G, which stipulates certain limitations on recovery action concerning contestability and age of tax claims. Section 173B also includes a definition of “tax recovery agreement” and “competent authority”. Empowerment Section 173C provides that tax recovery agreements may be given effect by Order in Council, in a similar manner to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 in relation to DTAs. However, whereas DTAs override anything in the Income Tax Act 1994 or any other enactment, section 173C provides that the extent to which tax recovery agreements override domestic law will be limited, in their application, by the provisions of Part XA. Taxes that may be recovered Section 173D provides that recoverable taxes are limited to those that are imposed by the laws of New Zealand and the other country, and are prescribed in the relevant tax recovery agreement. Essential documentation requirements A new section 173E stipulates the documentation that must accompany requests for assistance in recovery. This will include, for example, written particulars of the amount of the tax claim; the extent, if any, to which the requesting party considers that the tax claim is uncontested; a declaration that the request meets the terms of the relevant agreement; and a certified or notarized copy of the instrument permitting enforcement in the other country. Other documentation may be required under each agreement, although section 173E lists the essential documents that would be expected to accompany each request for assistance in recovery. Enforcement powers Section 173F provides that the Commissioner may exercise his usual powers of collection in carrying out recovery action under a tax recovery agreement. However, New Zealand use of money interest and penalties will not apply. Limitations on assistance in recovery Section 173G sets out limitations on the recovery of foreign tax by the Commissioner that concern the age of tax claims and whether they are contested. Under a tax recovery agreement the Commissioner will generally be obliged to collect uncontested tax claims (subject to the conditions of each individual treaty and the boundaries set out in the empowering legislation). The Commissioner will not, however, be obliged to collect a contested tax claim. Nevertheless, even if a tax claim is contested, in certain circumstances the Commissioner may choose to carry out recovery action - for example, when it appears the taxpayer is about to leave New Zealand or to re-locate or hide assets in an attempt to prevent recovery action. The Commissioner may do this only after consulting with the other country. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 48 The section provides that, to be recoverable under a tax recovery agreement, a tax claim must not have been outstanding as an uncontested tax liability longer than six years before the entry into force of the relevant agreement. The section also provides that the Commissioner is not obliged to comply with a request for assistance that has been made after a period of 15 years from the date that the tax claim first became uncontested. The rationale for this rule, which is modelled on a draft OECD proposal, is that a 15-year period provides a balance between providing sufficient time for disputes to be settled domestically before foreign assistance is required, and allowing a requested state to avoid the obligation to collect unacceptably old debt. Process when objection raised Section 173H provides a process that taxpayers may follow if they believe recovery action should not be taken. They may present their case to the New Zealand competent authority and request that the competent authority of the other state be informed. The New Zealand competent authority must then, without undue delay, endeavour to resolve the matter with them or the other competent authority. This approach replicates the mutual agreement procedure that is usually included in tax treaties. Right of Appeal A new section 173I provides a taxpayer who believes that recovery action should not be taken with a right of appeal to the District Court. Commissioner’s Certificate A new section 173J provides that, if the Commissioner determines assistance in recovery of a foreign tax claim may be given, he may produce and sign a certificate stating that the request complies with Part XA. In proceedings relating to recovery of the tax claim the certificate will be, in the absence of proof to the contrary, sufficient evidence of the matters certified. Tax recovery agreements may be negotiated on a stand alone basis, or as part of new or existing DTAs. The amendment to section BH1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 extends the purpose of a DTA to include giving assistance in the recovery of tax claims. This is to allow for tax recovery provisions to be included within DTAs. However, whereas DTAs override anything in the Income Tax Act 1994 or any other enactment, any DTA which contains a tax recovery agreement will be subject to the conditions set out in Part XA. Other, consequential, amendments include deeming the meaning of “tax” and “income tax” to include taxes prescribed in a tax recovery agreement, and the insertion of a definition of the term “contested act of assistance”, used in sections 173H and 173I. Application date The amendments apply from 20 May 1999, the date of enactment. Although the amendments will enable tax recovery agreements to have effect, New Zealand’s first such agreement (negotiated with the Netherlands) is not expected to enter into force until late 1999. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 49 GST ON OVERSEAS MAIL DELIVERY IN NEW ZEALAND (Section 11(2)(caa) of the GST Act) Introduction Delivery services fees charged to an overseas postal organisation by a supplier of postal services in New Zealand have been zero-rated. Background Postal services in New Zealand were not zero-rated previously because of the connection of the services with moveable personal property in New Zealand (that is, the mail). This meant that postal services were treated differently from other delivery services in respect of goods entering New Zealand. Agreements between international postal authorities treat the delivery of overseas mail as a service provided to the sender. As such, taxing the fees charged for delivering overseas mail in New Zealand would be against the intention of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, since consumption of the delivery service is considered to occur outside New Zealand. Key feature A new paragraph in section 11(2) specifically zero- rates delivery service fees charged to overseas postal organisations for the delivery of overseas mail in New Zealand. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 1999. Changes to other Acts MINOR REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS (Sections 30, 41 and 56 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992) The Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 has been amended to: Ensure that the terminal repayments of borrowers with a tax agent are due at the same time as their terminal income tax. This amendment follows that made last year to the Income Tax Act 1994 which extended the terminal tax due date for taxpayers with an agent who has an extension of time arrangement by two months. Correct two drafting errors made in the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act (No. 2) 1998 in relation to the interest write-off and refund provisions. Application dates The amendment to the payment dates applies from the 1997-98 income year. The corrections apply from the original application dates contained in the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act (No. 2) 1998. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 50 Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Draft general depreciation determination on growing trays In Tax Information Bulletin Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999), we published a draft general depreciation determination for plastic growing trays used for producing forestry seedlings. After considering a submission received on the draft, we felt it inappropriate to issue a general depreciation determination based on that draft. If we consider that a general depreciation determination for growing trays should still be issued, a revised draft will be published for comment. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 51 Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. GST - registration threshold and whether Commissioner can amend deemed registration date Case:Iona Farm Limited v CIR Decision date:10 June 1999 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:GST, sales to self, registration threshold, deemed registration Summary The High Court found in favour of the Commissioner upholding the decision of the Taxation Review Authority. Facts Iona Farm was leased by the Objector to Mr B from 1965 to 1991 and then to a farming partnership of Mr B and his son. The son purchased the farm from the Objector pursuant to an agreement which was dated 11 July 1994 but was purported to be effective as of 1 April 1993. The vendor Objector was not registered for GST purposes and the rental it had been charging to the partnership was well below the GST registration threshold. The son registered for GST purposes with effect from 1 May 1994 and claimed a second hand goods input of $98,333.33. The Commissioner obtained a valuation of the open market rental of the property, which showed that the value was substantially in excess of the registration threshold. The Commissioner registered the objector and assessed output tax on the supply of the farm to the son. The Commissioner originally established a deemed registration of the Objector for GST as from 1 February 1994 and later amended the date of registration to 1 October 1986. This was in response to a letter from the Objector, which advised that the sale took place on 1 April 1993 and not 11 July 1994 as the sale and purchase agreement represented. The Objector challenged the GST assessment on the grounds that the open market rental for the farm did not exceed the GST registration threshold and secondly, because it was not lawful for the Commissioner to change the date of the GST registration having already identified one date as the deemed registration date. Decision Citing Trustees Executors and Agency Co of New Zealand v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,076 Justice Young stated that where a lease imposes on the lessee an obligation to meet liabilities which are Correction to previous case note In the previous edition of the Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 11, No5 we published case note TRA Number 98/ 11. Decision Number 009/99 “Whether property was sold as a going concern”. That case note contained factual errors in the last two sentences of the Facts section. Those sentences should have read: “The purchaser claimed a GST input of $16,666.67. The Commissioner took the view that the sale of the property should have attracted GST and reassessed the objectors with the amount paid out to the purchaser.” We apologise for any inconvenience caused by the errors. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 52 properly regarded as those of the lessor the cost of meeting such liabilities are held to be part of the value of the supply. His Honour went on to say that the present situation where the underlying obligation was created by the lease was a more difficult type of case. Justice Young held that the question should be determined by allowing the situation to be controlled by the way in which the lease is drafted. On this basis, the “goods” supplied must be regarded as the leasehold estate actually conferred by the lessor on the lessee. In the present case, the goods supplied were the leasehold estate created by the 1964 lease with all its advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantages included an obligation to eradicate weeds. Therefore the value of supply represented the market value of that leasehold interest. Accordingly, the inquiry in the present case under s 10(2) must be in terms of the open market value of the lease allowing for the obligations of the tenant as to weed and pest eradication. To come to the correct valuation a deduction for weed control costs should not be taken off the stock unit price. In relation to the section 51(4) issue, Justice Young stated that there is nothing in section 51(4) which suggests that the powers conferred by that section can only be exercised once. When the Commissioner fixed the second deemed registration date this action was within the scope of the section. His Honour held further that the Commissioner had made an error and that section 25(j) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1924 provided that the Commissioner could re-exercise his powers in that circumstance. Whether establishment fees paid to financial advisor were capital or revenue Case:TRA Number 96/92. Decision Number 010/99 Decision date:11 June 1999 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Establishment fees, capital v revenue costs Summary Judge Barber found that the establishment fees were revenue in nature and that the Commissioner had acted incorrectly in treating payment of the $1,292.00 as a capital payment. Facts The Objector was a qualified social worker who ran a small importing business and also received income from rents and interest. The Objector paid an establishment fee to a financial advisor, for the restructuring of her investments of $30,000. The financial advisor gave the Objector a wide range of advice about investment in bonds, trusts, unit trusts, overseas investments and the like. There was also consideration of superannuation arrangements and life insurance with a focus on investment and a mix of equities. At the outset, the bulk of the Objector’s $30,000 investment portfolio was in fixed interest bank securities. The point of investing through the financial advisor was to save the Objector time. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction of the establishment fee on the grounds that it was a capital expense. Decision Judge Barber held that at all material times the Objector had an investment portfolio comprising of a series of carefully considered bank term deposits of varying durations and interest rates. These were regularly rolled over after negotiations by the objector with her bankers (and competitor bankers) regarding interest rates and terms and after consideration of alternative investment areas. The time came when the objector felt she would widen her investment criteria for her existing portfolio so she took advice from a financial advisor. The financial advisor designed a restructuring of her portfolio and gave her written advice on the type of new investments she should take up in place of her existing investments. Judge Barber stated that the Objector expanded her investment horizons after taking written advice from her financial advisor. She then allowed her $30,000 bank deposits investment portfolio to be reconstructed using not only her previous investment methods, but also other areas of investment - most of which she had herself considered previously but decided to be inappropriate at that time. Judge Barber stated that in simple terms, the issue here was whether the objector reviewed her $30,000 existing portfolio of bank deposits, or whether there was a complete reconstruction of her portfolio. Judge Barber held that the objector was an active investor. Judge Barber aligned the present case with CIR v North 20/03/99, No. AP 21/99, Auckland Registry, Justice Williams and stated that the present Objector’s investment aims did not alter fundamentally - the change was to her mix of investments. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 53 Whether late objection application properly declined Case:Bernard Joseph Wood v CIR - Judicial Review Decision date:9 June 1999 Act:Judicature Act 1908 Keywords:Judicial Review proceedings Summary The application for review was dismissed Facts In October 1994 the Plaintiff wrote to the Commissioner requesting that late objections forthe 1984-1993 income years be accepted. The Commissioner declined. The decision of the Commissioner addressed the application in two steps. The first dealt with the taxpayer’s explanation for the lateness of his objection to the assessments, which had accepted the Plaintiff’s position in relation to his assessable income at face value. It was considered the delay was not adequately explained or reasonable. The second step was to consider the merits and whether, as a matter of fairness, the late objection should be accepted. It was decided that, prima facie, the claim had merit but that it was not unfair to decline the application to object out of time. Decision The Court found that it could not be said that there was a clear entitlement to a deduction for losses incurred on the sale of shares, and, secondly, the Commissioner did consider the merits of the taxpayer’s entitlement to a deduction in such circumstances. The Court held that the Commissioner did take into account the taxpayer’s assertion, both through his accountants and through his solicitors, that he was unaware of the proper tax treatment of his profits and losses from his share transactions. The Commissioner regarded that consideration as outweighed by other considerations. The Court also found that the Commissioner had considered the issue of fairness in some detail and dismissed the challenge to the decision of the Commissioner. Whether settlement sum assessable income Case:Jeffery Burgess Sayer v CIR Decision date:8 June 1999 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Settlement payment, in respect of or in relation to employment, apportionment Summary The High Court held that a settlement sum received by the Objector subsequent to an Employment Court Award was assessable income. The receipt, although derived from an assignment of legal rights, had sufficient nexus with the employment of the Objector. Facts The Objector obtained judgment in the Employment Court against a former employer for wrongful termination of employment. The judgment awarded $62,000 for loss of earnings and $50,000 for humiliation. The employer company was by then in liquidation and the judgment debt was unsatisfied. The Objector commenced and then settled proceedings against directors and shareholders of the parent company of the former employer for $100,000. The Commissioner advised the Objector that he proposed to assess $50,000 of the amount received as compensation for loss of earnings. An objection was disallowed and the Objector requested a case be stated to the High Court. Decision As to the first issue of whether any part of the sum received by the Objector was assessable income, his Honour Justice Doogue held that it was. The Objector was forced by the liquidation of his former employer to seek other means of recovering the debt arising from the Employment Court judgment. These steps included the taking of proceedings against the employer’s shareholders and directors. At the time of settlement the Objector claimed he was owed over $130,000 by the former employer. There was no evidence before the Court that this enlarged amount was in any way due to claims other than the settlement of the employment dispute. His Honour held that authorities such as Marac, Buckley & Young, Smythe, Reid and NZ Forest Research Institute did not assist the Objector. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 54 The essence of such decisions was that the true nature of the transaction can only be ascertained by careful consideration of the legal arrangements actually entered into and not on the broad substance of the transaction. His Honour found that the Deed of Settlement itself was fatal to the Objector’s claim as it specifically apportioned all but $1 of the settlement sum to the assignment of the employment-related claim. “If the Deed had been silent about the consideration for the assignment of the company claim, the position of the Objector would undoubtedly be strong under this head, but when the deed is specific as to the consideration for the assignment ... the position is otherwise. The Court cannot go behind the Objector’s own document and state that the deed was in consideration of the settlement of proceedings against the directors and shareholders of the company when all but one dollar of the consideration was applied to the assignment of the company claim.” The Objector also challenged the apportionment by the Commissioner of $50,000 of the settlement sum as monetary remuneration. He cited the Australian authorities of McLaurin v FCT and Allsop v FCT; both decisions of the Full Court of the High Court of Australia. His Honour distinguished both cases on the basis that, although settlement sums were arrived at with reference to calculations of the payer as to constituent losses, the final settlements were lump sums accepted in full satisfaction of the entirety of the appellant’s claims. In the Objector’s case, there was no evidence to suggest there was any claim for unliquidated damages against the company. All but one dollar of the sum received was referable to ‘all claims’ against the employer. There was no evidence before the Court of any other possible claim the Objector was able to bring against the employer. As such, the sum received represented liquidated damages claims against the company at that time. The Court held that the Commissioner’s apportionment of that sum into assessable and non-assessable components was consistent with the proportioning of the original judgment amounts. Fringe Benefit Tax - whether company vehicle was available for private use Case:Yes Accounting Services Limited v CIR Decision date:17 June 1999 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Meaning of availability, Fringe benefit Summary The High Court confirmed the decision of the Taxation Review Authority which found in favour of the Objector regarding the availability of a motor vehicle for the private use and enjoyment of shareholder employees. Facts The Objector is a private company which provides accountancy services. The sole shareholders and directors are a husband and wife. The Objector owns a Ford Fairmont motor vehicle, which was used exclusively for the purposes of the company at all relevant times. A logbook maintained by the company verified sole business use. The husband and wife personally owned another vehicle, which they used for their private purposes. The wife, acting as secretary for the company wrote a letter to her husband sometime in 1991, but backdated it to 21 November 1989, stating to him that the Ford Fairmont is not available for private purpose in order to ensure that FBT is not payable. In the Taxation Review Authority, Judge Willy found that from the outset the company policy was that the Fairmont would not be used for private purposes. His Honour was also satisfied that it never had been so used. Therefore, the decision was that the vehicle can not be available for private use if the company policy forbids that use and providing it is not in fact used for private purposes. Decision Justice Anderson found in favour of the Objector stating that he was satisfied that there was an adequate evidential basis for the TRA to find that, regardless of the backdating of the restriction letter, from the outset the company policy was that the IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 55 vehicle would not be used for private purposes and the company and the husband and wife (as employees) fully appreciated and respected the policy. His Honour made some useful obiter comments that could be of assistance to the Commissioner in future cases. His Honour stated that it would have been preferable if the directors of the company had, in that capacity, passed a directors’ resolution from the beginning and if the husband and wife, in their capacity as employees, had in writing acknowledged and agreed to be bound by that direction. In this case, however, there is no suggestion other of than a bona fide treatment of the vehicle by the husband and wife in their various capacities. His Honour also stated that he found compelling the Objector’s submission that the word “so” in sub clause (b) of section 336N(1) invests “availability” with connotations of permission by the proprietor of the motor vehicle i.e. lawful availability. In Anderson J’s opinion it is untenable that a person could be liable for FBT because the circumstances would not prevent the tortious or criminal conversion of a motor vehicle by a dishonest employee. His Honour also stated that the meaning of “availability” is affected by its legislative context which in this case is the whole of the definition of “fringe benefit”. At page 7 of the decision His Honour stated: “”Availability” for the purposes of assessment of fringe benefit tax connotes a situation which the owner, lessor, or hirer of a motor vehicle has permitted. In any particular case whether such a situation exists will depend on the particular facts which may include the reality of a situation whatever the purported documentation might be.” Disposal of proceedings; Disputant’s claim struck out Case:TRA Number 97/86. Decision Number 012/99 Decision date:18 June 1999 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Facts The Disputant is a film production company. The Commissioner issued a NOPA in 1997 following a full review of the Disputant’s Income Tax, GST and FBT affairs. Substantial adjustments were proposed for the Disputant’s 1991 - 1993 income tax returns and GST periods from 1992 - 1997. FBT adjustments were proposed for quarters from 1993-1996. Some of the adjustments were agreed to by the Disputant in March 1997. The issues were: expenditure disallowed, disputed revaluations, depreciation disallowed and/or overclaimed, income not returned, penalties non- deductible, GST output tax understated and input tax overstated, and FBT on a motor vehicle and an overdrawn shareholder’s current account. Total tax in dispute exceeded $580,000. Decision The case came on for hearing on 20 July 1998. The Disputant advised the Authority by letter that it would not participate in, nor be represented at the hearing. The Commissioner sought an order dismissing the challenge and Judge Willy reserved his decision. Judge Willy stated in a brief judgment: “Because the procedure used in this case was not that of the usual case stated, I reserved the question of the appropriate way of disposing of the proceeding. In the circumstances I consider that the proper order is to strike out the objector’s statement of claim and to affirm the Commissioner \[sic\] assessments of 27 March 1997.” IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 56 Standard practice statements These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. Late Filing Penalty Introduction This Standard Practice Statement states the Commissioner’s practice on the charging of late filing penalties in instances where returns or Employer Monthly Schedules have not been filed by the due date. The passing of the Tax Administration Amendment Act (No 2) 1996 provided for a new penalty regime, including a penalty for late filing of certain return types. Prior to this, avenues available for pursuing overdue returns were restricted to the issue of default assessments and prosecution for failure to furnish in selected cases. The late filing penalty provisions were enacted by Parliament to provide an incentive for taxpayers to voluntarily comply with their filing obligations. Application This Standard Practice Statement applies from 1 August 1999. Legislation Under section 139A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), the late filing penalty applies to: Income tax returns for the 1997/1998 and subsequent years, ACC premium statements and PAYE reconciliation statements for 1997/1998 and subsequent years, ACC residual claims levy statements from the 1998/1999 year, and Employer Monthly Schedules from 1 April 1999. With the exception of Employer Monthly Schedules, the Commissioner must give at least 30 days notice before charging a late filing penalty. The Commissioner may do this by written notice, or by public notification. If the outstanding return is filed within the 30-day period, (or an extension of time is granted to file an income tax return), the penalty will not be charged. The Amount of the late filing penalty is prescribed in Section 139A (3), as follows: 1. Income tax returns: Amount of Net IncomeLate Filing Penalty Less than $100,000$50 From $100,000 to $1,000,000$250 Greater than $1,000,000$500 2. ACC premium statements, PAYE and ACC earner premium reconciliation statements, ACC residual claims levy statements and Employer Monthly Schedules: The late filing penalty is $250 per statement or schedule. Commissioner’s practice for charging the late filing penalty The Commissioner’s practice is that the late filing penalty is charged on the following: income tax returns for individuals (IR 3 and IR 5) income tax returns for companies (IR 4), PAYE and ACC earner premium reconciliation statements (IR 68P) ACC employer premium statements and ACC residual claims levy statements (IR 68A), and Employer Monthly Schedules (IR 348 and IR 349). The late filing penalty will be charged in the following circumstances: 1. Income tax returns When 30 days notice of imposition of the penalty has been given and: a) The return is not filed by the due date, and is not subject to an extension of time arrangement (EOT). b) The return is subject to an individual extension of time arrangement, and is not filed by the date agreed to when the EOT was granted. c) A client is removed from the A list of an agent, resulting in the loss of EOT for the return, and the return is not filed by the date specified when the extension of time was withdrawn. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 57 d) An extension of time arrangement is withdrawn from a client of an agent, and the return is not filed by the date specified when the extension of time was withdrawn. e) An extension of time arrangement is withdrawn from all clients of an agent, and the returns are not filed by the date specified when the extension of time was withdrawn. f) The return is for a client of an agent with EOT and is not filed by the 31st of March of the year immediately following the income year to which the return applies. The amount of the penalty for outstanding income tax returns is determined from the taxpayer’s previous year’s net income. If Inland Revenue has no information on which to base the late filing penalty, the minimum penalty of $50 is charged, and when the return is received the amount of penalty is checked and amended if necessary. If the original late filing penalty is reversed and an amended one charged, time will be given to pay any additional penalty. The minimum penalty remains payable if the return is subsequently filed and shows a loss. 2. PAYE and ACC earner premium reconciliation statements, ACC employer premium statements and ACC residual claims levy statements When 30 days notice of imposition of the penalty has been given and: a) The reconciliation or statement has not been filed by 31 May of the year to which the statement relates, or b) The employer has ceased employing and the reconciliation or statement has not been filed by the date required. 3. Employer Monthly Schedules When the schedule has not been filed by the due date. Commissioner’s practice for reversal or remission of the penalty The Commissioner’s practice is that the late filing penalty may be reversed if: The return was filed before the date the late filing penalty was charged, but had not been ‘lodged’ by Inland Revenue, or The tax return or Employer Monthly Schedule was not required to be filed, or The taxpayer was a client of an agent with EOT and the link had not been updated because of error or delay by Inland Revenue, or The taxpayer is a client of an agent, had previously been denied an EOT because of outstanding returns, and the outstanding returns were filed by the due date for the current year and the taxpayer is subsequently granted EOT for the current year, or Although registered as an employer, the tax- payer did not pay any salary or wages, (applies to Employer Monthly Schedules, PAYE and ACC earner premium reconciliation statements (IR68P) and ACC statements (IR68A)). The Commissioner’s practice is that the late filing penalty may be remitted if the legislative criteria of either (a) reasonable cause or, (b) highest net revenue over time, are met. (Sections 183A and 183D of the TAA). Remissions under these sections are covered in Standard Practice Statement RDC-2. The Commissioner’s practice is that the late filing penalty will not be remitted if: The taxpayer has EOT as a client of an agent, but the agent had not notified us before the late filing penalty was charged. The taxpayer gains EOT as a client of an agent, or gains an individual extension oftime arrangement, after the late filing penalty is charged. Summary In summary the practice for the late filing penalty is as follows: The Commissioner will give 30 days notice of the intention to impose the late filing penalty for outstanding income tax returns, PAYE and ACC earner premium reconciliation statements, ACC premium statements and ACC residual claims levy statements. The late filing penalty will be charged on identified outstanding IR 3, IR 4, and IR 5 income tax returns, the PAYE and ACC earner premium reconciliation statements (IR 68P), ACC premium statements and ACC residual claims levy statements (IR 68A), and Employer Monthly Schedules (IR 348 and IR 349). The amount of the late filing penalty is prescribed in Section 139A (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The penalty can only be remitted if the legislative criteria of reasonable cause or highest net revenue over time are met. (Sections 183A and 183D of the Tax Administration Act 1994) This Standard Practice Statement was signed by me on 18 June 1999. Michael Rapson Manager, Technical Standards IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 58 Disputes Resolution - Content standards for Notice of Proposed Adjustment and Notice of Response Introduction This Standard Practice Statement sets out the Commissioner’s practice applied to the content standards for Notices of Proposed Adjustment and Notices of Response Application This Standard Practice Statement applies from 1 August 1999. Background The Disputes Resolution rules introduced an open, “all cards on the table” approach to tax disputes, with the aim of resolving tax disputes fairly, quickly and efficiently. The process requires the exchange of certain information between the Commissioner and a taxpayer, and begins when one party issues a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPA”) to the other. If the recipient of the NOPA disagrees with the proposed adjustment, that party must reject any or all of the proposed adjustments within a two month response period by issuing a Notice of Response (“NOR”). If a NOR is not issued within that timeframe and there are no exceptional circumstances as defined in the Tax Administration Act 1994 the NOPA recipient is deemed to have accepted the proposed adjustments in the NOPA. There has been some confusion about what information must be in the NOPA and NOR. This has lead to claims that a NOPA or NOR was invalid because of alleged information shortcomings, and on occasion resulted in the deemed acceptance of proposed adjustments because the response period expired before alleged deficiencies could be made good. This is a critical outcome for a taxpayer; deemed acceptance finalises the dispute and the taxpayer no longer has the right to challenge the Commissioner before the Courts. The Commissioner does not consider deemed acceptance in these circumstances appropriate or in keeping with the stated aims of the disputes resolution rules. To remove some of the misconceptions and help taxpayers who wish to dispute assessments or proposed adjustments, this standard practice statement sets out the relevant tax laws, the Commissioner’s practice on applying those laws, and associated practical issues. Legislation All legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“the Act”). Section 89F gives a list of content headings for a NOPA, and section 89G(2) gives a similar list for a NOR. Both sections incorporate a standard which governs the content headings and acts as a guide to the amount and quality of the information required. These are guidelines, so they are flexible and permit NOPA and NOR to have a wide variance in content, style and detail, with the result that the amount and quality of information they contain can vary considerably and still comply with the law. When information provided under the content headings is full and complete (i.e. of a high quality) problems and misunderstandings are unlikely to arise. They are more likely to occur when information content is minimal or of a lesser quality. From 1 April 1999, the tax laws which govern the content of a NOPA and a NOR are as follows: NOPA 89F A notice of proposed adjustment must be in the prescribed form and contain, with sufficient detail to reasonably inform the recipient, - (a) The items in a disputable decision or a tax return that the issuer of the notice proposes should be adjusted; and (b) The tax laws on which the adjustments are based; and (c) An outline of the facts giving rise to the adjustments; and (d) The legal issues arising in respect of the adjustments; and (e) The propositions of law relied on or distinguished in respect of the adjustments. NOR 89G(2) A response notice must, with sufficient detail to reasonably inform the recipient,- (a) Specify the items in the notice of proposed adjustment that the issuer of the response notice considers to be in error; and (b) Specify the tax laws on which the issuer of the response notice relies; and (c) Outline the facts contained in the notice of proposed adjustment that the issuer of the response notice considers to be in error; and (d) Outline any further facts on which the issuer of the response notice relies; and (e) Outline any additional legal issues that the issuer of the response notice considers arise in respect of the notice of proposed adjustment; and (f) State the propositions of law relied upon in respect of the response notice. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 59 Commissioner’s Approach The standard for NOPA content is defined by the wording “must ... contain, with sufficient detail to reasonably inform the recipient” which precedes and governs the required content list. The same standard, only this time without the word “contain”, precedes and governs the required content list for the NOR. Essentially, each standard requires a NOPA or NOR issuer to provide enough factual and relevant details for the recipient of the notice to understand why a tax adjustment or determination is proposed or rejected. Case law when applied to the words “sufficient detail to reasonably inform” indicates that the circumstances and background to a dispute must be taken into account. These include any information already available or known to the recipient of a NOPA or NOR. Previously it was suggested that NOPA and NOR content should have enough detail to inform a reader who lacked prior knowledge of the disputed issue. This viewpoint overlooked an important factor in the disputes resolution process, i.e. that the Commissioner and a specific taxpayer (whether or not through a tax agent or legal advisor) are always the issuer and recipient of a NOPA and a NOR. (Which party is the issuer and which is the recipient depends on who began the process.) In most instances, before this there will have been some form of interaction between the two; e.g. the taxpayer will have issued a NOPA following receipt of the Commissioner’s assessment of a return filed by the taxpayer, or a determination such as tax residency status. If the Commissioner has issued the NOPA, this is likely to have followed a GST audit, income tax or other investigation involving the taxpayer. However the dispute started any earlier interaction between Commissioner and taxpayer would be evidence that both parties had entered the disputes resolution process with an awareness of the issues in dispute. These and other circumstances, including whether the taxpayer is represented by a tax agent or legal advisor, should be considered when the standards of sections 89F and 89G(2) are applied to the content of NOPA and NOR. The Commissioner believes he has a statutory obligation to inform taxpayers fully which goes beyond that required by sections 89F and 89G(2). In keeping with that wider obligation, Inland Revenue will always attempt to issue NOPA and NOR which are complete, fully detailed and of a high standard. A frank and complete exchange of information by both parties is implicit in the spirit and intent of the disputes resolution process. Inland Revenue therefore expects that taxpayers, their tax agents and legal advisors, will to the best of their ability also issue complete and fully detailed NOPA and NOR. The disputes resolution process was neither intended nor designed to be unduly difficult or costly for taxpayers who want to dispute a tax matter. However, the reality is that some taxpayers may struggle with the requirements, particularly if they do not have professional assistance. While Inland Revenue encourages taxpayers to issue NOPA and NOR with a high standard of information content, it would be unrealistic to expect this in every instance. The issuer of a NOPA or a NOR is not bound by or restricted to the content of that notice. However, it must contain sufficient relevant information to satisfy the legislative requirement that it “reasonably inform” the intended recipient. Although Inland Revenue prefers and encourages a high standard of NOPA and NOR content, mere brevity and lack of precision do not nullify a notice which directs the attention of the recipient to the necessary information. The following examples show how this can be achieved: Content standard for taxpayer- generated NOPA From 1 April 1999 section 89F requires taxpayers (including tax agents and legal advisors) to use an IR 210 Cover Sheet when issuing a NOPA. Inland Revenue recommends using the full IR 210 to complete the NOPA, as this form covers each of the content headings listed in section 89F. Using the full form is optional; taxpayers may instead complete the NOPA by way of a letter or typewritten sheets attached to the IR 210 cover sheet. Whichever option is used the NOPA should include all available relevant information In keeping with the aim and spirit of the disputes resolution process, this should be as complete and detailed as is possible. Following the format of the IR 210 form by listing each content heading and responding to each in turn will ensure that nothing is omitted. Some examples of how to inform the Commissioner and satisfy the requirements of tax law follow. Note that the examples are not exclusive and that other possibilities exist: (a) The items in a disputable decision or a tax return that the issuer of the notice proposes should be adjusted Inland Revenue needs to know the type and amount of each proposed adjustment as well as the tax return period involved. Reference should be as specific as possible e.g. “Increase 1998 travel expenditure by $1,500 to $4,365”; “1999 Repairs and Maintenance understated by $3,615”; or “Outputs overstated by $5,000 June/July 1998”. Directing Inland Revenue to an earlier letter which clearly sets out information about the type and IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 60 amount of proposed adjustment is also acceptable, e.g. “Determination of Loss (date)”; or “See my/your letter (date)”. (b) The tax laws on which the adjustments are based Wherever possible, identify the particular tax laws relating to the proposed adjustment. A taxpayer who does not have access to a copy of the tax laws through a tax agent, legal advisor, Citizens Advice Bureau, or local library etc. can ask Inland Revenue for help. Should our help be sought, then subject to the information supplied by the taxpayer, Inland Revenue may suggest certain tax laws could apply and will provide a photocopy of these. Any decision about application and use of a particular tax law in the context of their NOPA or NOR remains with the taxpayer. However, a general reference such as “The Income Tax Act” or “The Goods and Services Tax Act” is also acceptable if it is clear from the type of proposed adjustment and overall content of the NOPA that certain tax laws will be involved, e.g. a dispute involving depreciation in year of sale (1998) must involve section EG 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994. In some instances, reference to the content of a disputed income tax or GST return may also direct the Commissioner’s attention to the relevant tax laws. (c) An outline of the facts giving rise to the adjustments In practice most taxpayers tend to provide more rather than less information under this heading. Inland Revenue encourages and prefers this approach, as it helps us to understand the taxpayer’s point of view and ensures that we have the correct facts. The law requires an “outline” i.e. a description omitting details. This can be in the form of a brief statement e.g. “The four wheel drive was purchased for use only in my plumbing business” or “I am able to claim 100% depreciation and expenses because the mower was bought for the factory lawns”. When the adjustment item has been discussed in previous correspondence, reference to this by date(s) or a statement such as “For the reasons previously given, the Commissioner was wrong in fact and in law to treat profit from the sale of 24 Red Dwarf Drive, Galaxy, as 1998 taxable income” is also acceptable. (d) The legal issues arising in respect of the adjustments These are the questions to be decided and answered about the matters in dispute. There may only be one legal issue in a dispute or there may be several. The questions can take any form, and be simply put, e.g. “Am I able to claim 100% of expenses and depreciation for the four wheel drive?” Also acceptable is a statement such as “Tax law allows me to claim 100% of four wheel drive expenses and depreciation”. Often, the information provided under headings (a), (b) and (c) will indicate what the legal issues are. (e) The propositions of law relied on or distinguished in respect of the adjustments Under this heading, statements are made about how the law supports the proposed adjustments in the particular situation. The statements have more value when made not merely as a statement of opinion, but supported by reasoning and authority such as tax laws or case law i.e. Court decisions about how the law should be applied. Although other authorities can be used to illustrate support or acceptance for the taxpayer’s view, e.g. IRD rulings, TIB articles, etc. they carry less weight. “Distinguished” means showing why a particular tax law or Court decision which would usually apply, does not in these particular circumstances. Within the disputes resolution process a proposition of law includes any or all of the following: reference to tax laws, e.g. “Section DH 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 allows 100% expenditure and depreciation deduction for business vehicles”, “Section BD 2(1)(b)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 1994 applies”, or “See tax laws” case law (Court decisions) e.g. “Case N8 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,052” publications, e.g. “TIB Volume Nine, No.8 at page 12” IRD rulings, public or policy statements, etc. a simple statement e.g. “The four wheel drive is a business vehicle, and its repairs and maintenance costs are deductible” Inland Revenue encourages taxpayers to identify and include relevant propositions of law in their NOPA, although we realise that this may not always be possible. If no specific propositions of law are included, we will treat the tax laws referred to in the NOPA as being the propositions of law on which the taxpayer has relied. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) 61 Content standard for taxpayer- generated NOR Preparing a NOR involves more precise attention to information detail than preparing a NOPA. Inland Revenue recommends using an IR 210A when preparing a NOR, to ensure that each content heading listed in section 89G(2) is considered. Use of this form is optional; taxpayers may complete a NOR by way of a letter or typewritten sheets. Whichever option is used, all available relevant information should be included in the NOR. In keeping with the aim and spirit of the disputes resolution process, this should be as complete and detailed as is possible. Following the format of the IR 210A by listing each content heading and responding to each in turn will ensure that nothing is omitted. Some examples of how to provide sufficient information to inform the Commissioner and comply with tax law follow. Note that the examples are not exclusive and other possibilities exist: (a) Specify the items in the notice of proposed adjustment that the issuer of the response notice considers to be in error Although it can be helpful to do so, a NOR issuer is not required to say why an item is in error (disputed) under this heading. The information supplied elsewhere in the NOR should explain why the item is disputed. The word “specify” in the heading means each disputed item must be identified. There are several ways of doing this. If the taxpayer disagrees with all the proposed adjustments in the NOPA, a statement such as “The proposed adjustments are wrong” will make this clear. If one or more of a number of proposed adjustments are disagreed with, each must be identified, e.g. “Items a, c, e, and f are wrong”, or “Proposed adjustment amounts of $6,259.00, $3,400.00 and $1,321.00 are incorrect”. When the disagreed adjustments include several which can be combined together under a recognisable description, (e.g. adjustments which obviously all relate to vehicle repairs and maintenance) a statement such as “Repairs and maintenance items totalling $5,690.00” with separate identification of the other disputed adjustments is acceptable. (b) Specify the tax laws on which the issuer of the response notice relies The word “specify” again requires the NOR issuer to identify the tax laws relied on. Frequently these will be the same tax laws as the Commissioner has relied on in his NOPA, although the two parties disagree about how they should apply in the particular circumstances. When this occurs, a reference to the NOPA with a comment such as “See NOPA” or “As stated by the Commissioner” is sufficient. A NOR issuer may consider tax laws other than those quoted in the Commissioner’s NOPA apply. In this situation the Commissioner must be given at least the relevant Parts of the Act, section references, or enough information under this heading or elsewhere in the NOR for him to be able to identify the tax laws the issuer has relied on. (c) Outline the facts contained in the notice of proposed adjustment that the issuer of the response notice considers to be in error The NOR issuer is not required to say under this heading why any fact may be in error (although this would be helpful) merely to identify those which are. The information supplied under the next heading (d) should explain why a NOPA fact is disputed. Only an outline is needed; directing the Commissioner’s attention to the relevant paragraph, page number, or any other recognisable feature is one way to indicate which facts are in error. If none of the facts in the NOPA are in error, writing “Facts agreed” makes this clear, and is preferable to leaving that section of the IR 210A NOR blank. (d) Outline any further facts on which the issuer of the response notice relies The NOR issuer should show here any facts to be considered which were not included in the NOPA. The Commissioner needs to know why any NOPA fact is disputed. He also needs to be told about facts he has overlooked or did not know when the NOPA was prepared, as additional information or new information may be all that is needed to resolve the dispute. As in the NOPA examples, this can take several forms, including a brief statement; e.g. “The four wheel drive was used only in my plumbing business. I have two other cars available for private use”. Reference to correspondence in which the additional facts were discussed, or interviews and meetings where proceedings were tape-recorded and/ or a subsequent transcript agreed, would also be adequate. (Dates should be given in each instance.) If facts were correctly stated in the NOPA and there are no additional facts to be taken into account, no entry is needed under this heading. However writing “none” or “not applicable” clarifies this to the Commissioner. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.6 (July1999) 62 (e) Outline any additional legal issues that the issuer of the response notice considers arise in respect of the notice of proposed adjustment As with a NOPA, these are the questions that need to be answered about the matters in dispute. A NOR issuer may consider there are legal issues over and above those in the NOPA as a result of additional facts not considered by the Commissioner, or the application of tax laws on which the Commissioner has not relied. Because only an outline is required, the information provided about additional facts and tax laws can make the Commissioner aware of further legal issues. If a question is asked or a statement made in everyday language e.g. “Am I allowed a deduction under section BD 2(1)(b) for factory floor repairs? or “Can I claim the cost of driveway repairs as home office expenses?” it will alert the Commissioner to any additional legal issues. (f) State the propositions of law relied upon in respect of the response notice As with a NOPA, a simple statement or reference to tax laws, Court decisions, publications or IRD rulings and statements that the taxpayer considers support rejection of the proposed adjustments is required. If the taxpayer relies on the Commissioner’s propositions of law, statements such as “See NOPA” or “Refer Commissioner’s propositions of law” clarify this. If this section of the IR 210A is left blank, any reference in the NOR to tax laws will be treated as a reference to the propositions of law on which the taxpayer is relying. General The examples give some guidance on the nature and quantity of information to include in a NOPA or NOR for it to comply with the standards required by the law. They are not exclusive; other possibilities exist and at all times regard must be had for the circumstances surrounding the dispute. Inland Revenue recommends that where possible, taxpayers seek professional guidance with the preparation of these notices. As demonstrated by the examples Inland Revenue intends to apply as broad an interpretation to the content of taxpayer-generated NOPA and NOR as the standards permit. Where necessary, we will ask taxpayers to clarify or expand aspects of their notice by providing additional information. Inland Revenue considers that this approach has a basis in case law and is consistent with the aims of the disputes resolution rules. Similarly, when the response period remaining permits we will ask taxpayers to provide any information needed to bring their document to the relevant minimum content standard. In this situation, the information must be written and issued to Inland Revenue prior to the end of the notice response period, otherwise the taxpayer will not have issued a NOPA or a NOR. To avoid the possibility of taxpayers finding they have run out of time before essential information can be provided, we recommend the issue of NOPA and NOR earlier rather than later in the response period. Only in the exceptional circumstances defined in section 89K(3) can the Commissioner accept a late notice as having been given within the response period. Note that the requirements for the third document of the disputes resolution process - the statement of position (SOP) described in section 89M - are much more formal and restrictive than those of section 89F for the NOPA and section 89G(2) for the NOR. Where Inland Revenue has issued a Disclosure Notice, and the outcome of the process is unfavourable to the taxpayer who challenges the Commissioner’s position before the Courts, both taxpayer and Commissioner will be limited by section 138G(1) to the contents of their respective SOP. Only in very unusual circumstances will the Courts allow the introduction of additional evidence, issues, or propositions of law not previously contained in the SOP. When Commissioner and taxpayer have exchanged and rejected NOPA and NOR, and it seems likely the dispute will proceed to adjudication (the final stage of the disputes resolution process) Inland Revenue strongly urges taxpayers to seek professional assistance before attempting to prepare an SOP.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 3 NEW LEGISLATION CHILD SUPPORT AMENDMENT ACT 1999 Introduction The amendments to the Child Support Act 1991 are the result of a recent review of the child support scheme to improve its efficiency. They: Allow greater discretion to write off penalties. Close the gap between the year in which income is earned and the year of assessment for most liable parents. Reduce the opportunities for abuse of the estimations provisions. Remove the inequities in the exemption provisions and ensure that the law reflects the original intent of these provisions. Allow overseas taxable income to be included in liable parents’ child support assessments. Introduce a number of other administrative measures that will allow greater flexibility in the administration of the child support scheme. Background Inland Revenue administers the child support scheme, set up in 1992. Nearly 700,000 people – including children, custodians and liable parents – are directly affected by the workings of the scheme. 1 The amendments are intended to improve the overall administrative efficiency of the child support scheme. Most are the result of a recent review of the administration of the scheme. Many of them take up, and in some cases build upon, a number of the recommendations of the Child Support Review 1994 Working Party. The original proposals relating to the year of assessment, as contained in the bill at introduction, were changed by the Social Services Committee so that the gap between the end of the income year and the beginning of the child support year could be closed completely. As a result of that, and because of the delayed enactment, several application dates were also changed from those originally proposed in the bill. The select committee also took the opportunity to include in the bill two minor drafting changes. Write-off penalties New sections 135A and 135B When payments of child support are late, an initial penalty of 10% (or a minimum of $5) of the unpaid amount is imposed, with an additional 2% on the outstanding balance (including penalties) every subsequent month. Inland Revenue has been able to write off these penalties only in very limited circumstances. Under this system, some new liable parents incurred significant debts before they had an opportunity to establish regular payment arrangements, while others were penalised for a small failure in situations beyond their control. Key changes The changes are expected to encourage voluntary compliance with the child support law by giving Inland Revenue greater flexibility to write off penalties, particularly when the liability first arises. The new section 135A requires that penalties be written off in two situations: When liable parents keep to debt repayment arrangements they entered into within three months of when the assessment for their first payment was issued. When an initial penalty is greater than the arrears to which it relates and the liable parent has no history of late payments. 1 “Custodian” may include a person entitled to receive spousal maintenance, “child support” may include spousal maintenance, and “liable parent” may include a person who is required to pay spousal maintenance. Spousal maintenance is a payment between two parties that may be awarded by the courts or arranged by private agreement, for the benefit of the recipient rather than his or her children. A person does not have to have children to receive spousal maintenance, and someone with children may receive both spousal maintenance and child support. The Child Support Amendment Act 1999 (99/1) was introduced into Parliament on 24 November 1998 as the Child Support Amendment Bill (No 5). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 4 The new section 135B allows Inland Revenue to exercise discretion in considering whether part or all of a penalty should be written off when: The liable parent had reasonable cause for the delay in payment, and took corrective action as soon as possible. “Reasonable cause” is defined to mean an event or circumstance that is beyond the control of the liable parent, including a serious illness, accident or disaster, and that caused a reasonable delay in the payment. In failing to pay on time, the liable parent had acted in good faith on the advice of an Inland Revenue officer, and that advice proved to be incorrect. The delay in payment was due to an honest oversight by a liable parent who has no history of previous late payment and who paid the debt as soon as he or she became aware of the oversight. The custodian has taken over responsibility for collecting the child support debt and it would be unfair or unreasonable to enforce collection of the remaining penalty. The discretionary changes recognise that late payments are not always entirely within the control of a liable parent. If the conditions for write-off are met and the penalty has already been paid, that amount will be refunded. Inland Revenue will publish guidelines to ensure consistent application of the new provisions. Application date These amendments apply from 24 July 1999. Income year of assessment Sections 2, 29, 30, (new) 38A, 39, 106, 235, 236. Child support is based on income earned by liable parents two years earlier because that is currently the most recent income information available to Inland Revenue when the assessment is made. Under the tax simplification initiatives contained in the Taxation (Simplification and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1998, Inland Revenue will receive information on the salary and wages paid to employees from employers each month. This will make it possible to calculate child support assessments on recent income, instead of waiting until after end-of-year tax returns have been filed. Key changes The changes are designed to achieve a closer match between the income on which an assessment is based and the current ability of a liable parent to provide financial support. From 1 April 2001, child support assessments of liable parents who are employees or beneficiaries will be based on their income for the year immediately preceding the child support year. 2 However, child support assessments must be issued in the preceding February to allow liable parents time to exercise their right to object to assessments. As only 10 months of income information will be available in February, the income for those 10 months will be grossed up to provide an annual income amount. There will be no need for an inflation factor to be applied to these incomes, so the existing provision for an inflation factor has been repealed. The following table compares the existing and new processes. 2 This will affect approximately 75 percent of liable parents. 3 “Current year” is the year in which child support is assessed and payable; CY-1 is the current year minus one; CY-2 is the current year minus two. Current systemEffective 1 April 2001 Income year on which 1April 1999 –1 April 2000 – assessment based31 March 2000 31 March 2001 Income baseActual incomePartially (CY-2)estimated income (CY-1) Child support year1 April 2001 –1 April 2001 – (Current year) 3 31 March 2002 31 March 2002 Gap between end12 monthsNo gap of income year and beginning of child support year When the full annual income amounts are known they will be compared against the amounts used in the child support assessments. If the final taxable income amount is at least $500 more or less than the estimated taxable income, Inland Revenue will reassess the liability. Other liable parents will continue to have their child support assessments based on their income of two years earlier. An inflation factor will be added to their incomes to bring them into line, as closely as possible, with those whose assessments are based on the previous year’s income. This inflation factor will be based on the average of headline inflation determined by the Consumer Price Index over the year ending on 31 December before the start of the child support year. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 5 Application date These amendments will take effect from 1 April 2001. Estimation of income Sections 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, (new) 44A, 45, 46, 90, 235, 237, (new) 151A. The rules on estimating income were designed to recognise that income earned two years earlier is not always a good indicator of current capacity to pay child support. These rules give relief to liable parents whose income has fallen by at least 15 percent from that on which their assessment is based. When this occurs they may ask for a new assessment based on an estimate of their income. However, the complexity of the procedures created difficulties for liable parents, custodians and the administration of the scheme. Particular problems identified were: Some liable parents who estimated their income part way through the year had already paid sufficient to cover their estimated liability for the full year. Despite this, they were still required to pay the minimum amount of $10 per week. This could result in custodians receiving too much child support, which had to be recovered. When liable parents chose to estimate their income, a reconciliation based on their income tax returns at the end of the year compared their estimate against their actual income in that year. Even if they revoked the estimation their finalised liability was based on their actual income in that year, which could mean they had to pay more or less than they would have had they not estimated. Some liable parents had taken advantage of the estimation provisions by not filing a tax return at the end of the year, which meant that a reconciliation could not be carried out. The law also allowed for use of money interest to be charged when child support is underpaid, in recognition of the monetary benefit gained by a liable parent through having the use of unpaid child support. Although this was intended to create an incentive to file tax returns, return filing is now partially enforced through the introduction of the late filing fee. The failure of liable parents who have estimated their income to file returns is also addressed through new measures in the amendment Act. Key changes When liable parents who have estimated their income do not file end-of-year tax returns to enable an end-of-year reconciliation, Inland Revenue will now be able to issue a reconciliation assessment for the amount that the liable parents would have been required to pay had they not estimated their income. Liable parents will be able to object to this reconciliation by filing a tax return for that income year within 28 days of receiving notification of the assessment. If they do not file a return within this period, the reconciliation stands. They will also be prevented from estimating again until they have filed their outstanding tax return(s). (Application date 24 July 1999) To ensure that liable parents who estimate their income and do file their income tax returns are not disadvantaged, all liable parents will have their liability capped at the amount they would have had to pay had they not estimated their income. (Application date 1 April 2000) Example 1 A liable parent is assessed on income of $60,000. She estimates her current year income will be $50,000 and her liability is reassessed. Her actual income for the year is $62,000. Her reconciliation assessment will be based on income of $60,000. Liable parents who, at the time they estimate, have already paid their liability for the full year based on their estimated income will not have to continue paying the minimum amount of $10 per week. This may lead to some custodians having to go on a social welfare benefit for the rest of the year. If that happens the State will waive its entitlement to retain any child support for that period so that the custodian does not incur a child support debt. (Application date 1 April 2000) Example 2 A single liable parent pays child support for 3 months based on income of $36,000 a year. He becomes unemployed and estimates his income for the year at $15,000. His liability is reduced to the minimum and he has already paid more than that, so is required to pay nothing for the rest of the child support year. The custodian goes onto a social welfare as a result of losing child support. When the reconciliation assessment is carried out the custodian may incur a debt for the period she was on the benefit, but the debt can be written off. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 6 When liable parents revoke their estimation, or no longer meet the threshold for estimating income, their child support liability will revert to what would have been payable had they not estimated; they will be required to pay the full amount, and there will be no end of year reconciliation. (Application date 1 April 2000) Although liable parents are still required to make their election to estimate in writing, they no longer have to do so on an “approved form”. However, they will be required to provide documentary evidence to support their estimation. (Application date 24 July 1999) The provisions for use of money interest have been repealed from the child support year beginning 1 April 1999. However, the change is not retrospective in effect because use of money interest is not applied until after the end of the child support year. Application dates Some of the changes can apply immediately, while others must apply from the beginning of the next child support year. The rest are timed to coincide with the changes in the year of assessment, 2001. Exemptions for long-term prisoners and hospital patients Sections 73, 74, 75 Some long-term prison inmates and hospital patients are exempted from paying child support in recognition of their limited opportunity to earn income. However, in the past they generally qualified only if they were in prison or hospital for the full child support year; they did not receive it for part years. The exemption was not available to patients in private hospitals or people in residential care. Nor was it available to patients in public hospitals who were social welfare beneficiaries, even though the combination of the reduced benefit and automatic child support deduction left them with only $17.08 a week from which to meet all their personal needs. To qualify for the exemption, liable parents had to have no income for the child support year or, if their income was solely from investments, it could not exceed $520 gross. This meant that liable parents could be required to pay a full year’s child support even if they were released from hospital or prison in the last few weeks of the child support year and their only income after release was a social welfare benefit. Key changes Exemptions from child support liability are now available for the liable parent’s full period of imprisonment or hospitalisation if longer than 13 weeks, and he or she meets the income criteria. The income will be calculated on a weekly basis for periods of more than 13 weeks but less than a full child support year. The exemptions have also been extended to include long-term hospital patients whose sole income is a reduced social welfare benefit and those who are in private hospitals and residential care institutions. Liable parents who are granted an exemption from child support will no longer need to reapply at the beginning of each new child support year. Application date These amendments apply from 24 July 1999. Notice of assessment Sections 88,136 Section 88 specified what had to appear in a notice of assessment, even though the content was not always appropriate or necessary. The section also required a notice of assessment to be issued every time a parent’s income was reassessed, even if there was no change in the amount payable. This meant liable parents sometimes received notices that contained no new information. Key changes The content of notices of assessment can now be varied to suit the particular circumstances to which they relate, and to omit unnecessary or irrelevant information. Liable parents will continue to receive at least one notice of assessment for each child support year in which they have a liability, but they will receive subsequent notices in that year only if the amount to be paid changes. A previous oversight has been corrected so that notices of assessment will include the right to apply for an administrative determination when liable parents believe they have grounds for departure from the formula assessment. Application date These amendments apply from 24 July 1999. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 7 Refunds Section 216 The requirement that applications for refunds be in writing delayed those refunds and created unnecessary double handling and paperwork. A number of credits or overpayments are held on Inland Revenue’s child support database. Key changes Requests for refunds can now be made verbally or in writing. This is consistent with Inland Revenue’s general policy to encourage greater use of the telephone in contacts with the department. When Inland Revenue is satisfied that the liable parent is not in arrears and has no known future liability, it will be able to refund excess child support without a prior application. If the available final credit is less than $5 and no request for a refund has been received after 12 months from when that credit arose, it will be transferred to the liable parent’s tax account. Application date The amendment applies from 24 July 1999. Deductions of child support from wages and salaries Sections 165,166 Liable parents may have more than one source of income. For example, they may hold down two jobs, or work part-time and receive a social welfare benefit. In the past, even though they may have preferred to have a single deduction for child support, they may have been required to have deductions from more than one source. The child support law protects liable parents from unreasonable deductions by providing that deductions cannot reduce salary and wages by more than 40 percent. The original legislation required this amount to be calculated on a weekly basis, although administrative practice allowed employers to calculate the maximum deduction according to the pay period under which they operated. Key changes Liable parents can now choose to have the whole child support amount taken from only one income source. The maximum deduction from all sources is not to exceed 40 percent of their total after-tax income. Another amendment allows employers to make child support deductions according to the pay period they operate under, whether fortnightly or monthly, and is a compliance cost saving measure for them. The change makes the legislation consistent with existing practice. Application date The amendments apply from 24 July 1999. “Uplift” of debt and future entitlement Section 180 When child support and/or spousal maintenance is in arrears, non-beneficiary custodians can take responsibility for collection (uplifting the debt) themselves. Under the previous legislation, however, custodians who withdrew from the scheme had to wait until the final amount of entitlement was in arrears before they could uplift that debt. The state retains child support received for beneficiary custodians, although they are entitled to receive any spousal maintenance payments. Under the previous legislation, however, they were unable to take over responsibility for collecting spousal maintenance in arrears, a problem that arose because the provisions used the term “financial support”, which included “spousal maintenance”. The intention of the legislation was to prevent beneficiary custodians from uplifting their child support, which is retained by the state, but the wording had the effect of also preventing the uplift of spousal maintenance. Key changes Non-beneficiary custodians who choose to withdraw from the child support scheme but are entitled to a final payment of child support and/or spousal maintenance for the period up to the date they withdraw, can now take responsibility for collection of that final amount themselves. They do not need to wait until it becomes a debt. Beneficiary custodians who are entitled to spousal maintenance can now take over responsibility for collecting both past debts and future entitlement. These will be voluntary choices. Application date The amendments apply from 24 July 1999. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 8 Custodians’ bank accounts Sections 14, 55, 148 An application for child support must be “properly made”. Under the previous legislation this included providing details of the custodian’s bank account. These details are not essential to begin processing a child support application, however, particularly when the custodian is a social welfare beneficiary. Delaying the acceptance of an application delayed the start date of entitlement and deprived either non- beneficiary custodians or the state of revenue. The requirement that a bank account had to be in the custodian’s name was intended to ensure that payment went to the sole or principal provider of continuing daily care for the child(ren), but in practice proved to be too inflexible. Key changes Processing an application will not be delayed because a custodian has not given Inland Revenue details of his or her bank account. This will eliminate unnecessary delay in the start of child support. However, because it is administratively efficient for payments to be direct credited to a bank account, custodians will still be required to provide account details before any payments can be made. Custodians who wish to have their child support paid to an account in, say, their child’s name, or an account held by a budget advisor, can now choose to do so. Application date The amendments apply from 24 July 1999. Overseas taxable income New section 39A Child support is based on past income that is taxable in New Zealand. Under the previous legislation, this meant that liable parents who left New Zealand, and ceased to be resident for income tax purposes, could be assessed under the child support formula for only the minimum amount of $520 a year once their income year did not contain income taxable in New Zealand. As a result, the amount of child support payable often bore no relation to the capacity of the liable parent to contribute to the support of his or her children. Key changes Inland Revenue now has the discretion to include income that is taxable outside New Zealand in the child support assessment base when a liable parent is not resident in New Zealand for income tax purposes. (Any overseas income should already be included in the parent’s tax return if he or she is resident in New Zealand for income tax purposes.) This will ensure that assessments more accurately reflect that parent’s ability to pay child support. This new provision will be used mainly when a liable parent is resident in a country that has entered into a reciprocal agreement with New Zealand for the collection of child support. Application date The amendment applies from 24 July 1999. Reciprocal agreement with Australia New 219A of the Child Support Act 1991 Section 2 of the Family Proceedings Act 1980 The amendments are in anticipation of the reciprocal agreement for the collection of child support and spousal maintenance being entered into with Australia. This required a small change to the Child Support Act, although the agreement itself will be given effect in New Zealand by an Order in Council. Key changes When the Australian authorities collect child support and remit it to New Zealand, any annual debits arising from exchange fluctuations of up to $20 can be written off. The Family Proceedings Act 1980 has also been amended so that, once the agreement comes into effect, people residing in New Zealand or Australia will not be able to seek maintenance using the United Nations Convention for the Recovery of Maintenance Abroad. This is to prevent dual liabilities arising. Application date The amendment to the Family Proceedings Act 1980 will be given effect by the Order in Council that gives effect to the reciprocal agreement. The small debit write-off provision applies from 24 July 1999. Remedial amendments Section 208 The reference to “child support” in section 208(a) has been changed to “financial support” because “financial support” is inclusive of both child support and spousal maintenance. This applies from 24 July 1999. Section 30 The cross-references to the Income Tax Act 1994 in the definition of “living allowance” in section 30(4) have been changed to reflect changes in the Taxation (Parental Tax Credit) Act 1999. This change will apply from 1 October 1999. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 9 BINDING RULINGS This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995). You can order these publications free of charge from any Inland Revenue office. NEW APPLICATION FORMS FOR BINDING RULINGS Recent changes to the binding rulings regime, brought about by the enactment of the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 and the gazetting of the Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1999, have necessitated changes to: The application for private ruling form - formerly IR113, now IR713 The application for product ruling form - formerly IR114, now IR714 and brought about the introduction of: The application for status ruling form - IR712. The new forms take into account the fees applicable to binding ruling applications received on and from 26 August 1999, i.e. application fee $310, hourly rate thereafter $155 - both GST inclusive. Additionally, the forms and their respective information sheets have been combined and condensed, and generally brought up to date. These forms are available by: Phoning the number for “Forms and Brochures” under “Inland Revenue” in the Blue Pages(tm) Government Section of your local telephone directory Contacting the Adjudication & Rulings business group - telephone (04) 4747175 or e-mail to: rulings@ird.govt.nz Please do not use forms IR113 and IR114 after 26 August 1999. Our booklet “A Guide to Binding Rulings” is being updated, and we will advise the date of its release shortly. CHANGES TO BINDING RULINGS REGULATIONS Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1999 The Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1995 have been amended as follows: Status rulings are to be specifically included in the regulations to allow Inland Revenue to charge for this type of ruling. The hourly fee charged for private, product and status rulings is to be increased from $105 to $155 for applications received after the amended regulations come into force. The application fee charged for private, product and status ruling is to be increased from $210 to $310. A recent legislative review of the binding rulings system identified a number of deficiencies in the system. The resulting changes, some of a policy nature and others of a minor technical nature, were enacted through the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act in May 1999. (See TIB Vol 11, No.6) The amended regulations come into force on 26 August 1999, the 28th day after the date they were published in the Gazette (29 July 1999). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 10 LAND SALES – WHETHER INCOME TAX EXEMPTIONS FOR FARM LAND APPLY TO NON-NATURAL PERSONS PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 99/4 Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 96/8, published in TIB Volume Seven, No.13, May 1996, but the period of application is from 1 June 1999 to 31 May 2004 and some minor wording and formatting changes have been made. BR Pub 96/8 applied up until 31 May 1999. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CD 1(4)(a)(i) and section CD 1(7)(a). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the sale or other disposition of land by a non-natural person where the land had been acquired or used for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business carried on by that person and where the sale or disposition would otherwise be subject to section CD 1(2)(e), (f) or (g). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: The words “the taxpayer’s spouse” in section CD 1(4)(a)(i) and section CD 1(7)(a) do not restrict the meaning of “taxpayer” to natural persons. “Taxpayer” in section CD 1(4)(a)(i) and section CD 1(7)(a) includes non-natural persons such as companies and trusts. Accordingly, the exemptions provided by section CD 1(4)(a)(i) and section CD 1(7)(a) apply to a taxpayer that is a non-natural person if the other requirements of the exemptions are met. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 June 1999 to 31 May 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 14th day of July 1999. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) DRAFT PUBLIC RULING PU3801: GUARANTEE FEES PAID BY A NEW ZEALAND COMPANY TO AN OVERSEAS ASSOCIATED COMPANY In TIB Volume Eleven, No. 6 of July 1999 at page 33, dealing with legislative amendments in the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999, it was noted that section CN4 and associated definitions in section OB1 have been changed to clarify the position on guarantee fees paid to non-residents. Because of this legislative clarification, the Rulings Unit does not intend to publish its proposed item, “Guarantee fees paid by a New Zealand company to an overseas associated company”, whose exposure draft was advertised as being available for public comment in TIB Volume Ten, No. 9 of September 1998. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 11 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 99/4 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public ruling BR Pub 99/4 (“the Ruling”). Background Amounts derived from certain sales or other dispositions of land that would otherwise be gross income under section CD 1(2), are subject to a number of exemptions. This Ruling considers whether the exemptions contained in section CD 1(4)(a)(i) and section CD 1(7)(a), that are available in respect of sales of farm or agricultural land in certain circumstances, apply where the taxpayer disposing of the land is not a natural person. Legislation Section CD 1(4) states: Subsection (2)(e) shall not apply to any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land in any case where the Commissioner is satisfied that- (a)The land was acquired by the taxpayer, and used or intended to be used- (i) By the taxpayer, or by the taxpayer’s spouse, or by both of them, primarily and principally for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business carried on by the taxpayer, or the taxpayer’s spouse, or both of them; or .... Section CD 1(7) states: Subsection (2)(f) and (g) shall not apply to any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land in any case where- (a)That land is a lot resulting from the division into 2 or more lots of a larger area of land which, immediately before that division, was occupied or used by the taxpayer, or by the taxpayer’s spouse, or by both of them, primarily and principally for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business carried on by the taxpayer, or the taxpayer’s spouse, or both of them;and. .... Application of the Legislation The ordinary meaning of the words “by the taxpayer, or by the taxpayer’s spouse, or by both of them” in section CD 1(4)(a)(i) and section CD 1(7)(a) does not require the taxpayer to be a natural person. On a literal interpretation, by considering each alternative in section CD 1(4)(a) separately, a non-natural person taxpayer, e.g. a company, could clearly come within the words: “The land was acquired by the taxpayer, and used ... by the taxpayer... principally for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business carried on by the taxpayer”. Alternatively however, it is possible for the reference to the “taxpayer’s spouse” to be interpreted as colouring the word “taxpayer” and limiting its meaning to natural persons. It is the Commissioner’s view that the words are to be given their ordinary meaning, and that “taxpayer” as used in the exemptions is not restricted to natural persons. This interpretation is supported by the legislative history of the exemptions. Prior to 1983, the exemptions only referred to “taxpayer”, and it was clear that a company or other non-natural persons could come within the exemptions. In 1983, the exemptions were amended to include taxpayers’ spouses. The intention at that stage was to extend the exemptions, rather than to narrow them to natural persons. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 12 FREQUENT FLYER SCHEMES PROMOTED BY CREDIT CARD COMPANIES – FRINGE BENEFIT TAX LIABILITY PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 99/5 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CI 2(1) and the definition of “arrangement” in section OB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the receipt of benefits under a “frequent flyer scheme” (FFS) by an employee through the use of a credit card supplied by an employer to the employee of the employer. The features of the FFS are: The employees of the employer hold corporate credit cards. The employees use the credit cards for the purchase of goods and services. Depending on the policy of the employer, the purchases may be in respect of employment related expenditure or private expenditure, or both. The goods and services purchased by the employees may include airfares arising from employment related travel. The employer is not involved in negotiations or discussions with the credit card company as to the amount or level of benefits under the FFS provided to employees. The employer does no more than give permission or consent for employees to join the scheme. The employees of the employer join the credit card company’s FFS as individual members. As members of the FFS, employees accumulate points in respect of goods and services purchased with their corporate credit cards. The employees can exchange the accumulated points for goods and services, including free or discounted air travel, with the credit card company or any other person nominated by the credit card company. This Ruling will not apply if the employer is the credit card company providing the benefits under the FFS to its own employees. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: For the purposes of the FBT rules (as defined in section OZ 1(1)), section CI 2(1) will not apply to the entitlement of benefits received by the employees of the employers under the FFS. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 26 July 1999 until 31 July 2002 This Ruling is signed by me on the 26th of July 1999 Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 13 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 99/5 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 99/5 (“the Ruling”). Background The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Ruling BR Pub 95/6 (Tax Information Bulletin Volume Seven, No. 5, November 1995 at page 7 under the heading “Tax treatment of credit card companies’ frequent flyer schemes”). Some formatting changes have been made, and the commentary to the Ruling has been modified to provide further clarification. The Ruling sets out the tax treatment of frequent flyer schemes promoted by credit card companies. This Ruling will not apply where the employer is the credit card company providing the benefits under the FFS to its own employees. A policy statement dealing with the tax treatment of FFS promoted by airline companies appeared in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Five, No. 6, November 1993 at page 2. Legislation Section CI 1 states: In the FBT rules, “fringe benefit”, in relation to an employee and to any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year, means any benefit that consists of - ... (h)Any benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed by the employee in the quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year, - being, as the case may be, private use or enjoyment, availability for private use or enjoyment, ... or a benefit that is used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee ... and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee;... Section CI 2(1) states: For the purposes of the FBT rules, where a benefit is provided for or granted to an employee by a person with whom the employer of the employee has entered into an arrangement for that benefit to be so provided or granted, that benefit shall be deemed to be a benefit provided for or granted to the employee by the employer of the employee. “Arrangement” is defined in section OB 1 to mean, unless the context otherwise requires: ...any contract, agreement, plan, or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable), including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect: Application of the Legislation Liability for FBT Under section CI 1, an employer is liable to pay FBT on fringe benefits provided or granted to an employee by the employer. This is not an issue in the Ruling, because the employer is not the person providing the benefit to the employee. However, under section CI 2(1) an employer can be liable for FBT if the employer enters into an arrangement with another person for the provision of fringe benefits to the employer’s employees. Section CI 2(1) is an anti-avoidance provision. For it to have any application there must be an arrangement between the employer and the other party (the provider of the benefit), and that arrangement must provide for or grant a benefit to the employee of the employer entering into the arrangement. Members of a credit card company’s FFS Some credit card companies give all cardholders the opportunity to join their FFS. These schemes allow cardholders to accumulate points on the scheme as they charge goods and services to their credit cards. These goods and services may be employment related or may be private in nature. Subject to certain conditions (which vary from scheme to scheme), the cardholders can transfer the points to a participating airline FFS. The cardholder can then exchange the points for discounted or free travel or goods or services, depending on the terms of the particular airline FFS. There will be no FBT liability for the entitlements received if an employee is an individual card holder, even though the employee may charge employment related expenditure to the card that is later reimbursed by the employer. In these instances there is no arrangement between the employer and the FFS provider. Employees holding corporate credit cards If the employee holds a corporate credit card and is able to charge private as well as employment related expenditure to the card, the question of whether the corporate employer is subject to FBT will depend on whether there is an arrangement between the employer and the credit card company. Where such an arrangement exists, and the arrangement between the provider and the employer is for the granting of benefits to the employee, the employer will be liable to FBT on the value of those benefits received by the employee. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 14 Where the entitlement arises as a result of both employment related and private expenditure, some adjustment will be necessary to eliminate the portion of benefits arising from the private expenditure. Is there an arrangement? There have been a substantial number of cases in which the courts have considered the application and meaning of the definition of “arrangement”. Briefly, the major cases are: The High Court of Australia in Bell v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 87 CLR 548 considered that an arrangement: ...extends beyond contracts and agreements so as to embrace all kinds of concerted action by which persons may arrange their affairs for a particular purpose or so as to produce a particular effect. The Privy Council in Newton and others v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia \[1958\] 2 All ER 759 took a similar line when it concluded that: The word arrangement is apt to describe something less than a binding contract or agreement, something in the nature of an understanding between two or more persons - a plan arranged between them which may not be enforceable at law. But it must in this section comprehend, not only the initial plan but also the transactions by which it is carried into effect - all the transactions that is which have the effect of avoiding taxation, be they conveyances, transfers, or anything else. This passage was quoted and approved by Eichelbaum J in the High Court decision in Hadlee and Sydney Bridge Nominees Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,155. The Court of Appeal subsequently approved this. The Privy Council considered the meaning of arrangement in the context of the New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Act 1971 in New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board v Apple Fields Ltd \[1991\] 1 NZLR 257. It concluded that: Arrangement is a perfectly ordinary English word and in the context of section 27 involves no more than a meeting of minds between two or more persons, not amounting to a formal contract, but leading to an agreed course of action. The English Court of Appeal in Re British Basic Slag Ltd’s Agreements \[1963\] 2 All ER 807 considered the ordinary meaning of arrangement. It concluded: Though it may not be easy to put into words, everybody knows what is meant by an arrangement between two or more parties. If the arrangement is intended to be enforceable by legal proceedings, as in the case where it is made for good consideration it may no doubt be properly described as an agreement. But the statute clearly contemplates that there may be arrangements which are not enforceable by legal proceedings, but which create only moral obligations or obligations binding in honour..... When each of two or more parties intentionally arouses in the others expectation that he will act in a certain way, it seems to me that he incurs at least a moral obligation to do so. An arrangement is so defined is therefore something whereby the parties to it accept mutual rights and obligations. In Trade Practices Commission v Email Ltd 31 ALR 53, the Court considered whether an arrangement could exist when there was a commitment by one party only. It concluded that it would be rare that an arrangement could exist without reciprocity of commitment from the parties to achieve a commercial objective beneficial to each party. To summarise, the courts have identified the following characteristics that indicate the existence of an arrangement: A meeting of minds on an agreed course of action for a particular purpose (see New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board v Apple Fields). The parties agree to mutual rights and obligations in respect of the course of action to be undertaken (see Re British Basic Slag Ltd’s Agreements). An arrangement is unlikely to exist when only one party makes a commitment to the proposed course of action (see Trade Practices Commission v Email Ltd 31 ALR 53). The recurring theme in these characteristics is that the parties agree to make a combined effort for a common goal. It is arguable that an agreement for the granting of permission to recruit employees into the FFS, between the credit card company and the employer client, is an arrangement under section OB 1. It is clear that where each party agrees to certain actions there is a “meeting of the minds” (New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board v Apple Fields) and this is sufficient for there to be an arrangement. However, before section CI 2(1) has any application, the “arrangement” between the credit card company and the employer must be “for” the provision of a benefit by the employer to the employee. Is the arrangement “for” the provision of a benefit to the employee? The use of the word “for” in section CI 2(1) is the critical feature of this component. It was interpreted in the case of Patrick Harrison & Co. v AG for Manitoba \[1967\] SCR 274 as imposing a purpose test. In this case, the Court held that “for the extraction of minerals” meant “with the object or purpose of extracting minerals”. This component limits the arrangements that will fall within the ambit of section CI 2(1) by linking the arrangement to the purpose of providing a benefit to the employees. Accordingly, for section CI 2(1) to apply in this situation there must be an arrangement between the credit card company and the corporate employer to provide a benefit to the employees. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 15 In this Ruling’s Arrangement the corporate employer has not entered into any contract or other understanding with the credit card company so that employees receive entitlements under the FFS. If the employees obtain a benefit or an advantage from joining the FFS, it is from the contractual agreement between the credit card company and themselves rather than from any arrangement between the company and the corporate employer. It is concluded that any benefit arising from an individual employee’s membership of an FFS is not a “benefit” provided or granted by the employer, nor is it provided by way of an “arrangement” entered into by the employer and the credit card company. However, if there is any form of arrangement between the credit card company and the corporate employer where the benefits pass to employees as a result of that arrangement, there is clearly a provision of a fringe benefit and, accordingly, section CI 2(1) will apply. Example 1 An employee works for a company. She obtains a personal credit card and joins its associated FFS. Under that scheme she can accumulate points as goods and services are charged on the credit card. After the employee accumulates 10,000 points, she can transfer those points, at her option, to any one of a number of airlines’ FFS affiliated to the credit card company’s FFS. Once she accumulates a specified number of points on the airline FFS, she can exchange them for free or discounted travel. In the course of her work she incurs a number of employment related charges on the credit card as well as private expenditure. The employee accumulates points on the credit card FFS for both types of expenditure. She very soon reaches the specified threshold of points, and transfers them to a particular airline FFS, exchanging them for a free trip to Fiji. The company does not have an FBT liability. The receipt of the entitlement under the credit card company’s FFS is because of the contractual arrangement between the credit card company and the employee. No arrangement exists between the employer and the credit card company to provide the employee with entitlements under its FFS. It does not matter that some of the points that give the entitlement result from employment related expenditure. Example 2 The following year the employee obtains promotion in the company and receives a corporate credit card on which she is specified as the cardholder. The credit card is from a different company to that which issued her personal card. This particular credit card company allows cardholders to participate in its FFS. This scheme also allows an accumulation of points as goods and services are charged on the card and a transfer of points, subject to certain conditions, to a participating airline FFS. The employer does not have an FBT liability on any entitlement received by the employee under the credit card company’s FFS. There is no arrangement between the employer and the credit card company to provide entitlements to the employee under the FFS. The employee receives those entitlements because of her contractual relationship with the credit card company. NOTE: The draft ruling and commentary issued for consultative purposes late last year (PU0042) contained Example 3 which described a situation where the Commissioner could decide that there was an arrangement between an employer and a credit card company in respect of an FFS. It has been decided to remove this example as it raises issues beyond the scope of the “arrangement” to this Ruling which is to rule that there is no liability for FBT where there is no arrangement between the respective parties.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 22 PRODUCT RULING – BR Prd 99/8 This is a pr oduct ruling made under section 91F of the T ax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling applies to Tower Health Limited (“THL”). Taxation Law All legislative r eferences are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BD 2(1), BD 2(2), CB 5 (1)(h) and CD 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the Executive Income Protection Indemnity Value Contract issued by THL which provides the following benefits. Note that National Insurance Life & Health Limited changed its name to Tower Health Limited on 1 April 1999. Total Temporary Disability Benefit This benefit provides that if the Insured Person suffers a Total Disability, a monthly benefit will be paid as long as the Insured Person remains Totally Disabled until the end of the maximum benefit period. Total Disability and T otally Disabled ar e defined as: The inability of the Insured Person (other than by death), due to Illness or Accident to perform the duties of his or her normal or usual occupation, business or work from which he or she has derived income. An Insured Person is not Totally Disabled if he or she is engaged in any occupation, business or work for financial reward and not under care of a Medical Practitioner. The amount paid under this benefit is the lesser of: The benefit shown in the Policy Schedule or Endorsement Schedule (adjusted by any Inflation Protection Benefit, as described below) and, 80% of the Insured Person’s monthly income before Total Disability . This is the Insur ed Person’s average monthly Total Income for the 12-month or 36-month period before Total Disability , whichever is greater. Less the total of the following: The Insured Person’s Post-Disability Income for the relevant month, and If the Insured Person receives any disability lump sum payments under other insurance policies, an amount equal to 1% per month of those lump sum payments (this applies to the first 5 years of the claim). Post-Disability Income is defined as: Income from all sources including but not limited to an amount derived by the Insured Person from his or her personal services or personal exertion, employer paid sick leave, payments under other disability contracts, entitlements under the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992, benefits under the Social Security Act 1964, and entitlement to undrawn profit. It also includes, any other amount (except a superannuation payment) which in \[THL’s\] opinion is either an ongoing income or entitlement to payment or an amount in the nature of income (such as director’s fees or a share of profits in some form) which the Insured Person could reasonably be expected to receive from the same source as he or she derived Total Income before his or her Disability (even though the amount is not received). But Post-Disability Income does not include Unearned Income up to $100,000 per annum or a greater or lesser figure than \[THL\] decide on, from time to time before a claim is paid (relevant amount). It also does not include Unearned Income in excess of the relevant amount if that income has been offset when this Policy was first underwritten. Partial Disability Benefit This benefit provides that a monthly benefit will be paid if the Insured Person is Partially Disabled while the Policy is in force. An Insured Person is deemed to be Partially Disabled if that person: Was Totally Disabled for a period of mor e than 14 days in a row; and Then returns to his or her usual work, occupation or business, or any other work, occupation or business, but as a result of the illness or accident which caused the T otal Disability returns in a reduced capacity or for fewer hours per week than was worked before the disability; and Receives total income of less than 80% of that earned before disability. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 23 The dollar value of the benefit to be paid is calculated as follows: ((A - B) ÷ A) x C = D where: Ais the greater of the average monthly total income for the 12-month period or the 36-month period before Total Disability. Bis the monthly Post-Disability Income. Cis the amount calculated under the Total Temporary Disability Benefit without the deductions. Dis the Partial Disability Benefit monthly amount. Recurrent Disability Benefit The Recurrent Disability Benefit provides that THL will not require a Wait Period befor e paying the Insured Person the Total Temporary Disability Benefit under the Policy , if the Insur ed Person: Suffers a disability more than once from the same or directly related illness or accident, and it was less than 6 months since he or she was last disabled from that cause; and The Insured Person was being paid a monthly benefit for the disability under this Policy . Wait Period is defined as: The period specified in the Policy Schedule or an Endorsement Certificate. The period starts from the day the Insured Person suffers a Total Disability or the date a registered Medical Practitioner approved by \[THL\] certifies that the Insured Person is Totally Disabled, or the date the Insured Person ceases work whichever is later. Waiver of Premium Benefit The Waiver of Pr emium Benefit pr ovides that during any period the Insur ed Person is being paid a T otal or Partial Disability Monthly Benefit he or she will not be charged any premium. Hospital Benefit The Hospital Benefit is paid when the Insured Person suffers a Total Disability and is admitted to Hospital as a result. The amount paid is a daily amount equal to 1/30th of the amount of the monthly maximum benefit shown on the Policy Schedule or latest Endorsement Certificate (adjusted by any Inflation Protection Benefit) for each day the Insured Person is in hospital. The Hospital Benefit will be paid from and including the four th night of the Insur ed Person’s stay in hospital until one of the following events occur: The day the person leaves the hospital; or The end of the Wait Period; or The 64th day of the stay in hospital; or The day a Serious Care Benefit becomes payable to that person. Premium No Claim Discount Benefit The Premium No Claim Discount Benefit provides that if no claim has been paid out under the Policy for three consecutive Policy Years, the Insur ed Person will receive a 15% discount on future premiums. If the Insured Person makes a claim under the Policy while receiving the discount, it will end on the Policy Anniversary Date immediately following the date that the claim was paid. Inflation Protection Benefit The Inflation Protection Benefit provides that on each Policy Anniversary Date the Policy Holder is offered the opportunity to increase the maximum amounts of any indemnity value Benefit and T op Up Benefit shown in the Policy Schedule or the latest Endorsement Certificate, without presenting further evidence to THL about his or her health. The increase will be the annual rate of increase in the Consumer Price Index or 5%, whichever is less. Claims Indexation Benefit If a Total Disability Monthly Benefit has been paid out arising from the same or directly related cause for 12 months in a row, the Claims Indexation Benefit provides that the amount paid out will be increased on the next Policy Anniversary Date by the annual rate of increase in the latest Consumer Price Index or 5%, whichever is less. Total and Permanent Disability Benefit At the end of the Maximum Benefit Period, the Insured Person will be paid an amount equal to 100 times the amount of the last monthly benefit payment if: THL has paid the Insured Person a monthly benefit for the Maximum Benefit Period, and the Insured Person is, in the opinion of THL (after consideration of all material evidence), Totally and Per manently Disabled as a r esult of the illness or accident which gave rise to the payment of the monthly benefit. The amount payable reduces by 20% for every year that the Insur ed Person’s age exceeds 54 years at the time the Total and Per manent Disability becomes payable. Premium Payback Benefit The Premium Payback Benefit will be paid shortly after the Policy Anniversary Date immediately following the Insur ed Person’s 60th birthday or the date that the Policy has been in force for 15 consecutive years, whichever is later . Only one Premium Payback Benefit will be paid under the Policy and it will be calculated according to the formula below. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 24 If the Policy ends after it has been in force for at least 15 consecutive years but before the Policy Anniversary Date following the Insur ed Person’s 60th birthday, THL will pay 50% of the amount calculated accor ding to the formula below. The Premium Payback Benefit is calculated as follows: The total dollar value of all premiums paid under the Policy (except any premiums paid after the Policy Anniversary Date following the Insured Person’s 60 th birthday or the date that this Policy has been in force for 15 consecutive years, whichever is later). Less the dollar value of each of the following: Goods and Services Tax All Policy fees All premium frequency loading fees All Benefits paid any time under the Policy and benefits payable in respect of any claims notified before this benefit is paid. After the Premium Payback Benefit is paid, if the Maximum Benefit Period of the Policy is when the Insured Person reaches the age of 60, the Policy and all cover will end. If the Maximum Benefit Period is to age 65, the Policy will continue until the Policy Anniversary Date following the Insured Person’s 65 th birthday, as long as the premiums continue to be paid. Serious Care Benefit The Serious Care Benefit provides that an amount equal to 12 times the maximum benefit for T otal Disability shown on the Policy Schedule or Endorsement Certificate (adjusted by any Inflation Protection Benefit) will be paid out, if: The Insured Person is diagnosed as suffering for the first time in their lifetime, one of the Serious Care Conditions defined in the Policy; and The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical findings and reports acceptable to THL; and The Insured Person survives for 30 days following the date of diagnosis; and The date of diagnosis is at least 90 days after the Commencement Date and before the date on which cover for this benefits ends. Top Up Benefit The Top Up Benefit provides a monthly amount in addition to the Total Disability Monthly Benefit. The amount paid is the lesser of: The maximum amount of this benefit, as stated in the Policy Schedule; or 20% of the Insured Person’s monthly total income before disability; or The difference between the Insur ed Person’s monthly total income before disability and the total of Monthly Benefit THL pays. Non-Smoker Discount Benefit The Non-Smoker Benefit provides that if the Insured Person has not smoked tobacco in the previous 12 months and is not already receiving a non-smoker premium discount, then the Insured Person may apply for this discount. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the following assumptions: The Indemnity Value Contract is taken out by an individual and provides cover for that individual. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, the Taxation Law applies to the Ar rangement as follows: Any benefit received by the Insured Person under the Indemnity Value Contract by way of the Total Temporary Disability Benefit will be gross income under section CD 5: The portion of premium paid by the Insured Person under the Indemnity V alue Contract for the Total Temporary Disability Benefit will be an allowable deduction under section BD 2(1): Any benefit received by the Insured Person under the Indemnity Value Contract by way of the Partial Disability Benefit will be gross income under section CD 5: The portion of premium paid by the Insured Person under the Indemnity V alue Contract for the Partial Disability Benefit will be an allowable deduction under section BD 2(1): Any benefit received by the Insured Person under the Indemnity Value Contract by way of the Total Permanent Disability Benefit will be gross income under section CD 5: The portion of premium paid by the Insured Person under the Indemnity V alue Contract for the Total Permanent Disability Benefit will be an allowable deduction under section BD 2(1): Any benefit received by the Insured Person under the Indemnity Value Contract by way of the Top Up Benefit will be gr oss income under section CD 5: IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 25 The portion of premium paid by the Insured Person under the Indemnity V alue Contract for the Top Up Benefit will be an allowable deduction under section BD 2(1): Any benefit received by the Insured Person under the Indemnity Value Contract by way of the Recurrent Disability Benefit will be gross income under section CD 5: The portion of premium paid by the Insured Person under the Indemnity V alue Contract for the Recurrent Disability Benefit will be an allowable deduction under section BD 2(1): Any benefit received by the Insured Person under the Indemnity Value Contract by way of the Claims Indexation Benefit will be gross income under section CD 5: The portion of premium paid by the Insured Person under the Indemnity V alue Contract for the Claims Indexation Benefit will be an allowable deduction under section BD 2(1): Any benefit received by the Insured Person under the Indemnity Value Contract by way of the Hospital Benefit will not be gross income under section CD 5: The portion of premium paid by the Insured Person under the Indemnity V alue Contract for the Hospital Benefit will not be an allowable deduction under section BD 2(1): Any benefit received by the Insured Person under the Indemnity Value Contract by way of the Serious Care Benefit will not be gross income under section CD 5: The portion of premium paid by the Insured Person under the Indemnity V alue Contract for the Serious Care Benefit will not be an allowable deduction under section BD 2(1): Any benefit received by the Insured Person under the Indemnity Value Contract by way of the Premium Payback Benefit will not be gross income under section CD 5: The portion of premium paid by the Insured Person under the Indemnity V alue Contract for the Premium Payback Benefit will not be an allowable deduction under section BD 2(1): The Waiver of Pr emium, Non-Smoker Discount, Inflation Protection and Premium No Claim Discount Benefits under the Indemnity Value Contract have no tax consequences.

GST – WHETHER INPUT CREDIT AVAILABLE ON SALE AND SUBDIVISION OF LAND ACQUIRED IN 1984 Case:TRA Number 96/104. Decision Number 014/99 Decision date:9 July 1999 Act:Goods and Ser vices Tax Act 1985 Keywords:Taxable activity Summary The final issue to be determined in this case was whether an input credit based on the market value of the farmland was available at the commencement of the Objector’s taxable activity of subdivision and sale. Judge Barber found in favour of the Commissioner. This case was previously reported as Case T60 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,449. Facts The Objector’s jointly pur chased a number of properties in 1984 and in 1987, which together made up a farm. The husband was registered for GST and farmed the property with sheep and cattle. He did not pay any rental on the farm. In 1991, the husband claimed an input tax credit on the purchase of the farmland acquired in 1987. The Commissioner allowed the credit despite the fact that the land was in the name of both of the Objectors. In the same year, the husband and wife began charging the husband rent for the use of the farm. They did not register for GST because the rental was under the threshold for registration. The farming operation was not a success and the Objectors decided to subdivide and sell the property into 6 lots. All lots were sold by December 1994. The Objectors registered for GST on 1st June 1994 having pur chased another far m property. The sale of two of the lots were accounted for in the December 1994 return. The other four lots were sold in the GST periods ending 31st October 1993, 30th April 1994 and 30th June 1994. Decision Judge Barber agr eed with the Commissioner ’s arguments in respect of section 21(5) and stated that in respect of goods and services acquired or produced after 1st October 1986, there can be no input tax deduction for the Objectors for the purchase of the farmland acquired in 1984. His Honour also agreed with the Commissioner that section 21(5) expressly requires that there have been no prior deductions in respect of the goods and services in question and the objectors cannot obtain an input tax deduction (on commencement of their sudivisional activity) for the 1987 purchase. Judge Barber concluded that the only input credit available for the Objector ’s related to the 1987 purchase and that the husband had taken this input credit on behalf of the Objectors. He stated that the Objectors were not entitled to a GST input in respect of the farm as at the time they commenced their sudivisional activity . IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 27 DEDUCTION IN RESPECT OF LOSS SET-OFF – WHETHER INTEREST LOSSES CANCELLED AS A RESULT OF LIQUIDATION; WHETHER COMMISSIONER ABLE TO ALTER ASSESSMENT Case:Hot Dip Galvanisers (Christchurch) Ltd & Brian Perry Ltd v CIR Decision date:20 July 1999 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Offset of losses Summary The Court of Appeal held that the Appellants had not discharged the onus of proof, which rested on them and dismissed the appeal. Facts The appellant companies together with one other company, L Ltd, formed a specified gr oup for the purposes of section 191(5) of the Income Tax 1976. The two appellant companies applied interest losses incurred by L Ltd against their profits. L Ltd had been wound up on 2 May 1979 and the receivers, appointed under three debentures, paid $888,824 to the debenture holders in the period from 3 February 1977 to 15 March 1993. The Commissioner subsequently determined that the interest deductions which resulted in the company’ s losses for the 1981,1982 and 1983 income years had actually been remitted or cancelled. On the basis of this determination, the Commissioner issued an amended assessment for each of the appellants disallowing the deduction in respect of the loss set-off. The Taxation Review Authority was asked to determine whether the interest taken into account in calculating the losses sustained by L Ltd was cancelled or remitted as a consequence of the liquidation of that company and, if so, whether the Commissioner acted correctly in making the amended assessments of the appellants’ liability for income tax for the years in question. The T axation Review Authority held that the Commissioner had the power pursuant to section 188(4) to alter any assessment to reduce losses previously taken into account in assessing the income of a taxpayer . The debt used in the calculation of losses had to have been remitted or cancelled in whole or in part for section 188(4) to operate. The Taxation Review Authority found that in the present case the loss company had gone into liquidation and had been struck off the register of companies. In terms of section 188(6)(b), the debt had been deemed to have been cancelled as the loss company had been released from its liability under the debenture by operation of the Companies Act 1955. Furthermore, pursuant to section 188(6)(c) a debt is deemed to have been cancelled to the extent to which it has become irrecoverable or unenforceable by action through the lapse of time. Judge Barber stated that there did not seem to be any dispute between the parties that the payments made by the receivers or liquidators to the debenture holder must be treated as having been applied to capital or loan principal rather than to interest. Accordingly, the Commissioner was cor rect in disallowing the deduction in respect of the loss set- off. In the High Court Justice Morris concurred with Judge Barber ’s approach. Decision Justice Thomas stated that s191(7B) is a deeming provision which deems s 188(4)(5) and (6) to apply to a company which has obtained a deduction under s 191(5) or (7). It would not make sense, and would have little or no practical application, if the power to “alter any assessment” at “any time” were not to apply to an assessment made in respect of the income-making company relating to a debt to which s 188(4),(5) and (6) applies. The reference to these subsections and s 191(7B) could have no other realistic purpose than to provide the Commissioner with authority to alter the assessment of a company that has obtained a deduction, being the loss made by another company in the specified group, when that loss is remitted or cancelled. Apart from the clear direction in s188(4) the Commissioner may at any time alter any assessment. A construction which required the loss-making company to be assessed first would lead to absurd and unjust results. It would, in effect, provide a tax exemption for any income-making company in a group where the loss- making company was no longer in existence. The appellants disputed the application of the rule in Clayton’s Case (1816) 1 Mer 572. They argued that the presumption in Falk v Haugh (1935) 53 CLR 163 was applicable to the present case. Justice Thomas considered that it would be impermissible to enter into the question of whether a presumption applied in the present case. There were two reasons for this view. Firstly, pursuant to section 36 of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 the objector is IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 28 limited to the grounds stated in his or her objection and the burden of proof is on the objector. Secondly, the appeal was an appeal by way of case stated. In the present case it was plain that the case stated by the Authority set out the relevant facts as determined by the TRA and then posed three questions for the opinion of the High Court. The Authority’s findings of facts wer e not put in issue, and the hearing and determination in the High Court could not embrace a rehearing of the facts. Justice Thomas found that the appellants never disputed that the r eceiver’s payments were to be treated as having been applied to principal rather than interest. His Honour found that in the High Court Justice Morris proceeded on the basis that an appropriation had not been made and that, in those circumstances, the presumption in Clayton’s Case applied. Justice Morris regarded it as an established fact that neither the receivers nor the debenture holders had made an appropriation of the payments. In proceeding on this basis Justice Morris misconstrued the Authority’s judgment and accepted as fact a position, which had never been found or established by the Authority. Justice Thomas found that in actual fact the appellants had not adduced any evidence as to how the receivers or debenture holders dealt with the payments. The receivers’ abstracts did not indicate the direction of the payments one way or the other. Accordingly, the circumstances which would permit the application of the presumption had not been established. AWARDS FOR COSTS IN TAX CASES Case:National Insurance Company of New Zealand v CIR – 2nd costs hearing Decision date:30 July 1999 Facts The substantive case was reported as National Insurance Co of NZ Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1997) 18 NZTC 13,489 and on appeal to the Court of Appeal as Commissioner of Inland Revenue v National Insurance Co of NZ Ltd (1999) 19 NZTC 13,489. The first hearing on costs is reported as National Insurance Co of NZ Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (No 2) (1998) 18 NZTC 13,761. In the first costs hearing the taxpayer was awarded $150,000 plus disbursements on the basis that awards for costs in tax cases were much less than in other civil cases. The issue of costs in tax cases was subsequently heard by the Court of Appeal in Auckland Gas Co Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1999) 19 NZTC 15,027. The Court essentially said that tax cases are no different to any other civil case, and costs should therefore be determined on the same basis as all other civil cases. When the substantive issue in this case was heard before the Court of Appeal, the issue of costs to be awarded in the High Court was referred back to the High Court. Decision The Court considered the authorities referred by counsel and those relating to costs collected in McGechan on Procedure (paras HR46.05 and 46.07 p3-67 - 3-72(a)). In particular the Court gave further consideration to: the length of the hearing; the number of issues raised and contested by the parties (including the factual and legal complexities involved; the amount at stake and the importance of the issues to the parties; the extended period for which costs in tax cases are now to be regarded as payable with the new costs regime; the relative success of each party; the rough-and-ready rule of thumb that at least as much time and effort has to be put into the preparation as the hearing itself; the comments of the Court of Appeal on GST. Having regard to all these factors the Court ordered the Commissioner to pay the sum of $700,000 plus disbursements. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 29 WHETHER OBJECTOR WAS RESIDENT OF NZ FOR THE PURPOSES OF TAXATION OF INCOME Case:TRA Number 98/40. Decision Number 016/99 Decision date:27 July 1999 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Whether Objector was resident of NZ, Double Tax Relief Order Facts The Objector is a successful businessman who had devoted his time to business almost to the exclusion of his family. The Objector and his wife separated and he moved to Singapore and did not anticipate returning to New Zealand. The Objector took up the lease of an apartment in Singapore, opened bank accounts, was granted permanent residency, obtained a Singapor e Inland Revenue number and started his own business. In 1995 the Objector returned to New Zealand and reconciled with his wife and family . The Commissioner contended that the objector was a resident of both New Zealand and Singapore for the purposes of taxation of his income. The Objector contended that from 1991 to 1993 inclusive that he did not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. Decision Judge Willy found for the objector on the facts of the case. His Honour listed a number of factors that were relevant in showing that the Objector did not intend to return to New Zealand. Judge Willy held that for the period between 1990 and 1994 the Objector had abandoned his residence in New Zealand and was wholly resident in Singapore and that the reason the Objector kept assets in New Zealand was so he could provide for his family and as an asset base to finance his Singapore business. Thus the frequent visits of the Objector to New Zealand did not detract from his assertion that for 4 years he became wholly resident in Singapore. Judge Willy then consider ed sections 294, 241, and 242 of the Income Tax Act 1976 and the Double Taxation Relief (Singapor e) Order 1973 (1973/256). On the facts as found by Judge W illy, the Objector was not a New Zealand resident “for the purposes of New Zealand tax” as defined in Article 3 of the order. He was a Singapor e resident for the years covered in the case stated. That being so, income earned by the Objector could not, in terms of section 242, be brought to tax in New Zealand. Article 16 of the order did not need to be considered. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 30 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. PAYMENT OF DEBT BY COMPULSORY DEDUCTIONS FROM BANK ACCOUNTS Introduction This Standard Practice Statement outlines Inland Revenue’s practice on the use of Notices to Deduct. This statement covers: monitoring of bank accounts overdraft facilities investments joint bank accounts interest prosecution This Standard Practice Statement has been updated to include new legislation. Application date This Standard Practice Statement replaces Standard Practice Statement RDC 3, published in TIB V ol Ten No.10 (October 1998). This amended Standard Practice Statement applies to all deduction notices issued on or after 1 September 1999. Legislation Section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to issue a Notice requiring compulsory deductions to be made from amounts that are, or become payable by any person to a defaulting taxpayer . The Notice may require deductions to be made by way of a lump sum or instalments. The Notice may also require that daily interest be deducted, from the date of the written notice, until the amount in default has been deducted. Other Legislation The following legislation is similar in content to section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994: section 43 of the Goods and Ser vices Tax Act 1985 section 154 of the Child Support Act 1991 section 46 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 section 12L of the Gaming Duties Act 1971 section 46 of the Accident Compensation Act 1982 section 130 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 section 313 of the Accident Insurance Act 1998. Monitoring of bank accounts A Notice to Deduct may require deduction from amounts held on the date of the Notice or from amounts deposited after the date of the Notice. However Inland Revenue and the Bankers’ Association have agreed that banks will generally not be required to monitor accounts on a daily basis. If there is an exceptional case where Inland Revenue considers daily monitoring to be necessar y, Inland Revenue will ask the bank to monitor the account for a specific period. Inland Revenue’ s requirements will be discussed with the bank at the time. Unless there are exceptional circumstances, the maximum period a bank will be required to monitor an account is ten working days. Example The taxpayer has a large debt, which has been outstanding for some time. Inland Revenue is aware that the taxpayer is expecting to receive funds from an overseas source. It is known that payment of the funds, to the bank, will be made in the first week of the month, but the exact day of payment is not known. Inland Revenue will consult with the bank concerned and request that the account be monitored for the first week of that month. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 31 Overdraft facilities Inland Revenue cannot, by requiring a deduction to be made from a bank account, put a taxpayer into, or further into overdraft. If Inland Revenue issues a Notice to Deduct for an account which is in credit and the taxpayer attempts to evade it by transferring funds to an account in overdraft, then the Notice will take priority . Investments Compulsory deductions may be made from money that is held in a term investment before the date that the investment is due to mature. This may result in a reduced rate of interest on the investment. Joint bank accounts General information Previously the Commissioner issued Notices to Deduct for joint accounts if the signatory was “either or”. In ANZ Banking Group (New Zealand) Limited v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,643 the High Court held the Commissioner could not issue a Notice to Deduct to obtain funds from a joint account in respect of the income tax debt owed by one of the joint bank account holders, because there was no authority to do so. Inland Revenue will not issue Notices to Deduct for joint accounts, in respect of a debt owed by only one of the account holders except where the Commissioner has specific authority (eg for family assistance and child support). Family assistance debts When an overpayment for family assistance has occurred the person who received the overpayment (the recipient) and their partner or spouse (if they were the partner or spouse throughout the income year to which the overpayment relates) are jointly and severally liable for the overpayment (section KD 4(4) Income Tax Act 1994). The Commissioner is therefore able to issue a Notice to Deduct for an account in the name of the partner or spouse or for a joint account in the name of the recipient and the partner or spouse. Child support debts The Child Support Act 1991 allows the Commissioner to require deductions from money payable to liable parents for a child support debt. Section 155 of the Act extends this to money held in joint accounts in the name of the liable parent and one or more other persons, where the liable parent can draw from that account without the signature of the other person. Interest A Notice to Deduct may require deductions to be made to cover daily interest. The interest starts on the date of the Notice to Deduct and ends on the day on which the amount required to be deducted, has been deducted. Prosecution If a bank fails to make the required deductions and there was an amount payable, or an amount that became payable, Inland Revenue has the power to prosecute for not complying with the terms of the deduction notice. This Standard Practice Statement was signed by me on 9th August 1999 Michael Rapson Manager, Technical Standards IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 32 QUESTIONS WE’VE BEEN ASKED This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general inter est to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT 1994 Specified rates of interest / additional tax for tax in dispute A tax practitioner has asked for a summary of the specified rates of interest / additional tax on tax in dispute. The rates that have been set are: 8 March 1999 to present10.59%– taxpayer ’s paying rate 3.38%– Commissioner’s paying rate 8 November 1998 to 7 March 199912.48 %– taxpayer ’s paying rate 4.79 %– Commissioner’s paying rate 7 July 1998 to 7 November 199814.69%– taxpayer ’s paying rate 8.26%– Commissioner’s paying rate 1 April 1997 to 6 July 199813.9%– taxpayer ’s paying rate 7.1%– Commissioner’s paying rate 1 April 1996 to 31 March 1997 9%– for both 1 April 1994 to 31 March 1996 7%– for both 1 April 1992 to 31 March 199410%– for both 1 April 1989 to 31 March 199213.5%– for both 1 April 1985 to 31 March 198920%– for both Interest and additional tax, for tax in dispute, are calculated on a daily basis. If the tax is in dispute across more than one of the above periods, the interest or additional tax charged or the interest payable will be calculated at the daily rate that applies in each separate period. For example: The Commissioner is successful in a case where the tax is in dispute from 1 March 1999 to 31 May 1999. The unpaid tax would attract interest at 12.48 % (on a daily basis) for the first 7 days, then 10.59% (on a daily basis) for the other 85 days. TIB Vol 11, No. 6 (July 1999) contains details of amendments to the r ules on tax in dispute and use of money interest which confirm their application to income years prior to 1997. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.7 (August1999) 33 MATTERS OF INTEREST GST AND BLOODSTOCK DESTINED FOR EXPORT Introduction This policy statement amends Inland Revenue’ s previous policy statements on zero-rating of Goods and Ser vices Tax and expor t of bloodstock contained in T argeted Circular T/C 91/111, TIBs Vol.2 No.7, Vol.3 No.3, Vol.4 No.6. This statement sets out the policy in relation to bloodstock destined for export that will not be exported within 28 days of the time of supply. Background Under section 11(1C)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 the Commissioner may extend the period of time that goods sold for export may remain in New Zealand where it is not practicable, due to the nature of the supply, for the goods to be exported within 28 days of the time of supply . The previous policy statements set out the maximum extension period available for bloodstock exports to Asia as 10 months and to other destinations as 6 months. Policy The Commissioner has a discretion to extend the 28-day period before the supply of goods is charged with GST wher e, due to the natur e of the supply, it is not practicable for the supplier to export the goods within 28 days of the time of supply . Pursuant to this policy statement, the Commissioner may grant an extension of time to a maximum of 12 months from the time of supply. The extension is available for all age bloodstock to all destinations. There can be no “consumption” for GST purposes of the bloodstock in NZ prior to export. For a definition of “consumption” please see TIB Vol.4 No.6 An application for an extension must be made in writing accompanied by a copy of the contract of supply directed to your local Inland Revenue office. Bloodstock exported by the supplier For goods to be zero-rated when supplied the - supplier will enter the goods for export, pursuant to the Customs and Excise Act 1996, in the course of, or as a condition of making the supply and will export the goods; or goods will be deemed to be entered for export, pursuant to the Customs and Excise Act 1996, and exported by the supplier in the course of, or as a condition of, making the supply. By contrast, if a horse is sold in New Zealand and exported by the purchaser, it is the purchaser and not the supplier who is the exporter. As a result this supply could not be zero-rated. Liability where zero-rated bloodstock is on-sold or not exported If the zero-rated supply of bloodstock for export is on-sold by the purchaser to another party (regardless of whether the other party is in New Zealand or overseas) then the supply could not be zero-rated. The original supplier would be liable for the GST that would have been chargeable if GST had been levied at the applicable rate (currently 12.5%). Application date of policy The policy contained in this statement will be effective from the 16th of August 1999.

PORTABLE TOILETS – DRAFT GENERAL DEPRECIATION DETERMINATION Currently, there is no specific general economic depreciation rate for portable toilets. In the past taxpayers have been able to use the default class under the “Cleaning, refuse and recycling” industry category, which sets a depreciation rate of 22% D.V. (15.5% S.L.), based on an estimated useful life of 8 years. For those portable toilets that are let for short-term periods of less than one month, the “Hire equipment (short-term hire of one month or less only)” asset category sets a depreciation rate of 33% D.V. for “Cleaning, refuse and recycling equipment for hire with a general DV rate of 22%”, based on an estimated useful life of 5 years. We have been advised that it is usual for portable toilets to be let for both short and long-term periods, with the same toilets being used for both purposes. Under the current depreciation schedule, only those toilets let exclusively for short-term periods could use the preferential depreciation rate under the “Hire equipment” asset category. We have also been advised that the useful life of portable toilets, whether hired for short or long-term periods is 5 years. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general depreciation determination that will insert a new asset class of “Portable toilets” into the “Cleaning, refuse and recycling” industry category, with a depreciation rate of 33% D.V. (24% S.L.), based on an estimated useful life of 5 years. The draft determination is reproduced below. The proposed new depreciation rates are based on the estimated useful life set out in the determination and a residual value of 13.5%.

These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. EXCLUSION FROM THE TERM “DIVIDENDS” – WHETHER DISTRIBUTION MADE IN LIEU OF DIVIDENDS’ PAYMENT Summary This interpretation statement considers the application of section CF 3(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994 in relation to the factors to be taken into account in determining whether an acquisition, redemption, or cancellation of shares is made in lieu of the payment of dividends. Section CF 2 provides a wide definition of the term “dividends”. Prima facie, all distributions from a company to its shareholders are dividends. Under section CF 2(1)(g), a dividend includes any amount distributed in respect of the acquisition, redemption, or cancellation of shares in a company or other reduction or return of share capital of a company. However, section CF 3 provides certain exclusions from the definition, including distributions made on the repurchase, redemption, or cancellation of shares in certain situations. Broadly speaking, the legislation provides a rebuttable presumption that a capital reduction of 15% or more is a return of capital, rather than a dividend. The Commissioner can rebut this presumption if it appears that the company is returning capital in substitution for a dividend. Alternatively, upon application, the Commissioner can notify a company that a 10% or more reduction is not in substitution of a dividend on similar grounds. Included in the tests of whether an amount distributed to shareholders in the above circumstances is excluded from the term “dividends” under section CF 3(1)(b), is whether the payment is “made in lieu of the payment of dividends”. If it is established that the payment is made in lieu of dividends, the exclusion does not apply and the amount will remain a dividend under section CF 2. The Commissioner takes into account a number of factors, set out in section CF 3(1)(b)(iii), in determining whether the “in lieu of dividend” test is met. This item provides some guidance as to how the Commissioner applies his discretion in determining whether these factors apply to a given situation. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Issues Section CF 3(1)(b)(iii) lists the factors to which the Commissioner must have regard in satisfying himself that a repurchase, redemption, or cancellation of shares is not made in lieu of the payment of dividends. These are: The nature and amount of dividends paid by the company prior or subsequent to the relevant cancellation; and The issue of shares in the company subsequent to the relevant cancellation; and The expressed purpose or purposes of the relevant cancellation; and Any other relevant factor. The issue is the nature of the factors and circumstances the Commissioner takes into account in exercising his discretion in situations involving the cancellation of shares. Background Law reform introduced by the Companies Act 1993 now makes it easier for a company to repurchase or redeem its own shares. The Act provides that the company must have the express power to do so under its constitution. In essence, the share repurchase provisions are a means of returning capital back to shareholders, which previously required an application to the High Court. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) Section 52 of that Act provides that the company must satisfy a solvency test before making any distribution to shareholders. The term “solvency test” is defined in section 4 of the Act, and its effect is to ensure that the company does not distribute amounts greater than its net assets and has sufficient funds available to meet its normal business outgoings. The company law reform has meant that income tax rules also had to be formulated to cover both share repurchases and share redemptions. A series of tests known as the “brightline” tests were introduced into the Income Tax Act 1994 which, prima facie, allow such repurchases or redemptions on a tax-free basis if specific criteria have been met. In summary, these tests treat the repurchases of small parcels of shares (generally where the repurchase is less than 10% of the market value of all shares) as dividends, and larger parcels as tax-free. This is necessary to prevent companies distributing their earnings to their shareholders by way of tax-free repurchases and not dividends. It is recognised that substantial repurchases should be treated for tax purposes as a partial liquidation of the company. Where the cancellation is part of a pro rata offer to all shareholders, the capital reduction must be either at least 10%, or at least 15% of all shares in the company. For a reduction that falls between the 10% and 15% thresholds, the company must make application to the Commissioner. The “brightline” test, which applies to shares that are not non-participating redeemable shares, was set at 15% - considered to be approximately three times the typical dividend yield - to provide reasonable scope for a company genuinely reducing the size of its operation to fund a one-off distribution to its shareholders from tax-free reserves. When taxpayer behaviour defeats the purpose of the new rules, the Commissioner has a residual discretion to treat a distribution on the repurchase of shares as being in lieu of the payment of dividends. Evidence of this would be if the repurchase were made under an arrangement to acquire, redeem, or otherwise cancel shares in lieu of the payment of a dividend. Factors that the Commissioner takes into account in deciding the matter are contained in section CF 3(1)(b)(iii) and include the nature and amount of dividends paid by the company prior to, and subsequent to, the particular cancellation, and whether there is any subsequent issue of shares after the cancellation. In addition, the Commissioner has the discretion to take into account any other relevant factors (section CF 3(1)(b)(iii)(D)). The “in lieu of dividend” test applies regardless of whether the shares are non-participating shares and regardless of whether the brightline tests are satisfied. Legislation Section CF 3(1)(b) provides an exclusion from the term “dividends” of any amount distributed on the acquisition, redemption, or cancellation of shares in a company under certain circumstances. It states: In this Act, and subject to the provisions of this section, the term “dividends”, in relation to any company, does not include - (b)Any amount distributed upon the acquisition, redemption, or other cancellation (in whole but not in part) by the company of any share in the company (referred to in this paragraph as the “relevant cancellation”) where - (i) If the share is not a non-participating redeemable share, - (A) The relevant cancellation is part of a pro rata cancellation where the company has a fifteen percent capital reduction; or (B) The relevant cancellation is part of a pro rata cancellation where the company has a ten percent capital reduction and, upon application to the Commissioner by the company in such form as the Commissioner may specify, the Commissioner notifies the company in writing that the Commissioner has no reasonable grounds to conclude (having regard to the factors specified in subparagraph (iii)(A) to (D) that either the whole or any part of the relevant cancellation is made in lieu of the payment of dividends; or (C) The relevant cancellation is not part of a pro rata cancellation but the shareholder suffers a fifteen percent interest reduction; or (D) The company is an unlisted trust and the share was issued on such terms that its redemption is subject to subparagraph (iv)(A); or (E) The relevant cancellation is not part of a pro- rata cancellation and the company is an unlisted trust and the share was issued on such terms that its redemption is subject to subparagraph (iv)(B); and (ii) The relevant cancellation is not an on-market acquisition; and (iii) The Commissioner has given, in respect of the relevant cancellation, the notice referred to in subparagraph (i)(B) or otherwise is satisfied that neither the whole nor any part of the relevant cancellation was made in lieu of the payment of dividends, having regard to - (A) The nature and amount of dividends paid by the company prior or subsequent to the relevant cancellation; and (B) The issue of shares in the company subsequent to the relevant cancellation; and (C) The expressed purpose or purposes of the relevant cancellation; and (D) Any other relevant factor; and 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) (iv) To the extent that the amount distributed does not exceed - (A) In any case where the company is an unlisted trust and the share is issued on such terms that its redemption is subject to this subsubparagraph, the available subscribed capital per share; and (B) In any other case, the available subscribed capital per share cancelled: The definitions of “fifteen percent capital reduction” and “ten percent capital reduction” are contained in section CF 3(14): “Fifteen percent capital reduction” means, in respect of any company and any pro rata cancellation (referred to in this definition as the “relevant cancellation”), the circumstance where the aggregate amount paid by the company on account of the relevant cancellation (or paid by the company at the same time on account of any other pro rata cancellation of shares other than non-participating redeemable shares) is equal to or greater than 15% of the market value of all shares (not being non-participating redeemable shares) in the company at the time the company first notified shareholders of the proposed relevant cancellation (or, in any case where no advance notice was given, the time of the relevant cancellation): “Ten percent capital reduction” means, in respect of any company and any pro rata cancellation (referred to in this definition as the “relevant cancellation”), the circumstance where the aggregate amount paid by the company on account of the relevant cancellation (or paid by the company at the same time on account of any other pro rata cancellation of shares other than non-participating redeemable shares) is equal to or greater than 10% of the market value of all shares (not being non-participating redeemable shares) in the company at the time the company first notified shareholders of the proposed relevant cancellation (or, in any case where no advance notice was given, the time of the relevant cancellation): Section FC 1(1) states: Where in any debenture issued by a company the rate of interest payable in respect of the debenture is not specifically determined, but is determinable from time to time - (a)By reference to the dividend payable by the company; or (b)By reference to the company’s profits, however measured, for debentures issued after 8 pm New Zealand Standard Time on 23 October 1986 other than those issued under a binding contract entered into before that time; or (c)In any other manner, for debentures issued before the time specified in paragraph (b),- no deduction shall be made, in calculating the assessable income of the company, in respect of any interest payable under the debenture or of any expenditure or loss incurred in connection with the debenture or in borrowing the money secured by or owing under it. Section FC 2(1) deals with interest on debentures issued in substitution for shares: Where a company has issued debentures to its shareholders or to any class of its shareholders, and the amount of the debenture or debentures issued to each shareholder of the company or of that class has been determined by reference to the number or to the available subscribed capital per share of, or by reference or otherwise to, the shares in that company or in any other company (whether or not that other company is being or has been liquidated) that were held by or on behalf of the shareholder at the time the debentures were issued or at any earlier time, no deduction shall be allowed to the company, in respect of any interest payable under any debenture so issued or of any expenditure or loss incurred in connection with any such debenture or in borrowing the money secured by or owing under any such debenture. Section FC 2(2) provides a link to FC 1: Section FC 1 shall apply with respect to all debentures to which subsection (1) applies and to the interest payable under those debentures, in the same manner as if those debentures and that interest were debentures and interest of the kinds referred to in section FC 1. The definition of “share” or “shares” is contained in section OB 1 and includes: (a)Except in section DF 7, includes- (i) ... (ii) Any debenture to which section FC 1 or FC 2 applies: Application of the Legislation The Valabh Committee in its final report The Taxation of Distributions from Companies (July 1991) at page 31 discussed the need to distinguish between transactions that used the share cancellation process as a substitute for paying shareholders a dividend, and genuine commercially motivated transactions: A difficulty in defining and applying an anti-avoidance provision aimed at reductions in capital (or share repurchases) made in substitution for assessable dividends is in drawing a line between genuine commercially motivated transactions and those intended to avoid tax. The extremes between these alternatives are known. For example, where a company normally pays two dividends a year and one of those dividends in terms of approximate date and quantum is not paid but a partial reduction is made, it is clear that the capital reduction is in substitution of a dividend. At the other extreme, if the company sold a substantial part of its business and paid a substantial amount in addition to the normal dividend, it would not be a dividend substitution. Under section CF 3(1)(b)(iii),the Commissioner has a residual discretion to deem the share cancellation to be a dividend if it appears that the company is returning capital in substitution for dividends. In exercising this discretion, the Commissioner must consider the factors outlined in that provision. A discussion of these factors follows. 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) Nature and amount of dividends paid by the company prior or subsequent to the relevant cancellation Prima facie, the nature and amount of dividends paid prior to and after a share repurchase (or redemption) may indicate that amounts paid on repurchase are in lieu of a dividend. This may be the case if it appears that the company has not paid dividends, which would ordinarily be payable, prior to or after the acquisition, but has instead built-up its retained earnings and paid these out on a share acquisition. A low or no dividend policy, or an unexplained change in policy to reduce dividends, together with an increase in retained earnings, may indicate that the company is, or has been, taking such an approach. Where the Commissioner is asked to give a ruling on a proposed transaction, reliance would be given to knowledge gained before the cancellation in respect of dividends to be paid after the cancellation. That knowledge might include dividends declared but not paid, and knowledge of the directors’ intentions and expectations (including knowledge of the company’s dividend policy). The legislation refers to “dividends paid”. It does not refer to expectations, purpose, intentions, or policy. The test is not based on the company’s dividend policy but is stated explicitly in terms of its practice or history in paying dividends. However, the company’s dividend policy may help the Commissioner to determine the practice in issuing dividends. If there is no apparent pattern in the issue of dividends, but the company can show that it has adhered to an explicit policy that refers to objective criteria, the Commissioner may be able to draw conclusions that would not otherwise be available. Overall, this factor focuses on the company’s dividend policy or practice both before and after the share cancellation. Its purpose is to detect any changes or variations in the company’s dividend policy that indicate that the share cancellation is replacing a dividend the company would normally pay. Such inferences could be drawn from a combination of an increase in retained earnings and either a low dividend policy, or an unexplained change in policy or practice to reduce dividends. Issue of shares in the company subsequent to the relevant cancellation A company may acquire sufficient shares to meet the brightline levels for capital reduction, i.e. the 10% or 15% of market value of shares, (and, by doing so, effect a tax free distribution) and subsequently may reissue shares so that the effective capital reduction is less than the brightlines. If the subsequent reissue is to replace cash which is necessary to meet the company’s current operational or capital expenditure, this suggests that the company did not really intend, and was not really in a position, to reduce its capital, and that the funds paid out on repurchase were in lieu of dividends. If, after a share redemption takes place, a reissue of shares is made to only some of the shareholders, there will be an uneven effect on the shareholders, being those that previously held shares but no longer do so, and those that now have more shares. This will not affect the potential application of section CF 3(1)(b) however, as that paragraph does not distinguish between situations according to which shareholders receive reissued shares. An example of a cancellation of shares and a subsequent reissue is where, shortly after a share repurchase of 15%, a company reissues 10% of its shares. The result of this reissue, (the initial capital reduction of 15% minus the 10% of newly issued shares), results in total capital reduction of 5% which falls below the minimum brightline test of 10%. Such a transaction would indicate that the company has in reality effected a distribution that is more indicative of a dividend as opposed to a bona fide reduction in capital. The length of time between the cancellation and the issue of shares is relevant: the shorter this period is, the more likely the cancellation is made in lieu of the payment of dividends. If the Commissioner is asked to give a binding ruling on a proposed share repurchase transaction, he is placed in the difficult situation of having to consider the issue of shares by the company after the cancellation. The Commissioner then has to rely on knowledge available before the cancellation in respect of share issues planned for after the cancellation. That knowledge might include share issue offers made or received, and any information supplied by the directors and the shareholders regarding their intentions or expectations related to share issues. The Commissioner might also wish to make an assumption in the ruling about future share issues. Expressed purpose or purposes of the relevant cancellation This factor focuses on why the company is seeking to cancel shares. When the company can show a genuine commercial reason for cancelling the shares, this will indicate the cancellation is unlikely to be a dividend. The provision does not require the Commissioner to accept statements by or on behalf of the company that do not reflect the genuine intention of the company. The more intuitive and compelling the reason for the cancellation of the shares, the stronger this factor will be in reaching the overall decision. The existence of a genuine 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) commercial motive for the transaction should assist in indicating that the distribution is not in lieu of dividends. For example the expressed purpose of a repurchase and cancellation may be a necessary step in the reorganisation of the ownership and corporate structure of a group. It could be directed towards placing the overall strategic control of the group in the hands of its principals and certain senior employees, rather than outside shareholders. These are bona fide commercial reasons for a share cancellation. Another purpose of a cancellation may be that the company has surplus capital, notwithstanding a high dividend policy, and wishes to alter its debt:equity ratio to more closely align it with other companies in the same industry (in market value terms) and to increase its earnings per share. In such a case the company will borrow the cash to fund the share buyback, thereby helping it achieve its desired debt:equity ratio. This purpose provides sound commercial reasons for the cancellation and would support a view that the repurchase is not in lieu of a dividend. Other valid commercial reasons for reducing capital would include: Reducing funding costs by replacing its equity funding with cheaper debt funding, and by reducing the administration costs associated with a large and diverse shareholding. Reducing its cash balance to improve balance sheet performance and reduce its vulnerability to take-over. These reasons would of course need to be supported by evidence of the company’s requirements, costs of funding, industry norms, market rates, and so on. Any other relevant factor The Valabh Committee Final Report “The Taxation of Distributions from Companies” (July 1991) and the discussion document “Tax Implications of Company Law Reform” (December 1993) indicated that the following factors may be relevant as to whether a return of capital is in lieu of dividends: Is the capital reduction part of the down- sizing of the company? If so, this would be an indication the cancellation is not in lieu of dividends. Has the company been retaining earnings and then distributing them without any accompanying reduction of the business? A distribution arising from a cancellation of shares in this case would more than likely be in lieu of dividends. Has there been a sale of part of the business, accompanied by the return of a sizeable amount to the shareholders in addition to a dividend? If so, this would point to the cancellation not being in lieu of a dividend. Is the capital return an unusual one-off event? If it is, this too would suggest that the cancellation is not a disguised dividend. Conversely, if there have been previous capital reductions, this may lead to the conclusion that the reductions are in lieu of dividends. Will the cancellation leave the shareholders’ interests largely unchanged, or will the shareholders’ interests decline significantly with the capital reduction, i.e. the size of shareholder capital across the board will be significantly less? A substantial change would be grounds for presuming that the cancellation has a purpose other than, or in addition to, a distribution of funds. A minimal change could indicate that the payment resulting from the cancellation was in lieu of a dividend. An example of one of these factors is where a company (likely to be a closely-held company) accumulates earnings until they represent 15 percent or more of the market value of the company. The company then makes a distribution, ostensibly as a result of a down-sizing operation, but without reducing any of its core business. Such a distribution would be in lieu of dividends. Similarly, successive disproportionate reductions that leave the respective interests of shareholders largely unchanged, could also be in lieu of dividends. Another example is that of a company purchasing all a shareholder’s shares thus resulting in the exit of that shareholder from the company. This could be the company’s first share repurchase, and, to that extent, would be an “unusual event”. This suggests that the payment is not made in lieu of any dividend, but rather to facilitate a shareholder’s exit. FC 1 and FC 2 debentures An issue is whether the redemption of debentures that fall within the provisions of sections FC 1 and FC 2 should be subjected to the in lieu of dividend criteria in section CF 3(1)(b)(iii). Under section FC 1, if a debenture is issued where the rate of interest is not specified but is ordinarily based either on the dividend payable by the company or the profits of the company, no deduction is allowed for the interest. Under section FC 2(1), if a company issues debentures to its shareholders based on the number of shares the shareholders have in the company, again no deduction is allowed for the interest payable in respect of those debentures. 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) These debentures (like section FC 1 debentures) fall within the definition of “shares” under section OB 1. The debentures are, in effect, issued in substitution for shares. Where a company cancels or redeems these debentures, either in whole or in part, the Act treats this as if it was cancelling or redeeming ordinary shares. The redemption or cancellation of these debentures is therefore subject to the provisions of section CF 3(1)(b). Whether or not the repayments in respect of these debentures are in lieu of dividends will be determined on the basis of all four factors noted in this paragraph. The terms and conditions of repayment are matters the Commissioner will take into account to the extent that they are relevant to the factors in CF 3(1)(b) in determining whether the redemption or cancellation is in lieu of dividends. Example 1 As at 31 March 1997 Company A had share capital of $100,000, being 100,000 shares of $1, and accumulated profits of $20,000. Its shareholders planned to extract the $20,000 accumulated profits as dividends. However, because of a previous change of shareholding, Company A did not have sufficient imputation credits available to pay fully imputed dividends. Accordingly, the shareholders returned $20,000 share capital tax free, by redeeming 20,000 shares. Is the subsequent amount paid to shareholders excluded from the term “dividends” under section CF 3(1)(b)? The amount is not excluded. Under section CF 3(1)(b)(iii), the exemption will apply if the Commissioner “is satisfied that neither the whole nor any part of the relevant cancellation was made in lieu of the payment of dividends ...”. This provision is aimed at returns of capital which, in normal commercial terms, would have been paid as dividends. In the example the redemption of shares is made in lieu of dividends and the exemption does not therefore apply. Example 2 On 31 March 1997 Company B makes a capital distribution of $5M by cancelling 5,000,000 shares paid up to $1 each. Its total share capital is $30M. The company advises that its policy in respect of dividends is to pay 80% of profit after providing for interest, taxation, and the funding of asset replacement to maintain operating assets at an appropriate level. No definition of “appropriate” is given. This policy is not expected to alter. For the last two years, 1995 and 1996, it has paid dividends amounting to $1.5M and $3.5M respectively, representing 15% and 35% percent of profits in those two years. The company has not issued further shares since the cancellation. It advises that the purpose of the cancellation was to increase its debt:equity ratio to 30% debt and 70% equity. It has not down-sized its business. The retained earnings of the company amount to $10M. The question is whether the amount paid to shareholders will be excluded from the term “dividends” under section CF 3(1)(b). The first test as to the nature and amount of dividends the company issues is an objective one which looks to its practice in paying dividends. In the absence of a pattern in issuing dividends, the company would need to show that it has adhered to an explicit policy that refers to objective criteria. In the example there is no apparent pattern of dividend distribution. Under examination, the company’s dividend policy is apparently based on subjective criteria. It is not possible to draw any inference from the amount of past or future dividends paid where the amount of payment is determined after providing for inter alia “funding of asset replacement required to maintain the assets at an appropriate level”. Therefore, consideration of the nature and amount of dividends prior to and subsequent to the cancellation does not give any indication as to whether the cancellation will be made in lieu of dividends. The company has not issued further shares subsequent to the cancellation - a factor that assists the company’s case that the distribution to shareholders resulting from the cancellation is not in lieu of dividends. The company advises that the purpose of the cancellation was to increase its debt:equity ratio. However, other factors such as maintenance of its current level of business operations, and its retained earnings being in excess of the proposed amount to be distributed to shareholders, lead towards the conclusion that the cancellation is in lieu of dividends. In this example, on the evidence produced it would be difficult to satisfy the Commissioner that the distribution resulting from the cancellation of shares is not in lieu of dividends. 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) Example 3 Company C, a wool exporting company, has restructured its ownership to reflect a move away from having a mix of supplier and non-supplier shareholders. One of the company shareholders, Company D, a company that does not supply a product to Company C, purchased all the shares that the other non-supplier shareholders held in Company C. Company C then repurchased all of Company D’s shares. Company C’s shareholding then consisted solely of companies from which it purchased products. Company C has accumulated losses. In past years the company has paid out dividends when it has been able, and has a policy of paying dividends in the future. It advises that the share repurchase has not affected its ability to pay out dividends subsequently. The company also advises it has not been necessary to issue further shares to replace the capital returned to the shareholder in the repurchase, and evidence shows this to be true. The Commissioner now has to decide whether or not the repurchase of Company D’s shares is in lieu of a dividend under section CF 3(1)(b). From the information supplied it does not appear that the proposed redemption was made “in lieu of a dividend”, having regard to the company’s dividend policy. The company has paid dividends in the recent past (when it was able to do so). The company also has accumulated losses. Accordingly, there can be no suggestion that the company has been accumulating earnings that would normally be paid out as dividends. The company has not needed to issue further shares after the repurchase. This suggests that the company is in a position to pay out the shareholder on the repurchase of shares, thus helping to refute any suggestion that the repurchase is in lieu of dividends. The repurchase was part of a wider arrangement involving a change in ownership of the company, reflecting a desire to change the ownership from a mix of supplier and non-supplier shareholders to ownership by supplier shareholders. For this reason, the fact that the repurchase was to facilitate the exit of a major shareholder (which in itself is an unusual one-off event), leads to the conclusion that the repurchase was not in lieu of a dividend. Example 4 Company A decides to consolidate its business by selling assets surplus to requirements. The company distributes the capital profits to its shareholders by way of a pro-rata cancellation of more than 15% of its shares. Company B, which owns assets of the type used in the core business of company A, sells these assets to company A in exchange for an issue of shares. These actions would appear to amount to a straight cancellation of shares and a subsequent reissue to recoup capital - thus appearing to constitute a distribution to shareholders in lieu of dividends. The fact that the reissue of shares was not to all the shareholders is not a relevant consideration. The section does not require the Commissioner to address the shareholders’ position directly. The Commissioner is concerned with the initial transaction, i.e., the cancellation of shares and the resulting distribution to shareholders. A later reissue of shares provides an indication that the company was not in a position to reduce its capital and that the funds paid out were in lieu of dividends. A cancellation of shares and subsequent reissue must be considered in light of all the facts. For example, the period of time between the cancellation and the reissue may be relevant - the shorter the time, the greater the chance of the reissue being known prior to the cancellation. If it is known that a later reissue was required soon after the date of cancellation, then this would be a strong indicator on its own that the distribution was in lieu of dividends. Essentially, whether a distribution is in lieu of dividends requires the same approach in all situations - the Commissioner cannot look at just one factor in isolation - all four factors would have to be considered before a determination could be made that the distribution was or was not in lieu of dividends. One of the factors that could be relevant here is the expressed purpose or purposes of the cancellation. In this case, if the company has genuine commercial reasons for the share cancellation and the subsequent reissue of shares and none of the other section CF 3(1)(b) factors applied, then this would provide support for the conclusion that the distribution was not in lieu of dividends. 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) BINDING RULINGS This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently.

The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the making available by an employer to an employee of a car park that is on land or in a building owned or leased by the employer, and there is an exclusive right to occupy the property, and a legal estate or interest in that property. This includes space in a public car park where the space is subject to a lease between the employer and the proprietor of the car park. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: The car park provided by an employer to an employee is excluded from the definition of “fringe benefit” in section CI 1(h) by section CI 1(q), and the employer is not liable to fringe benefit tax in these circumstances. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 November 1999 to 31 March 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 12th day of August 1999. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 99/6 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusion reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 99/6 (“the Ruling”). Background A question exists as to whether the provision of a car park by an employer to an employee gives rise to a fringe benefit tax (FBT) liability. The Ruling confirms that an employer-provided car park is not subject to FBT if the car park is provided on land or in a building that the employer owns or leases, and there is an exclusive right to occupy the property and a legal estate or interest in that property. (The term “exclusive right” in the Ruling is to be understood as referring not only to a single tenant/lessee situation, but also to the right of several lessees under the same lease agreement to exclude persons other than themselves.) Included is a space in a public car park where that space is subject to such a lease between the employer and the proprietor of the car park. This is because the car park is considered to be part of the employer’s premises. Further information on FBT may be found in Inland Revenue’s Fringe benefit tax guide, IR 409. The statement on page 33 of that guide on staff car parks should be read in the light of the Ruling and this commentary. Legislation Section CI 1(h) defines a fringe benefit to include: Any benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed by the employee in the quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year, - being, as the case may be, ..., or a benefit that is used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee (whether that employment will occur, is occurring, or has occurred) and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee; ... Section CI 1(q) excludes from the definition of “fringe benefit” under section CI 1(h): Any benefit (not being a benefit which consists of the use or enjoyment of free, discounted, or subsidised travel, accommodation, or clothing) that is provided by the employer of the employee on the premises of the employer, not being premises that are occupied by the employee of the employer for residential purposes (or that, at any time when the employee is required to perform duties for the employer on premises, not being residential premises of the employee, other than those of the employer, or by any other person on those other premises), where the benefit is enjoyed by the employee on those premises (or, as the case may be, on those other premises). Application of the Legislation Under section CI 1(h), a benefit of “any other kind whatever” received by an employee directly or indirectly in relation to or by virtue of the employee’s employment, is subject to the FBT regime. The granting of a car park by an employer to an employee is a benefit under section CI 1(h) and is prima facie liable for FBT. While Parliament could have excluded all car parks from the FBT regime, it has not done so. However, section CI 1(q) excludes (with certain exceptions) from the definition of “fringe benefit” a benefit that is provided “by the employer of the employee on the premises of the employer” (the “on premises exemption”). Accordingly, it is the phrase “the premises of the employer” that must be considered, and the extent of the exclusion ascertained by reference to those words. As the following discussion reveals, not all car parks are exempt, and a line has to be drawn between those that are and those that are not. As “premises of the employer” is not defined in the Act, the question arises as to whether those words are restricted to the place in which the employer carries on business, i.e. “business premises”, or whether they are unrestricted in meaning and include all premises. The exemption provided in the Act is not for car parks generally, but for car parks provided on the employer’s premises. This exclusion was provided for fringe benefits because of the complications of administration and valuation that accompany “on premises” benefits. Factors that would have to be addressed are whether the tax should be based on the nominal capacity of the parking area or the actual utilisation of the benefit provided, the value to be given sealed and unsealed parks, etc. So it was never intended that car parks provided off the premises by way of a licence from a car park proprietor would be exempt from FBT. The benefit in such a case would be simply the cost of the park, but the valuation of a car park provided on the employer’s premises would be more difficult. While it could be said that some leased car parks (those provided by an independent car park proprietor) would be easily valued, in many cases parks on land leased by an employer would present the same problems as parks on land the employer owns. Accordingly, one would expect the on premises exemption to cover leased parks as well. 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) “Premises” is defined in The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, (1993 Edition) as, “a house or building with its grounds etc. ... .” The word “of” has many meanings, and the same dictionary defines “of” in the sense of possession as: 22 Belonging to (a person or thing) as something that he, she, or it has or possesses, or as a quality or attribute; having a specified relationship to (a person). The term “premises” has been discussed in a number of cases. In Lethbridge v Lethbridge (1861) 30 LJ Ch 388 it was said at page 393: There is no doubt, ... that the word admits of a limited as well as an enlarged sense, and that the context and surrounding circumstances must determine whether it was used in an enlarged or limited sense. Over a century later in the case of Maunsell v Olins \[1975\] AC 373; \[1975\] 1 All ER 16, Viscount Dilhorne expressed the same idea in this way at pages 383 and 19 respectively: “Premises” is an ordinary word of the English language which takes colour and content from the context in which it is used. ... It has, in my opinion, no recognised and established primary meaning. The word was discussed by Edwards J in In re Alloway \[1916\] NZLR 433 at page 443 in relation to the Chattels Transfer Act 1908 where he said: The word “premises” is here used in contradistinction to the word “lands”, and it seems to me to be plain that it is used in its popular sense, of which many illustrations are to be found in Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary. In that sense the word means any place occupied or exclusively used by any person for any purpose. The words “the ‘premises’ of a man engaged in business” signify the place in which he carries on his business. Such premises may be wholly buildings, as in the case of many shopkeepers; or wholly land, as in the case of a timber-yard; or partly buildings and partly land, as in the case of a timber-yard used in conjunction with a large joinery business; ... . In Re Simersall; Blackwell v Bray (1992) 35 FCR 586 at p 591, it was said: The term “of” in \[the relevant statute\] is apt to embrace a connection or association falling short of absolute ownership. Considering the definition of the word “of” first, the above indicates that the key in this usage of the word is possession or ownership. Therefore, in respect of premises, the word “of” indicates that to qualify as “the premises of the employer” there must be a right of ownership or possession. This may be satisfied if the premises are owned, rented or leased by the employer, since in the case of a lease the lessee obtains exclusive possession. A mere licence (that is, where the employer has permission from some third party to allow it or its employees to enter and occupy land for the purpose of car parking) would not meet this test of ownership or a possessory interest, as a licensee would have no such legal rights, but merely a right to use the premises. It may be difficult to decide in some cases whether there is a lease or a licence, and the nomenclature used by the parties is not decisive. The two factors that need to be considered are whether the legal right of exclusive possession has been given, and the intention of the parties to be inferred from the circumstances and their conduct; Butterworths Land Law in New Zealand by Hinde, McMorland and Sim, (Butterworths 1997) at pages 431 - 435. The creation and nature of a licence is explained in Halsbury’s Laws of England, Fourth Edition Reissue (Butterworths, London 1994) Vol. 27(1) at paragraphs 9 and 10 in the following way: A licence is normally created where a person is granted the right to use premises without becoming entitled to exclusive possession of them, or where exceptional circumstances exist which negative the presumption of the grant of a tenancy. If the agreement is merely for the use of the property in a certain way and on certain terms while the property remains in the owner’s possession and control, the agreement operates as a licence, even though the agreement may employ words appropriate to a lease. ... A mere licence does not create any estate or interest in the property to which it relates; it only makes an act lawful which otherwise would be unlawful. So the word “of” in the phrase “the premises of the employer” in section CI 1(q) introduces the requirement that the employer must either own or lease the premises. That is, the employer must have an estate or interest in the property and not merely a right to use it. If he or she does not own the premises in question, there would have to be a lease agreement for that employer to claim the benefit of the exemption provided by section CI 1(q). The phrase “the premises of the employer” in paragraph (q) is not the same as the phrase “grounds over which the employer has some rights”. As far as the interpretation of the word “premises” is concerned, the Commissioner’s view is that, in the context of parking facilities and the FBT legislation, “premises” should be interpreted broadly to include land, buildings, and parts of buildings. Therefore, a car park will form part of the premises of the employer where the land or building on or in which it is situated is owned or leased by the employer, and there is an exclusive right to occupy the property, as well as a legal estate or interest in it. Furthermore, the fact that the employer is not carrying on business on the premises owned or leased does not prevent an employer-provided car park from being excluded from the definition of “fringe benefit” in section CI 1(h). This means that an area of land owned or leased by the employer that is available for employee parking, although it is located away from the employer’s business premises, would qualify for the exemption. The land need not be adjacent to the business premises. 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) If the car park is in a public parking facility and the employer arranges and pays the proprietor to make available certain parks for the employer’s employees, generally speaking the car parks will be benefits that are subject to FBT. This is because in these circumstances, the employer will have a mere licence (that is to say, permission for it and its employees to enter the property for the purpose of parking while the property remains in the owner’s possession and control), rather than a more formal agreement or lease that would entitle the employer to an interest in or exclusive possession of the parking facility or any part of it. Accordingly, it could not be said that the spaces or parks provided would be “the premises of the employer”. This conclusion is consistent with Esso Australia Limited v FCT 98 ATC 4,953 a decision of the Federal Court of Australia. While that case considered whether certain childcare facilities were part of the narrower (and defined) term “business premises ... of the employer” for Australian FBT purposes and the outcome is not relevant in this context, at page 4,958 the judge (Merkel J) said: It seems to me that, ... for the relevant business premises to be those of an employer, the employer must have a right to possession of the premises, at least to the extent necessary to enable the conduct thereon of the relevant recreational or child care facility. It is important to note that there was a lease in existence in Esso, and the licence situation was not discussed. Indeed at page 4,958 of the judgment, Merkel J acknowledged that (even with a lease) the more employers that shared the particular premises, the harder it would be to say that they were premises of a particular employer. Accordingly, it is still considered that there is a distinction to be made between premises leased for the purposes of car parking, and premises upon which a person merely has a licence to enter for the purpose of parking a car. Where no specific park is made available, but that person simply parks at any spot available from day to day, the distinction would be even greater. When an employer has a lease agreement, the question will depend on the precise terms of the agreement. If a specific car park space were held under the lease, the exemption would apply. On the other hand, if there is no lease or specific spaces are not allocated under a lease agreement, it is not considered that such car parks are “premises of the employer”. Note:In some cases it may well be that the employer is simply acting on behalf of the employee in arranging and paying for the car park, e.g. the employee arranges his or her own parking but the employer pays the owner of the car park directly. In this situation, if the employer simply pays the parking fees on the employee’s behalf, the sums paid are monetary remuneration of the employee. There could conceivably be situations where, although the employer both arranges and pays for the car park, the employer is clearly acting as the employee’s intermediary or agent. The payments by the employer to the car park owner would then come within section EB 1 as being amounts that, although “not ... actually paid to or received by” the employee, are nevertheless “dealt with in the \[employee’s\] interest or on the \[employee’s\] behalf”. In those situations, the parking fees paid to the car park owner would be monetary remuneration of the employee, and taxable accordingly. Comments on technical submissions received Comments received from parties external to Inland Revenue raised objections that the Ruling would be unfair, it would impose further compliance costs on businesses, and would be contrary to Parliament’s intention. These matters have been given serious consideration. The plain meaning of the words “the premises of the employer” would have to be ignored in order to give them a wider interpretation that would extend to premises for which the employer has a licence. While acknowledging that the same practical benefit is received by an employee whether the car park is leased or licensed, the better view of the law, given the words used, is that this expression could not fairly have a construction placed upon it that would include car parks subject to a licence as well as leased car parks. While unfairness and added compliance costs are factors to be taken into account, it is not considered that they outweigh the correctness of this conclusion. While it may be said that Parliament’s intention is unclear, Parliament could have provided a specific exemption for car parks. It has not done so and instead has chosen to make an exemption available for all benefits in general (except travel, accommodation, and clothing) provided on employers’ premises. That being the case, the Commissioner has to apply the test laid down - “the premises of the employer” test - and not some other test. For example the exemption could have been restricted to premises owned by the employer. The test laid down in section CI 1(q) is clearly wider than that, but not specifically wide enough to exempt all car parks. The ordinary meaning of the words used must be interpreted, and that has led to the conclusion that licences are not covered by the exemption. Alternatively, possible to interpret the phrase as meaning business premises, but if that is what Parliament meant, it could have said so. Inland Revenue has made a concession in this respect, its publications stating that business premises are not what is considered to be meant by the word “premises”. 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) The Esso decision has been put forward as supporting the view that licensed car parks would qualify as premises of the employer. However, the Esso case concerned leased premises and the Court said that for the relevant business premises to be those of an employer there would need to be a right to possession (at least to the extent necessary to conduct the relevant child care facility). A licence simply does not confer possession, and so the approach taken in this Ruling does not conflict with the Esso case, which is not considered to go as far as commenting on licensed premises. Example 1 During the year ended 31 March 2000, an employer provides some of her employees with car parks on land across the road from the property in which she carries on her business. The employer is the lessee of that land pursuant to a enforceable and written lease agreement. The Commissioner considers that “premises of the employer” includes land leased by the employer. Therefore, the car parks provided by the employer to the employees are excluded from the definition of “fringe benefit” by section CI 1(q). No fringe benefit arises. The employer does not have to carry on her business on the leased land for the exclusion in section CI 1(q) to apply. Example 2 During the year ended 31 March 2000, an employer arranges parking at a commercial car park for three of her employees. No particular spaces are designated for them, but the car park owner has an area reserved for pre-sold parking that is limited to the number of such parkers so that there are always three parks available for these employees. The Commissioner considers that “the premises of the employer” does not include the car park or any part of it. It does not form part of the employer’s premises as the car parks are not owned by the employer, and the car park owner has not parted with possession, but still retains control of the park. Another distinguishing feature is the lack of specifically allocated parks. The requisite ownership or possessory interest is not, therefore, present so that the car park can be called the “premises of the employer”. Accordingly, the provision of places at the car park by the employer to the employees is subject to FBT under section CI 1(h). The provision of the car parks is not excluded from the definition of “fringe benefit” under section CI 1(q). Example 3 As in Example 2, the employer arranges parking at the commercial car park for the employees, but the employer is allotted a particular area in the car park (spaces 8 - 10) and the car park proprietor bills the employer direct. The car park is not owned by the employer and no part of it is subject to a rental or lease agreement between the employer and the proprietor of the car park (although the employer occasionally refers to the charges made for the use of the car park as “rent”). Although the employer could say that the ability to exclude others from the designated spaces is significant, this is nevertheless a licence arrangement (regardless of the use of the word “rent”) as the employer does not have an estate or possessory interest in the car park or any part of it, only a personal permission for herself and her employees to enter the land for a stipulated purpose. The occupation of space in fulfilment of that purpose is not intended to negate the owner’s exclusive possession of the car park or even of the designated spaces as would be the case if there were a lease agreement. The car parks are not “premises of the employer”: she merely has rights to use them. Because the owner of the car park remains in possession and retains general control over the premises, the arrangement is simply a contractual licence, outside the FBT exemption in section CI 1(q). Consequently, the employer is liable for FBT on the taxable value of these fringe benefits. Example 4 A company, having many employees who use the facilities provided by a nearby commercial car park, decides that it would like to lease the whole of the top floor of the car park. The available area is less than that of the other floors and would suit the requirements of its staff. The owner of the commercial car park agrees to grant a lease to the company, and installs a card access gate to that floor so that only the company’s employees may use the top floor. The written lease agreement provides that the car park owner will perform custodial duties and generally maintain the top floor to the standard of the other areas of the car park. The Commissioner considers that in these circumstances “the premises of the employer” extend to and include the top floor leased from the car park proprietor, and no fringe benefit liability arises by virtue of section CI 1(q). 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) PRODUCT RULING - BR PRD 99/9 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling applies to International Pacific College. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 11(2)(e). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the supply of tuition services to a person who is not resident in New Zealand pursuant to a contract which provides for that non-resident person to pay the tuition fees in respect of an international student at International Pacific College (“the College”). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The College is a charitable body incorporated in New Zealand under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 to promote, establish and conduct education programmes for international students in a fully residential environment. 2.The College is part of the Japanese based Educational Foundation Group (“EFG”) which provides educational services to students. 3.The majority of the College’s students are Japanese, although a small number of students from other countries also attend the College. The College provides tuition services to foreign students on a fee-paying basis. This Ruling is only concerned with tuition fees. Process of enrolment and payment of fees for a new international student 4.EFG, as agent for the College, undertakes a recruitment programme and conducts information forums in Japan for prospective students to study at the College in New Zealand. An application form for an entrance exam is required to be completed by the prospective student and signed by the parent. 5.Entrance examinations are undertaken, and both the student and the parent are interviewed as part of the entrance selection process. 6.The results of the student’s entrance examination are then provided to parents. A standard form letter confirming acceptance is then issued to formally confirm the contractual relationship between the College and the parents for a full four-year period. 7.The parents are required to sign a “Conditions of Acceptance” form. This form is discussed below. Documentation in respect of application, enrolment and payment for a new international student 8.The following documentation is relevant. • Registration form for information forum. • Application for entrance exam. • Assessment sheet for student and parent interview at entrance exam. • Standard form letter of acceptance. • Standard form “Conditions of Acceptance”. • Fees’ notification. 9.The explanation of each of these documents is as follows: Registration questionnaire for information forum 10.This document contains the name, address, and contact details of both the prospective student and his or her parents, and the employment and/or schooling history of the prospective student. Application for entrance exam 11.This form contains details of the prospective student’s name, address, nationality and educational background, and the name, age, and status of each family member. It also contains details relating to the prospective student’s current health, hobbies and interests, and his or her vocational aspirations. Both the prospective student and a parent must sign the form. Assessment sheet for student and parent interview at entrance exam 12.This document records the outcome of interviews with the parents and prospective students by way of assessment according to particular factors. 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) Standard form letter of acceptance, fee letter, and “Conditions of Acceptance” form 13.These documents are evidence of the formation of a binding, unconditional contract for a period of four years between the College and the person or persons who have agreed to pay the fees. 14.The “Conditions of Acceptance” form requires the person(s) who will pay the fees to sign the form. The person(s) must state whether they are the: • Father and mother • Father • Mother • Other person 15.The “Conditions of Acceptance” form also requires the person who has undertaken to pay the fees to answer questions to determine that person’s tax residence status and other relevant matters. Based on the information provided by the person, the College will be able to come to a conclusion about that person’s tax residence status and other matters that require consideration to determine the correct GST outcome. Fees’ notification 16.A letter setting out the fees is issued at the beginning of the year and again in August for the second half of the accommodation fees. Each letter constitutes an invoice for the purposes of the Act. Succeeding year information returns 17.The following documentation is relevant: • Standard fee letter for succeeding years (“the invoice”). • Information return form. 18.The tuition fees are invoiced at the beginning of the academic year. The standard fee letter is accompanied by an information return form that asks similar questions to those in the “Conditions of Acceptance” form referred to above. The information sought includes the number of college days non-resident parents plan to spend in New Zealand and also confirmation of the number of actual college days spent in New Zealand during the previous year. The parent is required to complete, sign, and return this form, together with the fee payment, to the College. Assumption made by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the following assumption: a)The tuition fees charged in respect of the students are solely for tuition services provided by the College. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the following conditions: a)The non-resident parent, guardian, or other person who has contracted with the College, is not inside New Zealand at any time that any of the tuition services are performed. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumption and condition above, the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: The tuition fee charged in respect of an international student for the supply of tuition services is a zero-rated supply for GST purposes in accordance with section 11(2)(e) where the tuition services are contractually supplied by the College to a parent, guardian, or other person who is not a “resident” in terms of section 2(1), and who is outside “New Zealand”, as defined in section 2(1), at the time the tuition services are performed. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 19 October 1998 until 19 October 2001. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of June 1999.

WHETHER GST PAYABLE BY A COMPANY IN LIQUIDATION ON RECOVERY OF VOIDABLE TRANSACTIONS Case:B S Montgomerie as Liquidator of Pasadena Holdings Ltd (Formerly Tisco Services Ltd) v CIR Decision date:2 August 1999 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:Insolvency, voidable transaction, liquidation, GST adjustment Summary Justice Williams found in favour of the Commissioner in regards to partial recoveries and for the Applicant in full recoveries. Facts Mr Montgomerie is the liquidator of Pasadena Holdings Ltd. This action is an application for a direction of the Court as to whether GST is payable by a company in liquidation (“the company”) on recoveries from voidable transactions. There were no facts nor tax in dispute, rather a question of law as to the interaction (if any) between the Companies Act 1993 and the GST Act vis-à-vis voidable transactions. The scenarios presented for the court’s consideration fell into two categories: Where a transaction is set aside pursuant to liquidators’ powers under ss 292-296 of the Companies Act, and the supplier of goods and/or services is obliged to make a full repayment of monies to the liquidator. Where, in the exercise of the above powers, the liquidator enters into a compromise with a supplier and recovers less than a full repayment. Mr Montgomerie stated that there were conflicting opinions amongst liquidators as to how GST was to be returned on such reversed transactions, if at all. The Court acknowledged that there appeared to be no precedent directly on this point. Decision Referring to the Court of Appeal’s judgment in CIR v NZ Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187, Williams J held that GST is a tax on transactions and a nexus must be demonstrated between supply and consideration. Section 25(1)(b) applies where there has been an alteration to previously agreed consideration, therefore the focus is on the original supply, not the recovery. His Honour held that partial recovery amounted to an ‘alteration’ of the original consideration, but applying principles of statutory interpretation, the same could not be said of recovery in full. Regarding full recoveries, his Honour held that his finding was consistent with s 26 of the GST Act which requires the supplier to make a GST adjustment for a bad debt which has been written off. His Honour focused on the symmetry of tax treatment between the supplier and the Company. He also noted: “As against that, it needs to be acknowledged that an unfortunate inconsistency arises in the treatment of GST according as to whether voidable transaction recoveries are complete or partial. But that arises out of the way in which s 25(1)(b) is phrased and the necessity for a strict interpretation to be accorded to taxing statutes. When parliament enacted the voidable transaction recovery regime it did not appear to have turned its mind to the impact of that regime on the Goods and Services Tax Act 1986.” 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) WHETHER LATE PAYMENT CHARGE ON INSURANCE PREMIUMS IS INTEREST INCOME OR PREMIUM INCOME Case:Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd v CIR Decision date:12 August 1999 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Interest income or premium income Summary Justice Hammond found in favour of the Commissioner confirming that the extra charge was interest income and the Commissioner’s treatment was correct. Facts The taxpayer issued “bundled” life assurance policies. When the premiums on those policies were not paid on time a charge was made to the policy- holder in addition to the basic premiums. For the years 1987 to 1990, the Commissioner took the view that the extra charge was investment income as it was charged on a notional loan from the company to defaulting policyholders. The taxpayer argued it was premium income. This meant it would be treated differently under the then existing legislation, in a manner more favourable to the taxpayer. Decision Justice Hammond considered himself bound by an early Court of Appeal decision (Cmr of Taxes v The AMP Society (1902) 22 NZLR 445) on whether the extra charge is interest income or premium income. His Honour found there was no material difference in the law between 1902 and 1999 and he could not ignore the earlier decision. On that basis the extra charge was interest income. In an earlier decision involving CML this issue had been decided the same way (see CML v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,341 at 11,351). However, in dicta to the actual decision Hammond J doubted whether the 1902 decision was correct, preferring the dissent of Stout CJ in that case - there was in reality no loan made. But His Honour concluded that, for accounting purposes, the “positive” interest rate generates income CML would not have otherwise had and was thus taxable (regardless of the earlier case). He said: “...it \[the interest\] included something above what was required merely to “restore” CML, and its policy holders, to their rightful position. To put this another way, this interest would represent an increase in the amount over and above that owing by the insured, and would be “revenue” earned by the life office.” WHETHER OBJECTORS AN UNINCORPORATED BODY FOR THE PURPOSES OF GST REGISTRATION Case:TRA Number 97/87 Decision Number 017/99 Decision date:11 August 1999 Keywords:Unincorporated body of persons, liability to register for GST Facts A family trust was established on 19 August 1982. A farm was owned by a farmer (half share) and his two sisters (one quarter share each). In 1983 the two sisters sold their shares in the farm to the trustees of the farmer’s family trust. The farmer and the trustees carried on in partnership in the business of sheep and cattle farmers on the farm pursuant to a Deed of Partnership dated 4 July 1984. The farm was not partnership property under the terms of the partnership but was placed at the use of the partnership under a twenty-year term of the partnership. Profits were shared between the partners in relation to the value of the assets they placed at the use of the partnership. In 1985 the farmer entered into a matrimonial property agreement with his wife. He transferred to her half of his half share in the farm and half of his stake in the partnership. In 1986 the farming partnership was registered for GST and in 1995 the farmer and his wife replaced the trustees of the family trust. In September 1995 the farmer and his wife both sold their undivided quarter shares of the farm to their son (as tenants in common) and the trust also sold its undivided half share to the son. Settlement was effected as at 1 August 1995 on the basis of the purchaser taking over the liabilities of the vendors under mortgages on the land and an acknowledgement of debt for the balance of the price. 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) The objectors did not include the proceeds of the sale in the GST return for the period ending 30 September 1995, which they filed in their capacity as partners in the partnership. The farming partnership was dissolved as at 1 August 1995 and the son took over the farming business from that date. On 18 December 1995 Inland Revenue advised the objector’s agent that the objectors were considered to be an unincorporated body carrying on a taxable activity of land rental. Inland Revenue considered that that the placing of the farm at the use of the partnership from 1 August 1983 resulted in deemed registration so that the sale of the farm to the son in August 1995 was a taxable supply attracting GST of $233,750.00. The objectors objected to this assessment on the basis that they were not an unincorporated body. Decision Judge Barber held that in terms of Case P70 (1990) 14 NZTC 4,469, an unincorporated body existed in the present case as there was a degree of comity or association between the landowners which transcended the fact that they were the joint owners of that land. His Honour regarded the landowners association, with regard to the use of their farmland and to their ultimately deriving profit from it, as a type of joint venture or even a separate partnership from the farming partnership. The landowners were not passive with regard to their land ownership. They made the land available to the partnership on terms whereby they determined land use. Judge Barber concluded that the landowners should be registered in the present case and confirmed the Commissioner’s GST assessment. 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. TEMPORARY SHORTFALL – PERMANENT REVERSAL INV-231 The tax shortfall is actually a timing shortfall but Inland Revenue’s practice, prior to 1 May 1998, was not to allow the temporary shortfall reduction unless the return containing the reversal had been furnished prior to notification of audit or investigation. This situation could also arise in other tax types, for example, income tax, FBT or PAYE. Legislation A temporary shortfall is defined in section 141I of the Tax Administration Act 1994. If a taxpayer is considered liable for a shortfall penalty and the tax shortfall is a temporary shortfall, the penalty warranted will be reduced by 75%. Subsection (3) defines a temporary shortfall as follows: A tax shortfall is a temporary tax shortfall for a return period if the Commissioner is satisfied that- (a)The tax shortfall has been permanently reversed or corrected in an earlier or later return period, so that (disregarding penalties or interest) the taxpayer pays the correct amount of tax or calculates and returns the correct tax liability in respect of the item or matter that gave rise to the tax shortfall; and (b)No tax shortfall will arise in a later return period in respect of a similar item or matter; and (c)No arrangement exists in any return period which has the purpose or effect of creating a further related tax deferral or advantage; and (d)The tax shortfall was permanently reversed or corrected before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation. Practice applicable from 1 May 1998 The Commissioner’s new interpretation of a temporary shortfall The Commissioner considers that a tax shortfall has been permanently reversed or corrected if: it appears from the taxpayer’s actions that steps taken will remedy the tax shortfall, or through operation of law or circumstances, the matter will reverse itself. Summary This SPS replaces the Standard Practice Statement INV-230 which was issued in the Tax Information Bulletin, Volume Ten, No.5, May 1998. Standard Practice Statement INV-231 is effective from the date of publication. This Standard Practice Statement sets out the Commissioner’s position on permanent reversal as it applies to a temporary shortfall. The Commissioner will accept that a tax shortfall has been permanently reversed if: It appears from the taxpayer’s actions that steps taken will remedy the tax shortfall, or Through operation of law or circumstances, the matter will reverse tself. This statement does not apply to corrections, as the Commissioner cannot be satisfied that they will be corrected in a later period. Application Date This Standard Practice Statement applies to assessments of shortfall penalties issued on or after 1 May 1998. If you have been assessed with a shortfall penalty between 1 May 1998 and the date of this statement, please contact the Inland Revenue officer concerned and, if applicable, your assessment will be adjusted to reflect the 75% reduction to the shortfall penalty. Background Inland Revenue’s practice has been to restrict the temporary shortfall reduction to instances where Inland Revenue has received the return containing the correction or reversal before the taxpayer has been notified of a pending audit or investigation. An issue has arisen concerning the timing of GST input credits. Many of the resulting refunds claimed can be quite substantial and could be subject to GST checks before the release of the refunds. GST refund checks are undertaken very quickly after the returns are received which means that the taxpayers may not have had an opportunity to furnish a following return which would permanently reverse the overclaim made in a previous period. 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) To reverse a situation does not necessarily mean to achieve a complete remedy - it only means to take steps that will lead to the remedy in due course. For example, when a ship goes off course, one remedies it by turning it back towards the right heading. The mistake has been remedied when the turn is made but getting the ship back to the position it should be in takes some time to take effect. Using this rationale, when the taxpayer claims the entire GST input claim in the first GST return, the taxpayer has made the reversal because no claim for an input credit relating to the same property purchase will be made in a later return. This means the reversal will be treated as made when the full input claim is made in the earlier return. The same would apply to income tax or any other revenue. In these scenarios, the taxpayer would be entitled to a 75% reduction for a temporary shortfall. This is because the taxpayer has made the claim in the earlier return period so they cannot make the claim again in the later period. The case may not be so clear when gross income is not returned in a correct return period. For example, an auditor ascertains that a taxpayer should have returned a sale in the return being audited. In order to qualify for the temporary shortfall reduction, Inland Revenue would have to be satisfied that the sale would have been returned in a later return period. This will involve making enquiries of the taxpayer and checking the internal systems, bank statements, etc. If the sale is recorded in the system that the taxpayer normally prepares the tax return from, Inland Revenue could safely assume that the sale would have been returned in the next return period. In some situations consideration of the taxpayer’s systems may indicate that the sale would have been returned in an even later return period. In both of these cases, Inland Revenue would allow the temporary shortfall reduction of any shortfall penalty warranted. Arguably, a 5% penalty for a full year’s deferral of income tax is much lower than a 5% penalty for deferral of GST for one, two or six months. Inland Revenue considers that the reason for shortfall penalties should not be confused; shortfall penalties address culpability. Interest will be charged to taxpayers for paying tax late. When the adjustment is made to the return, interest will be charged from the time that the taxpayer should have paid the correct amount of tax. In summary, a taxpayer is not required to have furnished the return containing the reversal prior to notification of audit, but Inland Revenue must be satisfied that, the reversal would have been made in a following return. The extended interpretation of temporary shortfall will be available for all tax types including income tax. This interpretation of the word “reversed” applies only to the definition of temporary shortfall. Michael Rapson Manager, Technical Standards Examples GST Input tax claim A property developer enters into an unconditional sale and purchase agreement for the purchase of real property. The full purchase price of the property is $750,000 and the property developer pays a deposit of $75,000 on 5 April 1998. The balance of the purchase price is payable on 5 May 1998. The vendor of the property is not registered for GST, so the property developer is purchasing a secondhand good and is entitled to claim a GST input credit only on the amount actually paid. The property developer is registered for GST on an invoice basis and files GST returns every two months. In the GST return for the period ended 30 April 1998, the property developer claims an input credit of $83,333 which is 1/9 of the total purchase price of the property. The correct claim in that period is $8,333, so there is a tax shortfall of $75,000. As the matter relates to an issue of interpretation and is over the specified threshold, the developer must have an acceptable interpretation for the tax position taken. As the standard has been breached, they are liable to a shortfall penalty of 20% of the tax shortfall. The taxpayer is entitled to claim 1/9 of the payment that will be made on 5 May 1998 in the GST return for the period ended 30 June 1998. The taxpayer has already made the claim in the previous GST return, and was not intending to make the claim in the June GST return. Therefore, at the time of making the full claim in the April return, the taxpayer had permanently reversed the tax shortfall, as they never intended to make a double claim, even though, due to the speed of the audit, the May/June return had not been received. In this case, the 75% reduction for a temporary shortfall is available. GST output tax not returned As part of his taxable activity, a taxpayer entered into an unconditional agreement to sell real property. The GST return for the period ended 31 May 1998 was audited and it was noted that output tax with respect to the deposit only had been returned. 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) The taxpayer is queried and advises that he is going to return the balance of the sale in the next return as that is when he will receive the monies outstanding for the property. As the time of supply was triggered upon receipt of the deposit, a tax shortfall is ascertained for the balance of the property sale that was not returned. The taxpayer advises that he wasn’t sure whether he should return the entire sale and had intended making an inquiry but just didn’t get around to it. It is considered that a reasonable person in the taxpayer’s category of taxpayer, when unsure, would have obtained advice prior to preparing his GST return. Accordingly, the taxpayer is liable to a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care. The taxpayer prepares his returns from his bank statements; therefore, the internal system will pick up the receipt of the balance of the sale of the property. It is clear that the output would have been returned in next period. Therefore, the tax shortfall has been reversed even though the following return has not been received because of the speed of the audit. In this case, the 75% reduction to the shortfall penalty would be warranted. Correction A taxpayer prepares the GST return and claims a GST input credit for some overseas travel and personal expenses. An audit is undertaken and a tax shortfall is ascertained for the above mentioned claims. There is no guarantee that the incorrect input claims will be corrected in the following GST return. Therefore, if culpability were established, no reduction for a temporary shortfall is available. REMISSION OF PENALTIES AND INTEREST RDC 2.1 Introduction Legislation introduced in 1997 consolidated the rules for remissions of penalties and interest. The legislation applies to all taxes and duties, but not to student loan and child support repayments. The legislation was amended in 1998 to include remission of the non-electronic filing penalty. When considering these remission provisions the Commissioner considers it important to have in mind fair treatment for both the taxpayer requesting the remission as well as all other taxpayers. A lenient remission practice penalises complying taxpayers and may ultimately affect voluntary compliance. However, allowing an unfair penalty to stand will also impact on voluntary compliance. This standard practice statement sets out the relevant legislation, practical issues and the Commissioner’s practice. All legislative references in this statement are to the Tax Administration Act 1994, unless otherwise stated. Application date This Standard Practice Statement replaces Standard Practice Statement RDC 2 originally published in TIB Vol 9 No. 13 December 1997. This amended Standard Practice Statement applies to remission requests received on or after 6 September 1999. Summary 1.Penalties exist to provide fairness to the tax system. Interest compensates the taxpayer or the Commissioner for use of money over time. 2.Remission provisions are needed to allow the Commissioner to accommodate circumstances in which a penalty is not appropriate. The procedures Inland Revenue uses should ensure taxpayers have been justly treated, regardless of the outcome. Inland Revenue will weigh the particular circumstances that exist in each individual case against the standard practice. The circumstances of the taxpayer will be taken into account. 3.The legislation will be applied in a manner that is fair to compliant taxpayers. Inland Revenue recognises that penalising a compliant taxpayer for a small non- compliance is counterproductive and may actually reduce voluntary compliance. 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) 4.Application for remission must be made in writing. 5.Late filing penalty, non-electronic filing penalty, and late payment penalty will be remitted if the Commissioner is satisfied that the non-compliance has been caused by: an event or circumstance that provides reasonable justification for the omission genuine oversight and confusion or a one off situation incorrect advice given by Inland Revenue. 6.The only situation identified to date where interest will be remitted (in whole or in part) is where an Inland Revenue officer has given incorrect advice to the taxpayer which has directly caused a return or payment to be made late or a schedule to be filed non- electronically, and the taxpayer can substantiate to Inland Revenue’s satisfaction that they were given the incorrect advice. 7.Remission applications will be considered only when the return has been filed and/or the tax has been paid. 8.Sections 183A and 183D do not permit remission to be granted for financial reasons. Application for remission All applications must be made in writing. There are two main grounds for remission: Remission may occur if an event or circumstance provides the taxpayer with reasonable justification for not meeting their obligations. Remission may occur if it is consistent with the collection of highest net revenue over time. Interest remissions can only be considered under this ground. Shortfall penalties cannot be remitted under sections 183A and 183D. Remission for reasonable cause Legislation - Section 183A - Sub-section (1) has been replaced by a new sub-section (1) and (1A), that apply to penalties that arise on or after 1 April 1999. (1)This section applies to a late filing penalty, a non- electronic filing penalty, a late payment penalty and imputation penalty tax imposed by section 140B, and a dividend withholding payment penalty tax imposed by section 140C. (1A)The Commissioner may remit the penalty if the Commissioner is satisfied that - (a) A penalty to which this section applies arises as a result of an event or circumstance beyond the control of the taxpayer; and (b) As a consequence of that event or circumstance the taxpayer has reasonable justification or excuse for not furnishing the tax return or an employer monthly schedule, or not furnishing an employer monthly schedule in a prescribed electronic format, or not paying the tax on time; and (c) The taxpayer corrected the failure to comply as soon as practicable. (2)Without limiting the Commissioner’s discretion under subsection (1), an event or circumstance may include - (a) an accident or a disaster; or (b) illness or emotional or mental distress. (3)An event or circumstance does not include - (a) An act or omission of an agent of a taxpayer, unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the act or omission was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent - (i) That could not have been anticipated; and (ii) The effect of which could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct; or (b) A taxpayer’s financial position. Practical issues Remissions under this section apply to late filing penalty, non-electronic filing penalty, late payment penalty, imputation penalty, or any dividend withholding payment penalty tax. The request must be in writing and the taxpayer may be required to produce relevant information. Generally Inland Revenue will only request additional information when there is insufficient information available in the original application and further information is necessary to determine if the case meets the “reasonable cause” criteria. There is no right to dispute the Commissioner’s decision. 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) Standard Practice Remission will only occur if the taxpayer is able to provide reasonable justification for the late filing, non-electronic filing, or late payment. The term “reasonable” must be applied to the event or circumstance. This is an objective test, which requires that it be reasonable for a person in the taxpayer’s position not to have complied. Application of Practice In deciding whether remission is appropriate the Commissioner will consider: 1. Has the penalty been correctly charged? 2.Has the taxpayer paid the tax (or filed the return) in question? 3.Why did the taxpayer pay (or file) late, or not file electronically? 4.Was the non-compliance caused by an event or circumstance that was - • an accident or a disaster? • illness or emotional or mental distress? When considering the above-mentioned events or circumstances the Commissioner will use the following definitions: • accident - an event that is without apparent cause or is unexpected • disaster - sudden or great misfortune or a calamity • illness - state of being ill • emotional distress - disturbance of the mind, mental sensation or state • mental distress - of the mind, done by the mind, affected with mental disorder. 5.Has this reason been used before? Where appropriate, have measures been put in place by the taxpayer to ensure that this situation does not recur in the future? 6.Was the tax paid or return filed as soon as “practicable” (as soon as it can be done, and as soon as is feasible and realistic)? This will depend on each case, specifically was the default corrected as soon as possible after the event or circumstance passed? 7.Was the non-compliance an act or omission of the taxpayer’s agent? Did an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent cause it? Could the default have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct? 8.Any other information that the Commissioner considers relevant in assessing the application. Examples Emotional or Mental Distress (late filing penalty) Taxpayer’s return was due on 7 July. The return was near completion and the taxpayer’s previous compliance history was exemplary. However, leading up to the due date his daughter became seriously ill and was hospitalised. Her condition steadily deteriorated and the family spent a great deal of time at the hospital where she was in intensive care until the first week in September. During this time a reminder notice had been issued advising the taxpayer that a late filing penalty would be charged if his current year’s income tax return was not filed within 30 days. He ignored the notice but filed the overdue return in the middle of October, along with documentation verifying his daughter’s illness/hospitalisation, after the penalty had been charged. In these circumstances, the taxpayer filed the return three months after the due date, but given the “events and circumstances” this would be considered a “practicable” time frame. Circumstances Beyond the Taxpayer’s Control (non- electronic filing penalty) An employer is set up for, and has been sending, electronic monthly schedules for the last six months. A fire destroys the work premises on the date before it was planned to transmit the current month’s schedule. As a back-up to the computer system, the employer has a printed copy of the file stored off-site. The employer decides to copy these details onto a paper-based schedule so that the schedule and payment would reach Inland Revenue on time. Any non-electronic filing penalty would be remitted as the event was “beyond the control” of the taxpayer. Circumstance Beyond Agent’s Control (late payment penalty) An agent was entrusted to pay a client’s income tax by the due date of 7 February, as the taxpayer would be overseas at the due date. The cheque was made out for the correct amount, signed and post-dated. The cheque was given to the agent and placed in the office safe. The night before 7 February the office was burgled and the safe blown up - the safe’s contents were destroyed. The client’s agent produced supporting documentation. This is considered to be an event beyond the agent’s control. 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) Remission consistent with collection of highest net revenue over time Legislation - Section 183D - Sub-section (1) has been amended to include paragraph (aa); it applies to penalties that arise on or after 1 April 1999. (1)The Commissioner may remit - (a) A late filing penalty; and (aa) A non-electronic filing penalty; and (b) A late payment penalty; and (c) Interest under Part VII - payable by a taxpayer if the Commissioner is satisfied that the remission is consistent with the Commissioner’s duty to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law. (2)In the application of this section, the Commissioner must have regard to the importance of the late payment penalty, the late filing penalty and interest under Part VII in promoting compliance especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts. (3)The Commissioner must not consider a taxpayer’s financial position when applying this section. Practical issues Remissions under this section apply to late filing penalty, non-electronic filing penalty, late payment penalty, imputation penalty, dividend withholding payment penalty tax, and interest payable under Part VII. There is no requirement to remit all of the penalties and interest. Each case will be considered on its merits. The request must be in writing and the taxpayer may be required to produce relevant information. Generally Inland Revenue will only request additional information when there is insufficient information in the original application and further information is necessary to substantiate the assertions made by the taxpayer, to be able to make an informed decision. There is no right to dispute the Commissioner’s decision. Standard Practice The Commissioner is required by law to collect over time as much revenue as possible in a timely manner, but with underlying emphasis on voluntary compliance by all taxpayers. The Commissioner recognises that pursuing the collection of penalties in some circumstances will not meet his legal duty. Those circumstances are where a penalty is charged because of: a genuine error a “one-off” situation wrong advice given by an officer of Inland Revenue which has directly resulted in the non-compliance. The only situation identified to date where interest will be remitted is where an Inland Revenue officer has given incorrect advice to the taxpayer, and that advice has directly resulted in the non-compliance. Section 183D expressly prevents a taxpayer’s financial circumstances being taken into account. The hardship provisions deal with such situations. Remissions under section 183D apply to recent events. It was not intended that this section be used to remit penalties remaining from longstanding arrears when the taxpayer has financial difficulties and eventually can only pay the core tax or the core tax plus minimal penalties. These cases are dealt with under the hardship provisions. Application of Practice In deciding whether remission is appropriate the Commissioner will consider: 1.Has the penalty or interest been correctly charged? 2.Has the taxpayer paid the tax (or filed the return) in question? 3.Why did the taxpayer pay (or file) late, or not file electronically? 4.Was the non-compliance because of a genuine oversight or a one-off situation? Remitting a penalty for a “reliable” taxpayer who did not comply due to a genuine oversight or “one- off” situation recognises that penalising a compliant taxpayer for a small failure to comply is counter-productive and may actually reduce voluntary compliance. Requests for remission because of a genuine oversight or a one-off situation apply to penalties only. The Commissioner will not remit interest in these cases as interest is compensation to the Revenue for use of the money over time. Interest charged because of a default by a third party does not fall into this category. In this situation the Commissioner considers the taxpayer should look to the third party for compensation. 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) 5.Has Inland Revenue given incorrect advice to the taxpayer, which has resulted in the non- compliance? If an officer of Inland Revenue has given the wrong advice, the imposition of the penalty may adversely affect future compliance by the taxpayer or other taxpayers. This is due to the adverse impact that imposing a penalty would have on a taxpayer’s perceptions of the integrity of the system eg where the taxpayer has been given the incorrect date, or amount, for payment and can substantiate to Inland Revenue’s satisfaction that they were given the incorrect advice. The tax must be paid in full as soon as the error is established. Section 183D is the only provision under which interest can be remitted. Interest will be remitted if Inland Revenue has given a taxpayer incorrect advice which caused a return or payment to be made late and the taxpayer can substantiate to Inland Revenue’s satisfaction that they were given the incorrect advice. Under this section, an interest remission will be made in whole or in part. The tax must be paid as soon as the error is established. Has Inland Revenue contributed to the problem with excessive delay (such as computer processing problems)? If interest has been accruing on an account that would have been cleared, but for problems caused by computer processing, and the taxpayer has made a conscious effort to pay interest that they calculated as accruing, and the calculation was incorrect, then Inland Revenue may consider an interest remission in part. The tax must be paid as soon as the delay is resolved. 6.Any other information that the Commissioner considers relevant in assessing the application. Examples One-off situation (late filing penalty and late payment penalty) An employer has a computer payroll package set up to prepare the employer monthly schedule for ir- filing. A serious virus is detected on the 4th August when the schedule is due for transmission on the 5th. The software developer is called but the problem is not fixed until the 7th when the schedule was prepared and transmitted. On the same day the remittance slip and payment were also sent. The late filing and late payment penalties would be remitted, as this would be a situation beyond the taxpayer’s control. Genuine Oversight (late payment penalty) A new office person had been hired by an employer as a wages clerk. The new person’s duties included preparing the wages, maintaining the wage records and preparing the employer monthly schedules and remittances. The new person arrived in early March and found the wage records in a terrible mess. The person completed and balanced the employer monthly schedule and forwarded it to Inland Revenue by 20 April, and had intended to enclose the monthly remittance for March in the same envelope. Unfortunately the remittance and the cheque were caught up in some papers and were not discovered until 24th April. The remittance and cheque were promptly delivered to the nearest Inland Revenue office with supporting documentation and an accompanying letter requesting remission. Remission of the late payment penalty would be granted under section 183D as a genuine oversight. Incorrect advice (late payment penalty) A small business person registered for GST and was a six-monthly payer. However as business improved the person elected to file GST returns two-monthly. The person sought the advice from the nearest Inland Revenue office but unfortunately confusion arose over the date the next return was due to be filed, resulting in the imposition of a late payment penalty. Remission of the late payment penalty would be granted under section 183D due to incorrect information being given by Inland Revenue. Incorrect Advice (interest) A taxpayer is advised of an incorrect date for PAYE and incurs a late payment penalty and interest. As the late payment penalty and interest were caused by Inland Revenue error; both the late payment penalty and interest would be remitted. However the taxpayer would be expected to provide evidence to support the contention that the incorrect information was given by Inland Revenue. 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) Incorrect Advice (partial remission of interest) A taxpayer rang Inland Revenue to find out what interest was accruing on their 1998 income tax account, as they had just received a Statement of Account showing some interest payable, but the due date for the actual income tax was shown as due 7 February 1999. They were advised that interest was not accruing so the taxpayer didn’t make payment immediately. Subsequently the taxpayer was charged further interest. Remission was applied for on the grounds that they would have paid immediately had they known of the ongoing liability. Remission of interest was granted in part - the interest that had accrued until the time the taxpayer telephoned Inland Revenue was still payable by the taxpayer. However the taxpayer would be expected to provide evidence to support the contention that the incorrect information was given by Inland Revenue. Automatic cancellation/remission There are two provisions for automatic cancellation of penalties and remission of interest: 1.Section 183B - Cancellation of late payment penalties under instalment arrangement. Broadly, if a taxpayer meets all obligations under an instalment arrangement all incremental penalties incurred after the date that the instalment arrangement is entered into are cancelled at the successful completion of the instalment arrangement. 2.Section 183E - Remission of interest if unpaid tax remitted. Where the underlying tax is remitted the interest is also remitted. The Commissioner will also reverse interest when a retrospective change to legislation caused the position taken by a taxpayer to become incorrect after it was taken. In this situation a new due date for payment would be made, and the interest would be cancelled. Difference between remission, cancellation and reversal Remission: occurs when the tax, penalty or interest is correctly charged at the time but a decision has been made to relieve the taxpayer of the liability to pay. Cancellation: occurs when the tax, penalty or interest was correctly charged at the time but a provision of the legislation relieves the taxpayer from the obligation to pay, such as the successful completion of an instalment arrangement. Reversal: the tax, penalty or interest should not have been charged in the first place. This Standard Practice Statement was signed by me on 31st August 1999. Michael Rapson Manager, Technical Standards 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) QUESTIONS WE’VE BEEN ASKED This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. BANKRUPT’S ABILITY TO CARRY FORWARD ACCUMULATED LOSSES Section IE 1, Income Tax Act 1994 – Net losses may be offset against future net income We have been asked whether a taxpayer is entitled to carry forward pre-bankruptcy losses where the loss arises from the taxpayer paying the debts owing (as opposed to the debts being remitted). Tax Information Bulletin Volume Nine, No. 9 (September 1997), at page 20, included an item under the heading “Losses released on discharge from bankruptcy - inability to carried forward”. The item concerned an enquiry on the ability of a bankrupt to carry forward income tax losses that had arisen as a result of debts incurred in a previous year. The bankrupt was released from payment of these debts during the bankruptcy process, and as a result had not made any payment towards the debts that made up the losses. She was not entitled to carry the losses forward to offset against post bankruptcy income, as she had been released from the obligation to pay the debts. Because she had made no payment of the debts, the amount of the debts could not be taken into account in calculating the losses available to carry forward. This item considers the situation where the bankrupt has paid the debts. A taxpayer was made bankrupt as a result of a farming business affected by severe flooding. Up to the time of the floods, the farming business had operated reasonably successfully and all business debts to the end of the previous income year had been paid in full. However, due to large depreciation claims, accumulated income tax losses were available to be carried forward at the time the farmer was adjudged bankrupt. At a meeting of creditors it was agreed that the Official Assignee (the “Assignee”) would continue to operate the business, as there was every prospect of the farm trading successfully once it had recovered from the floods. The farmer obtained work in a nearby town and derived salary and wages for the period of the bankruptcy. The farmer has asked about his income tax obligations and whether he is entitled to carry forward the pre-bankruptcy accumulated losses. In the situation described above, where the Assignee is carrying on the former business of the bankrupt, there are two “taxpayers”: The bankrupt, and The Assignee, as trustee for the benefit of the creditors, deriving income from the farming business. The income tax responsibilities of each follow. The bankrupt The bankrupt will be required to file two income tax returns for the year in which he was adjudged bankrupt. Under section 44(1)(f) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the first return will cover the period from the beginning of the income year to the date the farmer was adjudged bankrupt. This return is an “interim” return that enables Inland Revenue to lodge a proof of debt with the Assignee for any tax owing at the date of adjudication. From the income derived during this period, the farmer is entitled to deduct the pre-bankruptcy losses against any farming profit earned during the period to date of bankruptcy and other income (such as salary and wages) derived during that period. See Subpart IE of the Income Tax Act 1994 (the ITA). If there is an overpayment of income tax resulting from credits of PAYE tax deductions or provisional tax paid, the refund will pass to the Assignee. At the end of the income year in which the farmer is adjudged bankrupt, he must file a return of income for the full income year. 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) This second return will include any income or (loss) already declared in the earlier return of income to the date of bankruptcy, but not any income or loss resulting from the farming business now carried on by the Assignee. Any adjustments necessary to take account of PAYE credits already refunded to the Assignee as a result of the “interim” return of income will be made when the tax assessment for the full year is made. Under subpart IE of the ITA, the farmer will be able to offset against that full year’s income the accumulated pre-bankruptcy losses to the extent of the income derived. Any remaining losses can be carried forward to future years. Any of the pre-bankruptcy losses remaining after the bankruptcy is discharged can be used by the farmer to offset against future income derived. The Official Assignee as trustee Under section 42 of the Insolvency Act 1967, when a person is adjudged bankrupt all property of the bankrupt vests in the Assignee. This property includes the farm business assets, but not the accumulated losses as these are not “property” as envisaged by that Act. The Assignee carries on the farming business as trustee for the creditors. As trustee, the Assignee is a new taxpayer and will be liable to income tax on any gross income derived from the business. As section IE 1(1)(a) of the ITA only permits losses to be carried forward by “the taxpayer”, the Assignee, as another taxpayer, cannot utilise the farmer’s pre-bankruptcy losses against any income derived as trustee of the farming business. Under section HH 4 of the ITA the Assignee, as trustee, is required to furnish income tax returns for each income year, or part thereof, during the bankruptcy period while carrying on the former business of the bankrupt. Income tax is payable on any trustee income derived during the period. Any losses incurred by the trustee can be carried forward from year to year to offset against subsequent trustee income. However, any accumulated “trustee losses” remaining at the end of the bankruptcy period are not available to the farmer to offset against his post- bankruptcy income. 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No 8 (September 1999) General information Binding rulings (IR 115G) - Mar 1998: Explains binding rulings, which commit Inland Revenue to a particular interpretation of the tax law once given.

This is particularly useful when there are subsequent updates to an article you’re reading, because we’ll retrospectively add links to the earlier article. • Individual TIB articles will print satisfactorily, but this is not the better format if you want to print out a whole TIB. • All TIBs from January 1997 onwards (Volume Nine, No.1) are available in this format. Online TIB articles appear on our website as soon as they’re finalised – even before the whole TIB for the month is finalised at mid-month. This means you can read the first of any month’s TIB articles on our website in the last two weeks of the previous month. Printable TIB (PDF format) • This is the better format if you want to print out the whole TIB to use as a paper copy – the printout looks the same as this paper version. • You’ll need Adobe’s Acrobat Reader to use this format – available free from their website at http://www.adobe.com • Double-column layout means this version is better as a printed copy – not as easy to read on-screen. • All TIBs from July 1989 (the start of the TIB) are available in this format. The printable TIB appears on our website at mid-month, at the same time as we send the paper copy to the printers. This means you can get a printable TIB from our website about two weeks before we can post you a paper copy.

It confirms the income tax rates for 1999- 2000 and introduces several revenue protection and remedial measures. Key features of the new legislation relate to GST on “exported” services that are supplied and consumed in New Zealand, and the deductibility of film-related expenditure for tax purposes. The latter was included in the bill after introduction, as were several new remedial amendments. Enactment of the legislation has resulted in amendments primarily to the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. When enacted the legislation was divided into two Acts: Taxation (Remedial Matters) Act\[No.98\] Taxation (Annual Rates of Income Tax 1999-2000) Act\[No.99\] The new legislation is described in detail in this Tax Information Bulletin. POLICY ISSUES DEDUCTIBILITY OF FILM- RELATED EXPENDITURE Sections EO 4A, GD 12, OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction Section EO 4A has been amended to ensure that all film-related expenditure is under that section potentially subject to the claw back of deductions for expenditure to the extent that the expenditure is effectively reimbursed to the investor. Section EO 4A has also been amended to treat loss attributing qualifying companies and their shareholders as associated persons. Background Section EO 4A was enacted earlier this year by the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 to counter certain arrangements entered into by investors involving expenditure on films. Section EO 4A, as originally enacted, applied to expenditure that was deductible under the film expenditure rules in sections EO 3 and EO 4 and clawed back deductions to the extent that the expenditure was effectively reimbursed to the investor (usually through the sale of shares in a related company). After the enactment of section EO 4A the Government became aware of a tax-driven arrangement involving a film that circumvented this provision. The arrangement involved the effective reimbursement of film-related expenditure and was intended to provide tax benefits to high income individuals through their investment in partnerships in loss attributing qualifying companies. Section EO 4A, as originally enacted, did not apply to the arrangement, primarily because it involved expenditure that did not come within the film expenditure rules in sections EO 3 and EO 4. The Government was concerned that other arrangements involving effective reimbursement of film-related expenditure could use this method to circumvent section EO 4A. Key features Section EO 4A has been amended to ensure that it can potentially apply to all film-related expenditure whether or not that expenditure comes within the film expenditure rules in sections EO 3 and EO 4. The amendment brings within section EO 4A expenditure relating to a film but which was not previously subject to the section. This is achieved by section EO 4A stating that it applies to expenditure that would otherwise be deductible under the Act if the expenditure is for a right in, or in relation to, a film. For this purpose “right” is defined to mean a right to an amount that is dependent on or calculated by reference to income from the sale, use, rental or other exploitation of a film. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 4 Section EO 4A has also been amended to provide that for the purpose of that section loss attributing qualifying companies and their shareholders are treated as associated persons. The amendments include a savings provision which provides that section EO 4A does not apply to a person who has incurred substantial expenditure on a New Zealand film before 7 July 1999 if certain tests of commerciality and certain notification requirements are met. More specifically, the savings provision provides that section EO 4A does not apply to a person who has entered into an arrangement for the financing of a film on or before 30 June 2001 if: at least $1,000,000 of expenditure has been incurred before 7 July 1999 under contracts for the supply of goods or services in New Zealand in relation to the film; and the film has not been completed before 7 July 1999; and any person who has entered into such a contract has notified the Commissioner of Inland Revenue before 1 November 1999 that these requirements in relation to the film have been satisfied. (Notices should be addressed to National Manager, Corporates, Inland Revenue Department, P O Box 2198, Wellington.) In addition, the following requirements need to be satisfied before the savings provision applies: the film is a New Zealand film or a provisional certificate has been issued for the film by the Film Commission; and the recipient of any payments for intangible rights is subject to New Zealand tax on those payments or is a resident in a grey list country (that is, a country or territory specified in Schedule 3, Part A of the Income Tax Act 1994); and total expenditure on the film does not exceed 140% of the physical production cost of the film; and the investor has an expectation of profit based on reasonable commercial assumptions. Section GD 12, an anti-avoidance provision applying to non-arm’s length transactions involving films, has been amended in a similar manner to section EO 4A to ensure that it can potentially apply to all film- related production expenditure. Application date The amendments apply on and after 7 July 1999. DIVIDENDS FROM SHARES HELD ON REVENUE ACCOUNT Section FC 3(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The coverage of section FC 3 has been widened to include: all revenue account shareholders; and associated companies of the shareholder. These changes have been made for base maintenance reasons. Background Section FC 3 can apply when a company owns shares that it intends to sell. The section is designed to ensure that the exempt dividend provisions cannot be used to avoid the tax that should be paid on disposal of the shares. This can be illustrated as follows: Scenario 1 Parent Co buys all the shares in Target Co for $100 with the intention of selling them. Those shares are eventually sold for $110; the $10 gain would be taxable. Scenario 2 Again, Parent Co buys all the shares in Target Co for $100 with the intention of selling them. But this time Parent Co causes Target Co to pay it a dividend of $30 and Target Co is then sold for $80. In the absence of section FC 3, Parent Co would have derived an exempt dividend of $30 (by virtue of the section CB 10 intercorporate dividend exemption) and suffered, for tax purposes, a tax loss of $20 on the transaction. This is notwithstanding the fact that the same net gain of $10 is made as in scenario 1. Section FC 3 provides that the $30 dividend is income from the ‘sale’ of the shares - thus ensuring the net gain of $10 is taxable. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 5 a wholly-owned group of companies to be treated as a single company for tax purposes. The rules simplify the tax calculations for corporate groups and allow them to improve their efficiency by rationalising large and complex structures. Conduit tax reform was enacted in March 1998. Before the reform, New Zealand’s controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund rules had the unintended effect of taxing income derived on behalf of non-residents from outside New Zealand, at 33% on an accrual basis. Conduit reform effectively switched off the New Zealand tax on this income. In doing this, a significant disincentive to conduit investment was removed. New Zealand does, however, continue to impose non-resident withholding tax of 15% on any distributions of conduit income to non-residents. When conduit reform was enacted, it was not considered that there would be sufficient affected companies to justify introducing the extensive additional rules necessary if consolidated groups were to be fully integrated into the reform. This turned out not to be the case, so amendments have been made to integrate consolidated groups into the conduit rules. To effect the integration of consolidated groups into the conduit rules, new sections MI 14 to MI 22 have been enacted, and consequential amendments made to sections ME 12, MG 14, MI 5 and OB 1 (definition of “conduit tax relief account company”). These amendments are broadly patterned on the existing rules for consolidated group dividend withholding payment accounts. Amendments have also been made to address a number of other conduit remedial issues: An amendment to section FH 5 corrects a cross-reference error. Amendments to sections FH 7 and KH 1(2) address deficiencies in the formulae for determining respectively the amount of excessive interest expense allocated to New Zealand companies and the amount of conduit relief. If a company is able to offset branch equivalent tax account debits from another group member, the previous formulae inappropriately took that offset into account a number of times, even though it can be credited Other aspects of section FC 3 are: The section applies only to dividends that are paid out of pre-acquisition reserves because these represent a return of part of the purchase price. In contrast, dividends paid out of post-acquisition reserves are a return on the amount invested. The shares do not need to be sold for an adjustment to be made. To ensure that there is no double taxation, the intention is that the adjustment is reduced by any of the dividend amounts that are taxable. The changes A taxpayer may hold shares, the proceeds of which are gross income when disposed of, even if that shareholder does not engage in the business of dealing in shares or has not acquired the shares for the purpose of selling them. The shareholder may, for example, be a “controlled petroleum mining entity” and would still be holding the shares as revenue property. The changes to FC 3(1) make it clear that all revenue account situations are potentially covered. The changes also extend to dividends paid to persons associated with the shareholder (through a new section CF 2(13A)). Application date The changes apply on and after 21 May 1999. Possible further changes As pointed out by submissions, further work on section FC 3 seems appropriate to simplify and clarify its wording. CONDUIT TAXATION Sections FH 5, FH 7, FH 8(5), KH 1, KH 2, ME 12, MG 8(5), MG 14, MI 2, MI 5, MI 14 - MI 22, NH 7 and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994; sections 29 and 30A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction Extensive amendments have been made to integrate consolidated groups into the conduit tax rules. A number of remedial amendments have also been made, to address other deficiencies identified in the rules. Background The consolidated group rules, enacted in 1992, allow IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 6 against an income tax liability only once. An amendment to section FH 8(5) ensures that an inadequate debit does not arise to a conduit tax relief account if excessive interest expense allocated to New Zealand is applied against a company’s dividend withholding payment liability. When excessive interest is applied to a company’s dividend withholding payment liability, some conduit relief previously given to the company is clawed back. The company’s conduit tax relief account is debited to reflect this claw-back, but the previous rules did not debit a sufficient amount in some circumstances. Amendments to sections KH 1(1), NH 7(1) and OB 1 (definition of “conduit tax relief account company”) ensure that when a company has ceased to be a conduit tax relief company, it will not be entitled to conduit relief on subsequent income tax and dividend withholding payment liabilities. Amendments to sections KH 2(2) and NH 7(3) allow a listed company to use any commercially justifiable date on which it determines its non-resident shareholders as a measurement date. New sections KH 2(2A) and NH 7(3A) are compliance cost saving measures, which require 100% subsidiaries of listed companies to use the measurement date determined for their listed parent. An amendment to section MG 8(5) ensures that an allocation deficit debit does not arise for life insurance companies that have elected to use the conduit rules. These companies are prohibited by section MG 7(1) from transferring credits from their imputation credit account to their policyholder credit account, so any transfer from their dividend withholding payment account to their policyholder credit account would under the previous rules have triggered an inappropriate allocation deficit debit. An amendment to section MI 2(4) effects the policy intent that companies electing into the conduit rules would continue to be subject to the rules in subsequent years, without having to make a subsequent election. New subsections (5A) and (6A) clarify the effective date for the revocation of an election, and tie in with the amendments being made to sections KH 1(1) and NH 7(1). An amendment to section MI 5(2)(b) ensures that the descriptive term used for an entry in a conduit tax relief account is consistent with its description in subsection (1). New section NH 7(2)(c) ensures that a newly incorporated company is not inadvertently denied conduit relief on foreign-sourced dividends derived in its first two years of operation. Amendments to section 29 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 correct terminology and insert a cross-reference to section 30A. An amendment to section 30A removes the need to include the amount of conduit tax relief credit on shareholder dividend statements. The amendments to the conduit rules have retrospective effect to commencement of the conduit rules (the 1998-99 income year, 1998-99 imputation year, or dividends paid on or after 1 April 1998). Because the rules have only been in place for one year, it was considered cleaner to give the amendments retrospective effect than to address transitional effects that might otherwise arise. Retrospective application is also expected to favour taxpayers, as the amendments correct anomalies that are generally disadvantageous to them. For consolidated groups in particular, retrospective application will ensure there is no confusion about how the conduit rules might otherwise apply to the group for the 1998-99 year. Key features New sections MI 14 to MI 22 have been enacted, enabling a consolidated group to maintain a conduit tax relief account. Consequential amendments have been made, to ensure the new rules interface correctly with other provisions in the Act affecting conduit taxation. Amendments have also been made to address a number of remedial issues identified in a review of the conduit rules. Application date The amendments apply retrospectively from the 1998-99 income year, the year from which the conduit tax rules first applied. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 7 NEW ZEALAND RASPBERRY MARKETING COUNCIL Section GE 1 Income Tax Act 1994, and section 75D Estate and Gift Duty Act 1968. Introduction The New Zealand Raspberry Marketing Council, its committees and the Raspberry Marketing Export authority are to be wound up. The process for their winding up is contained in the Raspberry Marketing Authorities (Dissolution) Regulations 1999. The amendments to the Income Tax Act and the Estate and Gift Duties Act give certainty to the tax consequences flowing out of this winding up process. Background The New Zealand Raspberry Marketing Council, the Raspberry Marketing Export Authority and the four district marketing committees are each to be wound up as part of the Government’s producer board reform. The process for winding up these entities is contained in the Raspberry Marketing Authorities (Dissolution) Regulations 1999. The Raspberry Marketing Regulations 1979 are to be revoked. Key features There will be no income tax or gift duty consequences to the New Zealand Raspberry Marketing Council and its committees, and to the shareholders of the council and committees as a result of the introduction of the regulations providing for the dissolution process. The regulations are intended to confirm the shareholders’ entitlement to the assets of the council and committees on dissolution so there should be no tax cost. There will be no income tax or gift duty consequences to the Nelson Raspberry Marketing Committee and its members as a result of the vesting of Cold Storage Nelson Limited shares by the Nelson Raspberry Marketing Committee in a new company, Rubus Investments Nelson Ltd. The subsequent distribution of the new company’s shares to Nelson Raspberry Marketing Committee members will be treated for tax purposes as a distribution of those shares by the Nelson Raspberry Marketing Committee to its shareholders on winding up. This will clarify the current law on distributions by the producer board on wind up. The distribution to shareholders of the Raspberry Marketing Council and the four committees on their winding up will be treated for income tax purposes as a distribution by a company to its shareholders on winding up. Application date The amendments apply from the date the Raspberry Marketing Regulations 1999 were made, 12 July 1999. QUALIFYING COMPANY ELECTION TAX ON AMALGAMATIONS Section HG 11(1A), (1B) and (3A), Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction Qualifying company election tax (QCET) is now payable if a non-qualifying company amalgamates with a qualifying company and the qualifying company is the company which continues in existence after the amalgamation. Also, net losses of the non- qualifying company cannot be carried forward to the amalgamated company. Background A non-qualifying company that becomes a qualifying company is required to pay QCET on its retained earnings. The company can then distribute the retained earnings tax-free. Previously, if a non-qualifying company amalgamated with a qualifying company, with the non-qualifying company going out of existence and the qualifying company continuing as the amalgamated company, no QCET was payable on the non-qualifying company’s retained earnings, but the amalgamated company was then able to distribute the retained earnings tax-free. The result was that the retained earnings of a non-qualifying company could be distributed without any tax being paid at all. The amalgamated company was also entitled to the benefit of any net losses of the non- qualifying company. This result was never intended and was a deficiency in the law. The amendment ensures that retained earnings of a company cannot be distributed without appropriate tax being paid and that net losses of the non-qualifying company cannot be carried forward. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 8 Key features New subsections (1A) and (1B) have been inserted in section HG 11 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Subsection (1A) imposes QCET if a non-qualifying company amalgamates with a qualifying company and the qualifying company is the company which continues in existence after the amalgamation, and subsection (1B) directs how the QCET is to be calculated. The obligation to pay is placed on the amalgamated company. A new subsection (3A) also ensures that net losses of the non-qualifying company cannot be carried forward to the amalgamated company. Application date The amendment applies on and after 21 May 1999. CHARITABLE TRUSTS (Section KC 5(1)of the Income Tax Act 1994) The Karunai Illam Trust has been granted charitable donee status from the 2000-01 income year. Donations made to the Trust will entitled individual taxpayers to a rebate of 33 1/3 percent of the amount donated. The maximum rebate for all donations is $500 per annum. A company (other than a closely held company) will be entitled to a deduction from its net income up to the amount prescribed by section DJ 4. CONSOLIDATED GROUP DIVIDEND WITHHOLDING PAYMENT ACCOUNT Section MG 16A of the Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The amendment ensures that the anti-avoidance rules for inappropriate dividend withholding payment credit allocations also applies to consolidated groups. Background When a company has a debit balance in its dividend withholding payment account at the end of an imputation year (meaning it has credited its shareholders with more dividend withholding payment credits than it has paid), a 10% penalty arises on that debit balance. The same principle should apply to a debit balance in a consolidated group’s dividend withholding payment account. Previously, however, there was no provision in the Act to impose a penalty on a debit balance in a consolidated group’s dividend withholding payment account. An amendment has been made, therefore, to ensure consolidated groups are sanctioned if they have a debit balance in their dividend withholding payment account at the end of an imputation year. Key features New section MG 16A contains operative provisions to apply the anti-avoidance rules for inappropriate dividend withholding payment credit allocations to consolidated groups. Application date The amendment applies to the 1999-2000 and subsequent imputation years. JOINT BANK ACCOUNTS BETWEEN RESIDENTS AND NON-RESIDENTS Sections NG 2(1) and NG 10(1A) of the Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction An amendment removes doubt over whether a party paying interest on an account held jointly by residents and non-residents should deduct resident withholding tax or non-resident withholding tax. Background When interest income is derived jointly by residents and non-residents, the payer is often not readily able to identify the respective beneficial entitlement of each recipient. This can create compliance difficulties for payers seeking to determine the correct amount of tax to withhold. It also creates administrative difficulties, as residents that have been subjected to the lower non-resident withholding rate have no incentive to advise Inland Revenue and account for the under-deducted tax. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 9 An amendment has been made to remove doubt over the withholding rate that should apply. Its effect is as follows: New section NG 2(1)(ab) has the effect of imposing non-resident withholding tax on interest derived jointly by residents and non- residents at the rate of resident withholding tax. However, if the payer is not required to deduct resident withholding tax, they are not relieved from the obligation to deduct non- resident withholding tax from the interest attributable to the non-resident. Treaty relief is still available, but only on application to Inland Revenue for a refund of over-deducted tax. The existing provision of treaty relief at source has been removed for affected joint accounts, through new section NG 10(1A). Relief will not be available other than under a treaty. Subject to treaty relief, NRWT deducted under the new rules will remain a final tax on the non-resident, even though the rate of tax will be higher than what it is at present. In most cases, the amendment will lead to an over- deduction of tax on that portion of interest to which a non-resident is beneficially entitled. This is the intended effect of the amendment - it ensures that residents cannot have withholding tax under-deducted on their interest income by being treated as non- residents. If non-residents are unhappy with this treatment, they are entitled to operate their investments separately from resident persons, in which case the normal withholding rates will apply. Key features Section NG 2(1)(ab) introduces a new rate of withholding tax for interest derived jointly by resident and non-resident persons. New section NG 10(1A) precludes the treaty withholding rate on interest from being applied at source to interest derived jointly by resident and non- resident persons. Application date The amendment applies to interest paid from 8 September 1999. AVAILABLE SUBSCRIBED CAPITAL Section 0B 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The definition of “available subscribed capital” has been amended to correct a deficiency in the definition. The deficiency allowed the tax free conversion into available subscribed capital of reserves that are normally taxable on their distribution to shareholders. Background Available subscribed capital is the amount that a company can distribute to its shareholders tax-free in a repurchase of the company’s shares (if certain “bright line” tests have been met) or on its winding up. The concept of available subscribed capital is similar to the traditional company law concept of “paid up capital”. It is contrary to policy to allow reserves that are normally taxable when distributed to shareholders to become available subscribed capital without a tax cost. Key features The amendment to section OB 1 is designed to ensure that companies cannot make tax-free conversions into available subscribed capital reserves that would ordinarily be taxable when distributed to shareholders. Available subscribed capital will exclude consideration received by a company for the issue of its shares if that consideration is in the form of giving up or varying existing ownership rights or interests in the company. If available subscribed capital for those rights already exists it will be preserved. Application date This amendment applies from 20 May 1999. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 10 CROWN ENTITIES AND THE ASSOCIATED PERSONS TESTS Sections OD 3(3), OD 4(3), OD 7 and OD 8 of the Income Tax Act 1994; sections 67, 214E and 245B of the Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction Crown entities adhere to the commercial practice of treating each other on an arm’s length basis. However, the tax laws do not fully preclude the associated persons tests from applying to certain Crown entities. The amendments ensure that these associated persons tests do not inappropriately apply to the following special corporate entities that are owned by the Crown: state-owned enterprises, crown research institutes, hospitals and health services and crown health enterprises. Subsidiaries of these special corporate entities are also dealt with. Background The Income Tax Act 1994 contain several tests for determining whether parties to a transaction are associated persons. The concept of associated persons is intended to combat tax avoidance or tax minimisation in specific situations. It targets parties who are not necessarily dealing on an arm’s length basis. Several tests measure “association” under the various associated persons rules in sections OD 7 and OD 8. The voting interest and market value interest tests cannot cause special corporate entities owned by the Crown to be associated with each other. However, the “income interest” test and arguably the “control by any other means whatsoever” test could cause these entities to be incorrectly regarded as “associated”. The amendments ensure that the associated persons test are properly targeted insofar as they affect special corporate entities owned by Crown and subsidiaries of such special corporate entities. This confirms the Government’s policy of competitive neutrality between Crown entities. Key features Sections OD 7 and OD 8 define the associated persons tests. Amendments to these sections ensure that special corporate entities owned by the Crown and companies that form a group of companies with such special corporate entities are exempt from the ambit of the sections. In the 1976 Act, sections 67, 214E and 245B are amended so that associated persons tests do not apply to special corporate entities owned by the Crown and companies that form a group of companies with such special corporate entities. Application date The amendments to the Income Tax Act 1994 will have application back to the 1995-96 income year. The amendments to the Income Tax Act 1976 will have application back to 1 July 1994. The amendments do not apply where a different position has been taken in a tax return that has been filed before the bill was introduced (20 May 1999). NOTIONAL SINGLE PERSONS SHAREHOLDER AND GROUP COMPANIES Sections OD 3(3) and OD 4(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994; sections 8C and 8D of the Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction The legislation has been clarified to ensure that voting and market value interests in the subsidiaries of a special corporate entity are attributed to the ‘notional single person’ shareholder. Background Sections OD 3(3)(a) and OD 4(3)(a) provide that all voting and market value interests in a special corporate entity are held by a notional single person shareholder. Previously, the notional single person was deemed to hold such interests in the special corporate entity and no interests in any other company. Sections OD 3(3)(d) and OD 4(3)(d) contain the corporate ‘look through’ rule. Subsidiaries of a company are required to ‘look through’ its parent company for the purposes of tracing its shareholders. The shareholders of the parent company are deemed to be the shareholders of the subsidiaries. However, the subsidiaries of special corporate entities had to trace to the actual shareholders and were precluded from undertaking shareholder tracing to the notional single person created under OD 3(3)(a) and OD 4(3)(a). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 11 Sections OD 3(3)(a) and OD 4(3)(a) have now been amended to allow the application of the shareholder tracing rule under OD 3(3)(d) and OD 4(3)(d) to the subsidiaries of special corporate entities. Key features The notional single person shareholder is now deemed to own voting and market value interests of a special corporate entity as well as all interests that arise under sections OD 3(3)(d) and OD 4(3)(d). These amendments allow subsidiaries of special corporate entities to undertake shareholder tracing to the notional single person shareholder. Similar amendments have been made to sections 8C(3)(a)(ii) and 8D(3)(a)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 1976 to ensure that the notional single person shareholder of special corporate entities are also deemed to hold interests in the subsidiaries of such special corporate entity. Application date The amendments to the Income Tax Act 1994 will apply from to the 1995-96 income year, when the Act came into effect. The amendments to the Income Tax Act 1976 will apply from the 1992-93 income year. Confirmation of Annual Income Tax Rates for 1999-2000 The income tax rates for the 1999-00 income year have been confirmed as follows: Policyholder income33 cents for every $1 of schedular taxable income Maori authorities25 cents for every $1 of taxable income Undistributed rents, royalties and interest of the Maori Trustee25 cents for every $1 of taxable income Companies33 cents for every $1 of taxable income Trustee income (including that of trustees of superannuation funds)33 cents for every $1 of taxable income Trustees of group investment funds33 cents for every $1 of schedular taxable in respect of category A income Taxable distributions from non-qualifying trusts45 cents for every $1 of taxable distribution Other taxpayers (including individuals) Income not exceeding $38,00019.5 cents for every $1 of taxable income Income exceeding $38,00033 cents for every $1 of taxable income Specified superannuation contribution withholding tax33 cents for every $1 of the contribution The rates apply for the 1999-00-income year. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 12 GST – TREATMENT OF EXPORTED SERVICES Sections 10 and 11(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Introduction Services that are performed in New Zealand for a private consumer but have been contracted for by a non-resident, who is outside New Zealand, are no longer eligible for zero-rating. The amendment aims to protect the integrity of the tax base by ensuring that the consumption of services in New Zealand is subject to GST. Background In March 1999 the Government released the tax policy discussion document GST: A Review, which outlined proposals for changes to GST resulting from a review of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Act 1985. One of the proposals in the discussion document was that the GST Act should be amended to exclude from the zero-rating provisions the supply of services that are contracted for by a non-resident who is outside New Zealand but are consumed in New Zealand. In these cases, the non-resident, who is outside New Zealand, pays for the services but another person receives the performance of the services in New Zealand. Examples of such services include the education of non-resident students at New Zealand schools or universities under contract with the student’s non-resident parent(s), and the provision of accommodation and other services in New Zealand to non-resident tourists under a contract with a non- resident tour promoter. The policy intent of GST is to tax the domestic consumption of services, even though a non-resident has purchased them. However, following on from the Court of Appeal decision in Wilson & Horton v Commissioner of Inland Revenue, 1 these services may have been zero-rated. Key features New section 11(2A) ensures that GST is charged on the supply of services that are consumed in New Zealand but are contracted for by a non-resident who is outside New Zealand. It provides that section 11(2)(e) does not zero-rate services supplied to a non- resident if another person (including an employee or company director of the non-resident) receives the performance of those services in New Zealand. If it is reasonably foreseeable that the services relate to the making of taxable or exempt supplies by registered persons in New Zealand those services are excluded from the new provision. Other amendments clarify the law in this area. The application of section 11(2)(d), which zero-rates services physically performed outside New Zealand, has been expanded to specifically zero-rate the arrangement of such services. New section 11(2B) defines the phrase “outside New Zealand” in relation to section 11(2)(e) and (fa). For the purpose of these provisions a non-resident company or unincorporated body that has a minor presence in New Zealand, or whose presence is unrelated to the supply of services, will remain “outside New Zealand”. New sections 10(16A) and 10(17A) will apply for the purposes of new section 11(2A) if the supply involves the provision of a token, stamp or voucher. The value of supply will be recognised as arising at the time the token, stamp or voucher is acquired, rather than at the time it is redeemed. Application date The amendments apply on and after 20 May 1999. Detailed analysis Taxing consumption in New Zealand New section 11(2A) excludes from zero-rating the supply of services that are consumed in New Zealand but are contracted for by a non-resident who is outside New Zealand. It provides that section 11(2)(e) does not zero-rate services supplied to a non- resident if another person (including an employee or company director of the non-resident) receives the performance of those services in New Zealand. The provision will not apply if it is reasonably foreseeable that the supply of the services is related to the making of taxable or exempt supplies by registered persons. If section 11(2A) had applied to prevent zero-rating where the resident for whom the services were performed was a registered person making taxable supplies, the result would have been that full GST was charged to the non-resident and that cost could have been passed on to the resident. However, neither the non-resident nor the resident would have been entitled to an input tax credit for that GST cost. The resident business would therefore pass the full GST cost on in making a taxable supply. This would be inconsistent with the policy intent of taxing only the value added. 1 (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 13 The incentive, in the absence of a tax on imported services, for registered persons making exempt supplies to acquire services from offshore was recognised in the discussion document GST: A Review. However, that is an issue that Government is seeking to address in its longer-term review of imported services. The amendment is therefore directed primarily towards ensuring private consumers pay GST on the domestic consumption of services. “Outside New Zealand” The application of the phrase “outside New Zealand” in section 11(2)(e) and (fa) is relatively straightforward in respect of supplies to non-resident individuals. An individual is either in New Zealand or is not. However, it is more difficult in respect of non-resident companies and unincorporated bodies. New section 11(2B) provides a definition of the phrase “outside New Zealand” in respect of non- resident companies and unincorporated bodies. This definition will allow supplies under sections 11(2)(e) and (fa) to be zero-rated if the presence in New Zealand of the non-resident company or unincorporated body is minor, or not effectively connected with the supply. Minor presence What constitutes a minor presence will be very much determined by the facts of the particular case. “Minor” is a relative expression. What is minor is therefore a question of degree and should be regarded as relative to the size or volume of the supplies. Effectively connected The test of “effectively connected” is also a question of fact. The relationship of the supply with the presence in New Zealand must be more than remotely connected but can be more than one step removed from the presence. The phrase is therefore broader than the phrase “directly in connection with”. If the presence is attributable to the supply in question then it is very likely that the presence will be effectively connected with that supply. Example 1 Singaporean parents want their child to receive a year’s education in New Zealand. The parents contract with a New Zealand school to supply the tuition. Section 11(2A) excludes the supply of the tuition under the contract between the New Zealand school and the Singaporean parents from being zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). This is because it is reasonably foreseeable that another person (the child) will receive the performance of the tuition in New Zealand. Example 2 A non-resident tour operator pre-purchases accommodation from New Zealand hotels and incorporates them into travel packages for tours of New Zealand. The travel packages are then sold to non-resident tourists. Section 11(2A) excludes the supply of accommodation under the contracts between the New Zealand hotels and the non-resident tour operator from being zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). This is because it is reasonably foreseeable that another person (the non-resident tourist) will receive the performance of the accommodation services in New Zealand. Example 3 A director of a United States company is present in New Zealand for a short period to facilitate a statutory audit by a New Zealand chartered accountancy firm of a New Zealand subsidiary of the company. At the conclusion of the audit the director is presented with an audit report. The GST treatment of the services supplied by the accountancy firm will to some extent depend on who receives the performance of the services. In this case, as it was the United States parent rather than the New Zealand subsidiary that engaged the audit services the services should be zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). Section 11(2A) does not apply as the performance of the services is received by the United States company only. The remaining question is whether the presence of the director means that the United States company is still “outside New Zealand” under section 11(2)(e). The presence of the director would qualify as a minor presence in terms of section 11(2B) and therefore the United States company would be treated as being “outside New Zealand” under section 11(2)(e). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 14 Example 4 A senior manager of an Australian company is present for a short period in New Zealand to recruit on behalf of the company people with experience in horticulture. The company uses a New Zealand recruitment firm to assist with this process. The services supplied by the recruitment firm are zero-rated as the performance of the services is received by the Australian company only and not the manager. Therefore section 11(2A) would not be applicable. As the interviews are spread over a number of days the Australian company has arranged accommodation for the manager. Although the contract to supply the room is between the hotel and the Australian company, the performance of the services (provision of the accommodation) is received by the manager. Section 11(2A) will therefore exclude the supply of accommodation from being zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). Example 5 A New Zealand travel agent is asked by a New Zealand resident to arrange a fourteen-day holiday in Los Angeles. The travel agent receives a fee from a Los Angeles hotel for arranging the New Zealand resident’s stay in that hotel. The fee the travel agent receives from the Los Angeles hotel relates to services (the provision of accommodation) that are physically performed outside New Zealand by a non-resident. The travel agent may zero-rate the fees for arranging this service under the amended section 11(2)(d). Example 6 A New Zealand advertising firm is asked by an Australian company to prepare a media campaign for a new product that the company wants to release first in Australia and then in New Zealand. The New Zealand firm is responsible for coming up with ideas and implementation of the campaign. As the services are supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand they may be zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). If a staff member of the non- resident company came to New Zealand for a short period to facilitate the implementation of the media campaign this should not affect the zero-rating of the services because the presence of a the staff member would generally be considered to constitute a minor presence in terms of section 11(2B). Section 11(2A) does not affect previous statements concerning the GST treatment of advertising services: GST - Advertising space and advertising time sold to non-residents Public Ruling - BR Pub 96/10 Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 8 No. 8. Advertising agencies: placement and creative services supplied to non-residents Questions we’ve been asked, Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 11 No. 1. Further, the amendments are not intended to change the GST treatment of the particular fact situation in the Wilson & Horton case as determined by the Court of Appeal. Example 7 A New Zealand telecommunications company has a number of contracts with other telecommunication companies in other jurisdictions to connect to New Zealand calls originating offshore. Section 11(2A) will not apply to prevent the connection service provided by the New Zealand telecommunications company to the overseas telecommunications company from being zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). This is because the connection service supplied by the New Zealand telecommunications company is received by the overseas telecommunications company only, not by the person in New Zealand receiving the call. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 15 REMEDIAL ISSUES TRADING STOCK – EXCEPTED FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS Section EE 14(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 Third Party NZ CoAust Co 100% wholly owned group Transfer at cost (market value $60) Deduction in NZ $40 Deduction in Australia $40 Cost of shares $100 Sale at market $60 Example Introduction The rule requiring companies transferring excepted financial arrangements that are trading stock or revenue account property within a wholly-owned group to transfer them at cost now applies only to companies that are New Zealand resident. The amendment corrects an oversight in the recently enacted trading stock legislation. Background Under the new trading stock rules, excepted financial arrangements are to be valued at cost. To prevent wholly-owned groups of companies circumventing the rules by transferring excepted financial arrangements within a group, section EE 14 was enacted. The section states that if an excepted financial arrangement that has a market value less than cost is sold or disposed of within a wholly- owned group of companies, the transfer is deemed to take place at cost. If a member of the group is a non-resident company, there is potential for a double deduction of a loss. The non-resident company can claim a loss overseas on a transfer of excepted financial arrangements to a New Zealand member of a group. The New Zealand resident member may also be able to deduct a loss once the excepted financial arrangements are transferred at market value outside the group. The amendment is intended to prevent potential losses being deducted twice. Key features Section EE 14(2) has been amended to restrict its application to New Zealand resident companies. If excepted financial arrangements are entering or leaving the New Zealand tax base, transactions should take place at market value. Application date The amendment applies to the sale, disposal or distribution of excepted financial arrangements on and after 20 May 1999 (the date of introduction into Parliament of the tax bill containing the amendment). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 16 TRADING STOCK - DEFINITION OF “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS” Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The definition of “financial statements” has been amended so that it applies to financial statements prepared by all taxpayers. The amendment corrects an unintended effect of the definition in the Financial Reporting Act 1993. Background The trading stock rules were intended in part to require taxpayers to comply at the same level for tax purposes with what had been done for financial reporting purposes. This was achieved by generally requiring taxpayers to adopt the same valuation methods that apply to financial statements. The definition of “financial statements” has the same meaning as in the Financial Reporting Act 1993. This definition is confined to an “entity”, which is defined to mean a company or an issuer. Therefore others are not required to apply the same standards they apply to their financial statements. This effect was unintended, and is addressed by the amendment. Key features The definition of “financial statements” in section OB 1 has been amended so that it applies to the financial statements of all taxpayers, not just entities as defined in the Financial Reporting Act 1993. Application date The amendment applies to the 1999-2000 and subsequent income years. TRADING STOCK – DEFINITION OF“ASSOCIATED PERSONS” Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The associated persons rules which apply to determine whether a taxpayer is a “small taxpayer” have been amended. The amendment associates taxpayers only when companies have at least 50 percent common ownership or a taxpayer has at least 50 percent ownership of a company. Narrowing the scope of the definition makes the trading stock rules more workable for small businesses. Background “Small taxpayers” have simplified requirements for the valuation of trading stock to reduce compliance costs. An associated persons test is used to aggregate the income of associated taxpayers to determine whether a taxpayer’s business exceeds the $3,000,000 threshold allowed for small taxpayers. The associated persons test in section OD 7 of the Income Tax Act was previously used. The test is too wide as it includes relatives (to the fourth degree) and persons having a 25 percent interest in a company. Narrowing the definition will reduce compliance costs for taxpayers. Key features The amendment changes the associated persons test in the definition of “small taxpayer” in the Income Tax Act 1994 from section OD 7 to section OD 8(1)(a) and (b). Taxpayers will be associated only when companies have at least 50 percent common ownership, or a taxpayer has at least 50 percent ownership of a company. Application date The amendment applies from the 1998-99 and subsequent income years. The application date is the same as the date from which the trading stock rules took effect. Using this application date prevents any potentially harsh applications of the rules to those small taxpayers who would be excluded from the definition of “small taxpayers” were the amendment not enacted. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 17 TAXATION OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS Sections EH 26(3), EH 31, EH 48(2), EH 48(3)(a), EH 50(1A), EO 2A, FC 8A, FC 8C, FC 8F, FC 8H, FC 10(6A) and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The new legislation fine-tunes the amendments recently made to the rules governing the taxation of financial arrangements. Background The rules that govern the taxation of financial arrangements were recently reformed by the enactment of the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999. The amendments made in the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 are discussed in Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 6 (July 1999). The amendments in this Act merely fine-tune the earlier changes. Key features Section EH 26(3) Section EH 26(3) determines the value for which property is treated as being transferred under other provisions of the Act by referring to the paragraphs of section EH 48(3). The paragraphs are applied in alphabetical order. It has been made clear that the paragraphs are applied in alphabetical order until a paragraph applies. Section EH 31 Under section EH 31 a cash basis person may elect to use a spreading method to calculate income or expenditure in respect of the financial arrangements to which they are a party. The election must be made for all financial arrangements the person is a party to at the time of the election and any financial arrangements entered into in subsequent years. The person must continue to use the spreading method for those financial arrangements until the financial arrangements mature. New sections EH 31(6) and (7) have been inserted to provide for revocation of the election to use a spreading method. Taxpayers revoke their election by giving notice to the Commissioner (section EH 31(7)). Once notice has been given the revocation applies to financial arrangements entered into in the year following the income year in which the notice is given. Definition of consideration Section EH 48(2) “Consideration” is defined in section EH 48. If consideration includes property or services the value of the property or services is determined under sections EH 48(2) and (3). It was unclear whether the definition of consideration applied to the consideration paid to the person or the consideration paid by the person, or to both. It has been clarified that if the consideration includes property or services, the regardless of whether the consideration is paid to the person or paid by the person, the value of the property or services is determined under section EH 48(2) and (3). In addition, section EH 48(2) could be read in two ways. The first is “For an original party to any agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services or a specified option, not being ... a finance lease or a hire purchase agreement ...”. The second way is “For an original party to any agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services or a specified option, ... a finance lease or a hire purchase agreement ...”. The second interpretation is correct, and the section has been clarified to reflect this. Section EH 48(3)(a) As drafted, section EH 48(3)(a) referred to the lowest price “the parties would have agreed, on the date the agreement was entered into or the specified option was granted, if payment was required in full at the time the first right in the contracted property was transferred or the services provided”. This paragraph would never have applied because payment “was not required in full at the time the first right” was transferred. The section has been amended to refer to the lowest price that would have been paid had payment been made in full at that time. Non-residents becoming resident The Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 divided the accrual rules into two divisions. Division 1 applies to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999. Division 2 applies to financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999 and to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May if the taxpayer has made the transitional adjustment under section EH 17. Under Division 1, if a person who was non-resident becomes a resident of New Zealand the person is treated as acquiring the financial arrangement on the date the person become resident for an arm’s length value on that date (section EH 16(2)(b)). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 18 A provision similar to section EH 16(2)(b) was omitted in error from Division 2. Section EH 50(1A) has been inserted in Division 2 and provides that if a non-resident becomes resident after 20 May 1999 and the person is a party to financial arrangements the person is treated as having acquired those financial arrangements at the time the person becomes resident for arm’s length consideration. Section EO 2A Section EO 2A provides that a lessee “is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred in making lease payments under an operating lease”. Section EO 2A should set out how the deduction is calculated rather than providing the grounds for the deduction. The deduction should be subject to the normal deductibility tests. Finance lease rules Section FC 8A Under section FC 8A a lease is treated as a sale of the lease asset from the lessor to the lessee at the beginning of the lease. The lessor is also treated as advancing a loan to the lessee which the lessee uses to purchase the lease asset. As the legislation was drafted, the loan from the lessor was for the lessor’s disposition value, and the lessee uses the loan to purchase the lease asset for the lessee’s acquisition cost. The lessee’s acquisition costs include installation fees incurred by the lessee, so the loan may have only partially funded the acquisition of the lease asset. Section FC 8A has been amended so that the leasing of an asset is treated as a sale of the asset from the lessor to the lessee, the lessor is also treated as giving the lessee a loan, and the lessee is treated as using the loan to purchase the lease asset. The value of the loan for the lessor is the lessor’s disposition value and for the lessee the lessee’s acquisition cost. Section FC 8C Section FC 8C deals with early terminations of leases. If a lease terminates early, and the lease asset is returned to the lessor, the lease asset is treated as being sold to the lessor “for the amount by which the outstanding balance of the loan on the date of termination is more than the amount the lessee paid to be released from his or her obligations under the lease”. Under section FC 8C(2) if the amount paid by the lessee to be released from the loan exceeds the outstanding balance, the excess is gross income of the lessor. As the income would arise under the accrual rules, section FC 8C(2) was not necessary and has been repealed. Sections FC 8F and FC 10(6A) The words “for the purpose of this Act” at the beginning of sections FC 8F and FC 10(6A) were redundant and therefore removed. Section FC 8H Sections FC 8H and FC 8I allow for a person to make an adjustment if they determine part way through a lease that their lease is a finance lease. The adjustment is made in the income year they determine that their lease is a finance lease. It was not clear that the adjustment should only be made if, as a result of the extension of the lease, the total lease term becomes a period longer than 75 percent of the lease asset’s estimated useful life. This has been clarified in the legislation. Definition of “lease term” The definition of “lease term” in section OB 1 referred to paragraph (d) of the definition of “lease”. The reference was incorrect and has been corrected to refer to paragraph (f). Application date These amendments apply on and after 20 May 1999 (the date of enactment of the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999). TRANSFER PRICING Section GD 13(5) of the Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction An amendment has been made to confirm that that the transfer pricing rules do not apply to interest-free loans made to taxable New Zealand residents. Background The transfer pricing rules allow an arm’s length price to be substituted for a taxpayer’s transfer price, if the taxpayer’s price has the effect of depleting the New Zealand tax base. Section GD 13(4) allows the transfer pricing rules to apply to transactions when a non-resident makes a supply to New Zealand for inadequate consideration. Commonly, this would result in additional non- resident withholding tax being imposed. In many cases, however, the additional tax revenue would be more than offset by the tax benefit to the New Zealand recipient when it takes a deduction on the increased transfer price. If the overall effect of applying the transfer pricing rules would be a loss of revenue, section GD 13(5) prevents the transfer pricing rules applying. It was suggested that the interface with the thin capitalisation rules could result in the transfer pricing rules applying to an interest-free loan, on the basis IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 19 that if an arm’s length amount of interest were to be substituted by section GD 13(4), the thin capitalisation rules could then apply to deny a deduction for the increased interest expense. In that case, the extra non-resident withholding tax revenue on the substituted interest amount would exceed the tax value of the increased interest deduction (nil), so the transfer pricing rules would be applied (technically, section GD 13(5) would not apply to preclude section GD 13(4) operating to substitute an alternative interest amount). This was not the intended effect of the rules. A retrospective amendment has, therefore, been made to confirm that the transfer pricing rules do not apply to these loans. Key features An amendment to section GD 13(5) confirms that the transfer pricing rules do not apply to interest-free loans made to taxable New Zealand residents. Application date The amendment applies retrospectively from the 1996-97 income year, the year for which the current transfer pricing rules first applied. TAX SIMPLIFICATION Sections KD 4, KD 5, NC 8, NC 9, NC 12, OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994; sections 33A, 36CA, 38, 41A, 80B, 80C, 80E, 80F, 80G, 139AA, 184A and 184B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction The recently introduced measures removing the need for salary and wage earners to file income tax returns have been fine-tuned. The amendments arise from the work Inland Revenue is undertaking to implement these simplification measures, minor policy improvements, and the need to correct errors in earlier legislation. Background The no-filing simplification initiatives were enacted in the Taxation (Simplification and other Remedial Matters) Act 1998. They involved simplifying the income tax requirements for wage and salary earners and removing the need for many to file returns of income. Their introduction required significant amendments to the PAYE rules, the rules around filing tax returns, and the introduction of income statements. Key features The Government has identified several areas in the recent tax simplification legislation where amendments were required. The amendments fall into the following categories: Non-filing requirements. Improvements to the specification of those not required to file a tax return, those who have to receive an income statement or have to receive a tax return. Income statement issuing process. A number of minor amendments are made to the rules surrounding the issuing of income statements. The most significant is to allow the Commissioner to issue income statements based on the information at hand rather than the Commissioner having to wait for all information before issuing a statement. Claiming of rebates. These measures ensure that the legislation is consistent with the new process for claiming housekeeper and donation rebates. The most significant amendment is to the core provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 to confirm that claiming these rebates will take place on a separate rebate claim form rather than as part of the return of income, as happened in the past. PAYE amendments. These measures make a number of tidy-ups to the PAYE rules. The most significant amendment is providing a six-month period of grace during which a new large employer may file other than electronically. Family Assistance. These measures ensure that the legislation is consistent with the new process for administering family assistance. The new process involves one-off registration for claimants rather than the current annual registration process. Refunding of tax. An amendment is made to the provision requiring the Commissioner to direct credit refunds of tax to allow for a phased introduction of this measure as both taxpayers and Inland Revenue establish appropriate systems. Non-filing requirements A number of amendments fine-tune the filing rules. Section 33A(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act is amended to specify that taxpayers that receive $200 or less of income to which the PAYE rules are incorrectly applied are not required to file returns of income or be issued with income statements. This makes the legislation consistent with the policy IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 20 intent that the $200 threshold that relates to the issue of an income statement applies to salary and wages that have had tax incorrectly deducted (for instance, because of the use of an incorrect tax code). Section 33A(1)(b)(ii) is repealed. This provision stated that persons were entitled not to file if they earned less than $200 of interest and complied with their resident withholding tax obligations. Given the requirement that those with income exceeding $38,000 are required to receive an income statement if the lower 19.5% withholding rate applied, this provision was unnecessary. Section 33A(2) of the Tax Administration Act is amended to ensure that taxpayers who receive interest or dividend income from outside New Zealand, and if that income has had no withholding tax deducted, must file returns of income. This subsection is also amended to require a return to be filed by a person receiving interest or dividends that do not have a New Zealand source if withholding tax has been deducted at source and the total of those interest and dividends exceeds $200. Two other amendments are made to section 33A(2), which sets out cases when a tax return is required to be filed. The subsection is amended: to replace the reference to “absentees” with “non-residents”. This amendment is required because of a previous amendment to section KC 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 in the Taxation (Accruals Rules and other Remedial Matters) Act 1999. That change amended a reference to “absentees” to “non-residents” for the purposes of calculating entitlement to the low-income rebate. to ensure that taxpayers who wish to have their tax affairs squared-up part way through an income year, because they are leaving New Zealand, must file returns of income rather than request income statements. This is because the Commissioner may not possess all the relevant information at the time taxpayers wish to have their affairs squared-up. In this case return filing is a more efficient way to quickly square-up a taxpayer’s affairs. Section 33A (5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is amended to confirm that this subsection applies to “natural persons” rather than persons generally. This is consistent with the policy intent that income statements should go only to natural persons and not, for example, companies. A minor amendment is also made to section 38 of the Tax Administration Act to remove an unnecessary cross reference. Income statement process Section 80B (1) is intended to provide that natural persons who incorrectly receive an income statement must inform the Commissioner of this error. However, these is an ambiguity as to the inclusion of interest or dividends which is corrected by removing a reference to interest or dividends having being received. Section 80C is amended to provide that a person who has received resident withholding income which may have been incorrectly deducted is not required to request an income statement. This prevents taxpayers who may have been unaware of a failure by an interest payer becoming liable to request the issue of an income statement when the failure may not be obvious to the taxpayer receiving the interest. Section 80E is amended to allow the Commissioner to issue an income statement on the basis of the details that the Commissioner holds at the time the income statement is issued. This amendment is made to ensure that the Commissioner is not prevented from issuing an income statement where information is still outstanding, say, from one employer in relation to PAYE details. The section is also amended to specifically include family assistance information, with the Commissioner having the authority to place that information on income statement of a separate form. Section 80F is amended so that the Commissioner is not required to issue a further corrected income statement to a taxpayer who received an income statement in error. Previously, one would have been required to be issued in accordance with section 80D. This ensures that a taxpayer that would otherwise not receive an income statement but does through error is not required to receive a corrected income statement. This situation may arise if, for instance, a taxpayer mistakenly uses another taxpayer’s IRD number. These amendments apply for the 1999-2000 and subsequent income years. Housekeeper and donation rebate amendments A number of amendments are made to the provisions relating to the housekeeper and donation rebates. The first of these removes the housekeeper and donation rebates from the definition of “allowable rebates” so that section BC 8 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is consistent with the new process of administering housekeeper and donation rebates. This amendment applies for the 1999-2000 income year. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 21 Section BC 8 describes the process of calculating a taxpayer’s income tax liability and states that allowable rebates must be subtracted from a taxpayer’s unadjusted income tax liability to determine the adjusted tax liability. The new process involves removing these two rebates from the calculation required to determine a taxpayer’s tax liability. An amendment is made to section 41A(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow eligibility for housekeeper and donation rebates to be calculated using the income taxpayers receive in the year in which they made a payment or donation. The legislation currently states that the previous year’s income must be used. Since this legislation was enacted Inland Revenue has developed systems to allow current year income to be used. New section 41A(6) confirms that housekeeper and donation rebates cannot be claimed before the end of the income year in which they were made and that taxpayers with early balance dates are not able to claim before 1 April following their balance date. This amendment removes an ambiguity as to whether taxpayers can claim these rebates during the income year in which they make a payment or donation. It applies for the 1999-2000 and subsequent years. PAYE amendments Section NC 12A of the Income Tax Act 1994 gives the Commissioner authority to require an employer to change an employee’s tax code if the employee is using an incorrect code. Before amendment the new code ceased to apply from either the end of the income year or from a date specified by the Commissioner. At that time the employer reverted to applying the original incorrect code. This measure applies to tax deductions made on or after 1 April 1999. Since the enactment of this provision Inland Revenue has developed a process to check the accuracy of tax codes every month, meaning the automatic end-of- year expiry is unnecessary. Section NC 12A has been amended so that a tax code set by the Commissioner remains valid until an employee informs the employer that another tax code is appropriate. If the new code proposed by the employee is invalid the Commissioner will correct that code. This measure applies to tax deductions made on or after 1 April 1999. Various remedial amendments are made to correct incorrect PAYE tax codes within the Income Tax Act 1994. These amendments are required to remove references to the old PAYE tax codes. A drafting omission in section NC 8(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is corrected. A reference to the “Sec” tax code is changed to a reference to “S”. These amendments apply for the 1999-2000 and subsequent years. A similar amendment is made to section NC 9 to change a reference to the “T” code to “ML”. Again this measure applies for the 1999-2000 and subsequent years. A new section 36CA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is inserted to provide that employers who start up businesses and are covered by the electronic filing requirements for PAYE can, nevertheless, file non- electronically for a period of six months. This provision provides a grace period during which new employers can organise electronic filing of PAYE. This measure applies to employer monthly schedules due on or after 1 April 1999. A minor amendment to improve wording is made to section 139AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This section imposes a penalty on an employer who is required to file an employer monthly schedule in a prescribed electronic format and fails to do so. Family assistance amendments A number of amendments are made to ensure that the legislation is consistent with the new policy of a one-off family assistance registration. An amendment is made to section KD 4(2) to remove references to tax deduction certificates because the amended PAYE system based on employer monthly schedules does not involve the issuing of tax deduction certificates. Section KD 4(3) is also consequentially repealed. This measure applies from the date of enactment. A new section KD 4(2A) requires that a family assistance credit of tax may only be paid in respect of a child if the Commissioner is provided with the tax file number of the child for whom the credit is claimed. Currently, those claiming family assistance are required to provide references to birth certificates or other evidence acceptable to the Commissioner. A similar amendment is made to section KD 5(3). These measure apply from the 2000-2001 income year. Section KD 4(5) is amended to remove the requirement that the statement of the net income of a person issued a certificate of entitlement must include the income details of any other spouse during the income year. This will now be requested directly from that spouse. This measure applies from the date of enactment. A new section KD5 (2A) gives the Commissioner the authority to pay a credit of tax following the end of an income year until the Commissioner withdraws a certificate of entitlement. This measure is remove the need for yearly re-application if the Commissioner considers the person is still entitled to Family Assistance. This measure applies from the 2000-2001 income year. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 22 The current section KD 7(2) is replaced with a new section requiring the Commissioner to notify a person of the amount of family assistance they received as part of the issuing of an income statement. The requirement of a 20 April notification in other cases is not amended. This amendment applies to the 1999- 2000 income year. Refunding of tax An amendment is made to section 184A, which requires the direct crediting of refunds of tax, to allow for a phased introduction of this measure. This will enable both taxpayers and Inland Revenue to establish appropriate systems, reducing the compliance costs associated with this measure. A new section 184B is introduced which allows the Governor-General, by Order in Council, to specify the type of tax section 184A applies. This provision applies from the date of enactment. USE OF MONEY INTEREST AND SHORT OR LATE PAID PROVISIONAL TAX Section MB 7 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and section 120K of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Introduction A number of amendments are made to the provisional tax rules. Although most amendments are minor, one corrects an error in recent amendment aimed at preventing use of money interest being charged on provisional tax. Background These measures amend the use of money interest rules as they apply to provisional tax. Key features A section 120K(4B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 was inserted during the select committee stage of the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Bill 1997 in response to a concern from a taxpayer that use of money interest could be imposed on safe-harboured taxpayers to the extent that they have paid less tax than required by the provisional tax formula at a due date. This could occur because the generic use of money interest rule provides that if a taxpayer pays less tax than required at a due date, use of money interest on that underpayment begins from that due date. The generic rule had the effect of overriding the safe- harbour from use of money interest applying to natural provisional taxpayers with residual income tax of less than $30,000. Although the intention of section 120K(4B) was to prevent use of money interest being imposed on late- paid or short-paid provisional tax paid by a safe- harboured taxpayer, the provision did not achieve this. It actually prevents interest being charged or paid before the terminal tax date. A new provision has been inserted to correct the original problem with a savings provision to prevent taxpayers who relied on the incorrectly drafted provision in determining their provisional tax. To qualify for this savings provisional taxpayer must have, before 23 August 1999: (a)Notified the Commissioner in writing that the taxpayer was applying these provisions as they applied before this amendment. (b)Filed a return of income on that basis. For this criteria to be met the Commissioner would expect there to be explicit evidence of the taxpayer having turned his or her mind to the matter and having made an explicit decision. Section 120K (4A)(c) has been amended by replacing a reference to section MB 5(11) with a reference to section MB5A. This measure applies from the date of enactment. A minor amendment has also made to the provisional tax rules involving consolidated groups through replacement of section MB 7(2). A reference was made to the now repealed section MB 3(2). This repealed provision required taxpayers to estimate their residual income tax if their residual income tax exceeds $300,000. The reference has been removed and the wording of the subsection has been clarified. This measure also applies from the date of enactment. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 23 TAX EXEMPTION OF PORTABLE NZ SUPERANNUATION Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and section 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction The amendments ensure that payments of portable NZ superannuation and portable veteran’s pension to: persons residing in the Cook Island, Niue and Tokelau under section 17B of the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990 during the period 30 June 1993 to 30 September 1999; and to persons residing in certain Pacific countries 2 under section 17BA of the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990 from 1 October 1999; are exempt from income tax. Background Under the Income Tax Act, the payment of portable NZ superannuation and portable veteran’s pension paid or payable under section 17 or 19 of the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990 has been exempt from income tax. This rule has applied since 1 April 1990. From 30 June 1993, the payment of portable NZ superannuation and portable veteran’s pension was extended to persons residing in the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau under section 17B of the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990. However, the Income Tax Act was not consequentially amended to ensure that such payments were exempt from tax. From 1 October 1999, the payment of portable NZ superannuation and portable veteran’s pension was further extended to persons residing in certain Pacific countries under section 17BA of the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990. Key features The amendments ensure that payments of portable NZ superannuation and portable veteran’s pension to: persons residing in the Cook Island, Niue and Tokelau under section 17B of the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990 during the period 30 June 1993 to 30 September 1999; and to persons residing in certain Pacific countries under section 17BA of the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990 from 1 October 1999; are exempt from income tax. Application date The amendments relating to payments made under section 17B of the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990 apply from 30 June 1993 to 30 September 1999. The amendments relating to payments made under section 17BA of the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990 apply from 1 October 1999. 2 The Pacific countries are American Samoa, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Kiribati, Marshall Islands Nauru, New Caledonia, Niue, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Pitcairn Island, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Wallis and Futuna, unless New Zealand has a social security reciprocal agreement with the country under section 19 of the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990 relating to the portability of NZ superannuation and the veteran’s pension. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 24 USE OF MONEY INTEREST ON FOREIGN INVESTOR TAX CREDITS Section 120PA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction An amendment affirms the policy intent that use of money interest calculations should not be adjusted to reflect foreign investor tax credits carried back and applied from future income years. Background The foreign investor tax credit rules limit the New Zealand tax impost on non-residents’ earnings from equity investment to 33%. The rules allow a company to pay supplementary dividends to its non- resident shareholders, based on company tax paid. The company is then entitled to apply a foreign investor tax credit for an equivalent amount against its income tax liability. To ensure that companies are not placed at a significant cash flow disadvantage when funding a supplementary dividend, foreign investor tax credits are readily refundable through a carry-back rule, allowing credits to be applied against the four preceding income years. Because this rule is, however, merely a mechanism to allow a refund to be issued, and does not provide the Commissioner with the use of any funds in the earlier years, it is inappropriate for interest to be credited on any foreign investor tax credit refunded in this manner. When the foreign investor tax credit rules were extended to direct investment, in 1995, use of money interest was expressly precluded for carried back credits. However, the recently enacted compliance and penalty legislation inadvertently omitted a similar provision with effect from the 1997-98 income year. A retrospective amendment has been made to correct this oversight. Key features New section 120PA has been added to explicitly provide that foreign investor tax credits carried back and applied from future income years do not affect the interest calculations in the earlier income year. Application date The amendment will apply to foreign investor tax credits applied to the 1997-98 and subsequent income years. EFFECTIVE DATES FOR USE OF MONEY INTEREST RULES Sections 128(5) and (6) and sections 138I (4) and (5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction The amendments ensure that the use of money interest rules, introduced as part of the compliance and penalty legislation, apply to calculate interest on deferrable and non-deferrable tax in relation to a dispute on after 1 April 1997, irrespective of whether the objection or challenge relates to an income year before the 1997-98 income year. In addition, the amendments provide that if the objection or challenge relates to the 1996-97 or an earlier income year, interest is calculated from the date the period of deferral starts. Background The Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 gave effect to these measures. Owing to an error in the legislation, however, the original provisions did not apply for the 1996-97 income year or from 1 April 1997. Key features The addition of sections 128(4) and 138I(4) ensures that the use of money rules, introduced as part of the compliance and penalty legislation, apply from 1 April 1997 to calculate interest on deferrable and non-deferrable tax in relation to a dispute. This is irrespective of whether the dispute relates to an income year before the 1997-98 income year. Also, sections 128(5) and 138I(5) provide that if a dispute relates to the 1996-97 or an earlier income year and begins on or after 1 April 1997, the use of money interest rules will apply from the beginning of that dispute rather than the original due date. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 1997. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 25 GST AND BENEFITS UNDER ACCIDENT INSURANCE POLICIES Section 3(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Introduction The minimal life insurance component of accident insurance policies provided under the Accident Insurance Act 1998 is now treated as a taxable supply for GST purposes. Background Under the recent accident compensation reforms employers must provide their employees with accident insurance. The accident insurance contracts contain both a general insurance component, which is taxable, and a minimal life insurance component, which, before this amendment, was exempt. The life insurance component of accident insurance contracts includes, for example, the entitlement to weekly compensation payments for a surviving spouse. This means that insurers and employers would have been required to make apportionments between the taxable and exempt portions of the contracts for GST purposes, incurring compliance costs to ensure a technically correct GST treatment. Key feature The definition of “life insurance contract” in section 3(2) of the GST Act has been amended to exclude the benefits required to be provided in accident insurance policies by Schedule 1, Part 5 of the Accident Insurance Act 1998 (which relates to entitlements arising from fatal injuries). Application date The amendment applies on and after 1 April 1999. MINOR REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS A number of minor corrections to definitions and cross-references have also been enacted. For example, in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, the definition of “airport operator” is amended by substituting “Minister of Transport” for “Minister of Civil Aviation and Meteorological Services”. Similarly, and also in section OB 1, the definition of “consideration” is amended by correcting the reference to “section FE 6 (b)(i)” to section FE 6 (6)(b)(i)”. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 26 TAXATION OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS: CORRECTION Tax Information Bulletin Volume Eleven, No.6 (July 1999) described the amendments made to the taxation of financial arrangements in the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999. On page 5, in the first paragraph under the heading “Natural love and affection”, the reference to section EH 53 should instead be to section EH 52. Three of the examples used in the article also contain minor errors. Given the length and complexity of the examples, we are replacing them here in full. We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused readers. Example Natural love and affection example (pages 20 21) In year 1 a father establishes a family trust to benefit his two daughters. The trust deed gives the trustee the power to appoint other beneficiaries - including non-qualifying beneficiaries. In year 1 the father transfers the family home to the trust for its market value of $50,000. A debt is created between the trust and the father for $50,000. The father forgives the debt progressively in years 1 and 2. In each of the years 1 - 7 he makes regular cash gifts of $25,000 to the trust. In year 5 the trustee exercises the power of appointment, appoints the father’s family company as a beneficiary and distributes $40,000 to the company. The trustee also distributes $25,000 to each of the daughters in the same year. In year 7 the trustee distributes $20,000 to the family company and $20,000 to each of the daughters. The father establishes the trust primarily to benefit his daughters. Thus the $50,000 debt that he forgives to the trust in years 1 and 2 is treated as if it is paid under the accrual rules and is, therefore, not taxable to the trust. The distributions to the daughters in years 5 and 7 are distributions to qualifying beneficiaries, so are not taxable under the new rules. The distribution of $40,000 to the family company in year 5 is taxable to the trust in its entirety. This is because the family company is a non-qualifying beneficiary and the trust has received the benefit of $50,000 debt forgiveness in years 1 and 2. The distribution of $20,000 to the family company in year 7 is taxable to the extent of $10,000. This is because only $10,000 of the $50,000 past debt forgiveness has not already been taken into account in calculating taxable distributions under these provisions.

If the proceeds of the sale are more than $30,000 the lessor will return the excess to the lessee and if the sale proceeds are less than $30,000 the lessee will make up any shortfall. At the end of the lease the lessor sells the floodlight system for $24,000 and the lessee pays the lessor $6,000.

Branch equivalent income for the period 1 October 1998 to 30 September 1999 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD). HKD 200,000 ÷ 4.1542 = NZ$48,144.05 A similar calculation would be needed for a FIF using the branch equivalent or accounting profits methods. Example 2 A taxpayer with a 31 March balance date purchases shares in a Philippines company (which is a FIF) for 350,000 pesos on 7 September 1999. Using the comparative value or deemed rate of return methods, the cost is converted as follows: PHP 350,000 ÷ 20.8739 = NZ$16,767.35 Alternatively, the exchange rate can be calculated by averaging the exchange rates “x” which apply to each complete month in the foreign company’s accounting period. Example 3 A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 21 April 1999 and has a balance date of 30 September 1999. During this period, branch equivalent income of 500,000 Singapore dollars was derived. (i)Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-September 1999: (0.9496 + 0.9195 + 0.8833 + 0.8872 + 0.8911) ÷ 5 = 0.9061 (ii)Conversion to New Zealand currency: SGD 500,000 ÷ 0.9061 = NZ$551,815.47 Table B Table B lists the end of month exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for the 6 month period ending 30 September 1999.

This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995). You can order these publications free of charge from any Inland Revenue office. NOTICE OF EXTENSION OF PUBLIC RULING 1.This is a notice of extension of a public ruling made under section 91DD of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 2. Public ruling No.96/4A entitled “Debt forgiveness in consideration of natural love and affection” was signed on 8 December 1996 and notice of its making appeared in the Gazette of 12 December 1996 (Issue No.180). A copy of the ruling appeared in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin Vol.8, No.10 of December 1996. 3.Public ruling No.96/4A originally applied to amounts of debts forgiven in the 1997-98 and 1998-99 income years, and applied to taxpayers with standard, early, or late balance dates for these years. The ruling now applies to amounts of debts forgiven from the commencement of the 1997-98 year to 19 May 1999 for taxpayers with standard, early, or late balance dates for this period. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) NEW GUIDE TO BINDING RULINGS The coming into force of the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 and the Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1999 has made a number of changes to the binding rulings regime. The changes are reflected in a new version of the Guide to Binding Rulings IR715 (formerly IR115G), available from 14 October 1999, that includes: The new fees: now a $310 application fee and an hourly rate of $155 (both GST inclusive). The introduction of status rulings. The new rules governing the publication of product rulings. The effect of a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) on our ability to rule. The booklet may be viewed on Inland Revenue’s website at: www.ird.govt.nz and a copy down- loaded. Copies (max.10) may be obtained by phoning the number for “Forms and Brochures” under “Inland Revenue” in the Blue Pages™ Government Section of your local telephone directory. Any existing stock of the IR115G should be destroyed. GST – ZERO-RATING OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS’ TUITION FEES – LEGISLATIVE CHANGE Section 91G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 states that “a binding ruling does not apply from the date a taxation law is repealed or amended to the extent that the repeal or amendment changes the way the taxation law applies in the ruling”. Inland Revenue has issued a number of product rulings in relation to the zero-rating of tuition fees for international students, where the contractual recipient of the services is non-resident - usually the parent. Persons who are involved in or are interested in such arrangements should note that the Taxation (Remedial Matters) Act 1999 has inserted a new subsection (2A), making the zero-rating of tuition fees under section 11(2)(e) subject to this new provision. The GST treatment of the fees outlined in the product rulings is likely to be affected by this change in the law. All affected or interested parties are advised to refer to the new legislation, and to seek professional advice if necessary. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 34 DEBT FORGIVENESS IN CONSIDERATION OF NATURAL LOVE AND AFFECTION PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 99/7 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 (prior to the enactment of the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999) unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section EH 4(6). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the forgiveness by a natural person (in this Ruling referred to as the creditor), including by way of testamentary disposition under a will, of an amount owing under a debt in the following circumstances: 1.The debtor is a relative (for example a father or child, brother or sister, husband or wife (or non-spousal domestic partner), grandchild, niece or nephew) or close friend of the creditor; or 2.The debtor is a trustee or trustees of a family trust, being a fixed trust, where all of the beneficiaries, other than default beneficiaries, are qualifying beneficiaries; or 3.The debtor is a trustee or trustees of a family trust, being a discretionary trust, where all the beneficiaries, other than default beneficiaries, are qualifying beneficiaries. Such forgiveness may relate to the whole or a part of the relevant debt, and may be conditional or absolute. This Ruling does not apply to: A forgiveness of a debt due by a company (including a family company); or A forgiveness by a trustee of a debt due by one or more of the beneficiaries of the trust; or A debt forgiveness that forms part of a tax avoidance arrangement subject to section GD 11 or section BG 1. For the purposes of this Ruling, the term “qualifying beneficiary” means: A relative (for example a father or child, brother or sister, husband or wife (or non- spousal domestic partner), grandchild, niece or nephew, and other descendants or antecedents of the creditor, whether by blood, marriage, non-spousal domestic relationship, or adoption, and whether or not born during the creditor’s lifetime), or close friend of the creditor; or A fixed trust where all the beneficiaries, other than default beneficiaries, are relatives or close friends of the creditor or are qualifying beneficiaries or a combination of these; or A discretionary trust where all the beneficiaries, other than default beneficiaries, are relatives or close friends of the creditor or are qualifying beneficiaries or a combination of these; or A superannuation scheme that is a trust established specifically by its deed to provide retirement benefits to qualifying beneficiaries only. For the purposes of this Ruling, the term “default beneficiary” means: A person specified as a beneficiary for the sole purpose of their benefiting from the trust only in the event that all the qualifying beneficiaries pre-decease or no longer exist. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: Amounts owing under debts forgiven in the circumstances outlined in the Arrangement are, in terms of section EH 4(6), deemed to be paid for the purposes of the qualified accruals rules, as referred to in section OZ 1(1). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 April 1997 to 19 May 1999. This Ruling is signed by me on the 23rd day of September 1999. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication and Rulings) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 35 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 99/7 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 99/7 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling is also dealt with in Public Ruling BR Pub 96/4A (in TIB Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) at page 40 under the heading Debt forgiveness in consideration of natural love and affection). This Ruling (BR Pub 99/7) does not replace BR Pub 96/4A, which applies from the 1997-98 year to 19 May 1999. This Ruling applies for the period 1 April 1997 to 19 May 1999. Under section 91DB(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this permits taxpayers to rely upon either ruling during the period that both apply. The expiry date for both rulings is 19 May 1999 being the last day prior to the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 having application. That Act provides for a new section EH 5 on debt forgiveness in consideration of natural love and affection. Background The relevant provisions of the accruals rules are sections EH 1 to EH 10. Base price adjustment calculations for financial arrangements are contained in section EH 4. The base price adjustment is effectively a “wash up” calculation of all income or expenditure under a financial arrangement upon the maturity, transfer, or remission of that arrangement. Generally, under section EH 4, any principal, interest, or other amount payable on a financial arrangement that is “remitted” is gross income to the issuer. If the debt is remitted, the issuer is the debtor. This is illustrated by the examples below. Example 1 Creditor lends Debtor $50,000 repayable in two years with $10,000 interest. However, in the second year of the loan Debtor is in financial difficulties. Creditor agrees to accept $50,000 with no interest, in full and final settlement of Debtor’s obligations. The $10,000 interest is accordingly remitted in the second year. Debtor, however, claimed an income tax deduction for $5,000 of the interest in the first year (on an accruals basis). Assume Creditor is not a cash basis holder. Debtor’s base price adjustment in the second year effectively results in the recapture of her income tax deduction of $5,000. She has derived gross income of $5,000. Her gross income is calculated as follows: a - (b + c) =$50,000 - ($50,000 + $5,000) =- $5,000 (income). (A negative result is income for an issuer.) For Creditor, the holder of the financial arrangement, a bad debt deduction for the $5,000 forgiven would be available if the requirements of section EH 5(1) were satisfied prior to the remission. Example 2 Assume that Creditor made the loan under Example 1 and that Debtor had claimed an income tax deduction of $5,000 in the first year (on an accruals basis). Assume, however, that after the first year, Debtor’s financial difficulties lead the parties to agree that only $40,000 of principal and $10,000 of interest would be repaid in the second year in full and final settlement. If the balance of the interest ($5,000) were deductible by Debtor in the second year, she would have gross income of $5,000 under the base price adjustment. This is because the deductible interest in that year would partly offset her taxable remission income of $10,000. Debtor’s base price adjustment would be: a - (b + c) =$40,000 + $10,000 - ($50,000 + $5,000) =- $5,000 (income). Creditor could only claim a deduction for the remission under section EH 5(2) if she satisfied the requirements of that subsection prior to the remission. Creditor would only be entitled to a bad debt deduction if she carried on a business of holding or dealing in such financial arrangements and was not associated with Debtor. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 36 Legislation Section EH 4(6) allows issuers relief from the taxation of remissions for certain intra-family and private debts. It replaced, without material amendment, the former section 64F(7B) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section EH 4(6) Section EH 4(6) states: Where an amount owing under a debt (including any amount accrued and unpaid at the time of the forgiveness) is forgiven by a natural person in consideration of natural love and affection, the amount forgiven shall, for the purposes of the qualified accruals rules, be deemed to have been paid when the amount is forgiven. Application of the Legislation Requirements of section EH 4(6) In summary, for section EH 4(6) to apply: There must be an amount owing. It must be owing under a debt. It may include any amount accrued and unpaid. It must be forgiven. It must be forgiven by a natural person. It must be forgiven in consideration of natural love and affection. The following discusses some of the requirements of the subsection. Debt Section EH 4(6) only applies when there is “an amount owing under a debt”. It is not available for forgiveness of all types of “financial arrangement” that may be subject to the accruals rules. “Financial arrangement” as defined in section OB 1 is a very broad term. For example, it includes sell-back and buy-back arrangements, debt defeasances, and assignments of income. None of these is, in itself, a debt. “Debt” is not defined in the Act. Accordingly, the expression is given its ordinary or common meaning. In legal terms a “debt” is understood to be a liquidated money demand or something recoverable in court by action for debt. A debt is a certain sum due from one person to another, either by record (e.g. court judgment) or in writing. Forgiven An amount under a debt must be “forgiven” for section EH 4(6) to apply. The expression “forgiven” does not necessarily mean the same thing as “remitted” (as defined for accruals rules purposes in section EH 4(9)(c)). “Remitted” includes a wider range of events that are not necessarily forgiveness. These events could include when the issuer has been released from making payments by operation of statute (e.g. the Insolvency Act 1967) or lapse of time (e.g. become statute barred). “Forgiven” is not defined in the Act. The expression must be given its ordinary or common meaning, i.e. the giving up of any claim to restitution or remedy for an obligation. That forgiveness must be a positive act by the creditor (holder) as opposed to a consequence of the operation of statute or the lapse of time. Such forgiveness is normally evidenced by a deed or other document. Partial forgiveness The Commissioner considers that section EH 4(6) can apply to a partial debt forgiveness. The subsection applies in broadly the same way as to a full debt forgiveness. It deems the amount forgiven to be paid for the purposes of the base price adjustment calculation. However, a difference is that a partial debt remission does not trigger a base price adjustment, unless it accompanies maturity or transfer of the financial arrangement. Conditional forgiveness If a forgiveness is conditional, it does not occur until the conditions are fulfilled. Accordingly, the Commissioner considers that the amount conditionally forgiven is not deemed paid under section EH 4(6) until the conditions are fulfilled. Natural person The person forgiving the debt (the creditor or holder) must be a “natural person”. The expression “natural person” is a legal term whose meaning is not altered by the Act. It is a human being as opposed to an artificial person (such as a company): Pharmaceutical Society v London & Provincial Supply Assn. (1880) 5 A.C. 857, 869-870. This commentary sets out the Commissioner’s interpretation of “natural person” for deceased persons and for trusts settled by natural persons. In consideration of natural love and affection This requirement of the subsection confines it to family and other private transactions. It does not apply to business or commercial arrangements. The phrase “in consideration of natural love and affection” is another legal concept. It is not further defined in the Act. It is used to describe an action by a person where the motive is induced not by a promise of something in return but by the natural love and affection the person has for another. An action undertaken in consideration of natural love and affection does not entice reciprocation, i.e. there is nothing in return expected from the debtor. Natural love and affection is generally considered to IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 37 subsist between relatives, such as father and child, brother and sister, husband and wife (or non-spousal domestic partners), uncle and nephew, grandmother and grandchild, great-grandfather and great- grandchild and other descendants or antecedents of the creditor, whether by blood, marriage, non- spousal domestic relationship, or adoption – whether or not born during the creditor’s lifetime. Except as discussed below in relation to trusts, the Commissioner considers that section EH 4(6) requires that the natural love and affection exist between the creditor and the debtor. The Commissioner considers that in some cases it would be possible for natural love and affection to be present outside the family. For example, it could be present between close friends (although not ordinary acquaintances or colleagues). In testing the state of mind of a creditor in establishing the presence of natural love and affection, the Commissioner may look at a number of factors, such as express statements made, past distributions, existing relationships, and future intentions. However, this is by no means a complete list of the factors the Commissioner can take into account in determining whether the creditor has natural love and affection for the debtor. Inland Revenue does not propose to publish detailed rules or guidelines on the degree of relationship necessary to establish natural love and affection. This question can only be considered on a case by case basis. Debt is deemed paid If the requirements of section EH 4(6) are satisfied, the amount of the debt forgiven is deemed paid; including any amount accrued and unpaid on the debt. This consequence is deemed for all purposes within the qualified accruals rules. The main provisions when this deemed payment is relevant are sections EH 4 (base price adjustment) and EH 5 (bad debts). Broadly, the effect for the issuer or debtor is that no taxable remission arises on a base price adjustment. For the holder or creditor, no bad debt deduction is available under section EH 5 because the amount forgiven is deemed paid. Also, any interest or accruals income forgiven is taxable to the holder, for the same reason. Example 3 Assume that the forgiveness is as in Example 1, but that Creditor and Debtor are closely related (sisters) and that the requirements of section EH 4(6) are met. Debtor has claimed a $5,000 interest deduction in the first year. In the second year, rather than $5,000 of gross income as in Example 1, Debtor’s base price adjustment would result in expenditure of $5,000. This is the balance of the interest remitted that is deemed paid. Her calculation would be: a - (b + c) =($50,000 + $10,000) – ($50,000 + $5,000) =$5,000 (expenditure). (The amount deemed paid, $10,000, is added into item ‘a’.) Creditor is required over the two years to return the $10,000 of interest remitted as gross income under the accruals rules. No bad debt deduction is available for the remission as it is deemed paid. Example 4 Assume that the forgiveness is as in Example 2, but that Creditor and Debtor are closely related (sisters) and that the requirements of section EH 4(6) are met. Rather than $5,000 of gross income as in Example 2, Debtor’s base price adjustment would result in expenditure of $5,000, being the balance of the interest paid. The $10,000 of debt remitted is not taxable to Debtor, as Debtor is deemed to have paid it. Debtor’s calculation would be: a - (b + c) =($50,000 + $10,000) – ($50,000 + $5,000) =$5,000 (expenditure). Creditor is assessed on the $10,000 interest received. She is not entitled to a bad debt deduction for the remission as it is deemed paid. Testamentary dispositions and trusts Testamentary dispositions The question has arisen as to whether a deceased taxpayer can be a “natural person” for section EH 4(6) purposes. For example, can section EH 4(6) apply to a debt forgiveness by will when the other requirements of that provision are present? The Commissioner considers that the deceased can be a “natural person” and that section EH 4(6) can apply. This is because, under section 24 of the Wills Act 1837 (UK), in relation to the property of the deceased, a will speaks and takes effect from the time immediately prior to the deceased’s death. (The Wills Act 1837 (UK) has been incorporated into New Zealand law.) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 38 Accordingly, the Commissioner considers that section EH 4(6) will apply to a testamentary debt when its requirements would have been satisfied immediately prior to the deceased’s death. Example 5 Son owes Father a debt of $10,000. Father dies, and his will provides for the debt to be forgiven. Section EH 4(6) applies and Son is deemed to have paid the debt to Father for accruals purposes. Family fixed trusts The issue has also arisen as to whether the forgiveness of debt to a trust may satisfy section EH 4(6). The situation envisaged is when a trust settlor or creditor is a natural person. He or she has natural love and affection for the trust beneficiaries. The trust is a fixed trust (i.e. the trust deed sets out the share or interest that each beneficiary is to take) for beneficiaries. The trust owes the settlor or creditor a debt. The creditor forgives the debt to the trust. The Commissioner considers that the subsection can apply, provided that all the requirements are satisfied. The Commissioner considers that it is necessary to “look through” the trust from the creditor to the beneficiaries in determining whether there is natural love and affection. The presence or absence of that state between the creditor and the trustee, in his or her private capacity, is irrelevant. Similarly, the presence or absence of that state between the trustee and the beneficiaries is irrelevant. The state must exist, or have existed, between the natural person creditor and all of the trust’s beneficiaries (subject to the comments below about certain default beneficiaries). Family discretionary trusts The position is less clear for discretionary trusts when the class of beneficiaries includes persons for whom the settlor or other creditor has natural love and affection. Some parties have argued that a creditor does not have to have natural love and affection for all the beneficiaries of a discretionary trust in order to satisfy the section. The section does not mention “all beneficiaries” but merely provides that there must be natural love and affection. However, in the Commissioner’s view, it is implicit in the words of the section that the debt must be forgiven in consideration of natural love and affection towards all the beneficiaries. This is because the forgiveness, in a discretionary trust, could benefit any of the objects of the trust. If the trustee has power to allocate benefits to beneficiaries for whom a creditor could not have natural love and affection such as a company or a charity, this would seem to defeat the clear intention of the section. The Commissioner considers that the subsection will apply in a family discretionary trust situation, provided that at the time the debt is forgiven all of the objects of the trust (subject to the comments below about default beneficiaries) are persons for whom the creditor has or would have had natural love and affection, i.e. qualifying beneficiaries. The fact that the terms of the trust may include a power to add objects or beneficiaries for whom a creditor could not have natural love and affection will not preclude the section from applying to a forgiveness of debt if that discretion has not been exercised. Family trusts (fixed and discretionary) with default beneficiaries A related question is whether the subsection applies if a trust deed specifies default beneficiaries for whom the settlor does not have natural love and affection. For example, it is common for family trusts to have charities and similar bodies as default beneficiaries in the event that the qualifying beneficiaries pre-decease. There needs to be a legal mechanism whereby the assets of the trust are definitely to be distributed at some point in time. The naming of default beneficiaries to receive trust property if the intended beneficiaries or objects are not alive when the distribution takes place is accepted by the Commissioner as not precluding the application of section EH 4(6), notwithstanding that such default beneficiaries may be persons for whom the creditor does not necessarily have natural love and affection. Therefore, non-qualifying beneficiaries, such as charities, can be default beneficiaries and the section will still apply in a situation of debt forgiveness. Similarities between family companies and family trust arrangements The Commissioner has considered submissions that focus upon the similarities between family companies and family trust arrangements. However, there is clear legal distinction between these chosen vehicles, in that a company has separate legalpersonality from its shareholders. This was affirmed in the House of Lords case Salomon v Salomon & Co Ltd \[1897\] AC 22. Accordingly, any relationship between the creditor and the shareholders is regarded as being irrelevant in a forgiveness of debt situation. In contrast, a trust is a form of relationship in which one person (the trustee) holds property in his or her own ownership for the benefit of a second party (the beneficiary). The publication Nevill’s Law of Trusts, Wills and Administration in New Zealand refers to Keeton and Sheridan’s definition of a trust as: the relationship which arises whenever a person called the trustee is compelled in equity to hold property, whether real or personal, and whether by legal or equitable title, for the benefit of some persons (of whom he may be one and who are termed beneficiaries) or for some object permitted by law, in such a IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 39 way that the real benefit of the property accrues, not to the trustees, but to the beneficiaries or other objects of the trust. \[See The Law of Trusts, 10th edition, at page 5.\] In Garrow and Kelly’s Law of Trusts and Trustees, 5th Edition, 1982, a trust is defined as: an equitable obligation under which a person having the control of property is bound to deal with that property either: (a)For the benefit of definite persons (of whom he may himself be one) and any one of whom may enforce the obligation; or (b)For some object or purpose permitted by law. These definitions emphasise that trust property is vested in trustees who control it and manage it for the benefit of the beneficiaries or objects. A trust is the relationship between the trustee and beneficiaries, whereas a company is a separate legal entity from its shareholders. A forgiveness to a company or other non-natural person is not in consideration of natural love and affection. A number of commentators share this view. For example, the Valabh Committee commented on this issue in its discussion paper issued in October 1991 on the Operational Aspects of the Accruals Regime. The Committee said, at page 37: The Committee is not persuaded that the natural love and affection exemption should be extended to loans made to companies. Where a loan is forgiven, the relationship between lender and shareholders seems too remote to justify such an extension. Further comment is provided in the publication The New Zealand Accrual Regime - a practical guide by Glazebrook and Oliver. The authors say, at page 169: However, a person could not have natural love and affection for companies or other non-natural persons. It is certainly difficult to envisage that the forgiveness of debt owed by a company, whoever the shareholders are, could be in considera- tion of natural love and affection. In the discussion document Taxation of Financial Arrangements issued in December 1997, the following comments were made in respect of the forgiveness of company debt obligations: •Section EH 4(6) should not be extended to include forgiveness of debts owing by companies whose shareholders were persons for whom the creditor had natural love and affection. •A company has a separate legal identity from its shareholders. In contrast, a trust is a form of relationship in which one person (the trustee) holds property in his or her own ownership for the benefit of a second party (the beneficiary). The property is held according to terms that are dictated by the person who constituted the trust (the settlor). The function of trust law is to enforce the duties implicit in the trust relationship that exists between the trustee and the beneficiary and to provide remedies for a breach of those duties. •A forgiveness of a debt owing by a trust will benefit the beneficiaries of that trust. However, there may be situations where a loan to a company that is subsequently remitted does not beneficially flow through to shareholders - for example, if a company is insolvent, or in loss. •We note that the Valabh Committee, in its 1991 report, was also opposed to extending section EH 4(6) to cover forgiveness of debts owing by companies. Superannuation schemes as trust beneficiaries A superannuation scheme may be one of the beneficiaries of a trust. As long as the superannuation scheme is a trust established specifically by its deed to provide retirement benefits to persons for whom a creditor has natural love and affection, i.e., relatives or close friends, any debt forgiven by the creditor will be deemed to have been paid under section EH 4(6). Charities as beneficiaries Section EH 4(6) will not apply when a charity is a beneficiary (other than a default beneficiary). Natural love and affection cannot be held for a charity. To interpret section EH 4(6) otherwise would be to ignore the plain words of the section. Charities are not set up for specified or named people but with particular purposes in mind, e.g. relief of poverty, whereas a family trust will have specified beneficiaries as objects. Also, Parliament’s intention in enacting the legislation was to provide an exemption for family arrangements - not to deal in any way with the taxation treatment of charities. Example 6 Mother has established a trust, with her children as beneficiaries as to one-third each. The default beneficiary, if the other beneficiaries pre-decease, is a charity for the promotion of musical education. Mother has sold her business assets to the trust for a debt owed back by the trust of $100,000. Mother forgives the $100,000 debt in consideration of natural love and affection for the beneficiaries. Section EH 4(6) applies and the trustee is deemed to have paid the debt for accruals purposes. Although natural love and affection cannot exist in respect of a charity, its presence in the trust as a default beneficiary does not prevent the subsection applying. Example 7 Prior to his death, the deceased established a family discretionary trust under which the only potential beneficiaries are his children. He lent money to the trust to pay for an overseas trip by his children. His will provided for the loans to be forgiven. Section EH 4(6) applies and the trustee is deemed to have paid the debt for accruals purposes. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 40 Example 8 A discretionary trust is established whose beneficiaries are the settlor’s children, other family members, and family superannuation schemes. As long as the superannuation schemes are trusts established specifically by their deeds to provide retirement benefits to family beneficiaries only, debts forgiven by the settlor to the trust will fall within the provisions of section EH 4(6) and the Ruling will apply. Example 9 A discretionary trust includes within its objects the children of the settlor, a family company, and a charity. Both the company and the charity receive regular payments from the trust, i.e. they are not default beneficiaries. The Ruling will not apply where debt is forgiven to such a trust. The presence of the company and the charity precludes section EH 4(6) from applying in a debt forgiveness situation. Natural love and affection cannot be extended to a company or a charity. The same position will apply if no distributions are made to the company or charity. Example 10 A trust may have as its beneficiaries family members and a discretionary family trust. Provided that the beneficiaries (apart from default beneficiaries) of the discretionary trust are family members or close friends, i.e. qualifying beneficiaries, the provisions of section EH 4(6) will apply and so too will the Ruling. Other situations that may arise Situations will arise that fall outside the examples described here. If taxpayers or their agents are uncertain as to whether the Ruling applies in particular circumstances, they should check with their local Inland Revenue office. If the Ruling does not apply to their arrangement, taxpayers can then ask their local Inland Revenue office for a non- binding opinion on the Commissioner’s view of the law as it affects their arrangement. Alternatively, they can apply for a private binding ruling in respect of a particular arrangement. Other situations where section EH 4(6) does not apply The Commissioner considers that section EH 4(6) is not applicable if: A trustee, acting in his or her capacity as trustee, forgives a debt owed by the trust beneficiaries, in their capacity as beneficiaries, irrespective of a trustee’s natural love and affection for the beneficiaries. The trustee’s natural love and affection arises in his or her personal capacity. It would be improper for the trustee to forgive a debt in consideration of his or her personal natural love and affection for the beneficiaries. The trustee could only forgive in accordance with his or her duties as trustee (as set out in the trust deed). In the statutory context of section EH 4(6), the Commissioner considers that a trustee acting in his or her capacity as trustee is not a natural person. The settlor’s natural love and affection for the beneficiaries would also be irrelevant as the forgiveness would be by the trustee. The debt forgiveness forms part of a tax avoidance arrangement in terms of a provision such as section GD 11 or BG 1. For example, an individual taxpayer owes a bank an amount under a debt which she cannot pay in full. The individual pays what she can, and the bank, in turn, transfers the balance of the debt to the taxpayer’s spouse for nominal consideration. The spouse forgives the balance supposedly within section EH 4(6). In these circumstances the Commissioner might invoke an anti-avoidance provision such as section BG 1. Submissions received from practitioners and others We received many submissions in response to our initial draft of the ruling and we have adopted some of the suggestions made to us. We set out below how we have dealt with the main issues. Power of resettlement We were asked whether a trust having the power of resettlement will prevent the section from applying. If a trust has the power to resettle, this alone will not prevent the exemption provisions of section EH 4(6) from applying. Provided that a trust currently satisfies the criteria to achieve an exemption, where a resettlement is effected the resulting beneficiary make-up will govern whether a debt forgiven to the trust comes within the section. If the beneficiaries satisfy the criteria, the exemption will apply - the test is whether a debt is forgiven in consideration of natural love and affection. This test is not affected by the ability of a trust to resettle. Power to nominate further beneficiaries Commentators suggested that the fact that a trust may have the power to add further beneficiaries to the trust for whom a creditor could not have natural love and affection should not prevent section EH 4(6) from applying to a forgiveness of debt. We agree with this view. Provided that at the time the debt is forgiven all the beneficiaries (apart from IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 41 default beneficiaries) are persons for whom the creditor has natural love and affection, i.e. the ability to nominate further beneficiaries (other than qualifying or default beneficiaries) has not been exercised, section EH 4(6) will still apply. If, however, there is an intention (at the time of the debt forgiveness) to add such a non-qualifying beneficiary, the Commissioner reserves the right to consider the potential for invoking the anti-avoidance provisions of the Act if the circumstances support this. Degree of relationship Commentators stated that reference in the ruling to “near relatives” and “close friends” was too narrow an interpretation of the objects of a person’s natural love and affection. We agree with this view. The use of the term “near relatives” and the examples given, left unclear the degree of family relationship to which the section applies. The current draft ruling now refers to “relatives”, and expands on the examples, to take into account how a typical family trust makes provision for family members including those not yet born. Classes of beneficiaries Concern has been expressed as to how to differentiate between primary and minor beneficiaries. The Commissioner now considers that, in a family trust situation, the clear words of section EH 4(6) put the focus on beneficiaries of a trust for whom a creditor can have natural love and affection. The section will apply in all instances if the creditor has forgiven a debt owing by a trust where all the beneficiaries (apart from default beneficiaries) are persons for whom the creditor has natural love and affection, i.e. qualifying beneficiaries. Therefore, no distinction is required to be made between primary and minor beneficiaries. Companies and charities It was suggested by commentators that the section required the Commissioner to look through a company in much the same way that one looks through a trust to the beneficiaries. The Commissioner disagrees with this view. In respect of companies, there is a clear legal distinction between a company and its shareholders in that a company has a separate legal personality from its shareholders. Accordingly, any relationship in a forgiveness of debt situation between a creditor and the shareholders is irrelevant. Some parties also suggested that charities should be permitted beneficiaries for the purposes of section EH 4(6) - primarily for perceived policy reasons. For the reasons noted earlier in this commentary, it is the Commissioner’s view that a person cannot have natural love and affection for a charity or other non- natural person. Neither the history nor the wording of section EH 4(6) indicates any legislative intention to deal with charities; concessionally or otherwise. PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 99/10 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited as Trustee of the AMP Superannuation World Index Fund, IRD number 70-976-171. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BD 2, EE 1, and EF 2. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the redemption of Units in the AMP Superannuation World Index Fund (“the Fund”) by investors who receive securities for their redemption, and those shares are trading stock or revenue account property of that investor. The material details of the Arrangement are as follows. 1.The Fund is a registered superannuation scheme under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. It is established pursuant to a Deed of Trust dated 4 December 1998 (the “Trust Deed”) 2.The Fund is a passive or index investor and is required to hold a portfolio of shares and other notes and options (“securities”) that correspond to the composition and weighting of an index called the AMP World Index (“the Index”). The Index is based on the MSCI World Index with some modifications. The Index is determined according to the methodology set out in this Ruling. The term “Index” is defined in the Trust Deed as: means the index of securities known as the AMP World Index or such other index of securities agreed by the Manager and the Trustee from time to time. However, this Ruling only concerns the investments in the AMP World Index and no other index. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 42 3.Clauses 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 of the Trust Deed provide that: 5.2.2Subject to clauses 4.7 and 5.2.5, the Trustee shall not invest in any investment other than: 5.2.2.1 Constituent Company Securities which cause the Fund to hold such securities as near as practicably possible to their weightings in the Index; or 5.2.2.2 Any Asset which (i) was acquired and is held under a bona fide opinion that it is authorised by clause 5.2.2.1 or 5.2.5; or (ii) was acquired inadvertently without recognition of its non-complying nature; or (iii)was distributed to or received by the Fund as a result of holding an Asset of the Fund; provided that the Asset is disposed of or the non-compliance is otherwise remedied to the satisfaction of the Trustee as soon as practicably possible but no later than 30 Business Days, or such longer period as the Trustee may prescribe, after the non- compliance is discovered and reported to the Trustee. The Manager shall report to the Trustee when it is discovered that any Asset is within the category described in this clause 5.2.2.2 and shall dispose of any such Asset. 5.2.3Acquisitions and dispositions to achieve the objective set out in clause 5.2.2.1 are to be determined using the “least squares” methodology to minimise the Fund’s aggregate deviation in dollar terms from the proportions of the index, after allowing for parcel size and transaction cost constraints. The Fund shall adopt the same policy on adjustments to the Constituent Company Securities held by the Fund to reflect mergers, takeovers, substitutions, share buybacks, new listings, issues, special dividends capital distributions and other adjustments to the Index as is adopted by the AMP Investments’ World Index Fund; 5.2.5The Trustee may maintain or invest in Cash in any amount representing up to five percent (5%) of the Current Fund Value at any time, PROVIDED THAT the investment in Cash shall only be used to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund and to reduce the number of transactions required to be made or to facilitate redemptions from time to time, but may not be used by the Manager or the Trustee to increase the performance of the Fund by maximising the holding of securities considered to be likely to give a high return or minimising the holding of securities considered likely to give a low return. 4.Cash is defined in the Trust Deed to: \[include\] deposits, or negotiable instruments, in each case having maturities which are not later than the times at which the proceeds of realisation thereof are expected to be required, and on which there is full indefeasible liability of: (a)a New Zealand registered bank (having the meaning given to that term by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989) approved by the Manager for the purpose; or (b)the New Zealand Government. 5.The Fund is required to buy and sell shares as necessary to ensure that its portfolio continues to correspond as near as practicably possibly to the Index. Such buying and selling is not motivated by any intention to derive a profit or gain from such sales. The sole purpose of the Fund is to have a portfolio which continues to track the Index as near as practicably possible irrespective of whether the sale of shares will give rise to a profit or loss. 6.The Fund does not take any action to hedge or manage foreign exchange risks or exposures that arise from the investments of the Fund in non-New Zealand currencies. 7.The Fund operates a cash pool which can hold at any time cash (as defined in the Trust Deed) up to a maximum of 5% of the current fund value. However, the Fund aims to have as little cash as practical and does not aim to hold a cash pool of up to 5%. Any cash that the Fund holds is cash held awaiting investment or redemption. However, the Fund can only transact in $1 million dollar lots and is required to accumulate cash in lots of $1million dollars before investing. Therefore, any amount accumulated in $1million dollar lots is required to be invested as soon as possible. The percentage of cash to be held by the Fund shall not exceed the 5% level and will be no greater than strictly necessary in order to operate the Fund efficiently. 8.Redemptions are made from the cash pool if sufficient funds are available, otherwise redemptions are financed from the sale of securities. In addition, following a redemption, the cash pool is not normally topped up and there is no specified period of time in which the cash pool will be injected with further funds. Accordingly, if there is insufficient cash to pay a redemption if it arises, the redemption will be financed through the sale of securities. There may be some situations in which redemptions may be made through the transfer of Constituent Company Securities to unitholders. This IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 43 situation will not be common and will only occur where the unitholder has elected to receive such securities and the Manager has approved the transfer of such securities. The Manager does not exercise this discretion with a view to increasing the performance of the Fund. 9.With regards the ability to suspend redemptions, the Trust Deed provides under clause 8.5 that the manager can suspend redemptions in certain circumstances up to a period not exceeding 20 business days. This clause states: The Manager, with the consent of the Trustee (which may not be unreasonably withheld), may at any time give notice (a “Suspension Notice”) to Members suspending the operation of all existing and future requests under clause 8.3 relating to the Plan until the earlier of the Manager giving notice to the effect that the relevant Suspension Notice is cancelled or the expiration of 20 Business days from the date of the Suspension Notice or such other period (which may exceed 20 Business Days) that the Manager considers reasonable in the interests of all Members (the “Cancellation Date”), where the Manager in good faith determines that: (i)it is not practicable to pay a benefit due to insufficient Cash in the Plan, and an inability to convert sufficient assets into Cash, to enable the Manager to meet the Benefit payment; or (ii)the Market Value of the Units at the time is not a true reflection of the actual value of the Units, due to: (A) a suspension in trading of any Constituent Company Securities on any exchange; or (B) an exchange on which Constituent Company Securities are traded being closed for a period which in the Manager’s opinion is likely to involve a material change in the market price of the Constituent Company Securities; or (iii)for reasons beyond its reasonable control, the Manager is unable to calculate the Redemption Price; and provided that the period of suspension is no longer than is necessary, according to the Manager’s good faith determination, to accommodate the events referred to in paragraphs (i) to (iii). 10.Suspension of redemptions is likely to be very rare. Clause 8.5 caters for specific circumstances involving unusual market conditions or circumstances that give rise to “administrative difficulty” in complying with the requests for redemptions. It is the process for managing the redemptions (particularly the difficulty thereof) that is likely to give rise to suspensions rather than the market conditions relating to the securities. Also of particular note is clause 8.5(c) which provides that the Manager shall not use its discretion under this clause to increase the performance of the Fund or the returns to any member. 11.The Trustee of the Fund is The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited. 12.The Manager of the Fund is AMP Investment Management (N.Z.) Limited (“the Manager”), a wholly owned subsidiary of AMP Limited. Initial subscriptions are made through the Manager. The Manager invests the cash subscriptions (or subscriptions made in securities) into the Fund in return for units on behalf of the investors. The Manager subcontracts the function of converting cash to parcels of shares in companies included in the Index to Henderson Investors Limited (“the Investment Manager”). The Investment Manager is a United Kingdom incorporated subsidiary of AMP Limited. The Investment Manager purchases securities in the Index according to the predetermined rules set out below. Methodology for calculating the Index 13.The following predetermined rules apply for calculating and maintaining the Index: Countries included in the Index 14.The Index includes countries in the MSCI World Index that are in Schedule 3 Part A (referred to as ‘grey-list’ countries) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The countries included in the Index must also be at least 1% of the MSCI World Index. Grey-list countries which meet this size constraint at the date of this Ruling are Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, Canada and the United States. 15.If a new country, which meets the 1% threshold, achieves grey-list status the country will be added to the Index. If a country loses its grey-list status, or falls below 0.6% of the MSCI World Index, it will be removed from the Index. The Index country composition will be reviewed quarterly. 16.The thresholds for inclusion in or removal from the Index are designed to exclude small countries from the Index so as to minimise the number of shares required to be held by the Fund and the number of transactions. Limitation on number of securities included in the Index: 17.The Index will have a country module for each grey-list MSCI Country Index. Each of the country modules will cover a certain percentage of the relevant MSCI Country Index by value. The percentage coverage for each country at the inception of the Index is contained in the table below. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 44 CountryMarket Coverage % Australia80 Canada80 Germany80 Japan80 United Kingdom80 United States80 18.The methodology that the Index follows for the country module construction is to: 1.List all the securities in each MSCI Country Index in order of size (market capitalisation), from largest to smallest. 2.Start at the top of the list and work down until the Index has as many securities as required to obtain, as near as practically possible, the percentage market coverage in the above table. 3.Weight the selected securities by market capitalisation. 19.The market coverage for each country is reviewed once a quarter in order to maintain the percentages of market coverage for each country in the table above as closely as practically possible. A constituent company is not removed from the Index unless its market capitalisation ranks it below those companies representing 82.5% of the MSCI World Index market capitalisation. Conversely, a constituent company is not added unless its market capitalisation ranks it among those companies representing 77.5% of the MSCI World Index market capitalisation. These rules promote index stability. Methodology for minimising the deviation of the Fund from the Index 20.The Fund only acquires securities in tradeable lots. A tradeable lot is the minimum number of securities, usually determined by value, in which it is possible to trade in international markets. The Fund minimises the mismatch between the Fund and the Index by using a mechanical procedure to select securities. The correct combination of securities is dictated by a simple spreadsheet software program which uses the following formula: Deviation = (∑ i d i 2 / (1 + (∑ i w i 2 )) \* 100 Where d i is the difference (in decimal terms) between the Fund weight and the Index weight in security i and w i is the weight (in decimal terms) of security i in the Index. When the Fund perfectly matches the structure of the Index all the d i are equal to zero and the deviation of the Fund from the index is 0%. 21.The Applicant uses this deviation measure to identify the securities and determine the number of securities that are required to minimise fund deviation from the Index, having regard to minimum parcel and transaction cost restraints. The Fund buys the securities identified by the spreadsheet as soon as it is practicable to effect a trade in the particular market on the next day on which the market is opened. The main constraint for not purchasing stock in a company is the tradeable lot size for the stock of that company. This arises where there is insufficient funds allocated to the purchase of that stock from the funds available for investment. It should also be noted that if insufficient funds are available to allocate across all stocks, subsequent funds will be applied to the purchase of stocks not purchased previously. This is done in accordance with a mechanical process which enables the entire Index to be tracked and not just a portion of the Index. 22.The same methodology for minimising any deviation from the Index is applied to minimise any deviations arising where any securities are transferred to any unitholder to fund a redemption or where any securities are sold in order to fund a redemption in cash. Rebalancing occurs automatically and immediately as a result of the application of the formula used to minimise deviations. Upon a request for a redemption, the automatic procedure selects the securities that are to be sold or transferred to fund the redemption while at the same time minimising any deviation from the Index. The MSCI World Index 23.The MSCI World Index currently comprises approximately 1500 securities in 22 countries. The company exposures are predominantly in the form of ordinary shares, but other types of equity securities do appear in the index. The MSCI World Index is constructed by MSCI by an amalgamation of the individual country indices. 24.The MSCI selection criteria are to: •Define the “Market”. Data is collected to accurately measure the market capitalisation of each country. The assessed market capitalisation is then adjusted to remove double counting effects and all non-domiciled companies. Companies with significant cross-ownership are screened to avoid overstating a country’s true market capitalisation. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 45 •Capture 60 percent of market capitalisation of the country across all industry groupings. Once a country’s market capitalisation has been estimated, the size of the industry segment capitalisations is targeted with the aim of capturing 60 percent of the market’s exposure to each industry class. •Select the most liquid securities within each industry. •Select companies with a sufficient level of freely-tradeable equity securities. •Avoid cross-ownership. •Include companies in the index at their full market capitalisation weights (including shareholdings held by governments or which are otherwise not freely-tradeable). MSCI did recently alter their construction methodology to allow a company weighting of less than that implied by market capitalisation in very special circumstances. This would be in those cases where a large privatisation is announced, but the free float is only a very small portion of the market capitalisation. 25.MSCI changes its indices for two reasons - structural and market driven: •Structural changes reflect the evolution of a market, with respect to industry structure or regulations. Industry restructurings take place every twelve to twenty-four months for each country. Structural changes can only take place on the first day of each quarter, and will involve additions and deletions. •Market driven changes consist of new issues, mergers and acquisitions, spin- offs, bankruptcies and so on. These changes are announced and implemented as they occur. 26.In constructing the MSCI World Index, MSCI adopts a consistent selection methodology which does not involve any attempt to predict or take account of: •any likely change in value of a company’s securities; or •whether a company is likely to be profitable or unprofitable; or •whether a company is likely to exhibit changes in capital value. 27.The MSCI methodology is directed solely towards achieving a representative index by focusing on adequate coverage of all relevant industry sectors, liquidity of the relevant securities, “free float” of the relevant securities and avoidance of cross ownership situations. Disposal of units by unitholders 28.A unitholder is only able to dispose of its units by redeeming them. A unitholder may redeem units subject to the conditions in clause 8 of the Trust Deed. Clause 8 requires redemptions to be for amounts of at least $10,000 or all of a Member’s units and no Member is to be left with less than $100,000 worth of units. The Manager may also suspend redemptions in the limited circumstances as noted earlier. The redemption can be in the form of cash and/or cash equivalents and/or securities. However, redemptions in securities is the exception rather than the norm and depends on the unitholder making a request to receive securities instead of cash and the approval of the Manager. The Manager does not exercise this discretion with a view to increasing the performance of the Fund in any way. Generally, redemption will be made from the cash pool and if there is insufficient cash, securities will be realised in order to fund the redemption. 29. Clause 8.3.2 of the Trust Deed provides: Every Benefit payable under ... clause 8.3 shall be determined by multiplying the Redemption Price calculated on the date of acceptance by the Manager by the number of Units redeemed and become payable to the Member not later than ten (10) Business Days following the date on which the Manager receives the Benefit request or on any later redemption date requested by the Member. 30.Redemption Price is defined in Clause 3 of the Trust Deed to mean the Current Unit Value less the Exit Fee. 31.Current Unit Value is defined in Clause 3 of the Trust Deed as: On any date an amount that is arrived at by dividing the Current Fund Value by the number of Units on issue on such date... IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 46 32.The Current Fund Value is defined in Clause 3 of the Trust Deed as: The amount calculated by adding at any time when a valuation is required in relation to the Fund: (a)the total of the market value of all Cash, Units in the AMP Investment’s World Index Fund and investments of the Fund... (b)the income of the Fund due but not yet received; and (c)any other amounts which in the opinion of the Manager, should be included for the purposes of making a fair and reasonable determination of the value of the Fund having due regard to duly accepted accounting practice and accounting principles from time to time; and deducting therefrom such amounts- (d)as are required to meet liabilities properly attributable to the Fund (actual or contingent and not otherwise allowed for in determining the value of any asset) to the extent that the Manager has decided that provision should be made in the accounts of the Plan; (e)as represent Administration Expenses payable by the Trustee or the Manager; and (f)which, in the opinion of the Manager, should be included for the purpose of making a fair and reasonable determination of the current value of the Fund having due regard to generally accepted accounting practice and accounting principles current from time to time. 33.Clause 3 of the Trust Deed provides that Market Value in relation to Constituent Company Securities in the Index means: the last sale price of that security on its home stock exchange at any relevant time (provided that the last sale price is the same as or higher than the then current buy price and lower that the current sell price. In the event that the last sale price is lower than the then current buy price, then the market value is the then current buy price and in the event that the last sale price is higher that the current sell price then the market value is the current sell price). 34.Exit Fee is defined in Clause 3 of the Trust Deed to mean: ... such sum, if any, as the Manager in its absolute discretion may determine (either generally or in relation to a particular Benefit) to be a fair fee payable in relation to the relevant Benefit to provide for the likely per Unit cost of realising Assets to meet that Benefit, having regard to the Manager’s estimate of the aggregate of all costs, charges, expenses, disbursements, commissions, brokerage and other usual fees which would be likely to be incurred in respect of the sale or disposal of Assets on the date of calculation of the Redemption Price if Assets to fund a Unit’s Redemption Price were sold or disposed of on such date.

The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 5 August 1999 to 31 July 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 5th day of August 1999. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 99/11 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited as Trustee of the AMP Superannuation Tracker Fund, IRD number 71-325-547. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BD 2, EE 1, and EF 2. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the redemption of Units in the AMP Superannuation Tracker Fund (“the Fund”) by investors who receive securities for their redemption, and those shares are trading stock or revenue account property of that investor. The material details of the Arrangement are as follows. 1.The Fund is a registered superannuation scheme under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. It was established pursuant to a Deed of Trust dated 10 February 1999 (the “Trust Deed”). 2.The Fund is a passive or index investor and is required to hold a portfolio of shares and other notes and options (the “securities”) that correspond to the composition and weighting of an index called the Russell/Ord Minnett Tradeable Index TM (“the Index”). The Index is determined according to the methodology set out below. 3.The term “Index” is defined in the Trust Deed as: means the index of securities known as the Russell/Ord Minnett Tradeable IndexTM or such other index of securities agreed by the Manager and the Trustee from time to time. However, this Ruling only concerns the investments in the Russell/Ord Minnett Tradeable Index TM and no other index. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 48 4.The Fund is required to buy and sell securities as necessary to ensure that its portfolio continues to correspond as near as practicably possible to the Index. Such buying and selling is not motivated by any intention to derive a profit or gain from such sales. The sole purpose of the Fund is to have a portfolio which continues to track the Index as near as practicably possible, irrespective of whether the sale of securities will give rise to a profit or loss. 5.The Fund only invests in the securities that make up the Index and in Cash as described below. 6.Clauses 5.2.2 and 5.2.5 of the Trust Deed provide that: 5.2.2Subject to clauses 4.7 and 5.2.5, the Trustee shall not invest in any investment other than: 5.2.2.1 Constituent Company Securities which cause the Fund to hold such securities as near as practicably possible to their weightings in the Index; or 5.2.2.2 Any Asset which (i)was acquired and is held under a bona fide opinion that it is authorised by clause 5.2.2.1 or 5.2.5; or (ii)was acquired inadvertently without recognition of its non- complying nature; or (iii)was distributed to or received by the Fund as a result of holding an Asset of the Fund; provided that the Asset is disposed of or the non-compliance is otherwise remedied to the satisfaction of the Trustee as soon as practicably possible but no later than 30 Business Days, or such longer period as the Trustee may prescribe, after the non-compliance is discovered and reported to the Trustee. The Manager shall report to the Trustee when it is discovered that any Asset is within the category described in this clause 5.2.2.2 and shall dispose of any such Asset. ... 5.2.5The Trustee may maintain or invest in Cash in any amount representing up to five percent (5%) of the Current Fund Value at any time, PROVIDED THAT the investment in Cash shall only be used to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund and to reduce the number of transactions required to be made or to facilitate redemptions from time to time, but may not be used by the Manager or the Trustee to increase the performance of the Fund by maximising the holding of securities considered to be likely to give a high return or minimising the holding of securities considered likely to give a low return. 7.“Cash” is defined in the Trust Deed to: \[include\] deposits, or negotiable instruments, in each case having maturities which are not later than the times at which the proceeds of realisation thereof are expected to be required, and on which there is full indefeasible liability of: (a)a New Zealand registered bank (having the meaning given to that term by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989) approved by the Manager for the purpose; or (b)the New Zealand Government. 8.Contributions to the Fund are made in the form of constituent company securities or contract notes for them, or with the approval of the Manager, Cash or AMP Investments’ Tracker Fund units (which will immediately be converted into constituent company securities). However, the Fund will primarily accept contributions in the form of constituent company securities. 9.Cash may be accepted in the following circumstances: (a)where there is a contemporaneous redemption against which the contribution can be netted off by receiving Cash into the Fund and then paying it out on the redemption; or (b)to the extent the application cannot be made in securities due to uneven parcel sizes provided the Cash pool remains below 5% and, except where the Cash is committed to fund an obligation that was known at the time of receipt of the subscription, the Cash is converted to constituent company securities as soon as practicably possible; or (c)in applications of less than $50,000, provided the Cash pool remains below 5% and, except where the Cash is committed to fund an obligation that was known at the time of receipt of the subscription, the Cash is converted to constituent company securities as soon as practicably possible. 10.Subscriptions to the Fund are primarily made by way of parcels of securities that ensure that the Fund continues to match the weighting and composition of the Index as near as practicably possible. Subscribers may purchase a parcel of such securities through AMP Investment Management (NZ) Limited who will Act as an agent of the subscriber pursuant to an agency agreement. Alternatively, the subscribers may purchase the parcel of securities necessary for investment in the Fund through other intermediaries such as brokers or financial advisors. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 49 11.The Trustee of the Fund is The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited. 12.The Manager of the Fund is AMP Investment Management (N.Z.) Limited (“the Manager”), a wholly owned subsidiary of AMP Limited. Initial subscriptions are made through the Manager. 13.The Index is calculated and compiled by Frank Russell and Ord Minnett. Management of the Index is overseen by an independent advisory board. Neither the Fund nor the Manager (or any associate of the Fund or the Manager) has any influence over the rules of the Index. In addition, there is no arrangement, and will be no arrangement, with Frank Russell or Ord Minnett which influences the compilation of the Index. Methodology for calculating the Index 14.The following predetermined rules apply for calculating and maintaining the Index. 15.The Index is intended to form a benchmark for investment performance of active managers and to serve as a workable basis for a passive New Zealand index fund. 16.The criteria for an index to fill either of these roles are: •Replicability. All securities included in the index must be sufficiently liquid to allow reasonably sized positions in the benchmark portfolio to be bought and sold freely at any time. •Representativeness. A benchmark index must cover as wide a proportion of the investable market as possible. •Stability. The benchmark portfolio must be one which managers can buy and hold without undue trading activity. 17.The most commonly used benchmark for New Zealand equities is the NZSE40 index, but it includes a number of illiquid issues and its composition is changed frequently for small stocks. The NZSE10 index avoids these problems but has limited coverage. 18.The Index addresses the issues of liquidity, representativeness and stability. Membership criteria 19.The Index is a market weighted index with a target capitalisation representing at least 95% of a defined pool of tradeable securities listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZSE). Initially there were 25 companies in the Index, with this number subject to revision as necessary to maintain the 95% coverage of tradeable securities. Membership is normally reviewed quarterly. Major listings or delistings may also be included or excluded between quarterly reviews, with changes in the Index as necessary. 20.To be eligible for inclusion in the Index, a company must be listed on the NZSE and must meet and maintain the liquidity requirements described below. 21.Selection of companies for the Index from the tradeable pool is based on size and total coverage requirements, and is normally reviewed quarterly. 22.Where there is erratic movement in the securities price or market turnover, a longer review may occur. If in the initial public offering process there has been a restriction on the allocation of securities, then a company may be added to the Index in stages. Ordinary shares 23.Generally, ordinary shares (or common stock) are included in the Index. However, rights, bonus shares, contributing shares and some convertible preference shares and notes may also be included, if they have the character of ordinary equity. Exclusions 24.Securities traded on the NZSE which are securities in companies but domiciled in other countries are excluded from the Index. Company issued options, warrants, redeemable securities and non-convertible preference shares are generally excluded from the Index. Liquidity requirement 25.Eligibility for inclusion in the Index is normally reviewed quarterly and is based on liquidity as defined by the percentage of market value traded on a weekly basis. Inclusion in the index 26.As at 31 October 1998, the Index was made up of the top 26 companies by market capitalisation in the tradeable pool. 27.At each quarterly review the following criteria are used to select companies for inclusion in the Index: •Number of Companies. The number of companies included in the Index may be adjusted if the coverage of the Index falls below 95% of the tradeable pool. •In addition, major listings or delistings may also be included or excluded between quarterly reviews to maintain coverage at 95% of the tradeable pool. This could lead to a change in the number of companies in the Index at 31 October 1998. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 50 Market value weighting 28.The Index is calculated from security price movements based on the last sale prices in the current period divided by the last sale prices in the previous period, with adjustment for the number of quoted securities as necessary. Adjusted price changes for each company are weighted by their market capitalisation relative to the total market capitalisation of the companies in the Index. Index numbers and base period 29.The index values are stated in the form of an index number which is relative to a base period market value, initialised at 1,000 on 30 September 1996. There are three index values: •A capital index, excluding reinvestment of dividends; •A gross index, with reinvestment of Cash dividends but excluding imputation credits; •An adjusted gross index, with reinvestment of Cash dividends including adjustments for imputation credits. Mergers and take-overs 30.Following a merger or take-over offer in respect of 100% of the issued securities of a company in the Index, the company’s securities will be removed from the Index as soon as practicable after the offeror becomes entitled and announces that it will proceed with compulsory acquisition. 31.If a merger or take-over has less than 100% acceptance, then the company will remain subject to the normal eligibility and inclusion requirements for the Index. Continued inclusion in the Index may nevertheless be reviewed immediately. Capital increases and decreases 32.An increase or decrease in the capital of a company in the Index will be reflected in the market value weighting of the Index, depending on the proportion of the total market value of the index represented by the change. 33.The same rules apply for inclusions and exclusions from the Index on the basis of changed market value. Cash/rights/bonus issues 34.If a company in the Index makes a pro-rata Cash, rights or bonus issue that will alter the number of that company’s quoted securities, then the Index will be adjusted on the ex date to reflect the change. New listings 35.A new listing on the NZSE is not normally eligible for inclusion in the Index for at least three months following the issue of new securities because it must meet the liquidity requirement measured over a three month period. Eligibility will be reviewed at the end of each quarter. 36.However, if a new issue will represent more than 3% of the total market capitalisation of the Index, then the company may be considered for earlier inclusion. Management 37.Management of the Index is overseen by an independent advisory board to assist it in meeting industry requirements as closely as possible and in ensuring all decisions regarding the composition of the Index adhere to the principles set out in the rules without influence from any external party. Adjustments to the Fund 38.Because the objective of the Fund is to track the Index, any adjustments to the Index will necessitate corresponding portfolio adjustments to the assets of the Fund. Disposal of units by unitholders 39.A unitholder is only able to dispose of its units by redeeming them. A unitholder may redeem units subject to the conditions in clause 8 of the Trust Deed. Clause 8 requires redemptions to be for amounts of at least $10,000 or all of a Member’s units and no Member is to be left with less than $100,000 worth of units. The Manager may also suspend redemptions in the limited circumstances as noted at paragraph 48 below. The redemption can be in the form of Cash and/or Cash equivalents and/or securities. 40.Redemptions are usually made through the transfer of constituent company securities, but may, particularly in the circumstances described below, be made in Cash. 41.In the following circumstances a redemption will be made in Cash (where that Cash is not committed for other purposes): (a)where there is a contemporaneous contribution against which the redemption can be matched as described above; or (b)where the Cash is sufficient to fund the redemption in full, that redemption will be made from the Cash pool; and IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 51 (c)where the Cash is not sufficient to fund the redemption in full, the balance of the redemption will be made from securities in the proportions that will ensure that the Fund will continue to match the composition and weighting of the Index as near as practicably possible. 42.Clause 8.3.2 of the Trust Deed provides: Every Benefit payable under ... clause 8.3 shall be determined by multiplying the Redemption Price calculated on the date of acceptance by the Manager by the number of Units redeemed and become payable to the Member not later than ten (10) Business Days following the date on which the Manager receives the Benefit request or on any later redemption date requested by the Member. 43.Redemption Price is defined in Clause 3 of the Trust Deed to mean the Current Unit Value less the Exit Fee. 44.Current Unit Value is defined in Clause 3 of the Trust Deed as: On any date an amount that is arrived at by dividing the Current Fund Value by the number of Units on issue on such date... 45.The Current Fund Value is defined in Clause 3 of the Trust Deed as: The amount calculated by adding as at any time when a valuation is required in relation to the Fund - (a)the total of the market value of all Cash, Units in the AMP Investments’ Tracker Fund and investments of the Fund... (b)the income of the Fund due but not yet received; and (c)any other amounts which, in the opinion of the Manager, should be included for the purposes of making a fair and reasonable determination of the value of the Fund having due regard to duly accepted accounting practice and accounting principles from time to time; and deducting therefrom such amounts- (d)as are required to meet liabilities properly attributable to the Fund (actual or contingent and not otherwise allowed for in determining the value of any asset) to the extent that the Manager has decided that provision should be made in the accounts of the Plan; (e)as represent Administration Expenses payable by the Trustee or the Manager; and (f)which, in the opinion of the Manager, should be included for the purpose of making a fair and reasonable determination of the current value of the Fund having due regard to generally accepted accounting practice and accounting principles current from time to time. 46.Clause 3 of the Trust Deed provides that Market Value in relation to Constituent Company Securities in the Index means: its value as in the Index at any relevant time. 47.Exit Fee is defined in Clause 3 of the Trust Deed to mean: ... such sum, if any, as the Manager in its absolute discretion may determine (either generally or in relation to a particular Benefit) to be a fair fee payable in relation to the relevant Benefit to provide for the likely per Unit cost of realising Assets to meet that Benefit, having regard to the Manager’s estimate of the aggregate of all costs, charges, expenses, disbursements, commissions, brokerage and other usual fees which would be likely to be incurred in respect of the sale or disposal of Assets on the date of calculation of the Redemption Price if Assets to fund a Unit’s Redemption Price were sold or disposed of on such date. 48.With regards the ability to suspend redemptions, the Trust Deed provides under clause 8.5 that the manager can suspend redemptions in certain circumstances up to a period not exceeding 20 business days. This clause states: The Manager, with the consent of the Trustee (which may not be unreasonably withheld), may at any time give notice (a “Suspension Notice”) to Members suspending the operation of all existing and future requests under clause 8.3 relating to the Plan until the earlier of the Manager giving notice to the effect that the relevant Suspension Notice is cancelled or the expiration of 20 Business days from the date of the Suspension Notice or such other period (which may exceed 20 Business Days) that the Manager considers reasonable in the interests of all Members (the “Cancellation Date”), where the Manager in good faith determines that: (i)it is not practicable to pay a benefit due to insufficient Cash in the Plan, and an inability to convert sufficient assets into Cash, to enable the Manager to meet the Benefit payment; or (ii)the Market Value of the Units at the time is not a true reflection of the actual value of the Units, due to: (A)a suspension in trading of any Constituent Company Securities on any exchange; or (B)an exchange on which Constituent Company Securities are traded being closed for a period which in the Manager’s opinion is likely to involve a material change in the market price of the Constituent Company Securities; or (iii)for reasons beyond its reasonable control, the Manager is unable to calculate the Redemption Price; and provided that the period of suspension is no longer than is necessary, according to the Manager’s good faith determination, to accommodate the events referred to in paragraphs (i) to (iii). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 52 49.Suspension of redemptions is likely to be very rare. Clause 8.5 caters for specific circumstances involving unusual market conditions or circumstances that give rise to “administrative difficulty” in complying with the requests for redemptions. It is the process for managing the redemptions (particularly the difficulty thereof) that is likely to give rise to suspensions rather than the market conditions relating to the securities. Also of particular note is clause 8.5(c) which provides that the Manager shall not use its discretion under this clause to increase the performance of the Fund or the returns to any member. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: (a)The Fund operates in accordance with its Trust Deed dated 10 February 1999 (b)The Fund is a registered superannuation scheme under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 (c)The Fund only tracks the Russell/Ord Minnett Tradeable IndexTM (d)Where Cash is distributed on redemption its market value will be its nominal value (e)Where Cash equivalents are distributed on redemption, the value of this distribution will be the market value of these Cash equivalents (f)In determining the market value of a security at any time the last sale price for that security, as quoted on the New Zealand Stock Exchange at that time, shall be used (g)The Manager in determining the Investors’ entitlement to securities on redemption of Units in the Fund under clause 8.3 of the Trust Deed, shall use the market value of those securities at the valuation time (as defined in the Trust Deed) (h)The formula for calculating the “Current Unit Value” as defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed remains unaltered (i)The amounts derived by the Investor from the subsequent sale or disposal of securities received on redeeming Units in the Fund will be gross income of the Investor (j)Investors do not acquire Units in the Fund for the purpose of acquiring securities (k)Units in the Fund are not tradeable on a secondary market. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: The cost of the securities acquired by an investor on redemption of Units in the Fund is the market value of those Units at the valuation time of the Units redeemed less any Cash and/or Cash equivalents received. The market value of the Units redeemed is equal to the Redemption Price of those Units. The cost of a security the investor receives on redemption of Units is the last sale price of that security as listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange at the time the Units are redeemed. The cost of a security acquired by an investor on the redemption of Units is an allowable deduction under section BD 2 and is deductible: •In full in the income year in which the Units are redeemed, if the investor acquires the securities as trading stock for the purpose of section EE 1; and •In accordance with section EF 2, if the investor acquires the securities as revenue account property other than trading stock. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 5 August 1999 to 31 July 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 5th day of August 1999.

The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the issue of fully paid shares (“initial shares”) in Tower to qualifying parent company members (as defined in the Scheme for Conversion (the “Scheme”)) or to the Tower Safe Trust (“the Trust”) on behalf of the qualifying parent company members (and subsequently to the qualifying parent company members). Further the Arrangement is the allocation of subscription rights for partly paid shares (“subscription rights”) to qualifying subsidiary company members (as defined in the Scheme) or to the Trust on behalf of the qualifying subsidiary company members (and subsequently to the qualifying subsidiary company members) entitling them to subscribe for partly paid shares in Tower on favourable terms as part of the demutualisation of Tower and the issue of those partly paid shares to the qualifying subsidiary company members or to the Trust. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.Tower is a mutual life insurer.

Qualifying subsidiary company members will receive subscription rights to Tower shares on favourable terms on the implementation date. Qualifying subsidiary company members may then elect to subscribe, in which case they must also consent to be shareholders of Tower. If the qualifying subsidiary company members exercise the subscription rights, they will be issued shares in Tower on the subscription date, which will be within one month of the implementation date. The favourable subscription terms are: (a)that the new shares are credited as 50% paid at the time of issue, being the subscription date, to the qualifying subsidiary company member; and (b)the outstanding balance of 50% is not payable for two years. 5.The Trust will be established to receive initial shares and subscription rights issued by Tower where any member cannot be identified with sufficient specificity to enable the initial shares and subscription rights to be issued directly to the member. Further, the Trust will receive those subscription rights that a qualifying subsidiary company member has not exercised. The Trust will exercise all the subscription rights allocated to it under the Scheme. The trustee of the Trust will be Tower Safe Limited.

This means that the issue of initial shares and the allocation of the subscription rights and the associated issue of the partly paid shares by Tower: Will not be a “claim” to Tower in its own right. Will not be a “claim” to subsidiaries of Tower whose policyholders receive subscription rights and partly paid shares from Tower. Will not be a “claim” to the Tower Corporation Consolidated Group (“the Group”) or to Tower as the nominated company of the Group. Will not be a “claim” in the hands of the qualifying participants (as defined in the Scheme).

How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: The demutualisation process (being the members of Tower voting to approve the Scheme and the steps that follow, as set out in the Arrangement above, that result in the qualifying parent company members, and qualifying subsidiary company members (“ qualifying participants”) and the Trust accepting the initial shares and subscription rights, the subscription rights being exercised and the qualifying subsidiary company members and the Trust accepting the partly paid shares issued by Tower) will not of itself: IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 62 Be sufficient to constitute a business for the purposes of section CD 3 or the first limb of section CD 4. Mean that the initial shares, the partly paid shares and the subscription rights received by the qualifying participants and the Trust will be acquired for the purpose of sale or other disposition under the second limb of section CD 4. Constitute an undertaking or scheme entered into or devised for the purpose of making a profit under the third limb of section CD 4. Mean that the initial shares, partly paid shares and the subscription rights will be income according to ordinary concepts under section CD 5. Alter the account on which the qualifying participants hold their membership rights. That is the demutualisation process will not, of itself, mean that membership rights held by a qualifying participant on capital account prior to the demutualisation will become a revenue account item as a result of the demutualisation potentially giving rise to gross income under section CD 3, CD 4 or CD 5. Important Note This Ruling sets out how the Commissioner will apply the specified Taxation Laws in relation to the demutualisation process itself and should not be taken, in any way, as a ruling on: whether any income arising from the conversion of the membership rights for initial shares, partly paid shares and subscription rights in Tower is gross income which is taxable; or whether any proceeds from the sale of any initial shares and partly paid shares in Tower is gross income which is taxable. The answer to either of the above issues will depend on the facts of any particular case. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from the date of signing until 1 October 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 10th day of September 1999. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 99/20 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Names of the Persons who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Tower Limited (formerly Tower Corporation) (“Tower”), IRD number 45-402-460, and Tower Safe Limited, IRD number 70-891-115. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections HH 1, HH3, HH 4, and HH 6 and the definitions of “beneficiary income”, “dividend”, “qualifying trust”, “settlor”, “trustee income”, and “unit trust” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and sections 61 and 63 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the issue of fully paid shares (“initial shares”) and subscription rights for partly paid shares (“subscription rights”) in Tower to the Tower Safe Trust (“the Trust”) on behalf of the unconfirmed participants in exchange for their membership and other rights, the exercise of the subscription rights by the Trust and the subsequent issue of partly paid shares in Tower to the Trust, any accretions to the trust fund, the receipt of any income in respect of the trust fund, and subsequent distributions by the Trust in accordance with the trust deed to the Trust’s beneficiaries. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.Tower is a mutual life insurer. It will demutualise by issuing shares and subscription rights in itself to its Members (as defined in the Tower Corporation Bylaws) in exchange for the extinguishment of their membership rights. 2.Tower will convert to a company registered under the Companies Act 1993 by way of the Scheme for Conversion (the “Scheme”) in accordance with the provisions of Part IV of the Tower Corporation Act 1990. Tower will be known as Tower Limited from the time of its conversion. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 63 3.The allocation of initial shares and subscription rights in Tower will be to members who were members of Tower at 9:00pm on 8 December 1997 and who meet the qualifying rules. The allocation of the initial shares and the subscription rights received by each member will be determined by formulae that have been approved as part of the Scheme approval. 4.Qualifying parent company members will be issued with initial shares in Tower on the implementation date. Qualifying subsidiary company members will receive subscription rights to Tower shares on favourable terms on the implementation date. Qualifying subsidiary company members may then elect to subscribe, in which case they must also consent to be shareholders of Tower. If the qualifying subsidiary company members exercise the subscription rights, they will be issued shares in Tower on the subscription date, which will be within one month of the implementation date. The favourable subscription terms are: (a)that the new shares are credited as 50% paid at the time of issue, being the subscription date, to the qualifying subsidiary company member; and (b)the outstanding balance of 50% is not payable for two years. 5.The Trust will be established to receive initial shares and subscription rights issued by Tower where any member cannot be identified with sufficient specificity to enable the initial shares and subscription rights to be issued directly to the member. Further, the Trust will receive those subscription rights that a qualifying subsidiary company member has not exercised. The Trust will exercise all the subscription rights allocated to it under the Scheme. The trustee of the Trust will be Tower Safe Limited. On appropriate verification, a distribution will be made to the confirmed participant (as defined in the trust deed), as beneficiary of the Trust. 6.Tower will settle the Trust with a settlement of $100. The Trust will be formed for a maximum period of 80 years with a provision to enable the Trust to be brought to an end within that period. The Trust’s objects will primarily be to provide for the beneficiaries who are the unconfirmed participants (as defined in the trust deed) who will be capital beneficiaries only. Tower shareholders (as defined in the trust deed) will also be included as an object of the Trust but only to enable any unclaimed shares or their proceeds to be distributed to Tower shareholders on the winding up of the Trust and to receive distributions, pursuant to clause 9 of the draft trust deed, after an “appropriate period” has elapsed since the commencement date. 7.The “trust fund” (as defined in the trust deed) includes the initial and partly paid shares issued by Tower. The initial and partly paid shares and the other assets of the Trust will be pooled. Shares will not be specifically associated with any particular unconfirmed participant. This is for ease of administration. The Trust will receive any dividends or other amounts distributed by Tower in respect of the shares held as part of the trust fund. 8.The Trustee has investment powers to hold shares or other securities or rights issued by or in Tower, invest in any Tower fund and hold cash or other funds in deposits with any bank in New Zealand or in the acquisition of New Zealand government stock, pursuant to clause 14 of the trust deed. 9.The Trustee will be entitled to exercise voting rights in respect of the shares held for the benefit of the unconfirmed participants. 10.The income of the Trust will only be available to pay trust expenses and any excess income (including current year income) will otherwise be accumulated by the Trustee to hold as an addition to the capital share of the capital beneficiaries. Any accumulated income will be expressly stated to be capital and thus available for distribution to the capital beneficiaries. 11.The Trustee will have sufficient powers to enable it to achieve the objects of the Trust, i.e. to make distributions to the unconfirmed participants as they are found and identified. Distributions will be met from the trust fund and will be on a formula basis which takes account of the original shares which the beneficiary would otherwise have been entitled to and a share of the Trust’s tax-paid income (which has been accumulated and added to the capital of the trust fund) based on those shares. 12.The Trustee must make the distributions on a fair and equitable basis pursuant to the objects of the trust deed. The Trustee may provide a beneficiary with the cash equivalent of the value of Tower shares and other assets that they would otherwise receive. Beneficiaries will not be able to elect a cash option. 13.The Scheme does not provide for an allocation of Tower shares to non-members other than through the public float. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 64 14.A prospectus has been issued in both New Zealand and Australia seeking new capital. 15.It is also intended that Tower’s shares be listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange and Australian Stock Exchange. 16.The High Court approved the Scheme on 15 June 1999. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)Tower in transferring the initial shares, subscription rights and the partly paid shares to the Trust does not do so as a nominee for the unconfirmed participants. b)All of Tower Safe Limited’s obligations (as trustee) in respect of the trustee’s income tax liability have been satisfied. c)No amount of gross income derived by the trustee will vest in a beneficiary of the Trust within the income year the amount is derived by the trustee or be paid or applied to or for the benefit of a beneficiary during or within six months after the end of the income year in which the amount was derived by the trustee. d)No investments made by the trustee pursuant to the trust deed with an amount of gross income derived by the trustee during an income year will vest in a beneficiary of the Trust within the income year that amount is derived by the trustee or be paid or applied to or for the benefit of a beneficiary during or within six months after the end of the income year in which that amount was derived by the trustee. e)The trustee will pay all income tax liabilities at the trustee rate of income tax on all gross income derived by the trustee during any income year. f)The terms of the trust deed are not materially different from the draft trust deed submitted to the High Court on 18 September 1998 and received by the Rulings Unit on 9 October 1998. g)The Scheme is not materially different from that submitted to the High Court on 18 September 1998 and provided to the Rulings Unit on 9 October 1998. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: Section HE 1 does not apply to the Trust, as the Trust is not a “unit trust” as defined in section OB 1. Distributions by the Trust to the beneficiaries of the Trust will not be a “dividend”. The Trust is a “qualifying trust” as defined in section OB 1. Tower is the settlor of the Trust and the unconfirmed participants are not settlors of the Trust, as the term “settlor” is defined in section OB 1. No “trustee income” or “beneficiary income” as defined in section OB 1 arises as a result of the issue of the initial and partly paid shares in Tower and subscription rights in Tower to the Trust. When the trustee derives gross income in any particular income year, that income is not “beneficiary income” as defined in section OB 1 but it is “trustee income” as defined in section OB 1. Sections HH 3(1), HH 3(5) and HH 6(2)(a) apply to all distributions made by the Trust to the beneficiaries of the Trust, and all distributions made by the Trust to the beneficiaries of the Trust will not result in gross income being derived by the beneficiaries pursuant to those sections. Distributions from the Trust to the confirmed participants will not constitute a dutiable gift to any person under section 63 of the Estate &Gift Duties Act 1968, so no gift duty is payable on such distributions from the Trust under section 61 of the Estate &Gift Duties Act 1968. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from the date of signing until 1 October 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 10th day of September 1999. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 65 TAX STATEMENT TO TOWER CORPORATION POLICYHOLDERS This opinion is issued by the Commissioner in order to clarify the income tax consequences arising from the issue of shares in Tower in exchange for the extinguishment of members’ rights in the mutual as part of the demutualisation of Tower Corporation. It is not a Binding Ruling. Under the Scheme for conversion submitted by Tower and approved by the High Court on 15 June 1999- qualifying parent company members will receive fully paid shares at demutualisation; and qualifying subsidiary company members will receive rights to subscribe for partly paid shares immediately following demutualisation as follows: –the partly paid shares will be issued to qualifying subsidiary company members at the same issue price as the other new shares issued post demutualisation - but with half the price already paid as compensation for giving up membership rights –qualifying subsidiary company members will have to pay the remaining half of the price after two years if they elect not to sell them by that time –until the shares have been fully paid up, they will be entitled to dividends and voting entitlements equivalent to 50 percent of all other ordinary shares –the partly paid shares will be listed on the New Zealand and Australian Stock Exchanges during the two years, and may be sold at market price This statement applies to qualifying parent company members of Tower Corporation. There will be no tax consequences for most policyholders upon the receipt of shares on the demutualisation of Tower. In particular, shares received as part of the demutualisation process and the proceeds of the first sale of those shares will not ordinarily generate gross income in the hands of a policyholder if: the policy was taken out for personal or family reasons. This includes the assignee of such a policy where the assignee is a relative or family trust; or the policy was taken out over the life or well being of an employee or business principal of the business (corporate or otherwise); or the policy was taken out to protect personal earnings or business income in the event of disablement or trauma of an individual; or the policy was taken out for the purposes of providing life cover in respect of the life or well-being of a member, or a group of members, of a New Zealand superannuation fund by the trustees of the scheme. The on- distribution of shares by trustees to members will not give rise to taxable income in members’ hands; or the policy is an accident and disability or trauma policy taken out for the purposes of providing a lump sum or non-earnings related payment in the event of the disablement or trauma of an individual. However, there may be tax consequences for these policyholders whose business activities mean that they deal in insurance policies or are otherwise ordinarily taxable on such receipts, or where it is demonstrated that any policyholder acquired shares for the purpose of sale or other disposal. For the purposes of the trading stock valuation rules or for determining any profit on the sale of the shares, the cost price of the shares is their market value at the time they are issued by Tower, or the time of acquisition (in the case of further shares acquired). In addition, if a person acquires further shares with the purpose of resale, any profit on the sale of those shares will be taxable gross income. This statement represents the Commissioner’s opinion in relation to the demutualisation of Tower. This is not a Binding Ruling. It is possible to obtain a formal Binding Ruling from our Adjudication & Rulings business group if individual policyholders are unsure whether, in their specific circumstances, a disposition of Tower shares might generate gross income. A detailed process must be followed, and fees are charged, for obtaining such formal rulings. A booklet on this process can be obtained. Relevant policyholders should note that the treatment of the shares issued will not affect the tax status of the proceeds of any claim paid under a policy. M J Carr National Manager, Corporates 30 September 1999 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 66 TAX STATEMENT TO TOWER CORPORATION MEMBERS WHO ARE SUBSIDIARY COMPANY MEMBERS This opinion is issued by the Commissioner in order to clarify the income tax consequences arising from the receipt of subscription rights and the subsequent issue of partly paid shares in Tower Corporation in exchange for the extinguishment of the subsidiary company members’ rights in the mutual as part of the demutualisation of Tower Corporation.

There will be no tax consequences for most members upon the receipt of subscription rights and the subsequent issue of partly paid shares on the demutualisation of Tower, where payment of the remaining 50 percent of the issue price will be required within two years. In particular, partly paid shares received as part of the demutualisation process and the proceeds of the first sale of those shares will not ordinarily generate taxable gross income in the hands of a member if: the policy was taken out for personal or family reasons.

No tax consequences arise from members having a two-year period to pay the remaining portion of the issue price. In addition, if a person acquires further shares with the purpose of resale, any profit on the sale of those shares will be taxable gross income.

M J Carr National Manager, Corporates 30 September 1999 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 67 SECTION 17 NOTICES – INV-321 Introduction This standard practice statement outlines the procedures Inland Revenue will follow when issuing section 17 notices, and third party information request letters, pursuant to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). Appendix A provides copies of the section 17 notices, and third party information request letter, used. This standard practice statement is effective from 1 October 1999. Generally, where information is publicly available Inland Revenue will not use section 17 and will meet the usual charges, e.g. Land Transfer Office, Companies Office, Quotable Value New Zealand etc. Background Section 17 of the TAA is the legislative authority enabling Inland Revenue to require information and inspect books and documents. Most taxpayers and third parties are willing to cooperate with Inland Revenue requests for information. Some taxpayers, such as banks, while they are willing to cooperate with Inland Revenue, require legal compulsion before they can properly divulge the information. Therefore, it is Inland Revenue practice when initially requesting information, books or documents either not to rely upon the section, or to simply state that the request is made in terms of section 17, e.g. to a bank where the request is made about one of their clients. The reason for this practice is to foster a spirit of fairness, reasonableness, and mutual co-operation with taxpayers and third parties in their dealings with Inland Revenue. This is considered more appropriate than proceeding from the outset with a section 17 notice that refers to the statutory remedies for non-compliance with the terms of the notice. This response is also preferred by the major suppliers of information. STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. The section 17 notice makes reference to statutory consequences of non-compliance and includes a copy of section 17 in full. If not complied with, a section 17 notice will result in Inland Revenue invoking the statutory remedies as the next step in obtaining the information being sought. Considerations when issuing section 17 notices Inland Revenue will have considered the following prior to issuing section 17 notices: the reason for requiring the information - the request will be bona fide, and the information required will be necessary, or relevant; the impact of the request on the suppliers of information - Inland Revenue will be reasonable in relation to the quantity and/or timeliness for providing the information where there is genuine difficulty in obtaining and/or providing that information; the disputes resolution process - this process relies on full and prompt disclosure by both the Commissioner and the disputant; and the intention to ensure compliance with the notice - Inland Revenue will invoke the statutory remedies in the event of non- compliance. Procedures Generally, a section 17 notice will only be issued following a failure to provide information previously requested, or where specific issues have been identified and an attempt to resolve those issues has failed. Where it is considered necessary to issue a section 17 notice Inland Revenue will use the following procedures: 1.where an investigation is stalled by non- supply of information (refer notice “A”) or, has identified specific issues requiring resolution (refer notice “B”) a section 17 notice may be issued. The timing of issue will be determined on a case by case basis; 2.where the taxpayer or other entity contacts Inland Revenue and modification of the notice is agreed it will be recorded in writing (refer notice “C”); 3.where Inland Revenue considers a taxpayer has not complied with a section 17 notice an application for a court order, for compliance with the section 17 notice, may be made. Prosecution action may also be taken; 4.where non-compliance occurs a follow up notice will be issued stating that the section 17 notice has not been complied with, court orders are being sought and/or prosecution action is being considered (refer notice “D”); and 5.where prosecution action is taken it may be in tandem with, before or after, seeking a court order, but will not be prior to the issue of a follow up notice (refer notice “D”). Where compliance occurs subsequent to the issue of a follow up notice prosecution action may still proceed, e.g. where a pattern of late response emerges. In following the above process every attempt will be made to maintain contact with the taxpayer so as to provide an opportunity for concerns to be raised. Where requests are made to persons other than the taxpayer the procedure usually begins with a letter (refer letter “E”). It may follow a discussion. Where this request is not complied with the above process, to obtain the information, is commenced. Note:Inland Revenue will not reissue section 17 notices in a different format. Once a section 17 notice has not been complied with the offence is committed and prosecution action, if taken, must be commenced within 6 months of the offence. Standard Wording of Notices and Letters The following minimum content will be included in letters and section 17 notices: the notice/letter will be typed on Inland Revenue letterhead. In cases where it is faxed it will still be on letterhead; a section 17 notice will include (refer notices “A” and “B”); 1.a brief background to the requisition, 2.a statement as to why the requisition is made, 3.reference to the legal authority for collecting the information, 4.a statement that the information required is considered necessary or relevant for a proper purpose, 5.a statement that is as specific as the circumstances allow, 6.an address, time and date for collection which is reasonable relative to the information type and background to the requisition, 7.an offer of assistance or flexibility to enable compliance (i.e. to modify, collection time, collection place, collection date, requisition content) \[Note: any change to the date for compliance must be agreed before expiration of the original date. Beyond this a breach has occurred and an extension of time cannot be given\], 8.a reference to the possible consequences of non-compliance including any defence available, 9.the date of issue of the notice and a copy of section 17, and 10.signature and position of officer of Inland Revenue. the notice may also include; 1.an additional request for identification of items, if any, for which legal privilege is claimed, and 2.a requirement that any written information or particulars furnished be verified by statutory declaration. a follow up notice will include; 1.a statement that to Inland Revenue’s knowledge compliance has not occurred, 2.a statement as to the actions being considered, 3.a list of offences committed, 4.an indication of the maximum penalties applicable to each offence, and 5.copies of the offence sections including any defence section \[i.e. section 143(2), section 143A(2)\]. the first request to a person other than the taxpayer will refer to section 17 and include a date by which compliance should occur. (refer letter “E”). This letter is not to be use to request information that is publicly available. This Standard Practice Statement was signed by me on 1 October 1999.

This Standard Practice Statement, in conjunction with SPS INV 490, states the Commissioner’s operational practice when taxpayers wish to make adjustments to tax returns. Application This Standard Practice Statement applies to taxes and duties payable under a tax law from 1st December 1999, and to adjustments made on or after this date, regardless of the return period when the error occurred. These practices do not apply to assessments issued under the Child Support Act 1991 or to ACC assessments, except to the extent that the ACC adjustment occurs as a result of an income tax change. Definitions Credit adjustment: an adjustment that results in a reduced amount payable, increases a net loss, or increases a refund. Debit adjustment: an adjustment that results in an increase in the amount payable, reduces the amount of a refund or reduces a net loss. Response period: the response period referred to in this SPS is the two-month period starting on the date of issue of a notice of assessment or determination of loss. For GST purposes the response period is the two-month period commencing the day after the last day for filing the GST return. Calculation of the tax effect of an adjustment Income tax The tax effect of an item in a return period is calculated using the taxpayer’s marginal tax rates for the return period in which the error arose, not the period in which it is subsequently corrected. If a taxpayer has no tax to pay in the period in which the error arose, the rate of tax that applies is the lowest marginal rate that would apply to the return period if the taxpayer did have tax to pay. Other taxes The tax effect of an item in a return period is calculated by multiplying the value of the item adjusted by the applicable rate of tax. For example the amount of an FBT adjustment is calculated by multiplying the value of the benefit by 49%. The total tax effect of an adjustment is calculated by adding the tax effect of all return periods affected by the item adjusted. Correcting small errors in Income tax and Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) returns In many instances the costs to the taxpayer and Inland Revenue in correcting small errors is significant in relation to the tax effect of the adjustment, and in some cases may prove a deterrent to taxpayers correcting errors. As a solution to this problem, Inland Revenue will now allow small errors in Income tax and FBT returns to be corrected in the following return period where the income tax or FBT effect of the adjustment or adjustments is $500 or less per return period. In designing this practice, Inland Revenue considered the Care and Management provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 charges the Commissioner with the care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts. Subsection 3 of that section states: In collecting the taxes committed to the Commissioner’s charge, and notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts, it is the duty of the Commissioner to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law having regard to - (a)The resources available to the Commissioner; and (b)The importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts; and (c)The compliance costs incurred by taxpayers. The Commissioner also used the Care and Management provisions in SPS INV-490, to implement a practice whereby registered persons are able to self-correct GST errors in a subsequent GST return. (See TIB Volume Ten No.6 (June 1998), and TIB Volume Eleven No.2 (February 1999). The extension of self-correction of small errors to income tax and FBT returns is consistent with the principles of that practice. Application of self-correction Self-correction is only practicable for revenues where there is no impact on unrelated taxpayers, as errors in certain tax returns can result in the need for consequential adjustments to third party’s returns. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 74 (e.g. An error in PAYE deductions accounted for may lead to a consequential adjustment to a recipient’s tax return). This has led Inland Revenue to limit the application of self- correction to income tax, FBT and GST. However, self-correction also caters to those situations where one adjustment affects related taxpayers. This means that self- correction can be made to an income tax return filed by a partnership (for example), with the resulting adjustments to the partners’ tax returns. Because the tax affairs of those taxpayers who receive only source deduction payments (i.e. salary or wages) are simple, self correction does not apply to IR 5 tax returns, or (from 1 April 1999), income statements. Income tax and annual FBT returns are for a full year, and self-correction will result in a deferral of tax for 12 months or more. Therefore income tax and annual FBT errors can only be corrected in the immediately succeeding return if it has not already been filed when the error is detected For example, errors in a 1998 tax return can only be self-corrected in the 1999 year. Quarterly FBT returns may be self corrected in a following return period if the correction is made when it is found, and within twelve months of the period in which the error arose. Compliance and penalties provisions The implementation of the Compliance and Penalties regime in 1997 included universal interest to provide compensation for tax that has been under or over- paid. This was intended, along with the other changes introduced, to encourage voluntary compliance, i.e. taxpayers had greater incentive to get things right first time. Allowing for self- correction in a following period will mean that interest is not charged in these circumstances, thus alleviating a potential barrier to compliance. Inland Revenue reserves the right to impose shortfall penalties and assess the correct tax position in the year in which the error arose if: we believe the taxpayer’s original tax position was not a genuine mistake; or the taxpayer repeatedly makes the same or similar mistake and self-corrects; or the practice is used to create an unwarranted advantage. Where errors are detected during an audit or investigation the taxpayer will only be allowed to self-correct errors in the following return if the total tax effect of the error or errors is $500 or less per return period, and the immediately following return has not already been filed. However, taxpayers will be allowed to self-correct errors that are disclosed at the time an audit is commenced (subject to the conditions above). In view of the considerations above, a requirement of self-correction is that sufficient records must be kept to show: The return period the error occurred The amount of tax involved The nature of the error The return period correction was made These records must be readily available for review by Inland Revenue staff. General Rule for adjustments to tax returns over the telephone Inland Revenue will consider telephone requests for : a)Changes to PAYE returns (IR 66N, IR 66W, IR 68P, IR 345, IR 346, IR 348, IR 349), b)Changes to Non-Resident Withholding tax and Approved Issuer Levy returns (IR 67P, IR 67S), c)Changes to Resident Withholding (IR 15P, IR 15S), d)Changes to Non-resident individual income tax returns (IR 3NR), e)Transposition of numbers and arithmetical errors in all returns, f)Changes to the rebates for an IR 3 or IR 5 returns, (excluding the donations rebate), g)Changes to Family Assistance, h)Adjustments where the tax effect falls within the criteria allowed for under self-correction. Other credit adjustments Small errors in FBT, income tax and GST returns may be self-corrected in a following period, subject to the conditions specified above and in SPS INV 490. Employer Monthly schedules may be amended by telephoning or by sending an Employer monthly schedule amendments form (IR 344) to correct the error in the period in which it arose. All other types of credit adjustment must be made in writing. Where the total tax effect of the adjustment is $2,000 or more, a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) on the prescribed form must be issued. The tax effect of an adjustment is calculated by adding the tax effect of all tax return periods affected by the item adjusted. For example, an omitted item of expenditure has an income tax effect of $1650 and a GST effect of $555. As the total tax effect of the adjustment is greater than $2,000, a Notice of Proposed Adjustment is required. The only exception to this requirement is if the error has arisen because of a simple arithmetical or transposition error. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 75 The Commissioner’s practice applying to the content standards for Notices of Proposed Adjustment can be found in Standard Practice Statement INV 150, published in TIB Volume 11, No.6 (July 1999). A NOPA must be issued where the issue involves a contestable interpretation of tax law, regardless of the tax effect of the adjustment, even if the tax effect is $500 or less. If the adjustment is being requested after the expiry of the applicable response period, an explanation must be included as to why the request should be accepted late, unless it relates to a simple arithmetical or transposition error. If the amount of the adjustment is less than $2,000, use of the NOPA form is optional, however all NOPAs are given priority by Inland Revenue. If an informal request for an adjustment has been made, and the issue has not been resolved within the applicable initial response period, a NOPA should be issued to protect the taxpayers right to further challenge the item in contention. Inland Revenue will no longer accept amended tax returns for any credit adjustments. Other debit adjustments Small errors in FBT, income tax and GST tax returns may be self-corrected in a following period, subject to the conditions specified above and in SPS INV 490. Employer Monthly schedules may be amended by telephoning or by sending an Employer monthly schedule amendmentform (IR 344). In addition to those specified in the General rule above, debit adjustments may be made to IR3, IR 3NR, GST and FBT returns by telephone or in writing. Adjustments to other tax returns must be requested in writing. Use of the NOPA form for these adjustments is optional, however all NOPAs are given priority. If an informal request for an adjustment has been made, and the issue has not been resolved within the applicable initial response period, a NOPA should be issued to protect the taxpayers right to further challenge the item in contention.. Any debit adjustments requested by way of Notice of Proposed Adjustment will be treated as voluntary disclosure for the purposes of consideration of penalties. Inland Revenue will not accept amended tax returns for any debit adjustment. Summary 1.Taxpayers may self-correct minor errors in income tax, FBT and GST returns, subject to the conditions outlined above and in Inland Revenue Standard Practice Statement INV 490. 2.Requests for correction of errors such as the transposition of numbers, or arithmetical mistakes may be made by telephone or in writing. 3.Adjustments that result in an increase in tax to pay, reduction of a refund or a decrease in the amount of net loss may be requested by telephone or in writing. Those that are requested on the prescribed Notice of Proposed Adjustment form will be given priority consideration. 4.In general. requests for adjustment where the tax effect is a decrease in tax to pay must be made in writing. Where the proposed adjustment has a tax effect of $2,000 or more, or where the issue involves contestable interpretation of tax law, the request must be made on the prescribed Notice of Proposed Adjustment form unless it is correcting a simple arithmetical or transposition error. 5.Amended or ‘second’ tax returns will no longer be accepted.

Facts The Disputant is a construction company, which operates from the basement of the Directors’ residence. Mr D is the director of the company with 999 shares, his wife holding the remaining share. The Disputant sought to deduct entertainment expenses, which included local and overseas expenditure. The Disputant also sought to apportion various home related expenditure - deductions of 50% of the rates assessment, 80% of the power bills and 80% of the toll calls. The Commissioner disallowed the entertainment deductions claimed on the basis that the Disputant had not established sufficient nexus between the entertainment expenditure and its business income. The Commissioner also contended that Mr & Mrs D ( the two directors) were employees of the company as they received small salaries as shown in the company tax returns and deducted ACC from those salaries. A company car was also assessed for FBT and GST as the Commissioner considered that they were employees and the car was available for private use. Decision Overseas Expenses Judge Willy found that there was insufficient evidence to show that the expenses incurred on the overseas trip were in the course of earning assessable income and confirmed the Commissioner’s assessment. Local Entertainment Expenses Judge Willy found that the records kept by the company were insufficient to support a claim that local entertainment expenses were incurred in the course of producing assessable income. Mr D also acknowledged that most of the money was spent on liquor and food for himself and his wife. Rates Judge Willy found on the evidence that a deduction of 50% of the rates assessment was a reasonable apportionment, as a large garage, office, storage area and toilet & shower was devoted to business use. Electricity Judge Willy also found on the evidence that most of the power went into heating hot water used by the Disputant’s employees and allowed the claim of an 80% deduction of the power bills. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 77 Telephone Judge Willy found that the company’s office work was done by Mr D’s daughter in Dunedin and the amounts claimed for tolls were reasonable and sufficiently documented for the purposes of s22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Employer/Employee Status Judge Willy found on the evidence that there was no written employment contract between the company and (the directors) Mr & Mrs D. Mrs D did work for the company but was also employed by a third party who paid her wages and deducted PAYE. The TRA rejected the submissions made on behalf of the objectors that a reconstruction could have been made by the respondent using the agency provisions in sections 266 to 273 of the Act. The reconstruction as made by the Commissioner has been upheld by the Court of Appeal and the alternative approaches suggested by counsel are hypothetical. Further, counsel for the objectors submitted that section 99 was not applicable and that the normal assessment provisions were adequate to deal with the situation. The TRA rejected that submission, stating that the Court of Appeal has found that section 99 is applicable. The TRA discussed the submission made by counsel for the objectors that those individuals were incorrectly assessed on an amount equal to the full administration fee and should have been assessed on 77.5% of the net profits of the trading company which they actually received and kept. This issue has also been dealt with by the Court of Appeal and the assessments of 100% to the managers were confirmed. The TRA heard submissions on the statute bar argument but held that the Court of Appeal has already determined that issue. Counsel for the individuals dealt with the additional tax aspect of the present assessments, which was dealt with by Blanchard J in Miller and Ors v CIR at 13,974. The TRA considered that there was no right of objection in respect of the additional tax and accordingly it had no jurisdiction to direct a new due date for the payment of additional tax. However, the TRA observed that the relevant findings in Withey & Anor v CIR 18 NZTC 13,606 must be applied across the board to all taxpayers and the respondent had agreed to do so in this case. His Honour also held that the company was not making source deduction payments on the $100 a week drawn on account of the profits by Mr D and therefore Mr & Mrs D could not have been employees of the company. Fringe Benefit Tax & GST His Honour found that Mr & Mrs D regularly used the motor vehicle to run personal errands. They did not keep a log book and had no evidence to show how expenses were divided between business and private use. The FBT and GST assessments were cancelled on the grounds that it could not be established on the facts that Mr & Mrs D were employees of the company.

Decision Number 021/99 Decision date:21 September 1999 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Tax avoidance Summary The Taxation Review Authority confirmed the Commissioner’s assessments. Facts This hearing was consequential to leave reserved in the earlier decision of 16 April 1998 reported as Case T52. That decision is incorporated into this decision. Since then the Taxation Review Authority has had the benefit of the Court of Appeal decision on the tax avoidance template, namely, Miller v CIR; Managed Fashions Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,961 (CA). Decision There is considerable discussion of the Track C and D assessment approaches however the comments are obiter as neither have been used as the assessment approach in this particular case. The TRA rejected the submission made for the individual objectors that they were prejudiced and that there has been some type of abuse of process in the non disclosure of material associated with the other assessment approaches, namely Track C and D. WHETHER THE ARRANGEMENT WAS TAX AVOIDANCE IN TERMS OF SECTION 99 OF THE INCOME TAX ACT 1976 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 78 The TRA considered the argument of the objectors that it was an abuse of the Commissioner’s discretion that he employ whatever of Tracks A, B or C as he chooses in relation to different taxpayers. That decision was dealt with by Baragwanath J (in an unreported judgment of 26/9/97 dismissing an application for recall in Miller) where he held that the use in other cases of Track C did not invalidate the earlier Track B assessments in the present case. With regard to the 5% consulting fee the TRA considered that at least 15 hours per month were spent by the objector’s agent in giving general business advice hence the consulting fee was deductible to the two trading companies for a total, between the two companies, of 15 hours per month at $250 per hour. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 79 SECTION EH 18 OF THE INCOME TAX ACT 1994 Introduction This item discusses section EH 18 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (“the Act”), as inserted by the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 (“the 1999 Act”). It has been suggested that this new section is unclear in its application. Therefore Inland Revenue will recommend to the Government that it be amended to make clear its application. Background The accrual rules are now set out in two divisions. Generally, the rules in division 1 apply to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999. Division 2 applies to financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999 and also to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 if the taxpayer has elected to have the division 2 rules apply. Other provisions of the Act relating to financial arrangements were also amended by the 1999 Act, and because division 1 financial arrangements may continue after 20 May 1999, it was necessary to have a rule linking division 1 financial arrangements to the other parts of the Act. Section EH 18 sets out this rule. Its aim is to ensure that the other parts of the Act apply to division 1 financial arrangements as those other parts were before 20 May 1999 (in other words, as if the other parts had not been amended by the 1999 Act). For example, the 1999 Act amended section CG 8(8)(a) of the Act with effect from 20 May 1999. Section EH 18 is intended to ensure that section CG 8(8)(a) as it was worded before 20 May 1999 continues to apply to division 1 financial arrangements after 20 May 1999. GENERAL INTEREST ITEMS Application of section EH 18 It has been suggested that section EH 18 may not achieve its purpose. The reason is the section applies only when the provisions in other parts of the Act apply to division 1 financial arrangements. However, because of the amendments made by the 1999 Act, other parts of the Act may not apply to division 1 financial arrangements on or after 20 May 1999. For example, the 1999 Act amended section CE 1(1)(c) with effect from 20 May 1999 and the amended section CE 1(1)(c) now applies only to the “accrual rules”. Because the term “accrual rules” generally excludes division 1 financial arrangements, it is arguable that section CE 1(1)(c) does not apply to division 1 financial arrangements. Inland Revenue’s view Inland Revenue’s view is that the intent and purpose of the legislation are clear. A court faced with interpreting the section might apply the principles set out in cases like Northland Milk Vendors Association v Northern Milk Limited \[1988\] 1 NZLR 530 and Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty. Ltd v FCT (1981) 147 CLR 297 to give the section appropriate meaning. However, Inland Revenue agrees that section EH 18 should be made clearer and intends to recommend to the Government that appropriate amendments be made to the section, with an effective date of 20 May 1999. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 80 1999 DEEMED RATE OF RETURN ANNOUNCED FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUND RULES The deemed rate of return used for the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules has been set at 9.82% for the 1998-1999 income year. The rate will apply to all types of investments, including interests in superannuation schemes and life insurance policies. The FIF rules tax the income earned by foreign entities on behalf of New Zealand residents, and apply to investments that are not subject to the controlled foreign company rules. The deemed rate of return method is one of four methods for calculating FIF income or loss. The rate for future income years will continue to be set annually. GST – TAX INVOICES Introduction In December 1998 a Committee of Experts released its Report to the Treasurer and Minister of Revenue on Tax Compliance. One of the concerns raised in the report related to problems businesses were having in complying with the tax invoicing requirements contained in section 24 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The report stated that evidence showed that a high proportion of documents held by small businesses, which purport to be tax invoices, do not meet the statutory requirements. The report went on to say that if the recipient of a supply does not take the time to get a proper tax invoice they risk penalties for making an input tax claim without valid supporting documentation. Although the Committee considered ways to reduce this burden, it recognised that for the GST system to work effectively an audit trail is required, and to relax the tax invoicing requirements could result in difficulties for Inland Revenue in its audit activity. The Committee recommended that Inland Revenue publish a statement on its operational policy on tax invoices for GST purposes. As a result of this recommendation Inland Revenue has prepared the following article which covers: legislative requirements for tax invoices, common errors of tax invoices encountered by Inland Revenue, and Inland Revenue’s practice regarding tax invoices. It does not however, identify which errors are considered significant and which are not. This is because the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is very specific concerning the details required to be on a tax invoice, and invoices being held at the time of any input tax deduction being claimed. Legislation Sections quoted refer to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the Act). Section 20(2) of the Act, subject to sections 24(5) or 24(6) or 24(7) and 25, requires a registered person to hold a tax invoice pursuant to section 24, or a debit or credit note pursuant to section 25, to support any input tax claim at the time any return in respect of that supply is furnished. Section 20(2) also gives the Commissioner the authority to disallow any input tax claim where that claim is not supported by a valid tax invoice. The requirements of a tax invoice are contained in section 24 of the Act. The particulars required on a tax invoice are contained in section 24(3), which states: Except as the Commissioner may otherwise allow, and subject to this section, a tax invoice shall contain the following particulars: (a)The words “tax invoice” in a prominent place: (b)The name and registration number of the supplier: (c)The name and address of the recipient: (d)The date upon which the tax invoice is issued: (e)A description of the goods and services supplied: (f)The quantity or volume of the goods and services supplied: (g)Either - (i)The total amount of the tax charged, the consideration, excluding tax, and the consideration, inclusive of tax for the supply; or (ii)Where the amount of tax charged is the tax fraction of the consideration, the consideration for the supply and a statement that it includes a charge in respect of the tax. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 81 Where a supply does not exceed $200, section 24(4) of the Act relaxes the information required on a tax invoice. Section 24(4) states: Notwithstanding anything in subsection (3) of this section, where the consideration in money for a supply does not exceed $200 (or such greater amount as the Governor-General may, from time to time, by Order in Council declare), a tax invoice shall contain the particulars specified in that subsection or the following particulars: (a)The words “tax invoice” in a prominent place: (b)The name and registration number of the supplier: (c)The date upon which the tax invoice is issued: (d)A description of the goods and services supplied: (e)The consideration for the supply and a statement that it includes a charge in respect of tax: Provided that this subsection shall not apply to a supply that is charged with tax pursuant to section 11 of this Act. Section 24(5) does not require a registered person to issue a tax invoice for supplies where the consideration in money for that supply does not exceed $50. Section 24(5) states: Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a supplier shall not be required to provide a tax invoice if the considera- tion in money for a supply does not exceed $50 (or such greater amount as the Governor-General may, from time to time, by Order in Council declare). Section 24(6) allows the Commissioner to determine that a tax invoice does not have to contain one or more of the requirements mentioned in sections 24(3) and 24(4), or that a tax invoice does not have to be issued at all. Section 24(6) states: Where the Commissioner is satisfied that there are or will be sufficient records available to establish the particulars of any supply or class of supplies, and that it would be impractical to require that a tax invoice be issued pursuant to this section, the Commissioner may determine that, subject to any conditions that the Commissioner may consider necessary, - (a)Any one or more of the particulars specified in subsection (3) or subsection (4) of this section shall not be contained on a tax invoice; or (b)A tax invoice is not required to be issued. When the Commissioner is likely to use section 24(6) is discussed under Inland Revenue Practice, below. Common Errors Tax Invoices The biggest problem Inland Revenue staff encounter when conducting GST checks is that either no tax invoice has been issued for a supply, e.g. property transactions, or documents being used to support input tax claims do not meet the requirements laid down in sections 24(3) and 24(4) of the Act. Common errors found in incomplete documentation include: the words “tax invoice” missing, incorrect GST numbers being used, usually transposition or using old numbers, name of recipient incorrect or missing, no GST content shown and no statement to say the total is GST inclusive, using the simplified tax invoice for supplies over $200, date missing. In some instances registered persons are not obtaining, or retaining, tax invoices for supplies just over $50. Although the Act states that tax invoices are not required for supplies up to $50 once the supply is more than $50 then a tax invoice is required or the claim may be disallowed. There have also been instances where taxpayers have issued buyer created tax invoices for supplies that have occurred prior to, or without, approval being granted by Inland Revenue. Section 24(2)(a) is quite specific that the Commissioner must have granted prior approval before a taxpayer can issue buyer created tax invoices. Where prior approval has not been granted, the supplier, and not the recipient of the supply, must issue the tax invoice. Statements The use of statements to support input tax claims is another area where the tax invoicing requirements are not being met. Although it may be easier to use a statement when preparing GST returns, the information contained on the statement does not generally meet the requirements of sections 24(3) or 24(4) of the Act. A statement generally just summarises the invoices issued for a specific period, e.g. a month, it does not normally have the words “tax invoice” in a prominent place or a description, and where appropriate the quantity or volume, of the goods and services supplied. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 82 Credit Notes It is also noted that some registered persons are not issuing credit notes when: A supply of goods and services has been cancelled; or The nature of that supply of goods and services has been fundamentally varied or altered; or The previously agreed consideration for a supply of goods and services has been altered, whether due to the offer of a discount or otherwise; or The goods and services supplied, or part thereof, have been returned to the supplier. Section 25(3)(a) of the Act requires a credit note to be issued when a tax invoice has been provided for a supply and one of the above situations occurs. Section 25(3)(e) allows a registered person not to issue a credit note when the excess is the result of the recipient of the supply taking up a prompt payment discount offered by the registered person. The terms of the prompt payment discount have to be clearly stated on the face of the tax invoice. Section 25(3B) provides the Commissioner with the discretion not to require a credit note to be issued, or vary the requirements contained in the credit note, only where he is satisfied that there are, or will be, sufficient records available to establish the particulars of any supply or class of supplies, and it would be impractical to require a credit note to be issued. When the Commissioner is likely to use section 25(3B) is discussed under Inland Revenue Practice. Inland Revenue Practice For the GST system to work effectively there must be a clear audit trail in place. This audit trail is achieved by requiring a registered person to have a tax invoice to support all input tax claims for supplies over $50.00, with the exception of claims for second-hand goods purchased from non registered persons. It is therefore important that all registered persons ensure they obtain tax invoices, that comply with section 24 of the Act, if they intend to make an input tax claim in relation to a supply. Failure to do so may result in the claim being disallowed and penalties being imposed. Where a taxpayer claiming an input tax deduction is not the person named on the tax invoice, Inland Revenue will allow the claim providing the taxpayer can establish that they are the recipient of the supply. For example, where a taxpayer is claiming expenses incurred by an employee, that claim will only be allowed where the employer can demonstrate that the costs incurred by the employee are in respect of the taxpayer’s business, and the taxpayer has reimbursed the employee for the actual expenses incurred. Commissioner’s discretion under sections 24(6) and 25(3B) of the ActSections 24(6) and 25(3B) allow the commissioner to either; dispense with any one or more of the particulars specified in sections 24(3), 24(4), 25(3)(a) or 25(3)(b), or dispense with the need to issue a tax invoice, credit note or debit note. Where the Commissioner gives dispensation under sections 24(3) or 24(4) section 26(6A) of the Act requires the modified tax invoice to contain the words “modified tax invoice - IRD approved”. The Commissioner will only apply complete dispensation for the requirement to issue a tax invoice, credit note or debit note where; there are sufficient records available to establish the particulars of the supply, and it would be impractical to require that a tax invoice, credit note or debit note be issued. As mentioned above, the tax invoice, credit note and debit note are required to ensure there is an audit trail in place, therefore dispensation under sections 24(6) and 25(3B) will be rare. The fact that a registered person does not hold a valid tax invoice, debit note or credit note, at the time their GST return is lodged, is not generally sufficient reason for approval under sections 24(6) and 25(3B) to be granted. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 83 USE OF THE FBT RATE OF 24% OF THE ORIGINAL COST PRICE TO DETERMINE THE FRINGE BENEFIT VALUE OF A MOTOR VEHICLE Introduction In its December 1998 report , the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance recommended that Inland Revenue publish in the Tax Information Bulletin an informative explanation of the rationale underlying the use of 24% of the original cost price of the vehicle 1 as the value for fringe benefit tax purposes. The Committee perceived that there is widespread misunderstanding of the reason for using this rate. The rate is set having regard to the average costs (both fixed and running) an employee would have incurred had he or she: purchased the car new; run it for five years; and done 16,000 km in private use per year. Neither the portion of business use nor the actual private use is part of the calculation. Instead, the focus is on the costs the employee would have incurred had he or she purchased the car and run it according to the criteria above Over the five-year period the total costs that would have been incurred by the employee, based on the criteria above, are 120% of the cost of the car. The 24% figure is merely one-fifth of this. The basis for the formula of 24% of the original cost price of the vehicle An employer who makes available a motor vehicle for an employee to use privately is liable to pay fringe benefit tax (FBT). The employee is deemed to derive the benefit from the availability of the vehicle, regardless of actual use. These fringe benefits are valued each year at the rate of 24% of the original cost price of the motor vehicle.1 The 24% rate can best be explained by reference to the April 1982 report of the Task Force on Tax Reform (the McCaw Committee), which suggested the benefit valuation formula. Extracts from this report follow: “Introduction The Task Force considers that the provision of a car to an employee should give rise to a taxable benefit where that car is substantially available for private use at the employee’s discretion. A benefit should be assessed for each month or part of a month during which the vehicle is so available. Valuation of the Benefit The value to an employee of a company car will vary depending on a number of factors, including the cost of the car, the extent of private running and the amount of operating costs met by the employer. It would be impracti- cable for all such variables to be identified and quantified for each case. Adoption of a specified formula is therefore proposed. The Task Force has concluded that as a general rule the value to an employee of a fringe benefit is equal to the amount by which the employee’s need to meet private outgoings is reduced. Thus the value of a benefit to the employee may differ from the employer’s costs of providing that benefit. Therefore, in arriving at an appropriate formula we have had regard to the typical costs of operating a vehicle. We have adopted as a benchmark the total operating costs where the annual distance travelled is 16,000 kms and have used as a base details published by the Automobile Association Inc. New Zealand. Formula Options The first option is to provide that the taxable value be calculated by applying a fixed percentage rate to the cost of the vehicle. ...... If this option were adopted, the Task Force is of the opinion that the rate should be set at a conservative level, say 2% per month \[or 24% per year\]..... The second option would be to adopt the specified rate approach of the first option, but to apply the selected rate to the book value of the vehicle rather than to the cost price (book value being that arrived at after the deduction of depreciation at departmental rates). The rate adopted should be something in excess of that which would have been adopted under the first option. This option has the added advantage that the value to be assessed will reduce as the vehicle ages. A third option would be to fix a specific value which varies with the size of vehicle. .....” 1 Two methods exist to calculate the value of the fringe benefit: 24% of the GST-inclusive cost of the motor vehicle, or 27% of the GST-exclusive cost of the motor vehicle. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No. 9 ( October 1999) 84 The key point is that the McCaw Committee found that 2% per month on cost was a satisfactory approximation of the cost of employees running their own cars. This is based on the following assumptions: The benefit (use or availability for use) should be based on the total costs the employee would have incurred had the employee purchased the car. The car is purchased new and owned for five years. The private use is 16,000 km per year. The actual cost was (and still is) higher than this, but the McCaw Committee recommended 2% as an appropriate figure. Over the five-year period referred to, the total estimate of these costs is 120% of the cost of the car. The McCaw Committee then considered three options as to how this could be applied. The Government decided to use the first option, a flat 24% per year (or 120% over five years), which is the simplest to apply. The trade-off is that it is arbitrary in any specific circumstance (as are, in fact, all three options suggested by the McCaw Committee ). The reason for this arbitrariness is that the actual costs (that the employee would otherwise have incurred) are unknown. Any attempt to make it less arbitrary would significantly increase compliance costs. Further, the method ignores the employer’s actual costs and the amount of business use – there is no apportionment of the fixed costs between business and benefit. As the McCaw Committee suggested in its second option, an alternative would be to base the benefit on depreciated value. Alternatively, market value could be used. As the Committee noted, this would lead to the use of a higher rate. For example, presuming that: 24% of cost is correct; the other assumptions stand; and the average value over the five-year period of the vehicle is 60% of its cost, an average rate of 40% (rather than 24%) would be needed to ensure the benefit equalled 120% of the cost of the vehicle over the five-year period. Further, the value would need to be known for each FBT return, whereas cost over the ownership period is constant. This in itself would increase compliance costs. Although the value could be determined with greater accuracy if specific circumstances were taken into account, compliance costs would also increase significantly. Each marginal increase in accuracy achieved for some taxpayers by incorporating one of these factors would increase compliance costs for all. Further, although the change might reduce the FBT payable by some taxpayers, the tax to be paid by others might increase. Using original cost to determine the value provides certainty, and a compromise between accuracy and compliance costs. This is an explicit trade-off the Government made in legislating that the FBT value would be 24% of the original cost of the motor vehicle. The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance repeated the research of the McCaw report using current prices and costs, the results of which are shown in Table 1. The Committee considered that the global “percentage of cost” approach provides a satisfactory compromise and thus endorsed the formula suggested by the McCaw Committee and chosen by the Government.

Corrections
-----------

### Correction to public ruling BR Pub 99/8 commentary

An error has been identified in the Commentary to public ruling BR Pub 99/8, published in TIB Volume Eleven, No.11 of December 1999.

A typographical error occurs in the penultimate line of Example 2 on page 7 of the TIB. The line should read:

“GST 12.5% on x minus y”, not “...x plus y”. 

We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

Transfer Pricing Draft Guidelines – Part 2 A guide to the application of section GD 13 of New Zealand’s Income Tax Act 1994 This appendix contains the second part of a series of draft guidelines on New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules. The first part, issued in October 1997, contained a general overview of the framework in which transfer pricing operates. This part deals with the remaining issues covered in the OECD guidelines issued to date, namely intangible property, intra-group services and cost contribution arrangements (CCAs). Subsequent guidelines will deal with advance pricing agreements (APAs) and the application to branches of section FB 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Inland Revenue welcomes submissions on the material in this part of the draft guidelines. Please make these by 31 March 2000, addressed to: General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Inland Revenue fully endorses the OECD guidelines in relation to issues dealt with in this part of the guidelines. This part should be read, therefore, as supplementing the OECD guidelines, rather than superseding them. On matters not addressed in draft guidelines issued to date, Inland Revenue will continue to follow the OECD guidelines. This document is also available on the Internet. Visit Inland Revenue’s website at http://www.ird.govt.nz and choose the Tax Information Bulletin section.

Inland Revenue’s guidelines will follow the OECD position, once it is finalised and published. 10.In the interim, Inland Revenue will continue to follow the OECD’s current published position on the issue, set out in the loose-leaf version of the OECD’s Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital (November 1997), specifically, the: •Commentary on Article 7 (Business Profits) in volume 1; and •Report on the Attribution of Income to Permanent Establishments in volume 2. Submissions on Part 1 of guidelines 11.Submissions have been received on Part 1 of the transfer pricing guidelines, released in draft as an appendix to Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 9 No.10 (October 1997). 12.Submissions have not identified any areas where a substantive revision of the draft will be required. It is proposed, therefore, that a further draft of Part 1 will not be prepared for release at this stage. Instead, it is planned to issue a final version later this year, incorporating the final version of the material included in this draft and on APAs. Introduction 1.This is the second part in the series of guidelines on New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules. The first part, a draft of which was issued in October 1997, contained a general overview of the framework in which transfer pricing operates. This part deals with the remaining issues covered in the OECD guidelines issued to date, namely intangible property, intra-group services and cost contribution arrangements (CCAs). Subsequent guidelines will deal with advance pricing agreements (APAs), and the application of section FB 2 to branches. Inland Revenue’s approach to this part of guidelines 2.This part of the guidelines deals with material of a specialised nature covered in chapters 6 to 8 of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (referred to in these guidelines as the “OECD guidelines”). Inland Revenue considers there to be little value to replicating the analysis of those guidelines here. Consequently, this part of the guidelines consists substantially of a summary of the key points made in the OECD guidelines (cross- referenced to relevant paragraphs in those guidelines), supplemented by Inland Revenue’s views on those guidelines and comments on areas where it is considered that further clarification is useful. If more detail is required than is provided in this part of the guidelines, reference should be made to the OECD guidelines. 3.Inland Revenue fully endorses the material in chapters 6 to 8 of the OECD guidelines and proposes to follow the positions outlined in those chapters in administering New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules. This part of the guidelines should, therefore, be read as supplementing the OECD guidelines, rather than superseding them. This applies for the domestic application of New Zealand’s rules, as well as in relation to issues raised under New Zealand’s double taxation agreements. 4.The OECD is continuing to undertake work on specialist transfer pricing areas such as global trading and insurance. At this stage, Inland Revenue does not propose to issue its own guidelines in these areas. Instead, Inland Revenue is likely to endorse the OECD guidelines, once issued, in the administration of these areas in the form in which the OECD releases them. Scope 5.This part of the guidelines applies only to the application of section GD 13 (as modified by section GC 1 where relevant). It therefore applies only to transactions between separate entities. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 4 INTANGIBLE PROPERTY Key points •The process for applying the arm’s length principle to intangible property is no different than for other property. It can be more problematic to apply, however, because: •Valid comparables can be difficult, if not impossible, to locate. •For entirely commercial reasons, multinational enterprises (MNEs) may structure their arrangements in different ways to independent firms. •Functional analysis is critical in determining the real nature of intangible property being transferred. The value of intangible property can be more sensitive to small differences than other property, so it is important that the nature of the transaction (and relevant pricing factors) be fully understood. •If one party to a transaction does not contribute intangible property, the most straightforward analysis is likely to involve using that party as the “tested party”, even if it is outside New Zealand. •The value of intangible property is broadly based on perceptions of its profit potential. If there are no reliable comparables on which to apply the pricing methods directly, alternatives may be to: •Apply the profit split method, which requires a less rigorous application of comparables than do the other methods. •Value intangibles based on evaluations of profit potential. •When dealing with marketing activities of firms that do not own the marketing intangible, it is important to ensure that their compensation is commensurate with what independent entities would have accepted given the rights and obligations under the arrangement. Introduction 13.Chapter 6 of the OECD guidelines discusses the application of the arm’s length principle to intangible property. Inland Revenue fully endorses the position established in those guidelines. This chapter should, therefore, be read as supplementing, but not supplanting, the OECD guidelines. 14.Paragraph 6.2 of the OECD guidelines provides a general description of intangible property: The term “intangible property” includes rights to use industrial assets such as patents, trademarks, trade names, designs or models. It also includes literary and artistic property rights, and intellectual property such as know-how and trade secrets. ... These intangibles are assets that may have considerable value even though they may have no book value in the company’s balance sheet. There also may be considerable risks associated with them (eg, contract or product liability and environmental damages). 15.The OECD guidelines focus on trade and marketing intangibles (referred to collectively as commercial intangibles). The reason for distinguishing between these two types of intangibles is that they have different features that lead to the creation of their respective values. Understanding the distinction aids significantly in applying the arm’s length principle correctly. 16.The treatment of intangible property can be one of the most difficult areas to apply correctly in transfer pricing practice. Transactions involving intangible property are often difficult to evaluate for tax purposes, because: •It can be difficult to discern the precise nature of the transaction – the transaction may represent a number of components, both tangible and intangible, bundled together to form a single product. •The property may have a special character complicating the search for comparables – this might make value difficult to determine at the time of the transaction, or to confirm subsequently as being arm’s length. •MNEs may, for entirely commercial reasons, structure their transactions in ways that would not be adopted by independent firms. 17.A sound functional analysis (see paragraphs 164- 211 in the draft of Part 1 of the guidelines) is an important first step in applying the arm’s length principle to intangible property. Functional analysis can help identify: IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 5 •the factors that have led to the creation of intangible value, and consequently where one might expect the rewards to that intangible to accrue; •who the “owner” of the intangible is; •what the true nature of the property being transferred is; •the terms and conditions under which a related party is using an intangible (for example, whether the user is a licensee of the intangible, or merely a contract distributor); 18.The results of the analysis can identify those features of a transaction for which comparables ideally should be identified. It also better enables a check that the price determined is consistent with the true nature of the property being transferred. (Table 2, which contains a list of specific factors that can be particularly relevant in determining the nature of intangible property being transferred, is a key reference in this chapter.) 19.The most desirable way to determine the arm’s length price is through the direct application of reliable comparables. For example, the arm’s length price might be determined directly by reference to the transfer of similar intangible property in an uncontrolled transaction (a comparable uncontrolled price, or CUP), or by comparing the return to a manufacturing function incorporating equivalent intangible property (a cost plus approach). One possibility here is that if one of the parties to the transaction does not contribute any intangible property, that party might be used as the “tested party”, even if it is not the New Zealand party to the transaction (see paragraphs 134 to 138 in the draft of Part 1 of the guidelines). Alternatively, internal comparables (the transfer of the same property to an independent third party), if available, could prove a valuable source of information (see paragraphs 243 to 246 in the draft of Part 1 of the guidelines). 20.The often unique nature of intangible property does mean, however, that applying comparables directly may not always be practicable. Further, even if an apparent comparable can be located, it would be erroneous to assume it can usefully be applied mechanically. The key issue in section GD 13 is whether the most reliable measure of the arm’s length price has been determined, not whether a comparable has been identified and applied in a process. In some cases, it may be better that no comparable is applied, rather than applying a patently bad comparable. 21.If comparables cannot be applied directly, recourse might be made to the profit split method, which requires a less rigorous application of comparables than the other methods. Alternatively, the intangible might be valued by reference to reliable projections of future cash flows attributable to that property. Comparables might still be usefully applied in such an approach, possibly, for example, as support for the variables underlying the valuation. 22.One issue that taxpayers should be conscious of, and will need to address in their analysis, is the possibility that a double deduction might arise if a local operation, either directly or indirectly, is meeting the costs of maintaining intellectual property (generally an issue associated with marketing intangibles). If an independent party would not be required to maintain the intangible in a similar transaction, the local operation should not be paying the same price for the property being transferred as the independent firm, as well as meeting the maintenance expenditure. 23.As with any other area of transfer pricing, the quality of a taxpayer’s analysis and documentation will be a factor in supporting the credibility of its transfer prices. As discussed in the documentation chapter in the draft of Part 1 of the guidelines, taxpayers should weigh the cost of preparing documentation against the risk that Inland Revenue might make an adjustment in determining the extent to which documentation should be prepared for a transaction. In this regard, taxpayers might usefully consider whether an APA would represent a cost-effective way of obtaining greater certainty that their transfer prices will be acceptable to Inland Revenue. 24.This chapter discusses first the identification of the nature of the intangible property being transferred. It then considers ways in which the arm’s length price for the transfer might be determined. Finally, it considers specifically the treatment of marketing intangibles. 25.This chapter is based on the OECD guidelines, and cross-referenced to paragraphs in those guidelines when relevant. If further detail is required, reference should be made to those guidelines. Identifying types of intangible property 26.The OECD guidelines begin their discussion of intangible property by distinguishing between two broad types of intangible property – marketing intangibles and trade intangibles (which are essentially non-marketing intangibles). An important reason for this distinction is that the two types of intangible property have different characteristics that give rise to the creation of their intangible value. An awareness of the distinction can be useful in identifying the factors contributing to an intangible’s value, and aids significantly in applying the arm’s length price correctly. 27.For example, the effectiveness of the promotion of a trade name (a marketing intangible) is likely to be a significant factor in determining its value (although the quality of the underlying product or service will also be important). This suggests that an important factor in assessing the value of a marketing intangible used in a IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 6 transaction will be how that intangible is maintained. For example, a marketing intangible may have a very limited life unless supported by current marketing expenditure (in other words, if current marketing is eliminated, its value will quickly evaporate). Such an intangible is likely to have little or no inherent value, and it would be inconsistent with the arm’s length principle for the intangible to earn anything beyond a nominal return. 28.The value of a trade intangible, by contrast, is more likely to be determined by the use to which it can be applied. It is the inherent quality in the intangible property that is dominant in creating its value. 29.Table 1 summarises the general differences between the two types of intangibles. Table 1: Distinguishing trade and marketing intangibles Trade intangibles Marketing intangibles 1. Tend to arise from1. Often cheap to create risky and costly researchlegally (such as trademarks and development.and trade names) but very costly to develop and maintain value. 2. Generally associated2. Associated with the with the production ofpromotion of goods goods.or services. 3. Use of a patented trade3. Competitors are able intangible may resultto enter the same market in a monopoly for a if products are productdifferentiated. 4. Any legal rights4. May have an indefinite established (for example,life (if properly a patent) are likely to have maintained). a limited life. 30.Consideration of these differences will be important in determining the nature of any intangible property that is applied in a transaction, and the type of comparables that might need to be identified to assess the value of that property. Thus it will be important in determining: •the value of any intangible property transferred within a MNE; and •the amount of income attributable to intangible property and how: •the income should be allocated between the parties if ownership of the property is shared. •one party to a transaction should be compensated if it contributes to the value of intangible property owned by the other party. 31.The focus, however, should be not so much the ability to correctly classify intangibles into trade and marketing intangibles (because the boundary may be blurred in many instances), but rather on developing an awareness of factors that lead to the creation of value in intangible property of different natures. If the nature of the intangible property under consideration is better understood, so too will be the ability to ascertain effectively the appropriate arm’s length price for its transfer. Applying arm’s length principle 32.In principle, the arm’s length standard applies to intangible property in the same way as for any other type of property – the methods in section GD 13(7) are applied to determine the most reliable measure of the arm’s length price. As noted in paragraph 16, however, the arm’s length principle can be difficult to apply in practice to controlled transactions involving intangible property, because: •It can be difficult to discern the precise nature of the transaction – the transaction may represent a number of components, both tangible and intangible, bundled together to form a single product. •The property may have a special character complicating the search for comparables – this might make value difficult to determine at the time of the transaction. •MNEs may, for entirely commercial reasons, structure their transactions in ways that would not be adopted by independent firms (paragraph 6.13). 33.For example, a MNE might transfer property that an independent firm would not be prepared to transfer. It is common for MNEs to licence technology to their subsidiaries because they retain control over how that technology is exploited. An independent firm, by contrast, may be more reluctant to licence its technology, out of concern that the other party might use or disclose the detail of the property inappropriately. 34.When attempting to apply comparables to transfer pricing analyses involving intangible property, a key consideration is how reliable those comparables are in practice. Because of the special character of intangible property, it is possible that even apparently small differences between two items being compared could have a significant effect on their relative value. Consequently, a greater level of care is likely to be required in assessing comparability when intangible property is involved. It cannot be automatically assumed IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 7 that because two items of intangible property appear comparable outwardly, they are directly comparable. Detailed analysis will often be necessary to determine the extent to which the two items are truly comparable. 35.It is also important to consider both parties to the transaction (paragraph 6.14). One might, for example, perform an analysis that demonstrates, from a transferor’s perspective, the price at which an independent party would be prepared to transfer property. However, this may not be the same price that an independent party would be prepared to pay, based on the value and usefulness of the intangible in its business. At arm’s length, the transaction would not proceed at the price determined from the transferor’s perspective. That price could not, therefore, be an arm’s length price. (The asymmetry of the interests of the transferor and transferee is commented on further in paragraph 90, in the context of valuation-based approaches to determining the arm’s length price.) Ascertaining what the transaction involves 36.Before appraising whether the price for intangible property is arm’s length, it is necessary to ascertain exactly what the transaction involves. This identifies what it is that will need to be priced, ideally by reference to independent comparables. For example, a transaction may involve the transfer of a bundle of rights in a way that is not representative of how independent firms might have undertaken a similar transaction. Segmenting the transfer into its component parts may give a clearer picture of exactly what is being transferred. It might also permit reliable comparables to be more readily identified for each component part, rather than requiring comparables to be located for the transaction as a whole. 37.A central tool for ascertaining what the transaction involves will be a functional analysis. Failure to perform an adequate functional analysis has the potential to cause much controversy and confusion over inter-company transfer pricing for intangible property. In the absence of an adequate analysis, it is likely there will be no meeting of the minds between taxpayers and Inland Revenue on what the transaction involves, let alone how it should be priced. 38.Functional analysis can be used to answer three threshold questions for appraising intangible property: •Who is the “owner” of the intangible property for transfer pricing purposes? •What is the true nature of the intangible property being transferred? •What are the terms and conditions under which a related party is using an intangible? For example, is the user a licensee of the intangible, or merely a contract distributor? 39.The answer to the first question is relevant in identifying where returns to the intangible might be expected to accrue. The answers to the second and third questions identify factors that will be relevant in actually pricing the transfer of the intangible. Ownership of intangible property 40.A general rule of thumb is that intangible property is owned initially by the party that bears the expenses and risks associated with its development, whether incurred directly, or indirectly through recompensing another entity undertaking work on its behalf. The owner of that property is then entitled to all of the income attributable to that intangible. The principle behind this is that, at arm’s length, an independent party would not be prepared to incur such expenditure and assume such risk if it were not going to benefit from what is produced by its efforts. 41.The initial owner of an intangible may choose to transfer some or all of the rights to exploit the intangible. However, an arm’s length charge should be imposed for the transfer of those rights. The party to whom the rights are transferred will then be entitled to the income attributable to the intangible rights that are transferred. 42.It is possible, however, that legal ownership of intangible property (such as a patent) does not vest with the party that has developed the property. In that case, the arm’s length principle would treat the legal owner as being entitled to the income attributable to that intangible, even though the legal owner has not contributed to its development. However, the developer of the intangible property would be expected to have received an arm’s length consideration for its development services. This might, for example, take the form of: •a cost reimbursement (with an appropriate profit element), if the developer is a contract developer (effectively a service provider); or •lump-sum compensation, if the developer bore all of the expenses and risks of development. 43. Whether or not the developer is a contract developer should be determined on the facts of the relationship between the parties during the development process. If the developer is a contract developer, it would seem reasonable to expect that at the outset of the development process, an arrangement would be in place for costs to be reimbursed during the process or a formal understanding already established that the developer will not own any intangible property produced. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 8 Factors in pricing 44.An understanding of the exact nature of the intangible property being transferred is fundamental to the correct evaluation of the arm’s length price for that property. 45.There are two aims in identifying the nature of the intangible property being transferred. 46.First, the key features of the intangible property that have led to the creation of its value are identified, giving an indication of the important factors that will need to be priced. This helps identify what it is that will give rise to the expected benefits, and to differentiate profit attributable to that intangible from the profit attributable to other factors, such as functions performed and other assets employed. 47.Second, if the intangible property is to be valued by reference to comparables, and it must be acknowledged that in many cases, this may not readily be possible, it will enable the true extent of comparability between the transactions being compared to be better ascertained. 48.The OECD guidelines (paragraphs 6.20 to 6.24) and the United States section 482 regulations (1.482- 4(c)(2)(iii)(B)(2)) identify a number of specific factors that may be particularly relevant to consider in determining the nature of intangible property being transferred. Table 2 lists the more significant of these factors (but is not an exhaustive list). Table 2: Factors in determining nature of intangible property (a)The expected benefits from the intangible property, determined possibly through a net present value calculation. (b)The terms of the transfer, including the exploitation rights granted in the intangible, the exclusive or non-exclusive character of any rights granted, any restrictions on use, or any limitations on the geographic area in which the rights might be exploited. (c)The stage of development of the intangible in the market in which the intangible is to be exploited, including, where appropriate: •the extent of any capital investment, start-up expenses or development work required; and •necessary governmental approvals, authorisations, or licenses required. (d)Rights to receive updates, revisions, or modifications of the intangible. (e)The uniqueness of the property and the period for which it remains unique, including the degree and duration of protection afforded to the property under the laws of the relevant countries, and the value that the process in which the property is used contributes to the final product. (f)The duration of the license, contract, or other agreement, and any termination or negotiation rights. (g)Any economic and product liability risks to be assumed by the transferee. (h)The existence and extent of any collateral transactions or on-going business relationship between the transferee and transferor. (i)The functions to be performed by the transferee, including any ancillary or subsidiary services. 49.Each of the factors in the table will influence the price for the intangible property. For example, if the transferee is to assume economic and product liability risks (paragraph (g)), the arm’s length price for the property transferred will be lower (perhaps by way of a lower royalty rate) than if the transferor retained those risks. Terms and conditions of transfer 50.The conditions for transferring intangible property may be those of an outright sale of the intangible or, perhaps more commonly, a licensing arrangement for rights in respect of the intangible property (paragraph 6.16). This identifies those aspects of the transaction for which a price needs to be determined. It also identifies the type of comparables that need to be identified if the arrangement is to be benchmarked against an uncontrolled transaction. 51.Determining the conditions of the transfer will not necessarily be a straightforward task. For example, it may be difficult to differentiate between a transfer of an intangible, and the supply of a product or service that benefits from the intangible. 52.One area of potential confusion is the treatment of embedded intangibles – for example, tangible property carrying rights to use a tradename or trade mark, which is sold by a manufacturer to a related distributor. 53.There are a number of issues to be considered when dealing with the transfer of tangible property that includes an intangible element such as a trademark. First, it must be considered whether intangible rights have actually been transferred. For example, the mere acquisition of branded goods will in many cases not involve the transfer of intangible rights. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 9 54.Second, if it is considered that an intangible right has been transferred then consideration must be given to whether that right should be valued separately from the tangible property. This will be a question of fact and will depend on the available comparable data and available transfer pricing methods. In addition, a consideration of the industry specific factors might also be made. For example, in some industries the mere fact that an intangible right has been transferred with the tangible property may not give rise to a valuable right, such as when the intangible element has no value. In such a case, there would be no reason to attempt to separate the arm’s length value of the tangible property from the intangible property. Calculating arm’s length price 55.Several issues arise when calculating the arm’s length price for intangible property. 56.First, in applying the traditional transactional methods (CUP, resale price and cost plus methods) or the comparable profits methods (including the transactional net margin method (TNMM)) to determine the arm’s length price for a transaction involving intangible property, it will be very important to identify that the independent transaction used as a benchmark is truly comparable. If the independent transaction is not comparable, perhaps because an important functional difference has not correctly been identified, the analysis based on that comparable is likely to have no value. The principles of comparability applied to intangible property are discussed in paragraphs 61 to 70 below. 57.Second, in many cases, taxpayers will face difficulties in identifying reliable comparables on which to base a sound transfer pricing analysis. Taxpayers may then need to examine alternative approaches for performing an analysis. 58.One option available to taxpayers is the use of the profit split method. This is discussed in paragraphs 71 to 78. A key feature of the profit split method is that it requires a less rigorous application of comparables than is required for analysis under the other methods. The downside of this, however, is that because the method tends to be more subjective in application than the other methods, it can increase the potential for disagreement between taxpayers and Inland Revenue over what transfer prices are appropriate. 59.As an alternative, recourse might be made to a valuation-based approach to determining the arm’s length price. As paragraph 6.29 of the OECD guidelines notes, in relation to transactions when valuation is highly uncertain at the time of the transfer: One possibility is to use anticipated benefits (taking into account all relevant economic factors) as a means for establishing the pricing at the outset of the transaction. 60.It is likely that comparables might still play a part in a valuation-based approach. For example, comparables might be located to lend support to the assumptions underlying the valuation model applied. The use of comparables is not essential to this approach, but would be expected to increase the credibility of the analysis, if applied. Valuation-based approaches are discussed further in paragraphs 79 to 100. Comparability 61.As noted in paragraph 56, it will be very important to identify that the independent transaction used as a benchmark is truly comparable when considering transactions involving intangible property. If the independent transaction is not comparable, perhaps because an important functional difference has not been correctly identified, the analysis based on that comparable is likely to have no value. 62.The OECD guidelines, at paragraph 6.25, contain a detailed example illustrating various considerations in determining comparability for controlled transactions. The example contemplates how the arm’s length price for a branded athletic shoe might be determined. 63.The first approach suggested is to value the shoe, including its brand value, by reference to a comparable uncontrolled price. This might be done if there is a similar athletic shoe, both in terms of the quality and specification of the shoe itself and also in terms of the consumer acceptability and other characteristics of the brand name in that market, transferred under a different brand name in an uncontrolled transaction. 64.The second approach involves estimating the value of the brand name itself, with the price of the unbranded shoe and the extra value attributable to the brand name being determined separately. The OECD guidelines (paragraph 6.25) suggest the following as one approach that might be taken: Branded athletic shoe ‘A’ may be comparable to an unbranded shoe in all respects (after adjustments) except for the brand name itself. In such a case, the premium attributable to the brand might be determined by comparing an unbranded shoe with different features, transferred in an uncontrolled transaction, to its branded equivalent, also transferred in an uncontrolled transaction. Then it may be possible to use this information as an aid in determining the price of branded shoe ‘A’, although adjustments may be necessary for the effect of the difference in features on the value of the brand. 65.Paragraph 6.25 does conclude, however, by noting that: ... adjustments may be particularly difficult where a trademarked product has a dominant market position such that the generic product is in essence trading in a different market, particularly where sophisticated products are involved. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 10 Example 1, adapted from the United States’ section 482 regulations (1.482-4(c)(4), example 4), further illustrates considerations in identifying intangibles. Example 1 66.A German pharmaceutical company has developed a new drug that is useful for treating migraine headaches and produces no significant side effects. The new drug replaces an older drug that the company had previously produced and marketed as a treatment for migraine headaches. 67.A number of drugs for treating migraine headaches are already on the market. However, because all of these other drugs have side effects, the new drug can be expected quickly to dominate the worldwide market for such treatments and to command a premium price. Thus the new drug can be expected to earn extraordinary profits. 68.The German company had previously marketed its drug through an independent company in New Zealand. It now decides to establish a New Zealand subsidiary, and assign that subsidiary the rights to produce and market the new drug in New Zealand. The question arises as to what might be an appropriate royalty rate to charge for those rights. 69.On further research, it is determined that the old and new drugs were licensed at the same stage in their development and the agreements conveyed identical rights to the licensees. There has also been no change in the New Zealand market for migraine headache treatments since the earlier drug was introduced. Prima facie, therefore, it might be concluded that the licence agreement for the new drug might be closely comparable to the previous licence agreement with the independent company, allowing the previous agreement to be used as a CUP. 70.Given the nature of the new drug, however, it is clear that its profitability is likely to be higher, and that the reward for that additional profitability should lie with its developer. This consideration would need to be factored into the license agreement for the new drug. Profit split method 71.As noted in paragraphs 57 and 58, taxpayers will, in many cases, face difficulties in identifying reliable comparables on which to base a sound transfer pricing analysis. The profit split method might then be a useful alternative approach for performing an analysis, particularly as it requires a less rigorous application of comparables than is required for analysis under the other methods. 72.Paragraph 6.26 of the OECD guidelines similarly states that: In cases involving highly valuable intangible property, it may be difficult to find comparable uncontrolled transactions. It therefore may be difficult to apply the traditional transactional methods and the transactional net margin method, particularly where both parties to the transaction own valuable intangible property or unique assets used in the transaction that distinguish the transaction from those of potential competitors. In such cases the profit split method may be relevant although there may be practical problems in its application. 73.Inland Revenue acknowledges that comparable uncontrolled transactions may be particularly difficult to locate for New Zealand, given the size of our market and the nature of adjustments that might be required if overseas data is applied. In the absence of reliable comparable transactions, Inland Revenue considers the profit split method could represent a useful tool. If the method is to be used for more significant transactions, however, it may be prudent for taxpayers to consider whether there would be sufficient merit to seeking an APA. 74.Application of the profit split method requires that profit be allocated based on the relative contribution of each party to a transaction. Although this allocation ideally should be made by reference to how independent firms have allocated profits in similar transactions, it may not be essential to apply comparables in practice, particularly if locating comparables will not be a practicable exercise. 75.In such cases, profits will need to be allocated based on a subjective assessment of the relative contribution of each of the parties to the transaction. There is, however, no prescriptive way in which this judgement should be exercised, and each case will need to be assessed on its own facts and circumstances. In allocating profits, taxpayers should aim to determine compensation for each party that is consistent with each party’s functions, assets used and risks assumed in relation to the transaction (to put it another way, an appropriate allocation based on a sound functional analysis). 76.Second, in many cases, taxpayers will face difficulties in identifying reliable comparables on which to base a sound transfer pricing analysis. Taxpayers may then need to examine alternative approaches for performing an analysis. As paragraph 117 of the draft of Part 1 of the guidelines noted: in practice, the assessment of relative contribution may, of necessity, need to be a somewhat subjective measure based on the facts and circumstances of each case. 77.An important caveat should be noted in applying the profit split method. The subjective nature of the profit allocation between the parties means that the method might reasonably be considered the least reliable of the transfer pricing methods. Because of this, the method is perhaps less likely to be, or may not be, acceptable in foreign jurisdictions, particularly if an IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 11 alternative, more reliable, method can be applied. This has the potential to result in double taxation. 78.A further consideration is that the profit split method is predicated on an adequate level of information being available about the related party. Consequently, a taxpayer seeking to rely on the profit split method will need to ensure that appropriate information on the offshore party or parties can be made available if requested by Inland Revenue. Valuation-based approach to intangible property 79.The traditionally perceived role of comparables in analyses involving intangible property is that the comparables should be applied to support a transfer price for intangible property directly. For example, a CUP might be used to support the actual royalty rate adopted, or the cost plus method might be used to value a manufacturing function incorporating a production (trade) intangible. 80.In the absence of reliable comparables on which to base this more traditional analysis however, recourse might be made to determining an arm’s length price for the transfer of intangible property on a valuation-based approach. Such analyses are based on realistic projections of future benefits (paragraph 6.29) attributable to the intangible. In layman’s terms, it is the question, “how much extra value does the intangible create?” 81.Paragraph 6.29 of the OECD guidelines is drafted with specific reference to intangible property for which valuation is highly uncertain at the time of transfer. Inland Revenue considers that the specific difficulties created by the size of the New Zealand market means that the approach could usefully have broader application here than a superficial reading of the OECD guidelines might imply, particularly for determining arm’s length royalty rates. Taxpayers should be aware, however, that while Inland Revenue considers a broader ambit fully consistent with the tenor of the OECD guidelines, other tax administrations might not hold the same view. Applying a valuation-based approach 82.As a broad principle, the value of an item of intangible property is based on perceptions of its profit potential. More formally, this might be determined by calculating the net present value (NPV) of the expected benefits to be realised (potential profits or cost savings) through the exploitation of that property. 83.Example 2 illustrates this principle, and offers valuable insights into how: •an arm’s length price for a transfer of intangible property might legitimately be estimated in the absence of reliable comparables; or •comparables might be applied in a non-traditional manner to support the assumptions underlying a valuation approach to intangible property. Example 2 84.A New Zealand company is to be provided with intangible property that is expected to increase sales by $1 million for each of the next three years, but have no effect on sales beyond that time. Costs for those years will remain constant, except for an initial outlay of $500,000 to update machinery to utilise the property. There will be some risk to the company, and the risk- adjusted cost of capital is determined to be 20% (in practice, this would need to be based on commercial considerations). 85.The net present value of the cash flows for the intangible are calculated as follows: YearCash flowDiscountPresent ratevalue 0 Initial outlay( 500,000)1.000( 500,000) 1 Additional receipts1,000,0000.800 800,000 2 Additional receipts1,000,0000.640 640,000 3 Additional receipts1,000,0000.512 512,000 NPV (r = 20%): $1,452,000 86.Based on this calculation, the New Zealand company might be prepared to pay a royalty of up to $743,852 for each year (that royalty rate also having a NPV of $1,452,000). If it paid such a royalty, the company would still earn its required rate of return from the project: YearCash flowDiscountPresent ratevalue 0 Initial outlay( 500,000)1.000( 500,000) 1 Receipts less royalty 256,1480.800 204,918 2 Receipts less royalty 256,1480.640 163,934 3 Receipts less royalty 256,1480.512 131,148 NPV (r = 20%):$ 0 Observations on valuation approach 87.A couple of important principles for applying the arm’s length principle can be derived from considering the difficulties in making such NPV calculations in practice. 88.First, determination of the values for most of the variables applied in the NPV calculation (in particular, expected benefits and the appropriate discount rate) can be very subjective. Further, the arm’s length principle IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 12 does not appear to apply NPV calculations directly. However, in appraising how independent firms have valued intangible property, the arm’s length principle is implicitly testing what the market has established the variables in the NPV (or similar) calculation should be. 89.Consider, for example, a CUP that is being used to determine an arm’s length price for the transfer of intangible property. In negotiating their price, the independent firms would each have evaluated the profit potential of the intangible property. Although these evaluations may not have used formal NPV calculations, it is to be expected that they would at least have been based on some views of what the likely future income attributable to the intangible property would be, and the costs and risks involved in its exploitation. If a CUP is being used, therefore, the projections made by the uncontrolled participants in the market are implicitly forming the basis for establishing the transfer price in the controlled transaction. 90.Second, it is important to consider both parties to the transaction (paragraph 6.14), a point noted in paragraph 35. Example 2 determined the maximum value the transferee would be prepared to pay for the intangible property – the price commensurate with the value and usefulness of the intangible property in its business, given its risk-tolerance preference. At arm’s length, however, the transferor is unlikely to have access to the same information as the transferee, and may for example, based on its own perceptions of profit potential, be prepared to license the intangible property for a royalty of only $500,000 per year. The parties might then be expected to negotiate a royalty somewhere between these two reservation prices. 91.In principle, therefore, it should be possible to appraise intangible property without reference to comparables, and in the absence of reliable comparables or where only a limited amount of revenue is at issue, this may be the prudent approach for a taxpayer to take. Several cautions should, however, be noted. 92.First, ideally, transfer prices will be benchmarked against comparable transactions between independent firms, because this allows the reliability of assumptions made in performing NPV (or similar) calculations to be tested against a more objective base. The absence of one or more reliable comparables may reduce the credibility of the analysis. 93.Second, although Inland Revenue considers a valuation-based approach can be undertaken to fall broadly within the acceptable transfer pricing methods, this view may not be respected by other tax administrations. Double taxation may then result. Taxpayers should, therefore, exercise caution in adopting such an approach if the resulting analysis is also to be provided to justify the transfer price to an overseas tax administration. 94.Finally, the analysis in this section does not exhaust the theoretical underpinnings of valuation-based approaches. For example, it does not deal nicely with relatively immaterial transactions (because the size of the transaction is small relative to the overall size of operations), when cost of capital considerations may become unimportant in determining whether a transaction proceeds at a given price. If a valuation- based approach is to be adopted, particularly for larger value transactions, greater consideration will need to be given to the theoretical underpinnings of valuation techniques. At arm’s length, the value of intangible property is often ascertained from perceptions of its profit potential. This approach may also be feasible in many transfer pricing cases. The value of comparables is then found in the support they give to values adopted in that calculation, such as appropriate discount rates and whether independent firms would have been prepared to rely on the projections made in entering into the transaction on the terms agreed. Applying comparables in this manner is not essential, but is likely to add to the credibility of the analysis. For more complex or high-valued transactions, it may be prudent for taxpayers to consider the merits of seeking an APA. Valuation highly uncertain at time of transaction 95.The OECD guidelines, at paragraphs 6.28 to 6.35, discuss the application of the arm’s length principle to transfers of intangible property when valuation of that property is highly uncertain when it is transferred. One important issue in the discussion is whether tax administrations should be able to review the transfer price adopted by reference to a form of the arrangement that differs from that adopted by the taxpayer. 96.When the value of the intangible property is uncertain, the risks and rewards of transferring that property will typically be shared between the parties when it is transferred. A MNE might structure a transaction in a number of ways, depending on the level of risk, and the various types of risk, each of its members are to assume. For example, the initial owner of intangible property (see paragraphs 40 to 43) may choose to exploit that property with the following levels of market risk (paragraphs 6.29 to 6.31): •No risk:The developer sells the entire results of its development for a fixed sum, with the purchaser then assuming the entire risk of the commercial success or failure of the intangible. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 13 •Complete risk:The developer might manufacture and market the final product itself, using a contract distributor to get the product to the market. •Partial risk:The developer might retain ownership, but license the use of that property to another entity in return for some form of royalty. Such an arrangement results in risk being shared between the developer (the licensor) and the other party (the licensee). The developer’s royalty return depends on the level of sales by the other entity, and is subject, therefore, to market risk. The other entity’s return will similarly be dependent on how well the product performs in the market. Royalties with periodic adjustments are a subset of this category. 97.Given that the structure of the arrangement can be seen to be a way of sharing market, credit, country and other risks between the parties, the form of the transaction is not usually the most important aspect for transfer pricing purposes. Rather, the central issue in any audit activity should generally be whether the allocation of rewards, including the royalty rate set in a taxpayer’s arrangements, is consistent with the level of all the risks assumed by the taxpayer. This examination needs to be set in the context of the functional analysis for each parties’ actions. As with third party dealings, consideration should also be given to the circumstances of other dealings between the parties, and each party’s overall level of risk. An appropriate allocation of risk and reward would be determined by reference to what independent parties would have done in similar circumstances. 98.In evaluating a taxpayer’s transfer price, Inland Revenue will need to benchmark its analysis against an objective external standard. If the form of a taxpayer’s arrangement is unique, therefore, Inland Revenue might, in evaluating the transfer price adopted, need to look to: the arrangements that would have been made in comparable circumstances by independent enterprises ... Thus, if independent enterprises would have fixed the pricing based on a particular projection, the same approach should be used ... in evaluating the pricing. ... \[Inland Revenue\] could, for example, enquire into whether the associated enterprises made adequate projections, taking into account all the developments that were reasonably foreseeable, without using hindsight (paragraph 6.32). 99.As with other transfer pricing issues, taxpayers are in the best position to ensure there are no surprises in the way Inland Revenue reviews their transfer prices. This can be achieved by documenting, in as much detail as prudent, why a transaction has been structured in the way it has, and how the components of that price have been determined by reference to what independent parties in similar circumstances would have done. 100.Further, the more thorough a taxpayer’s analysis, the less likely it will be that the Commissioner will be able to meet the burden of proof required if the taxpayer’s determination of the arm’s length price is to be overturned. Taxpayers should consider costs, risks and benefits in determining the extent to which they should develop and document their policy, as indicated in the previously published draft chapter on documentation. Use of standard international royalty rate 101.One question that is often posed is whether a royalty rate established as arm’s length in relation to one member of a MNE will be accepted automatically by Inland Revenue as also being arm’s length in relation to New Zealand. This issue is discussed in the example 3. Example 3 102.A United States company licences technology to a number of subsidiaries around the world. A comprehensive analysis has been performed to support that an arm’s length royalty rate for its Japanese subsidiary is 7%. On the basis of this analysis, the company also charges the same royalty rate to all of its other subsidiaries. The question arises as to whether Inland Revenue will accept 7% as an arm’s length royalty rate for the New Zealand subsidiary. 103.There are two issues in this question. First, there is the question of whether 7% is actually an arm’s length royalty rate for the Japanese subsidiary. Second, if it is an arm’s length rate for Japan, are the economic features of the New Zealand and Japanese markets sufficiently similar that the same royalty rate should be expected to apply in both markets? (a)7% is an arm’s length royalty for Japan 104.Even if 7% is an arm’s length royalty rate for Japan, it is still necessary to examine the relative economics of the New Zealand and Japanese markets to test whether 7% is also appropriate for New Zealand. If the differences between the markets were relatively small, 7% would be an appropriate royalty rate for New Zealand. However, if significant differences exist, adjustments could be made to reflect these if they can be valued. 105.At arm’s length, both the licensor and licensee will look at profit potential from intangible property in negotiating a royalty rate. If markets are different, potential profits from those markets are also likely to differ, and so too would acceptable royalty rates. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 14 (b)Arm’s length royalty for Japan is not 7% 106.From an alternative perspective, even if 7% is not an arm’s length royalty rate for the Japanese subsidiary, it may still be an arm’s length rate for the New Zealand subsidiary. For example, it might be determined that an arm’s length royalty rate for Japan is only 5%, but that a 2% premium is justified by the geographical differences between Japan and New Zealand. 107.Significantly, even though incorrect analysis might have been used to ascertain the 7% royalty rate for New Zealand, the important thing is that a correct royalty rate has been determined. There would, therefore, be no justification for Inland Revenue to attempt to substitute an alternative royalty rate under section GD 13. Marketing activities of enterprises not owning marketing intangible 108.Marketing activities are often undertaken by enterprises that do not own the trademarks or trade names they promote. The question is how the marketer should be compensated for those services. Two key issues arise: •Should the marketer be compensated as a service provider or might it be entitled to a share in any additional return attributable to the marketing intangibles? •How should the return attributable to marketing intangibles be identified? 109.Whether the marketer is entitled to a return on the marketing intangibles above a normal return on marketing activities will depend on the obligations and rights implied by the agreement between the parties (paragraph 6.37) – in other words, what compensation would an independent party have sought given its rights and obligations under the agreement. The OECD guidelines contain a couple of illustrative examples: •A distributor acting merely as agent and being reimbursed for its promotional expenditure would be entitled to compensation appropriate to its agency activity, but not to any share in returns attributable to marketing intangibles (paragraph 6.37). •A distributor bearing the cost of its own marketing activity would expect to share in the potential benefits of those activities (paragraph 6.38). However, it is important to consider the rights of the distributor in determining whether any extra return is justified. For example: •The distributor may benefit directly from its investment in developing the value of a trademark from its turnover and market share if it has a long-term sole distribution contract for the trademarked product. •Unless a distributor bears expenditure beyond that which an independent distributor with similar rights would bear, there is no justification for it to receive an additional margin relative to an independent distributor. 110.A further factor to consider, not explicitly addressed above, is the extent to which the distributor is bearing real risk, relative to independent firms in the market. If a controlled distributor were bearing relatively greater risk than comparable independent firms, it would, prima facie, also be expected to derive a greater margin from its activities. 111.Example 4, adapted from examples 2 & 3 of the United States section 482 regulations at 1.482-4(f)(3)(iv), illustrates these principles further. Example 4 112.Gizmo Co owns all of the worldwide rights for a name. The name is widely known outside New Zealand, but is not known within New Zealand. Gizmo Co decides to enter the New Zealand market and establishes a subsidiary here, to distribute in New Zealand and to undertake the advertising and other marketing efforts required to establish the name in the New Zealand market. 113.The New Zealand subsidiary incurs expenses in developing the New Zealand market that are not reimbursed by Gizmo Co. However, the level of these expenses are comparable to those incurred by independent firms in the same industry when introducing a product in the New Zealand market under a brand name owned by a foreign manufacturer. 114.Because the subsidiary would have been expected to incur the development expenses if it were unrelated to Gizmo Co, no adjustment needs to be made in respect of the marketing expenses. 115.The situation would be different, however, if the subsidiary incurred expenses that are significantly larger than would independent firms under similar circumstances. Expenses incurred in excess of the level incurred by independent firms should be treated as a service to Gizmo Co, as they effectively represent a service adding to the value of Gizmo Co’s intangible property. 116.There is a caveat to this conclusion. The analysis does not contemplate whether the price for the product being transferred is arm’s length. If, for example, the New Zealand subsidiary were undercharged for the product it receives, this would compensate for its excessive expenses. When both the transfer price for the product and the expenses are considered together, it may be determined that there is no overall transfer pricing issue. This observation also illustrates that it may often IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 15 not be appropriate to stop with an analysis at the gross level. From Gizmo Co’s perspective, charging inadequate consideration would reduce its gross margin relative to comparable firms. However, this is offset by the New Zealand subsidiary not charging explicitly for its services, which reduces the costs Gizmo Co would recognise in calculating its net profit. Allocating return attributable to marketing intangibles 117.Identifying the return attributable to marketing activities if it is to be allocated between the parties to a transaction is not straightforward (paragraph 6.39). The OECD guidelines identify several difficult questions that must be considered in identifying the amount of any return: •To what extent have advertising and marketing activities contributed to the production or revenue from a product? •What value, if any, did a trademark have when introduced into a new market – it is possible that its value in a particular market is wholly attributable to its promotion in that market. •·Does a higher return for a trademarked product relative to other products in the market trace back to the marketing of the product, its superior characteristics relative to other products, or a mixture of both? 118.Little guidance can be given on how these questions should be evaluated, and each case will need to be determined based on its own facts and circumstances. However, as with the general application of the arm’s length principle, taxpayers should aim to determine transfer prices that result in the compensation a distributor receives for its marketing activity being consistent with what an independent entity would have accepted given similar rights and obligations. Summary 119.This chapter has considered the following key points: •Intangible property poses some special difficulties in determining the arm’s length price, particularly because of the complexity of some arrangements and the difficulties in identifying comparable transactions. •If one party to a transaction does not contribute intangible property, the most straightforward analysis is likely to involve using that party as the “tested party”, even if it is outside New Zealand. •Two particular areas where sufficient care is often not taken are: •A local operation is meeting costs for maintaining intellectual property that an independent party would not be required to meet, while at the same time paying the same amount as the independent firm for property it acquires (a double deduction). •Analysis being based on what outwardly appear to be reliable comparables but that are not reliable, because the nature of intangible property (potentially high price variations for differences that superficially appear quite small) has not been considered adequately. •In many cases (particularly using the profit split method), the analysis of intangible property may need to be based on a subjective judgement with limited recourse to reliable comparables. In exercising such judgement, taxpayers will need to be conscious that the final result should seek to ensure that each party to the transaction obtains a return that is broadly consistent with its functions performed, assets employed and risks assumed in relation to the transaction involving the intangible property. •Valuing intangible property based on realistic projections of future benefits may be an appropriate response to the limited availability of comparables in the New Zealand market, particularly in relation to determining arm’s length royalty rates. •When dealing with marketing activities of firms that do not own the marketing intangible, it is important to ensure that their compensation is commensurate with what independent entities would have accepted given the rights and obligations under the arrangement. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 16 INTRA-GROUP SERVICES Key Points •The OECD guidelines identify two key issues in the treatment of intra-group services: •Has a service been provided? •If so, how should the arm’s length price be determined? •The central test of whether an intra-group service is provided is whether the recipient of an activity receives something that an independent enterprise in comparable circumstances would have been prepared to pay for or perform for itself in-house. •The arm’s length price can be determined using either: •a direct charge approach, when charges are identified for specific services; or •an indirect charge approach, when costs are indirectly allocated against all services provided in determining a cost base on which charges are to be determined. •The costs attributable to a particular service will often not be able to be discerned directly, meaning that an indirect cost allocation will need to be applied: •An appropriate allocation key will need to be used, based on the facts and circumstances of each case. •The key focus is a realistic allocation, not accounting perfection – Inland Revenue is looking for a fair charge for the services provided and a reasonable effort into establishing a basis for future calculations. Key issues in intra-group services 124.The OECD guidelines, in paragraph 7.5, identify two key questions in applying the arm’s length principle to intra-group services: •Has an intra-group service in fact been provided? •If so, what charge for that service is consistent with the arm’s length principle? Has a service been provided? 125.Each case must be tested on its own facts and circumstances (paragraph 7.7). However, as a general rule, the central issue in determining whether an intra- group service has been provided will be whether the recipient of an activity receives something that an independent firm in comparable circumstances would have been willing to pay for or would have performed in- house for itself. If the activity is not one for which the independent enterprise would have been willing to pay or perform for itself, the activity ordinarily should not be considered as an intra-group service under the arm’s length principle (paragraph 7.6). 126.The OECD guidelines contain several examples that illustrate this principle: •If a service is performed to meet an identified need of one or more specific members of the group, an intra-group service would ordinarily be found to exist, because an independent party Introduction 120.Chapter 7 of the OECD guidelines discusses the application of the arm’s length principle in relation to intra-group services. Inland Revenue fully endorses the OECD position on intra-group services. 121.Essentially, this chapter summarises the material in the OECD guidelines. For greater detail, recourse should be made to those guidelines. 122.This chapter does, however, discuss issues that will be of particular interest to Inland Revenue in administering the transfer pricing rules. The discussion includes, for example, an analysis of possible allocation keys that might be applied in determining the cost base if the cost-plus method is to be applied to determine the arm’s length price. 123.Inland Revenue expects that cost allocations will be commonly employed in determining an arm’s length price for services. This being the case, however, it is important not to lose sight of the big picture. Inland Revenue is looking for a realistic allocation of costs (with due regard to considerations of materiality), not accounting perfection. Ultimately, the test is whether a fair charge is determined for services provided to a related company from the perspective of both the provider and the recipient. Inland Revenue would also expect to see that taxpayers have put a reasonable effort into establishing a framework from which the price for future services can be readily determined. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 17 would be willing to pay to have that need met (paragraph 7.8). •“Shareholder activities” performed because of an ownership interest in a group member (such as meetings of the shareholders of the parent company of the group) would not justify a charge to the recipient company, because the group members do not need the activity (paragraph 7.9). •An incidental benefit derived by a group member from an activity performed for another group member does not mean that it has received a service, because independent enterprises would not be willing to pay for the activities giving rise to the benefit (paragraph 7.12). •An “on call” service may be an intra-group service to the extent that it would be reasonable to expect an independent enterprise in comparable circumstances to incur ‘standby’ charges to ensure the availability of the services when the need for them arises (paragraph 7.16). 127.The OECD guidelines also confirm that the provision of centralised services by a parent company or a group service centre and made available to some or all members of the group will ordinarily be treated as intra- group services. Paragraph 7.14 contains an illustrative list of a number of centralised services that are likely to be intra-group services because independent enterprises would be willing to pay for or perform them for themselves: •Administrative services: •planning, co-ordination, budgetary control, financial advice, accounting, auditing, legal, factoring, computer services; •Financial services: •supervision of cash flows and solvency, capital increases, loan contracts, management of interest and exchange rate risks, and refinancing; •Assistance in the fields of production, purchasing, distribution and marketing; •Services in staff matters such as recruitment and training; •Research and development or administration and protection of intangible property for all or part of the MNE group. Central test for intra-group service: Does the recipient of an activity receive something that an independent enterprise in comparable circumstances would have been prepared to pay for or perform for itself in-house? If so, that activity will ordinarily be treated as an intra-group service. Determining an arm’s length charge 128.Once it has been determined that a service has been provided, the issue is to determine what would constitute an arm’s length charge. As with other transactions, the arm’s length charge is one that is consistent with what would have been charged and accepted in a transaction between independent enterprises in comparable circumstances. 129.The OECD guidelines identify two general approaches to determining arm’s length prices for intra- group services. Which approach is followed will tend to depend on whether each service provided and its recipient is identified separately, or whether the services are more generic in nature and their recipients not specifically identified. 130.The direct-charge approach can be applied when a member of the group is charged for specific services. In principle, it should be a relatively straightforward exercise to determine the arm’s length price for that service, either by reference to the charge for that service when provided to independent third parties (an internal CUP) or by reference to charges made for comparable services between independent firms. 131.The indirect-charge approach may be applied if the direct-charge approach is impractical, or if arrangements within the group are not readily identifiable and either incorporated into the charge for other transfers, allocated among group members on some basis, or in some cases not allocated among group members at all (paragraph 7.22). In such cases, cost allocation and apportionment approaches, often with some degree of estimation or approximation, may need to be used (paragraph 7.23). 132.Examples in the OECD guidelines of when the indirect-charge approach may be applicable include: •The proportion of the value of the services rendered to various members of a group cannot be quantified except on an approximate basis (for example, central sales promotion activities). •Separate recording and analysis of the relevant service activity for each beneficiary would involve a burden of administrative work disproportionate to the activities themselves (paragraph 7.24). 133.If a specific service forms part of the provider’s main business activity and is provided both to members of the group and to third parties, the direct-charge approach generally should be applied as a matter of course (paragraph 7.23). The method by which the services provided to third parties are priced should also be able to be applied to services provided within the group. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 18 Applying a pricing method 134.In applying the arm’s length principle to intra- group services, it is necessary to consider both the provider and the recipient of the service. The price charged for the service should not be more than an independent recipient in similar circumstances would be willing to pay (a test of benefits received). Similarly, an independent supplier would not be prepared to offer the service below a certain price. Costs incurred by the service provider will be a relevant consideration in determining what this reservation price is (paragraph 7.29). 135.In practice, the CUP and cost plus methods tend to be most widely used in determining arm’s length prices for intra-group services. However, there is no reason why other methods should not be used if they result in the determination of an arm’s length price. 136.The CUP method is likely to be used if there is a comparable service provided between independent enterprises in the recipient’s market, or the service is also provided to independent parties under similar circumstances to which it is provided to another group member (paragraph 7.31). However, care would need to be taken to ensure that necessary adjustments are made to reflect differences in comparability. 137.For example, there may be overheads borne by an independent firm that a MNE may not need to incur, such as promotional activities to obtain new and retain existing clients, the costs of obtaining professional indemnities, and any other differences in the functions performed by the MNE and the comparable firm. Such differences would require adjustments in determining an arm’s length charge for the MNE. 138.The cost plus method is widely used because, in many cases, the difficulty of identifying market prices and the general objectivity with which costs can be identified and measured make it the most practicable and reliable method to apply. The costs associated with the provision of a service are first identified (a discussion on how costs might be determined indirectly is set out below). Reference is then made to services provided by independent firms in comparable circumstances to determine what, if any, mark-up would be added at arm’s length. 139.When applying the cost plus method, it is important to ensure that the functions for which a margin is being determined are comparable. If the MNE provides only an agency function, it would not be appropriate to use the mark-up added by an independent distributor as an unadjusted comparable. Having said that, the reliability of the cost allocation is likely, in practice, to be a more material issue than the reliability of the mark-up adopted. In this regard, taxpayers may find the administrative practice set out in paragraphs 166 to 176 of some assistance. Profit element 140.In an arm’s length transaction, an independent enterprise would normally seek to earn a profit from providing services, rather than merely charging them out at cost. However, there may be circumstances when services would be provided without a profit element. The OECD guidelines give the following examples: •The costs of providing the service are greater than an independent recipient would be prepared to pay, but the service complements the provider’s activities in a way that increases its overall profitability (for example, providing the service generates goodwill) (paragraph 7.33). •For whatever reason, an incidental service is provided in-house when it could have been sourced more cheaply from an independent party (a CUP). In this case, the CUP would be the arm’s length price, rather than a price based on the costs incurred by the service provider (paragraph 7.34). 141.Thus it will not always be the case that the arm’s length price will reflect a profit for the service provider (paragraph 7.33). Determining the cost base for cost- plus method 142.Paragraph 7.23 of the OECD guidelines notes that: “Any indirect-charge method should be sensitive to the commercial features of the individual case (eg, the allocation key makes sense under the circumstances), contains safeguards against manipulation and follow sound accounting principles, and be capable of producing charges or allocations of costs that are commensurate with the actual or reasonably expected benefits to the recipient of the service.” 143.There are a number of allocation keys that might be applied to allocate costs between members of a group. The OECD guidelines, for example, make reference to allocation keys based on turnover, staff employed, and capital applied (paragraph 7.25). The following discussion, which moves beyond the material in the OECD guidelines, considers the strengths and weaknesses of various allocation keys that might be applied. Whether one of the keys, in the form discussed below or in an adapted form, might be appropriate will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. 144.In performing cost allocations, it is important not to lose sight of the big picture. Inland Revenue is looking for a realistic allocation of costs, not accounting perfection. Taxpayers should be seeking to determine a fair charge for services provided to a subsidiary, and at the same time, making a reasonable effort to establish a coherent basis for determining the price for future IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 19 services. 145.It is also important that taxpayers perform any cost allocation with regard to the services are being provided. The question is what costs are being incurred to provide a service. Care must, therefore, be taken to exclude costs that do not relate to the services under consideration. 146.If taxpayers are in any doubt over an appropriate cost allocation, they may find it useful to discuss the allocation they propose with their account manager in Inland Revenue. Alternatively, they could contact Keith Edwards, the National Advisor (Transfer Pricing), on (09) 367-1340. 147.While any advice would not be binding on Inland Revenue, it may give taxpayers a useful insight into how Inland Revenue may approach the issue. If more certainty is required, taxpayers could consider applying for an APA. Global formula approach 148.One approach is to apportion costs on the arbitrary basis of gross turnover of the worldwide group as follows: New Zealand gross salesx Costs to be allocated Worldwide group’s gross sales 149.The global formula approach does not always arrive at a reasonable or realistic result. Deficiencies in the approach include the inappropriate allocation across all subsidiaries of: •Start-up costs of new subsidiaries. •Costs relating to specific functions performed for, or product lines carried by, only certain members of the group. •Charges for services available to the group but not taken advantage of by all of its members. 150.Another issue to be aware of concerns the level of costs associated with certain activities. For example, a MNE may derive its income from a number of sources, such as product sales, providing services and leasing assets. However, the ratio of income to expenditure may not be uniform across all these income types, with some types of income having higher valued inputs per dollar of output. 151.It may, therefore, be appropriate to associate the income and expenditure with the relevant functions. Then, once the specific functions of the New Zealand enterprise have been identified, the costs relating to functions that the New Zealand enterprise performs could be allocated as follows: Gross New Zealand turnoverxNet central expenditure on for relevant functionsrelevant functions Gross worldwide turnover for relevant functions Time expended 152.When dealing with the service industry, it is common to talk in units of time expended to perform a task. When a central service provider performs functions for the group as a whole, therefore, it may be appropriate to allocate costs based on the amount of time expended on providing services to each member of the group. 153.If services are provided that have varying degrees of value (for example, the provision of both specialist technical assistance and general clerical activities), an allocation based only on time spent may not be appropriate. Instead, the costs should be determined for each category of service provided by the central service provider. Costs associated with each category might then be allocated between members of the group based on time spent providing those services. 154.It should be noted that the purpose of dividing costs between categories of service is to ascertain an allocation of costs between members of the group that better reflects the benefits they derive. In undertaking this division, however, taxpayers should not attempt to over-refine their service categorisation. In many cases, the gains in accuracy from further refining the service categorisation will not be sufficient to justify the additional cost of performing the further analysis. Inland Revenue would, however, expect taxpayers to record the basis for any cut-off decision. 155.If a group is not completely service oriented, the costs of the service provider will need to be divided to identify those expenses associated with the service industry. Income producing units 156.Corporations in the business of leasing plant and equipment are generally able to identify the generation of income from the utilisation of specific units. Expenditure incurred in producing the income can also be more readily identified. Once it is determined what assets the New Zealand operation is leasing out, as compared to the leasing of assets by the worldwide group, centralised costs might be allocated based on the number of units being utilised. This principle is illustrated in example 5. Example 5 157.A New Zealand shipping company charters ships that it owns. In allocating head office costs incurred by a foreign parent, it is likely to be appropriate to make an allocation of head office costs relating to chartered vessels over the number of chartered vessels worldwide. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 20 However, it is not likely to be appropriate to allocate head office charges of the group’s entire shipping operations over the number of ships operated and leased. This type of allocation does not recognise that different types of ships have different costs – for example, support vessels for oil exploration and production platforms as contrasted with roll-on roll-off freighters. 158.If only support vessels are present in New Zealand it is appropriate only to identify the world costs applicable to support vessels. It is also necessary to distinguish between those vessels leased fully manned and bareboat charters. 159.Once the relevant costs have been identified, they could be allocated as follows: Support vessels in New Zealand x Allocation expenditure Support vessels worldwide whether working or not Gross profit allocation basis 160.There will be situations where allocating costs on the basis of gross revenue will not be appropriate. This may be through an inability to make like comparison of the turnover of the various members of a group, because the mix of activities is not consistent throughout the group and some activities may require greater support than others. For example, one member’s gross turnover may be distorted by a high turnover activity, conducted only by that member, that generates little, if any, profit and requires relatively less assistance to administer (for example, a lease that is sub-leased or a contract that is sub-contracted). 161.In this situation, it may be worthwhile exploring the possibility of allocating costs on the basis of relative gross profits instead. Income from non-active business sources would need to be excluded. Whether this approach is appropriate will depend on the circumstances of the case and whether it results in a fair allocation. Other methods 162.There are various other keys that might be employed to allocate central expenditure. These include, for example, units produced, material used, and number of employees. However, as with any other key, use of alternative keys would need to provide a cost allocation that is consistent with the benefit derived by the New Zealand entity. Pitfalls and potential audit issues 163.One obvious issue for taxpayers is what needs to be done to minimise the likelihood that Inland Revenue will attempt to adjust taxpayers’ transfer prices. Provided taxpayers adopt transfer pricing that is consistent with the principles expressed earlier in the chapter, they should have few difficulties. 164.There are, however, certain areas where audit experience indicates mistakes are commonly made: •Charges are made for services that do not meet the test of whether an intra-group service has been provided, such as the charging by a parent of shareholder activities. •Errors are made in determining the cost base when the cost-plus method is applied, such as the use of a cost allocation key that is inappropriate for a taxpayer’s circumstances. •Taxpayers have taken a double deduction, for example, by including a service fee implicitly in a license fee while charging separately in allocating group service centre costs (paragraph 7.26). 165.Taxpayers should be conscious of these issues in determining their transfer prices. Administrative practice for services 166.As a general rule, Inland Revenue does not endorse the use of safe harbours. This is because they can result in prices being determined that are clearly inconsistent with the arm’s length principle but are consistent with the safe harbour. One example is the previously mentioned incidental service provided in- house where the costs alone of providing the service exceed a CUP for the service. 167.Inland Revenue is conscious, however, of the desirability of minimising compliance costs, particularly if this can be achieved without compromising the integrity of the arm’s length principle. To this end, Inland Revenue will, with the exception of the level of the de minimis threshold, be following the administrative practice of the Australian Tax Office for services (Australian Tax Office Ruling TR 99/1 refers). It should be noted, however, that taxpayers are not obliged to follow the administrative practice. They can, if they prefer, follow the normal application of the arm’s length principle in determining their transfer pricing for services. 168.The administrative practice applies to: •Non-core services. These services refer to activities that are not integral to the profit-earning or economically significant activities of the group. They include activities that are supportive of the group’s main business and are generally routine but are not similar to activities by which the group derives its income; and •·Services with costs below a de minimis threshold. This will apply when the total direct and indirect costs of supplying services to New Zealand or foreign associated enterprises, as appropriate, is not more than $100,000 in a year. The practice IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 21 applies to all intra-group services supplied or acquired where the relevant cost limit is not exceeded. 169.It is considered that the use of transfer prices permitted by the administrative practice will give rise to a realistic prices that still approximate arm’s length pricing. 170.The criteria for the administrative practices are set out in Table 3.

A transfer price of up to cost plus 10% of relevant costs would be accepted for non-core services supplied by associated enterprises resident in a particular foreign country where it is established by the taxpayer’s group that it is the practice of that country to require that price for the services for its tax purposes, and to accept such prices (or mark-ups) for similar services supplied by New Zealand companies to associated enterprises resident in that country (ie, that the other country does or would be expected to accept symmetrical mark-ups for such services). Therefore, the New Zealand group may use different prices in respect of services acquired from associated enterprises in different countries, but none that exceed cost plus 10% of relevant costs. 172.Similarly, a transfer price not less than cost plus 5% of relevant costs but less than cost plus 7.5% of relevant costs would be accepted for non-core services supplied to associated enterprises resident in a particular foreign country where it is established by the taxpayer’s group that it is the practice of that country to require, for its tax purposes, that the price for the services be no higher than the selected price, and to accept such prices (or mark-ups) as an upper limit for similar services supplied by an associated enterprise in that country to New Zealand companies (i.e., that the other country does or would be expected to accept symmetrical mark-ups for such services). Again, the New Zealand company group might use different transfer prices for services supplied to associated enterprises in different countries, but none less than cost plus 5% of relevant costs. 173.All companies in the group must use the same mark-up on costs for services supplied to, or acquired from, associated enterprises in the same country, if they are relying on the administrative practice. Caveat to administrative practice 174.The administrative practice does not absolve taxpayers from the requirement to establish that a service (i.e., a benefit) has actually been supplied. If no service has been supplied, then no charge would be made at arm’s length. The administrative practice does not override this. 175.To rely on the administrative practices, the taxpayer (whether a supplier or recipient of services) must maintain documentation to establish the nature and extent of services supplied/acquired and to address the issues (as far as is relevant) considered in calculating the relevant total costs. If the taxpayer wishes to use a mark- up other than 7.5% (see paragraphs 171 and 172), documentation of other countries’ practices to support that choice should be kept. Further, a record of the relevant group companies should be retained. 176.If taxpayers require further information on the application of the administrative practice, they should contact their account manager, or Keith Edwards, the National Advisor (Transfer Pricing), on (09) 367-1340. Practical solutions 177.Determining arm’s length prices must remain a practicable exercise. The aim of the exercise is to determine practically an arm’s length price, rather than attempting to over-refine the analysis which, at the end of the day, may not actually result in a more reliable measure of the arm’s length price being determined. 178.The OECD guidelines themselves note that while an attempt should be made to establish the proper arm’s length pricing, there may be practical reasons why a tax administration, exceptionally, might forgo accuracy in favour of practicability (paragraph 7.37). As indicated in the chapter on documentation, taxpayers should trade-off the risks and benefits in determining its transfer pricing policies. Taxpayers should, however, record the basis for any cut-off decision. Summary 179.This chapter has considered the following key points: •There are two central questions to be addressed: •Has a service been provided? •If so, how should the arm’s length price be determined? •The central test of whether a service has been provided is whether the recipient of an activity receives something that an independent enterprise in comparable circumstances would have been prepared to: •pay for it; or •perform the service for itself in-house. •The most common methods applied to services are the CUP and cost plus methods. •When the cost plus method is applied, costs might be identified directly if a direct-charge approach is used, or indirectly using an appropriate allocation key. •If a cost allocation is being used, taxpayers should seek to identify a realistic allocation of costs with due regard to considerations of materiality, and not for accounting perfection – the real test is whether a fair charge is determined for the services provided. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 23 •In auditing the transfer prices adopted for intra- group services, Inland Revenue is most likely to focus on: •whether a service has been provided; •if an indirect-charge approach is taken to applying the cost plus method, whether the allocation key used is appropriate; and •whether the approach adopted results in a double deduction through both an explicit and an implicit charge being made. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 24 COST CONTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS (CCAS) Key Points •A CCA is a contractual arrangement whereby the contracting parties agree to contribute costs in proportion to their overall expected benefits from the arrangement. •To satisfy the arm’s length principle, a participant’s contribution must be consistent with what an independent enterprise would have agreed to pay in comparable circumstances. •Difficulties can arise in measuring the value of a participant’s contribution and the expected value of its benefits. Participants should ensure that any judgement made leads to commercially justifiable conclusions. 184.There are a number of significant issues that have not yet been resolved by the OECD (paragraph 8.1). The OECD guidelines appear likely to be developed further, therefore, as member countries gain experience in applying the arm’s length principle to CCAs. 185.There may also be an issue over whether CCAs will be acceptable in overseas jurisdictions. For example, some jurisdictions may limit the use of CCAs to the development of intangible property, while others may not recognise them at all. If a CCA is not recognised in an overseas jurisdiction, there is potential for double taxation to occur. 186.The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the OECD guidelines on CCAs. The discussion is not, however, exhaustive of issues canvassed in the OECD guidelines. For example, the OECD guidelines contain a detailed discussion on documents that would be useful to document adequately a CCA (paragraphs 8.41 to 8.43). If a taxpayer does intend entering into CCA, the OECD guidelines are essential reading before entering into the arrangement. Applying arm’s length principle to CCAs 187.For a CCA to satisfy the arm’s length principle, a participant’s contribution must be consistent with what an independent enterprise would have agreed to pay in comparable circumstances (paragraph 8.8). 188.Independent enterprises would require that each participant’s proportionate share of the actual overall contributions to the CCA be consistent with the participant’s proportionate share of the overall expected benefits to be received under the arrangement (paragraph 8.9). 189.Applying the arm’s length principle to CCAs, therefore, requires the determination of: •the participants in the CCA; •each participant’s relative contribution to the joint activity; and Introduction 180.Chapter 8 of the OECD guidelines discusses the application of the arm’s length principle in relation to cost contribution arrangements (CCAs). Inland Revenue fully endorses the position established in those guidelines. 181.A CCA is a framework agreed among business enterprises to share the costs and risks of developing, producing or obtaining assets, services, or rights. It also determines the nature and extent of the interest of each participant in those assets, services, or rights. It is a contractual arrangement under which a member’s share of contributions should be consistent with its expected benefits from the arrangement. Each member is also entitled to exploit its interest in the CCA separately as an effective owner, rather than as a licensee – it does not need to pay a royalty or other consideration for that right (paragraph 8.3). There is no standard framework for a CCA – each arrangement will depend on its own unique facts and circumstances. 182.A CCA should be distinguished from the scenario where members of a MNE jointly fund a new entity which then develops and exploits intangible property in its own right. In that case, the new entity will own any intangible property that it creates, and would be expected to derive an arm’s length return from the exploitation of that intangible. The return to the members funding the new entity would be based on the form of capital contributed (for example, interest paid on debt or dividends paid on equity), rather than by benefiting directly from the intangible property. 183.The OECD guidelines suggest that the most likely area in which CCAs will arise will relate to the development of intangible property. However, the guidelines note that CCAs may also be used for any joint funding activity, such as centralised management services or developing advertising campaigns common to the participants’ markets (paragraphs 8.6 and 8.7). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 25 •the appropriate allocation of contributions, based on each participant’s expected benefits. Identification of participants 190.Because the concept of mutual benefit is fundamental to a CCA, a participant must have a reasonable expectation that it will benefit from the CCA activity itself. A participant must receive a beneficial interest in the property or services that are the subject of the CCA activity and have a reasonable expectation of being able to exploit that interest, directly or indirectly. 191.A member of the MNE that performs part of the CCA activity but does not stand to benefit from the outcome of the CCA activity cannot be a participant of the CCA. Instead, it should be compensated by way of an arm’s length charge for the services it performs for the CCA. This principle is illustrated in example 6. Example 6 192.Three members of a MNE marketing a product in the same regional market in which consumers have similar preferences, want to enter a CCA to develop a joint advertising campaign. A fourth member of the MNE helps develop the advertising campaign, but does not itself market the product. 193.The fourth member will not be a participant in the CCA, both because it does not receive a beneficial interest in the services subject to the CCA activity and would not, in any case, have a reasonable expectation of being able to exploit any interest. The three participants in the CCA would, therefore, compensate the fourth member by way of an arm’s length payment for the advertising services provided to the CCA. Amount of participant’s contribution 194.As contributions are to be made to a CCA in proportion to expected benefits, it is necessary to be able to value each member’s contribution. Following the arm’s length principle, the value of each participant’s contribution is the value that independent enterprises would have assigned to the contribution in comparable circumstances. 195.Contributions to a CCA could be monetary or non-monetary in nature. Non-monetary contributions might include, for example, the use of a participant’s existing intangible assets or the provision of services by a participant. 196.When the contribution is cash, its value can easily be quantified. There are, however, a number of difficulties in valuing non-monetary contributions that have not yet been fully resolved in the OECD guidelines. For example: •Should cost or market value be used in valuing contributions? •How should the value of property or services provided be apportioned when they are only partly applied in the CCA activity with the balance applied in the provider’s other activities? 197.These issues will need to be resolved on a facts and circumstances basis. The key consideration, however, is to ensure that the valuation approach adopted is commercially justifiable, and that independent firms would have been prepared to accept the terms of the CCA given the valuations adopted. Appropriateness of allocation 198.While a participant’s contribution must be consistent with its expected benefits if a CCA is to satisfy the arm’s length principle, there is, however, no universal rule for estimating the expected benefits to be obtained by each participant in a CCA (paragraph 8.19). Possible techniques include (but are not limited to): •Estimation based on anticipated additional income that will be generated or costs that will be saved as a result of entering the CCA. •The use of an appropriate allocation key, perhaps based on sales, units used, produced or sold, gross or operating profits, numbers of employees, capital invested, or alternative keys. 199.Again, appraisal of the appropriateness of the cost allocations will be based on facts and circumstances. The key consideration, however, is to ensure the benefits estimated are consistent with the benefits that an independent firm might have expected to receive from the CCA. Balancing payments 200.Balancing payments may be required to adjust participants’ proportionate shares of contributions (paragraph 8.18). If, for example, a participant’s contribution exceeds its expected share of the benefits from the CCA, a payment should be made to that participant from the other participants so that its contributions and expected benefits are reconciled. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 26 Tax treatment of contributions and balancing payments 201.The tax treatment of contributions to a CCA will depend on the character of the payment. If the expenditure would be deductible if it were to be incurred outside the CCA, the expenditure will be deductible. If, however, the expenditure would be treated as capital expenditure if it were to be incurred outside the CCA, the expenditure will be non-deductible. 202.A balancing payment is treated as an addition to the costs of a payer and as a reimbursement (reduction) of costs to the recipient. If a balancing payment exceeds the recipient’s deductible expenditures, the tax treatment of the excess payment will depend on what the payment is made for. 203.No part of a contribution or balancing payment in respect of a CCA will constitute a royalty for the use of intangible property, because each participant in the CCA receives a right to exploit intangible property arising from the CCA by virtue of being a participant in the CCA. Conclusions on applying arm’s length principle to CCAs 204.The proceeding discussion suggests that it may be difficult to locate comparable data on which to apply the arm’s length principle to CCAs. Participants to a CCA may, therefore, need to depend on the exercise of “commercially justifiable” judgement in determining the value of the contributions and the expected benefits of each participant. Each case will depend on its own facts and circumstances. 205.Taxpayers should ensure in particular that: •valuations of non-cash contributions to a CCA are consistent for each party’s contribution and commercially justifiable; and •expected benefits are estimated in such a way that an independent enterprise would be prepared to use the outcome of the estimation as a basis for determining whether it would accept the terms of the CCA. Structure of CCA 206.Paragraph 8.40 of the OECD guidelines lists a number of conditions that a CCA at arm’s length would ordinarily meet. These conditions, set out below, may provide a useful guide when formulating a CCA. (a)The participants would include only enterprises expected to derive mutual benefits from the CCA activity itself, either directly or indirectly (and not just from performing part or all of the activity). (b)The arrangement would specify the nature and extent of each participant’s beneficial interest in the results of the CCA activity. (c)No payment other than the CCA contributions, appropriate balancing payments and buy-in payments would be made for the beneficial interest in property, services, or rights obtained through the CCA. (d)The proportionate shares of contributions would be determined in a proper manner using an allocation method reflecting the sharing of expected benefits from the arrangement. (e)The arrangement would allow for balancing payments or for the allocation of contributions to be changed prospectively after a reasonable period of time to reflect changes in proportionate shares of expected benefits among the participants. (f)Adjustments would be made as necessary (including the possibility of buy-in and buy-out payments) upon the withdrawal of a participant and upon termination of the CCA. Summary 207.This chapter has considered the following key points: •A CCA is a contractual arrangement whereby participants agree to shares costs on the basis of expected benefits from the arrangement. •To satisfy the arm’s length principle, a participant’s contribution must be consistent with what an independent enterprise would have agreed to pay in comparable circumstances. •Difficulties can arise in measuring the value of a participant’s contribution and the expected value of its benefits. Any judgements made in making these measurements should be commercially justifiable. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) - Appendix 27

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) 3 THIS MONTH’S OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO COMMENT Inland Revenue produces a number of statements/rulings aimed at explaining how taxation law affects taxpayers and their agents. Because we are keen to produce items that accurately and fairly reflect taxation legislation, and are useful in practical situations, your input into the process – as perhaps a “user” of that legislation – is highly valued. The following draft items are available for review/comment this month, having a deadline of 29 February 2000. These are mostly the same items that we advertised in last month’s TIB, but due to the high level of interest already shown and the additional time for comment, you may wish to obtain a copy. Please see page 17 for details on how to obtain a copy: Ref.Draft typeDescription ED0011Standard Practice StatementTape recording Inland Revenue interviews. The draft Standard Practice Statement looks at the rules to be followed when Inland Revenue conducts an interview using audio recording equipment, rather than handwritten notes. IS2228Interpretation statementTransferable term fishing quota – acquisition and conversion. The item considers whether the cost of acquiring a transferable term fishing quota (TTQ) is deductible and if it is depreciable property as defined in the Income Tax Act 1976. It further considers issues arising when a TTQ is converted to an individual term quota. PU0066Public rulingBad debts – writing off debts as bad for GST and income tax purposes. The draft ruling is essentially the same as public ruling 96/3A, but has an application period from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2004. It looks at when a debt is considered bad, and what is required to write off a debt as bad. PU3019Public ruling“Cost price of the motor vehicle” – meaning of the term for fringe benefit tax purposes. The draft ruling considers what should be included under the term “cost price of the motor vehicle”, where an employer who owns a vehicle makes provision of the vehicle to an employee for that employee’s private use and enjoyment. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) 4 BINDING RULINGS This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995). You can order these publications free of charge from any Inland Revenue office. PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 00/01 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Colonial Services (NZ) Limited. Taxation Laws This Ruling applies in respect of the following sections of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985: •Income Tax Act 1994, sections BD 1, BD 2, EH 1- EH 10, HH 1(8), HH 3 to HH 8 and the definitions of “unit trust”, “beneficiary income”, “trustee income”, “core acquisition price”, “financial arrangement” and “unit holders” in section OB 1. •Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, sections 3, 14 and 55(7) and the definition of “insurance” in section 2(1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment, administration and carrying on of Colonial Select Investor Service (“the Service”) by Colonial Services (NZ) Limited (“CSNZL”). CSNZL is the agent of Investors in the Service and the Manager of the Service. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.CSNZL launched the Service \[previously known as “Navigator Select Investor Service”\] during August 1998, and for that purpose obtained Product Ruling BR Prd 98/71. This Ruling replaces BR Prd 98/71 which is withdrawn. 2.The Service provides access for Investors to a range of investment products and fund managers with all reporting consolidated. 3.The Administrator of the Service is Jacques Martin New Zealand Limited (“JMNZL”). This Ruling applies only to those activities of the Administrator that are carried on in relation to the Service and are described in this Arrangement. 4.The Custodian and bare trustee of the Service, and the Nominee of the Investors, is the Public Trustee acting at all times through its nominee and wholly owned subsidiary, Navigator Nominees Limited (“NNL”), who may also act as the trustee of any superannuation scheme made available through the Service. 5.Investors are able to switch between investment options and make lump sum or regular contributions and withdrawals. 6.Investors are offered the choice of investing in: (i)unit trusts (New Zealand, Australian and elsewhere); (ii)group investment funds (“GIFs”); and (iii)UK Investment Trusts. 7.Possibly in the future a master superannuation fund would be added. The superannuation fund will in turn offer a choice of investment in wholesale superannuation funds, GIFs and unit trusts. In addition, Investors may be offered the facility to invest in “direct” investment securities on a case by case basis including: participatory securities, interest bearing securities, and shares other than unit trusts, group investment funds and Investment Trusts. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) 5 8.The Manager will approve the various unit trusts, GIFs and the Investment Trusts selected by Jarden Morgan Investment Services Limited from time to time based on performance. Investors will be entitled to select their own “direct” investments if that option is offered to the Investors. 9.In addition to the various investment options, Investors may also elect to include supplementary insurance benefits such as life cover, total and permanent disablement, trauma cover and income cover. 10.Investors in the Service may be supplied with both life and non-life insurance cover through the Service. 11.Investors come to CSNZL to use the Service through their financial advisers. The Manager, the Administrator and the Custodian of the Service act only as directed by Investors and do not give any investment advice or make any investment decisions under delegated authority from the Investors. Jarden Morgan Investment Services Limited under contract to CSNZL selects the product mix of the Service and makes the asset allocation decisions of the premixed selection options. 12.Reporting to Investors under the Service is purely to provide information to Investors on details of their investments and income from their investments as well as to deliver an annual statement for taxation purposes. The reports do not constitute what is regarded in the industry as “monitoring” nor do they contain investment advice. 13.The Investors’ agent and Manager of the Service is CSNZL. The Manager of the Service is appointed as the Investors’ agent pursuant to an investment authority given under the Investor Information Document (“the IID”) to instruct the Custodian to acquire, dispose of, and receive the income from investments on behalf of the Investor. 14.The Administrator is charged under the Administration Agreement primarily with making and withdrawing from investments on behalf of Investors as well as collecting and processing the cash flows that arise from them. As an adjunct to that activity it must carry out the consequential administration, reporting and record keeping activities that make up the Service. 15.Investors under the IID appoint the Custodian to act as bare trustee and nominee in subscribing for and holding investments in safe custody in its name on their behalf. Investors undertake to be bound by the terms of the Custodian Agreement, and authorise the Manager to delegate its powers (including those delegated to it by the Custodian) to the Administrator. 16.The Custodian also establishes a trust account under the Cash Holding Account Agreement to facilitate all the cash flows of the Service. The administration and management of that account is delegated to the Manager who in turn delegates it to the Administrator. 17.An Investor who wishes to use the Service will be handed an IID, which will: (i)Background the structure of the Service. (ii)Explain in general terms the operation of the pertinent Administration, Custodian, Delegation and Cash Holding Account Agreements (together with the IID described in this Ruling as “the Agreements”) by which the Service is implemented. (iii)Contain detachable application forms and an Investment Authority by which Investors can identify their investment selections. 18.An Investor wishing to use the Service will then make application and execute an Investment Authority under which the Investor will: (i)Provide a declaration pursuant to which Investors will: authorise the Manager and Custodian to act as their agent and bare trustee/nominee respectively, be bound by the Custodian Agreement, and consent to the delegation of services to the Administrator. (ii)Confirm the Investor’s receipt of investment statements for each option selected. 19.Investors in products other than the superannuation fund first pay their moneys into a Cash Holding Account of the Custodian run by the Administrator who records and identifies by Investor all deposits, investments, income, withdrawals, expenses, and tax information. From this account the Administrator as delegate of the Manager disperses funds into Investors’ various investment options. Interest and dividend income as well as sale proceeds and further investment moneys are all received into the Cash Holding Account which acts as a general clearing account for all funds received from or to be disbursed to Investors. Investors are required to maintain a minimum credit balance in this account. 20.Investors in the superannuation scheme (if made available) will become direct members of the scheme, and their investment choices are activated as members of the scheme. 21.Investors expressly acknowledge receipt of an investment statement (and at their option a prospectus) where one has been issued from their financial adviser for each product that they select, including the superannuation scheme (if made available). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) 6 22.The relevant documentation is: (i)The Administration Agreement, being an agreement between the Manager and the Administrator. (ii)The Custodian Agreement, being an agreement between the Manager and the Custodian. (iii)The Cash Holding Account Agreement between the Custodian and the Manager. (iv)The IID (and the Investment Authority given under the IID by the Investor) between the Manager, the Investor and the Investor’s financial adviser. (v)The Delegation Agreement between the Manager and the Custodian. 23.The Investor undertakes in the IID to be bound by the three other agreements relevant to the Investor. 24.Title to investments is held by the Custodian, and the Cash Holding Account is also in the name of the Custodian. 25.The Administrator will operate the Cash Holding Account, record and trace all investments made by individual Investors, and report to them at regular intervals on the value of their investments, the income derived and any tax deductions made. 26.The Administrator under the Administration Agreement provides a means of recording each Investor’s interest in the underlying products. 27.The Custodian Agreement at paragraph 2.1(e) expressly describes the pooling as aggregation for “administrative convenience”. The pooling is subject to the proviso that adequate tracing be maintained at all times. 28.Taking into account the effect of delegations, the essence of the Agreements can be summarised as follows: (i)The Manager provides the entire facility and arranges for investments to be made, changed, or sold by instructing the Custodian as the Investor’s agent. (ii)The Custodian holds title to the investments and the Cash Holding Account as bare trustee for each Investor. (iii)The Administrator makes, changes or sells the investments, pays and collects the resulting cash flows and attends to all consequential administration, processing, record keeping and reporting requirements of the Service. 29.The services rendered in respect of each fee charged in relation to the Service are: (i)Investment/Contribution fee: •Processing applications by Investors. •Arranging the acquisition of investments. •Providing four switches per annum. •Providing documentation. (ii)Administration fee: •Keeping records of Investors and their portfolios. •Investor level transaction recording and tracing. •Maintaining a computer system that delivers the service requirements. •Allocating and processing distributions for Investors. •Reporting to Investors and preparation of Investor tax statements. •Executing proxies and voting rights of the Custodian. •Reporting to the Custodian. •Maintaining Investors’ Cash Holding Accounts. •Responding to Investor queries about the Service. (iii)Custodian fee: •Use of the Custodian’s name as security holder. (The tasks of subscribing, safe custody and withdrawing from the investments are delegated to the Administrator, leaving the Custodian merely lending his or her name as security holder for the investment.) (iv)Switching fee: •Processing investment switches. (v)Expense fee: •Printing and distributing Investor information documentation, investment statements and prospectuses, excluding establishment expenses of the Service. •Audit, accounting and legal compliance services, excluding establishment expenses of the Service. (vi)Regular withdrawal fee: •Direct crediting money to accounts for singular/regular withdrawals. (vii)Withdrawal fee: •Processing withdrawal applications. (viii)Adviser service fee: IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) 7 •Supplying financial planning and portfolio monitoring services. (ix)Fund manager fee: •On-going charging for management (investment and administration) of GIFs or unit trusts (where charged to the Investor by the Fund Manager or trustee) for: -Annual management costs. -On-going monitoring of the investments. -Purchasing and selling investments. -Maintaining computer system to record investments. -Receiving and processing distributions. -Reporting to Investors. -Reporting to trustee. -Responding to customer queries. -Acting as trustee. -Use of the trustee/statutory supervisor’s name as security holder. (The tasks of subscribing, safe custody and withdrawing from the investments are delegated to the Manager, leaving the trustee/statutory supervisor merely lending his or her name as security holder for the investment.) -Maintaining register of Investors. -Accounting and legal fees excluding establishment expenses of the fund. -Preparing and distributing cheques and statements. -Printing stationary. -Cost of holding investor meetings. -Any other miscellaneous cost incurred in managing the funds. -Issuing expenses. (x)Brokerage fee: •Brokerage paid to broker to arrange entry into listed trusts. •Brokerage paid to broker to arrange exit from listed trusts. (xi)Insurance cover: •The supply of life insurance cover. •The supply of non-life insurance cover. 30.The way in which each fee is calculated is set out in the Agreements. The rates and methods used to calculate such fees may be varied from time to time. However, any type of fee not described above, charged in the future, will not be subject to this Ruling. 31.The adviser service fee, the fund manager fee and the brokerage fee are not charged by the Manager, Custodian or the Administrator of the Service. Investors through the Service pay these fees for services supplied to them through the Service by their adviser, fund managers and brokers. This Ruling does not consider the goods and services tax treatment of the adviser services fee, the fund manager fee and the brokerage fee paid by Investors. 32.In respect of the fees charged by fund managers, a separate contribution fee is ordinarily charged for set up costs. Due to the size of the investment through the Service, the fund managers have waived this fee for Investors through the Service. Assumption made by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following assumption: a)The Investors are resident in New Zealand under section OE 1 or OE 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)The final form of the Agreements will not differ materially from the draft Agreements received by Adjudication & Rulings on 16 March 1999 and 23 June 1999. b)Where an Investor is under a legal disability, the Manager, Administrator and the Custodian will not have or exercise the receipt, control, or disposition of any income derived by that investor, but may act on the instructions of whomsoever the law gives the capacity to act on behalf of that Investor. No additional powers accrue to the Manager, Administrator or the Custodian because of a lack of capacity of an Investor beneficiary so as to change the nature of the bare trust relationship. c)Except for the non-life insurance cover supplied to Investors through the Service, the investments and facilities available through the Service are any debt security, equity security, participatory security, credit contract, contract of life insurance, superannuation scheme, or futures contract referred to in section 3(1)(ka) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. d)The fees described in this Ruling are charged only for the services listed under each fee in the Arrangement. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) 8 e)The fees charged by the Administrator to the Manager under the Administration Agreement will be negotiated on an arm’s length basis. f)The Manager, Custodian and the Administrator undertake no services that, either directly or indirectly through the selection of the product mix of the Service, involve planning an Investor’s portfolio or advising on an Investor’s portfolio or making investment decisions or recommendations for an Investor. g)Colonial makes goods and services tax returns as a group under the provisions of section 55 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. h)The only activities carried on by the Administrator in relation to the Service are as described in the Arrangement to this Ruling. i)The Manager will only disapprove investments in “direct” investment securities (if that option is offered to Investors) if, and only if, the purchase of a particular share or investment on behalf of the customer will, in the reasonable and bona fide view of the Manager: •Result in excessive costs to the Manager due to administrative complexity; or •Be unlawful or contrary to the Manager’s own interests; or •Expose the Manager to use its own funds with respect to uncalled or partly paid shares. j)Any fee that is charged in relation to the Service is on an arm’s length, stand alone commercial basis so as only to reflect the relevant services listed and will not be directly or indirectly related to or affected by any other services or fees. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The Service, to be launched to the public by CSNZL, as the Manager and the Investors’ agent, JMNZL as the Administrator, and NNL as the Custodian of the Service pursuant to a bare trust, is not a “unit trust” as defined in section OB 1 and the Investors are not “unit holders” as also defined in section OB 1. •As a consequence of Investors having direct ownership of their investment choices, the income from investments made by the Investors through the Service and held by the Custodian, will be gross income of the relevant Investor under section BD 1, and not the Manager, the Administrator or the Custodian. •All the fees listed in the Arrangement that are paid by an Investor who is liable to be assessed pursuant to sections CD 3, CD 4, or CD 5 in respect of gross income received from investments through the Service, are deductible to that Investor under section BD 2, except to the extent that the fees (not being either contingent upon implementation of a “financial arrangement” or non-contingent upon implementation of a “financial arrangement” but exceeding 2% of the “core acquisition price” of a “financial arrangement” as those terms are defined in the qualified accrual rules) are incurred in gaining or producing exempt income or an amount that is excluded from being gross income. •The following fees are not deductible to an Investor who is not liable to be assessed pursuant to sections CD 3, CD 4, or CD 5 in respect of gross income received from investments through the Service: •The investment/contribution fee. •The withdrawal fee. •The brokerage fee. •The switching fee. •The adviser service fee to the extent that it relates to planning services. •The following fees paid by an Investor who is not liable to be assessed pursuant to sections CD 3, CD 4, or CD 5 in respect of gross income received from investments through the Service, are deductible to that Investor under section BD 2 except to the extent that the fees (not being either contingent upon implementation of a “financial arrangement” or non- contingent upon implementation of a “financial arrangement” but exceeding 2% of the “core acquisition price” of a “financial arrangement” as those terms are defined in the qualified accrual rules) are incurred in gaining or producing exempt income or an amount that is excluded from being gross income: •The administration fee. •The custodian fee. •The expense fee. •The regular withdrawal fee. •The fund manager fee. •The adviser service fee to the extent that it relates to monitoring services. •The fees paid by the Manager in relation to the Service to the Administrator, or to any broker, agent, or associate of the Administrator, or to any independent research resource, are deductible under section BD 2 by the Manager. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) 9 •GST is payable in respect of any fees charged for non-life insurance cover to Investors through the Service. •Except for any fees charged for non-life insurance cover to Investors through the Service, the fees listed in the Arrangement in this Ruling that are charged by the Manager, the Custodian and the Administrator in relation to the Service are exempt from GST by reason of the application of section 14 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. •The representative member of the Colonial group is required to make a return of goods and services tax under section 55(7) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 in respect of any fee charged for the Administrator’s services supplied in relation to the Service, where Investors are supplied with non-life insurance cover through the Service. •There is no requirement for the representative member of the Colonial group to make a return of goods and services tax under section 55(7) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, in respect of the Administrator’s services supplied in relation to the Service, except where Investors are supplied with non-life insurance cover through the Service. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 13 January 2000 until 31 March 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 13th day of January 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) 10 GENERAL INTEREST ITEMS DOUBLE TAX AGREEMENT WITH INDIA AMENDED New Zealand has a network of 26 Double Tax Agreements (DTAs) with its main trading and investment partners. These DTAs aim to reduce tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment and to assist tax administration. From time to time these DTAs need updating to address deficiencies that have been identified, or areas where the Government’s policy positions may have changed. On 17 December a Second Protocol entered into force, updating certain features of the DTA between New Zealand and India concluded in 1986. Specifically, the Second Protocol amends the Indian DTA by: •reducing the maximum rates of tax on dividends (from 20% to 15%); interest (from 15% to 10%); and royalties and certain service fees (from 30% to 10%); •revising the definition of ‘India’ to recognise the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea; •clarifying that when a non-individual’s place of effective management (which determines tax residence) cannot be determined, the competent authorities can settle the question by mutual agreement; •clarifying that New Zealand and India may tax certain income from immovable property and from the alienation of property; and •clarifying that the Non-discrimination Article will not affect the rate of tax imposed on branches of non-resident companies nor defeat the application of anti-avoidance provisions, thus preventing potential abuse of the Non- discrimination Article. The provisions of the Second Protocol take effect: •in New Zealand, from the income year beginning 1 April 2000; and •in India, for any ‘previous year’ (as defined in the Income Tax Act 1961) beginning on or after 1 April 2000. The full text of the protocol is available on the Inland Revenue Department website (http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/international/ DTA/agreements/india2p.html). STUDENT LOAN SCHEME - REPAYMENT THRESHOLD FOR 2000-01 The student loan scheme repayment threshold for the 2000/01 income year will increase to $14,768. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) 11 TRANSFER PRICING – DRAFT GUIDELINES The appendix to this TIB contains the second of a series of draft guidelines on the application of New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules. The first part, issued in October 1997 (TIB Vol 9, No.10), contained a general overview of the framework in which transfer pricing operates. This part deals with the remaining issues covered in the OECD guidelines issued to date, namely intangible property, intra-group services and cost contribution arrangements (CCAs). Subsequent guidelines will deal with advance pricing agreements (APAs) and the application to branches of section FB 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Inland Revenue welcomes submissions on the material in the draft guidelines. Please make these by 31 March 2000, addressed to: General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Inland Revenue fully endorses the OECD guidelines in relation to issues dealt with in this part of the guidelines. This part should be read, therefore, as supplementing the OECD guidelines, rather than superseding them. On matters not addressed in draft guidelines issued to date, Inland Revenue will continue to follow the OECD guidelines. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) 12 LEGAL DECISIONS - CASE NOTES This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. WHETHER ASSESSMENT INVALID Case:I R & P M Hyslop v CIR Decision date:10 January 2000 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:“Assessment”, “Notice of Assessment” Summary Justice Chambers upheld the Commissioner’s appeal and referred the substantive issue back to the Taxation Review Authority. Facts This was an appeal from the TRA judgment of Barber DCJ reported as Case T49 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,335. That case itself was in many ways a rerun of Case M7 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,046 \[also reported as Case 84 (1990) 14 TRNZ 21; TRA No 88/9; Dec No 89/107\] (Judge Bathgate) except that M7 dealt with the 1982 to 1984 financial years (inclusive) of the objectors and Case T49 deals with 1985 to 1989 inclusive. The essential tax issue was whether the husband and wife objectors (the husband being a pharmacist and the wife also a shareholder/director of their pharmacy company) successfully split some income among their children consequential to measures taken in about September 1982 to gift capital to their children. However the Authority in T49 found that it did not need to decide the substantive issues as it found in favour of the Objectors on the threshold submission that the Commissioner had failed to give adequate grounds for the assessments, thereby rendering those assessments invalid. Barber DCJ stated as follows: “It is only necessary for me to deal with the threshold issue. It seems to me that the basis of the assessments could not have been clearly known to the objectors when they were reassessed on 13 March 1991 and when they formulated their objections...... I have always been of the view that a fundamental part of the assessment process is to notify the objector, simultaneously with an assessment document or, perhaps, prior to that, of the reasons for assessment or reassessment. One would expect those reasons to be endorsed, briefly on the form of assessment or to be set out in a covering letter. In this case that did not happen, except that there was reference to reliance on the principles of Case M7 ...In my view, the reasons for assessment should be endorsed on the assessment form or contained n a simultaneous covering letter...In my view, it is not good enough to assess a person without making clear the reasons for assessment...... I find the assessment process in this case to have been invalid and ineffective. It is not redeemed by subsequent correspondence.” Decision Chambers J found that the Taxation Review Authority had no basis on which to entertain this issue of validity, because invalidity of the assessments was not raised as a ground of objection. Section 36 Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 (now section 18 Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994) was clear. Invalidity is a distinct ground of objection: CIR v Canterbury Frozen Meat Co Limited (1994) 16 NZTC 11,150 at 11,159. And while that finding was sufficient to enable the case to be decided in the Commissioner’s favour, the Authority also erred in finding that a failure by the Commissioner to give sufficient reasons for an assessment invalidates that assessment. Sections 26 and 29(1) Income Tax Act 1976 (sections 114 and 111 TAA 1994) make it clear that an assessment is quite different from the notice of assessment, and any failure or deficiency in the notice has no effect on the validity of the assessment. It is the consideration that has gone into an assessment by the Commissioner that determines validity, not the physical form (if any) upon which notice is given to the taxpayer. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) 13 Finally Chambers J found that the Authority erred in finding that the Commissioner had given insufficient information as to the grounds of assessment in this case. In the facts of this case a reasonable objective reader of Case M7 would be able to deduce some reasonably clear legal principles and the Commissioner’s application of those principles was well demonstrated in the working papers sent with the notices. The Commissioner did “nail his colours to the mast for the Hyslops to see”. WHETHER LEGAL EXPENSES INCURRED IN DEFENCE OF CRIMINAL CHARGES DEDUCTIBLE UNDER INCOME TAX ACT AND GOODS AND SERVICES TAX ACT Case:TRA Number 10/99 & 45/99. Decision Number 1/2000 Decision date:11 January 2000 Act:Income Tax Act , Goods and Services Tax Act Keywords:deductibility of legal expenses Summary Judge Barber found in favour of the Commissioner in all aspects of the case. Facts On 15 January 1995 the police searched the taxpayer’s property and 170 cannabis plants were found. Subsequently the taxpayer pleased guilty to two charges of cultivating cannabis, one of possessing cannabis for supply, and one of selling cannabis, a class C drug. As a result of a plea bargain entered into with the Police, on 22 March 1995, the taxpayer was fined $40,000, ordered to forfeit the sum of $14,820.00 being cash found on his property and was sentenced to two years imprisonment. The taxpayer claimed legal expenses of $21,231 incurred in relation to the criminal prosecution against him for the cultivation, possession and sale of cannabis in his 1995 income tax return and GST return for the period ending 31 March 1995. The Commissioner disallowed the deductions and a challenge was issued in the Taxation Review Authority by the taxpayer. Decision In terms of the GST input tax credit claim, Judge Barber stated that the GST Act makes it quite clear that, for the purposes of this case, the critical criterion is whether the goods and services were “acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies”. His Honour found from the evidence that the legal services in this case were acquired by the taxpayer for the purpose of minimising or avoiding any prison sentence and the size of sum to be forfeited to the Crown, and to protect the taxpayer’s own home property and preserve it from the State. His Honour stated that there can be no doubt here that the plea bargain reduced the length of jail sentence imposed on the taxpayer. Also of importance was Judge Barbers’ finding that the facts indicated that the taxpayer’s cannabis business did not operate after the taxpayer’s arrest and that any subsequent sales (which were alleged to have occurred by the taxpayer after his arrest) were from stock remaining after business closure. His Honour also agreed with the Commissioner’s position that if the taxpayer recommenced cannabis growing on release from prison, then that would be a new and separate business and not a continuance of the previous business which had closed by 3 March 1995. This finding also depended on the particular facts of the case. The facts were overwhelmingly clear that the principal purpose of the taxpayer in acquiring the legal services was to achieve the best possible outcome in respect of the criminal charges laid against him. That purpose is quite indirect to the continuing of taxable supplies of cannabis and is too remote from that purpose to be an input to such an activity. In any event, that activity came to an end before the bulk of the legal services seem to have been supplied. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 1 (January 2000) 14 In regards to income tax deductibility, His Honour found that the legal expenses in defending the criminal charges were of a private and personal nature and related to the preservation of the taxpayer’s personal liberty and assets. Such expenditure is not deductible under the Income Tax Act. Also such expenditure is not sufficiently connected with the taxpayer’s income earning process of cannabis growing and dealing. It merely has an indirect connection. In any case the taxpayer’s cannabis business had ceased at the time that the legal fees were incurred so there could not possibly be the required nexus between that expenditure and the cannabis business. Regarding the final issue Judge Barber found for the Commissioner on a matter of credibility i.e. it is more likely that the taxpayer spent the proceeds from cannabis sales as they were earned rather than saved them.
