In Confidence IR2019/622 – Land Rules Review: Tranche 1 Page 1 of 16 IN CONFIDENCE 15 November 2019 Minister of Revenue Land Rules Review: Tranche 1 Executive Summary 1. This report seeks agreement to policy changes relating to the land rules and powers to amend the Land Transfer Tax Statement. This report also seeks agreement for these proposals to go to Cabinet. 2. Tranche 1 of the current land rules review has involved consideration of the following policy changes: • Clarifying the rules for deducting holding costs where land that is subject to tax on sale is used for private purposes while it is held. • Tightening the rules that relate to habitual buying and selling of homes and business premises to ensure people cannot structure around them to escape paying tax. 3. A draft Cabinet Paper is attached for your consideration. Note that the proposals related to denying deductions for holding costs for privately used land that is taxable on sale may attract public comment. 4. This report also discusses proposals to move the content of the Land Transfer Tax Statement from the Land Transfer Act 2017 to regulations to make changing the Statement easier. Holding costs 5. Holding costs (e.g. rates, interest, insurance etc) are costs incurred as a result of holding land. There is currently uncertainty about the extent to which holding costs are deductible where land that is taxed on sale is used privately while it is held (e.g. where the sale of a private bach is subject to tax under the bright-line test). 6. We advised you in September on the options for the deductibility of holding costs (see IR2019/519). Our preference was to deny deductions for holding costs entirely where land is used for private purposes (including where vacant land is not used, or intended to be used, for income-earning purposes). We also proposed confirming that the costs of acquisition of, and capital improvements to, land that is taxable on sale should always be deductible in full, despite private use. 7. We have now undertaken full public consultation on the options. Feedback from consultation has been unsupportive of officials’ preferred position on the deductibility of holding costs. However, submitters support the proposals to confirm the deductibility of the costs of acquisition and capital improvements. 8. Despite views from submitters, we still consider the original preferred positions represent the best option for deductibility of holding costs. Habitual buying and selling 9. The land sales rules generally tax gains from the sale of land that is equivalent to trading stock. To limit their scope, the rules contain exclusions to ensure that land In Confidence IR2019/622 – Land Rules Review: Tranche 1 Page 2 of 16 IN CONFIDENCE that is not equivalent to trading stock, and is used as a residence or business premises, is not taxed. To ensure that taxpayers do not take advantage of the exclusions where that is not intended, the exclusions do not apply where a person has a regular pattern of buying and selling land that is used as a residence or business premises. 10. Inland Revenue has concerns that the current regular pattern restrictions are not working as intended, and that taxpayers can structure around the regular pattern restrictions. To address these concerns, officials have consulted on proposals to expand the regular pattern restrictions. 11. Taking into account feedback received from submitters, officials propose the following amendments to the regular pattern restrictions: • That the regular pattern restrictions be extended to apply where a person, or a group of people, have a regular pattern of buying and selling land that is used as a residence or business premises. • To limit the potential for overreach arising from the above changes, that the regular pattern restrictions be limited to apply only in situations where the land was acquired with a purpose or intention of disposal. Land Transfer Tax Statement 12. LINZ is undertaking work to reduce compliance costs for property transfers. This has included a review of the rules relating to the Land Transfer Tax Statement. Currently changes to the Land Transfer Tax Statement require legislative amendment. To speed up making future changes to the Land Transfer Tax Statement, L INZ is seeking to move the content of the Statement from the Land Transfer Act 2017 to regulations. 13. It intended that this change be included in the next omnibus tax Bill, expected to be introduced in March 2020. In Confidence IR2019/622 – Land Rules Review: Tranche 1 Page 3 of 16 IN CONFIDENCE Recommended action We recommend that you: 14. agree to amend the rules for the deductibility of holding costs to deny deductions in full to the extent land that is taxed on sale is used privately (including where vacant land is not used, or intended to be used, for income-earning purposes). Agreed/Not agreed 15. agree to amend the rules to confirm that where a land sale is taxable the costs of acquisition of, and capital improvements to, the land should always be deductible in full, despite any private use. Agreed/Not agreed 16. agree to amend the regular pattern restrictions in the main home, residential and business premises exclusions to ensure taxpayers cannot structure to escape tax; Agreed/Not agreed 17. note that the Minister for Land Information has agreed to amendments to the Land Transfer Act 2017 to allow the Land Transfer Tax Statement to be set by regulation; Noted 18. agree that the above amendments be included in the omnibus tax Bill expected to be introduced in March 2020. Agreed/Not agreed 19. authorise the attached Cabinet paper for lodgement with the Cabinet Office by 10am Thursday 5 December 2019; Authorised and lodged 20. refer a copy of this report to the Minister of Finance and the Minister for Land Information for their information. Referred/Not referred Peter Frawley Policy Lead Policy and Strategy Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue / /2019 In Confidence IR2019/622 – Land Rules Review: Tranche 1 Page 4 of 16 IN CONFIDENCE Background 21. As part of the Government’s refreshed tax policy work programme, we are reviewing the current land rules, particularly in relation to investment property and speculators, land banking and vacant land. The objective is to recommend ways to improve the efficient use of land, and ensure that the current tax settings are fair, balanced, and encourage and support productive investment. 22. Tranche 1 of this review involves the following policy projects: • Clarifying the rules for deducting holding costs where land that is subject to tax on sale is used for private purposes while it is held. • Tightening the rules that relate to habitual buying and selling of homes and business premises to ensure people cannot structure around them to avoid paying tax. 23. In September 2019, we updated you on our progress on these issues (see IR2019/489 and IR2019/519). This report provides you with our final recommendations and seeks agreement for these proposals to go to Cabinet. 24. This report also discusses moving the content of the Land Transfer Tax Statement from the Land Transfer Act 2017 to regulations to make changes to the Statement easier. 25. If these amendments are approved by Cabinet it is intended that legislation will be included in the next omnibus tax Bil l, which is expected to be introduced in March 2020. Holding costs for privately used land that is taxable on sale Problem definition and options 26. Holding costs (e.g. rates, interest, insurance etc) are costs incurred as a result of owning land. There is currently uncertainty about the extent to which holding costs are deductible for privately used land that is taxable on sale (e.g. where a private bach is taxed under the bright-line test). This is because in this scenario, the same expenditure simultaneously relates to both the taxable income from the sale of the land, and the private benefit from the use of the land. This leads to a tension between the principle that expenditure is deductible where it relates to deriving taxable income, and the principle that expenditure that gives rise to a private benefit should not be deductible. 27. This is an issue where there has been uncertainty for some time. It became more prominent when the bright-line test, which brought more privately used land into the tax base, was introduced. It is intended that the proposed amendments will improve clarity in the law in this area. 28. We reported to you on the options for deductibility in September (see IR2019/519). In summary, those options were: • Apportionment: recognise that holding costs relate to both the taxable gain on sale, and the benefit obtained from the private use of the land and allow a deduction for a portion of the costs that relates to the taxable gain on sale. • Allow full deductions: recognise that holding costs are costs incurred in deriving assessable income from the sale of the land and allow full deductions. In Confidence IR2019/622 – Land Rules Review: Tranche 1 Page 5 of 16 IN CONFIDENCE • Deny deductions to the extent of private use: attribute the holding costs to the current year use of the property and, therefore, deny deductions where current year use of the land is private. 29. In our earlier report, officials’ preference was to deny deductions in full to the extent of private use. While officials recognised that the most conceptually correct option was apportionment, it was considered that option was too complex, and could be said to be inconsistent with other areas of the tax law. 30. Given the recommendation to deny deductions for private use, our September report also considered options for the classification of unused or vacant land as either private or income-earning use. Officials’ preference was that where land is temporarily unused or vacant it should be classified depending on the other use of the land (e.g. vacant days for a private bach should be treated as private use days, and vacant days for a rental property should be treated as income-earning days). 31. Where land is wholly vacant or unused, officials recommended that it should be classified as private use, unless the owner holds the land as part of a business or income-earning activity, or they notify the Commissioner in the year they acquired the land that it was acquired with a purpose of resale so that any gain will be subject to tax on sale. If the land is subsequently privately used, deductions will be denied from that point. 32. Finally, it was noted that technical amendments should be made to the rules for the deductibility of the costs of acquisition of, and capital improvements to, land that is taxable on sale. The technical amendments would clarify that those costs would be fully deductible despite private use, and despite being unaware at the time the costs were incurred that the land would be taxable on sale (e.g. a bright-line situation). Consultation 33. Officials released a public consultation document discussing the proposed amendments in October 2019. 34. Submitters agree there is a need to provide further clarity in relation to the deductibility of holding costs. They also agreed it would be useful to clarify the rules for the deductibility of the costs of acquisition and capital improvements to land as proposed. 35. However, submitters do not support officials’ preferred option to deny deductions for private use entirely. Instead, it was submitted that some deduction should be al lowed where holding costs directly relate to the taxable gain on sale of the land. 36. Submitters disagree with officials’ position that apportionment is not consistent with current law. They also disagree that an apportionment approach must be complex. They pointed to other parts of the tax legislation where a simplified apportionment approach (e.g. apportioning on a 50:50 or 75:25 basis) has been adopted for mixed private/income-earning use. 37. Finally, submitters also did not support officials’ recommendations to treat all unused or vacant land as being used privately unless it is held as part of a business or income-earning activity, or the owner notifies the Commissioner that the land was acquired with a purpose of resale. Submitters considered that where land is wholly unused and is subject to tax on sale its only use is income-earning and so deductions should always be allowed in full. 38. A more detailed summary of submissions is included in Appendix A. 39. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand also wrote to you submitting that, given the importance of these changes, more time should be given to consider all the potential options in more detail. In Confidence IR2019/622 – Land Rules Review: Tranche 1 Page 6 of 16 IN CONFIDENCE Final recommendations 40. In principle, expenditure that relates to deriving taxable income should be deductible. However, allowing deductions in full would be contrary to the principle that deductions should be denied to the extent expenditure provides a private (untaxed) benefit. This suggests that apportionment may be the better option. 41. Officials accept that apportionment is consistent with current law. However, as has been accepted by most submitters, accurate apportionment is complex. 42. Submitters have suggested that a simplified apportionment approach could be applied. However, officials do not consider it is appropriate to use a simplified approach in this context. In this context, there is a risk that expenditure that produces a private (untaxed) benefit could be deductible. Officials consider the better policy is that, to the extent there is private use of land that is taxable on sale, deductions for the holding costs should be denied in full. 43. This would mean, for example, that no deductions would be allowed for holding costs for a bach that was used entirely privately but was taxable on sale under the bright-line test. Conversely, a deduction for half the holding costs would be allowed for a bach that was used privately for six months per year and rented for six months per year. 44. With regard to wholly vacant or unused land, officials continue to recommend their original proposal. Officials consider that if taxpayers have land that is solely acquired with an intention of resale, and there is no private use, they can continue to cla im deductions provided they notify Commissioner of that intention. Habitual buying and selling Current law and policy framework 45. The land sales rules generally tax gains from the sale of land where the land is held by a person effectively as trading stock (in the same way that a furniture vendor is taxed on the gains they make from selling their furniture). It is not intended that the rules tax capital gains (e.g. gains from selling the furniture vendor’s shop or a person’s home). However, the rules are drafted quite broadly to ensure that people cannot easily structure around them, which means they can catch some land that is (properly) a capital asset. 46. To limit this potential overreach, the rules contain exclusions. Relevantly, the rules exclude from tax gains from the sale of a person’s home (the main home and residential exclusions) or business premises (the business premises exclusion) if they happen to be caught by the broader rules. For example, the land sales rules generally tax all sales of land by a land dealer, but the exclusions ensure the dealer will not be taxed on the sale of their home. 47. To ensure the exclusions are not abused, they are subject to regular pattern restrictions. These restrictions ensure that people who regularly buy and sell land as trading stock cannot use the land as a home or business premise while they own it to escape tax. For example, a person who has a pattern of buying, renovating and selling their homes should pay tax on their gains rather than escaping tax by relying on the residential exclusion. In Confidence IR2019/622 – Land Rules Review: Tranche 1 Page 7 of 16 IN CONFIDENCE Problem definition and proposals 48. While the current law contains regular pattern restrictions to stop people who habitually buy and sell land escaping tax, Inland Revenue has concerns that those restrictions are not working as intended. 49. As currently drafted, taxpayers who habitually buy and sell land can structure around the regular pattern restrictions. Given the recent tightening of the land rules there is a concern that taxpayers have a greater incentive to avoid the regular pattern restrictions by arranging their affairs so they do not have a pattern of buying and selling main homes, residences and/or business premises. This is contrary to the policy intention, and may undermine the integrity of the tax system. 50. There are two issues of concern: • First, the regular pattern restrictions apply quite narrowly to the activities of a single person, which allows taxpayers to circumvent the application of the regular pattern restrictions by buying and selling land using different but associated persons or entities each time. To resolve this concern, it was proposed that the regular pattern restrictions could be amended to apply where a person, or a group of people, have a regular pattern of buying and selling land that the person, or group of people, occupy as a residence or business premises. • Secondly, the current regular pattern restrictions have been interpreted narrowly to apply only where there is a similarity or likeness between the transactions (for example, a pattern of buying land, building a home on the land and then selling). This means that the regular pattern restrictions will not apply where a person does something different to each piece of land. To resolve this concern, it was proposed that the regular pattern restrictions could be extended to apply to any pattern of buying and selling land, with a focus on the regularity of the transactions, rather than on what is done with the land while it is owned. 51. The regular pattern restriction in the main home exclusion for the bright-line test is supplemented by a time-period rule, which states that the main home exclusion will not apply if a person has relied on it twice in the previous two years. To attempt to provide clarity and objectivity, it was also proposed that a similar time-period rule could be added to the residential and business premises exclusions. Consultation 52. We released a public consultation document on this issue in September 2019 (see BN2019/500). Prior to releasing the document publicly, we also tested our thinking with some private sector advisors. 53. In general, submitters appear to acknowledge officials’ concerns that taxpayers can structure around the existing regular pattern restrictions. However, almost all submitters expressed concerns about the potential for overreach from the proposed amendments and, in particular, that the amendments risk taxing transactions that should not be subject to tax (i.e. sales of genuine homes or business premises). 54. The submitters also disagreed with proposals to amend the regular pattern restriction to the business premises exclusion. They submitted that there was no evidence of any abuse of that exclusion. 55. Submitters could see that a time-period rule may be useful to supplement the regular pattern restriction in the residential exclusion. However, there was concern that a time-period rule would be arbitrary and could not accommodate factors outside a person’s control. In Confidence IR2019/622 – Land Rules Review: Tranche 1 Page 8 of 16 IN CONFIDENCE Final recommendations 56. After consideration of the submissions received, officials recommend the following amendments to the regular pattern restrictions: • Intention test: officials recommend adding an intention test to the regular pattern exclusions. As discussed above, the purpose of the regular pattern restrictions is to ensure that people who regularly buy and sell land as trading stock cannot use the land as a home or business premises while they own it to escape tax. On that basis, officials recommend that the regular pattern restrictions in the residential and business premises exclusions be amended to target their application to situations where the person acquired the land with an intention of disposal. Officials consider this limitation will bring the law more in line with the policy intention and will address concerns about the potential for overreach from the other proposals. • Group of persons: officials continue to be of the view that the regular pattern restrictions should be extended to apply to a person or a group of persons that undertake buying and selling activity together. Officials consider that a group of persons will be treated as undertaking buying and selling activity together in the following circumstances: – For the residential exclusion, a group of people will be undertaking buying and selling activity together if they all occupy all of the properties as their residence, or if the people who occupy all of the properties as their residences controls the trusts or other entities that own the properties. – For the business premises exclusion, a group of people will be undertaking buying and selling activity together if they are all controlled by the same person or persons (e.g. all the companies have the same shareholders). • Regular pattern: officials continue to be of the view that the regular pattern restrictions should be extended to apply to any pattern of buying and selling land, with a focus on the regularity of the transactions, rather than on what is done with the land while it is owned. • Business premises: while we acknowledge the views of submitters that there appears to be less potential for abuse of the business premises exclusion, officials consider that amendment of the regular pattern restriction in the business premises exclusion is necessary to ensure that taxpayers cannot structure around the restriction by using a group of related companies. The proposed changes will ensure this is the case. The main concern from submitters appears to be the concern of overreach. Officials consider this concern will be addressed by amending the regular pattern restriction so it only applies where land is acquired with an intention of resale. • Time-period rule: having considered the submissions, officials have decided that a time-period rule such as that included in the bright-line main home exclusion is not appropriate for the residential and business premises exclusions. In the context of the bright-line test, which taxes sales without consideration of intention, presuming that the exclusion should not apply simply because In Confidence IR2019/622 – Land Rules Review: Tranche 1 Page 9 of 16 IN CONFIDENCE there were multiple transactions within a defined period can be justified. However, officials consider that regularity alone should not be enough to give rise to a taxable transaction under the other provisions. Instead, officials consider that the land needs to also be acquired with an intention of resale. Land Transfer Tax Statement 57. LINZ is undertaking work to reduce compliance costs for property transfers. This work has followed Cabinet’s decision to remove the exemption for providing an IRD number when people transfer a property that is their main home. The removal of the ‘main home’ exemption is to take effect from 1 January 2020. 58. People buying and selling property are currently required to complete up to three forms: the Land Transfer Tax Statement, the Residential Land Statement, and the Residential Land Withholding Tax Declaration. The Residential Land Statement and the Residential Land Withholding Tax Declaration are both able to be changed without legislative amendment. However, the content of the Land Transfer Tax Statement is prescribed by the Land Transfer Act 2017. 59. LINZ seeks to move the content of the Land Transfer Tax Statement from the Land Transfer Act 2017 to regulations, so that changes to the Statement can be made more easily. 60. This amendment should go into the omnibus tax Bill, expected to be introduced in early 2020. Fiscal impacts 61. The amendments to the rules for deductibility of holding costs will prevent taxpayers from taking deductions that they have previously been allowed. Therefore, those amendments will be fiscally positive. However, the impact cannot be quantified. 62. The change to allow full deductions for the costs of acquisition and improvements despite private use is technically revenue negative. However, this change aligns the law with current practice. Therefore, we do not expect any actual revenue loss from this amendment. 63. The amendments to the regular pattern restrictions will stop taxpayers from being able to escape tax by structuring around the rules. Therefore, those amendments will also be fiscally positive. However, the impact cannot be quantified. Administrative implications 64. Inland Revenue has a property compliance programme that will be responsible for the administration of the proposed new rules, including monitoring compliance. It is expected that the proposed amendments for holding costs and habitual buying and selling can be managed within the existing baselines. The proposals are technical in nature and will have no impact on Business Transformation or existing business and system processes. There will be some minor changes required to existing communication products, but all communication will be undertaken using existing communication platforms. Therefore, no additional funding is required to support these changes. Application dates 65. The proposal clarifying that acquisition and capital improvement expenditure is always deductible for land that is taxable on sale should apply from 1 April 2008, In Confidence IR2019/622 – Land Rules Review: Tranche 1 Page 10 of 16 IN CONFIDENCE being the commencement date of the Income Tax Act 2007. All other proposals in this report should apply from the date of enactment. Next steps 66. A draft Cabinet paper and draft Regulatory Impact Assessments are attached. We invite you to consider these and provide feedback on the draft Cabinet paper. 67. The final Cabinet paper will need to be lodged with the Cabinet office by 10am Thursday 5 December 2019 for consideration at the DEV Committee meeting on 11 December 2019. Once Cabinet approval has been received officials will begin drafting the necessary changes to the Income Tax Act and the Land Transfer Act for inclusion in the next taxation Bill, currently scheduled for introduction in March 2020. In Confidence IR2019/622 – Land Rules Review: Tranche 1 Page 11 of 16 IN CONFIDENCE Appendix A – Holding costs – Summary of submissions 68. Nine submissions were received on the proposals for the deductibility of holding costs. The main points made in those submissions are summarised below. 69. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ) submitted that this issue is complex and is likely to have far reaching conclusions. Therefore, they submitted that sufficient time should be allowed to appropriately consider all the relevant matters and to undertake further detailed analysis, including consideration of other options. Jim Gordon Tax Limited (JGT) also raised similar concerns. Deductibility 70. All submitters who commented on the proposal to deny deductions for all holding costs where there is any private use disagreed with that proposal (New Zealand Law Society (NZLS), Findex NZ Limited (Findex), Tandem Group Limited (Tandem), Blackmore Virtue & Owens (BVO), CA ANZ, KPMG, Ernst & Young Limited (EY), JGT). The Corporate Taxpayers Group (CTG) did not comment on the main proposal but noted that the issue of the business/private boundary should not be an issue for members of the group. Comments on policy justification 71. Many of the submitters disagreed with the reasons provided for preferring denial of deductions. 72. Findex submitted that disallowing deductions completely is inconsistent with current tax law. Findex submitted that it is inequitable for tax law to deem the gain on what is essentially a private asset to be taxable income and then deny any deduction for costs incurred in relation to deriving that income on the basis the expenditure is private. 73. EY submitted that where the land tax rules recharacterise otherwise capital account land into revenue account land (e.g. the bright-line test) the same recharacterisation should be extended to holding costs which were previously treated as private in nature. 74. Tandem submitted that unless some of the gain is excluded from tax it is unfair to disallow any of the expenditure on the basis of private use. 75. KPMG noted that, as a matter of principle, some holding costs for privately used land that is taxable on sale should be allowed as a deduction. KPMG said a general prohibition on deductions for holding costs at the time of sale (particularly for interest which, absent rules allowing general deductibility, would be included in the cost of an item) does not accord with commercial reality. 76. EY submitted that in the absence of an adequately workable apportionment approach, it is not apparent why the entirety of the holding costs should be non- deductible. EY submitted that the proposed approach unjustifiably favours the principle underpinning the private limitation over the principle of net taxation. 77. EY submitted that disallowing deductions does not adequately address the fact that the New Zealand income tax system seeks to tax only “net gains”. If a taxpayer derives assessable income, then the framework suggests that related costs ought to be deductible. The wholesale denial of a deduction for holding costs ignores the fact that the taxpayer has incurred costs in relation to holding land and therefore over-calculates the applicable gain made on sale. 78. KPMG submitted that while there are genuine policy reasons for disallowing some holding costs, to the extent of private use of the land, there is no basis for In Confidence IR2019/622 – Land Rules Review: Tranche 1 Page 12 of 16 IN CONFIDENCE disallowing all of the expenditure. The fact that other parts of the Act may not take the correct approach (which is not necessarily accepted) is a poor policy reason for not applying the correct approach in this situation. 79. CA ANZ submitted that a suggestion that other areas of the tax law that do not require apportionment should be changed does not take into account the fact that there is a direct nexus between, for example, rental income derived and the costs incurred in the period. 80. Findex noted that the inappropriateness of the proposed approach is illustrated by the fact that it would deny deductions for a person acquiring property with an intention to renovate and sell, where that expenditure has a clear nexus with deriving assessable income. 81. KPMG also submitted that the argument that denying deductions will save taxpayers from having to find records of their costs is not a justified reason. In practice these costs will not be difficult to track, and if compliance costs from tracking expenditure is excessive, taxpayers do not have to claim them. It should be up to taxpayers to decide the compliance costs they are willing to bear, not the Government. 82. JGT submitted that no positive policy justification has been provided for preferring the no deductions option, and instead this position is reached by default with superficial and insufficient analysis. Apportionment 83. Findex and KPMG agreed that apportionment would be the most accurate approach. 84. NZLS, Findex and JGT noted that apportionment is consistent with current legislation and well-established case law. NZLS pointed, as an example, to the mixed-use asset rules. 85. NZLS submitted that apportionment does not need to be difficult to calculate or administer. They suggest that apportionment may be easily and fairly implemented by measuring the private benefit based on market rental attributed to the land during the periods of private use. NZLS submitted there are online algorithms that can assist in determining this. 86. Other submitters accepted that accurate apportionment would be complicated (Findex, KPMG, CA ANZ). 87. However, Findex noted that while apportionment is complex, the Courts have stated that absolute accuracy is not required. Findex submitted that rejecting apportionment because of complexity and because a simplified approach is inaccurate is not consistent with existing and proposed tax law. Findex and KPMG noted that there are many examples in the Act of situations where accuracy has been sacrificed for simplicity, including the entertainment expenditure deduction rules, the motor vehicle deduction rules, and the proposed new rules for deductions for telecommunication tools used principally for employment duties. Consistency 88. CA ANZ submitted that there should be a consistent approach for all revenue account property, which should result in tax only being paid on the actual gain on disposal (after taking into account the costs of acquisition, capital improvements and holding costs). This should not be different where tax is payable under the bright-line test. 89. EY suggests that the current proposals ignore the horizonal inequity that results if holding costs associated with land that is held with an intention of resale are In Confidence IR2019/622 – Land Rules Review: Tranche 1 Page 13 of 16 IN CONFIDENCE deductible but where land is caught under the bright-line test deductions are prohibited by any private use. Other options 90. Submitters suggested there are other options for the deductibility of holding costs that have not been adequately considered. 91. Findex submitted that an approach where accuracy is sacrificed for simplicity would be appropriate (e.g. a 50/50 apportionment such as in the entertainment expenditure rules). 92. KPMG also suggested that, balancing the need for simplicity and certainty for taxpayers with some denial of costs to reflect the private benefit, a 50% apportionment approach would be reasonable. KPMG noted that while this will not be precisely right for any single situation, denying all deductions would be worse. 93. CA ANZ suggested that an alternative to accurate apportionment is to allow deductions at the time of disposal for all appropriate holding costs capped to the sales proceeds to recognise that holding costs in part may include a private benefit element. CA ANZ submitted that this approach is practical and relatively simple and places taxpayers in the economically correct position by only subjecting the actual gain to tax. CA ANZ also noted that this approach would stop taxpayers from holding onto land for more than five years so that they are not taxed on a gain that is far in excess of what they actually derived. 94. EY submitted that deductions should be allowed to the extent that the proceeds from the sale of the land are caught under the land tax rules, but deductions should be deferred to the time of realisation of the gain, unless current year income is derived from the land. Taxpayers claiming such deductions should be required to provide supporting disclosures to appropriately evidence any costs claimed. EY submitted that deductions should either be ring-fenced to other income from land or capped at net-zero to prevent the creation of carry-forward losses. EY submitted that this type of rule would support the integrity of the tax system and ensure the principle underpinning the private limitation is not excessively eroded. 95. JGT suggested that full deductions should be allowed and the land-owner should be deemed to receive rental income equal to the market value of the private usage. 96. BVO suggested that it is possible to find a simple solution to provide some concession to taxpayers who are taxed under the bright-line test. BVO suggested that the amount of profit that is taxable could be reduced for each year of ownership as is the case for sales subject to the rezoning rule. 97. NZLS, CA ANZ and EY submitted that any option that allows some deductibility would require clarification that the approach will not override the current mixed-use asset rules and will not allow a deduction where one has already been taken under other rules. Vacant land 98. NZLS broadly agreed with the treatment of vacancy, and that the mixed-use asset rules should continue to apply. KPMG also submitted that it seems reasonable to rely on the mixed-use asset rules where they apply. 99. However, most submitters disagreed with the proposals relating to vacant land. In particular, they disagreed that wholly vacant land should be treated as private unless expressly held for an income-earning purpose (Findex, KPMG, EY, CA ANZ, JGT). Findex noted that if a person never used or occupied land, but the subsequent In Confidence IR2019/622 – Land Rules Review: Tranche 1 Page 14 of 16 IN CONFIDENCE sale is subject to tax, holding costs should be deductible on the basis that the only “use” of the land is income-earning. 100. JGT submitted that holding costs should be deductible where wholly vacant land is on revenue account, because tax is paid on net income, which requires deduction of expenses. 101. EY submitted that the preferred approach is overly simplistic and ignores the fact that land which is held vacant, or property which is held unused, may not generate any private benefit to the owner at that point in time. 102. EY also submitted that it is difficult to reconcile why periods of vacancy in a bright- line house should be treated differently to a house which was declared as on revenue account at acquisition. CA ANZ noted there is no justification for having a different approach where land is acquired with an intention of resale versus under the bright-line test. 103. JGT submitted that there is no justification given for denying deductions outside of the limited circumstances where land is held as part of an income-earning activity. EY also submitted that the object of deeming vacant land to be used privately is unclear. EY submitted that the tax system should not be used to incentivise taxpayers to either use or sell their land through denial of deductions. 104. KPMG submitted that it is not reasonable to expect taxpayers to inform the Commissioner at the time of purchase of the land that it was acquired solely with an intention of sale. CA ANZ and JGT also noted that there is no justification for the proposed new information requirement for revenue account vacant land. JGT also noted that it is not clear how taxpayers will make this notification. Alternative approaches 105. Consistent with suggestions for deductibility generally, CA ANZ suggested that the correct approach for vacant land is that all holding costs should be deductible, capped at the sale price where there is actual private use. 106. Similarly, KPMG suggested that where there is any actual private use of vacant or unused land a 50% deduction should be allowed, as they suggested for fully private use land. Definition of vacant land 107. EY submitted that it has not been suggested how vacant land will be defined. 108. JGT submitted that it is not clear what would happen where there are two uses of the land in an income year in situations where the mixed-use asset rules do not apply (e.g. land used privately for part of the year, used as a long-term rental for part of the year and vacant for part of the year). JGT also submitted that there is not enough consideration of incidental use (e.g. parking a trailer on a section that is revenue account property), or partial use (e.g. where part of a larger block of land that is on revenue account is used for private purposes). JGT noted that the document suggests this type of private use will result in deductions being denied which must be wrong. 109. CTG also noted that there needs to be further clarity around when vacant land is held for income earning purposes (e.g. land that is deliberately vacant around an industrial plant should always be considered held for income-earning purposes). In Confidence IR2019/622 – Land Rules Review: Tranche 1 Page 15 of 16 IN CONFIDENCE What are holding costs? 110. EY submitted that the consultation document did not provide sufficient analysis of what is considered a ‘holding cost’. EY submitted that repairs and maintenance, including refurbishment and significant landscaping improvement costs, are all arguably capital improvements and should be deductible. However, costs that are associated with the use of the land and do not provide any enduring benefit, such as lawn mowing, should not be deductible. EY submitted that the boundary should be defined by reference to costs that are necessary for land to be held by a taxpayer (including interest, rates and insurance) versus costs that are incurred merely to improve the current utility of the land for its owner with no enduring benefit. 111. CA ANZ submitted that holding costs should include interest expense, lease payments in respect of leasehold land, and repairs and maintenance (undertaken to retain the value of the property). CA ANZ submitted that holding costs should not include costs directly associated with private use (e.g. power and utility costs). CA ANZ also submitted that there are reasonable arguments for including rates and property insurance as deductible expenditure, as those costs would be deductible for purely revenue account property. 112. KPMG submitted that there could be reasonable arguments for distinguishing between different types of costs. Interest and repairs and maintenance expenditure with a sufficient nexus to a taxable sale should be included as deductible holding costs, but costs such as rates and insurance that are periodic in nature should be outside the scope of the proposed rules because they expire when they are incurred and have less of a nexus with the taxable sale of land. Private use vs income-earning use 113. CTG submitted that the proposals are being made on the basis that there is a clear distinction between private and income-earning use. However, CTG noted that there are often grey areas where land is used for both at the same time, and that there needs to be clear guidance to distinguish between private and income-earning use. 114. JGT submitted that there was insufficient consideration of how incidental use (e.g. parking a trailer on a section that is revenue account property), or partial use (e.g. where part of a larger block of land that is on revenue account is used for private purposes) will be treated. JGT submitted that such use should not impact on the deductibility of holding costs. Holding costs for different entities 115. There was generally support for the proposal that land held in companies should be treated differently to land owned by individuals, partnerships, trusts or look-through companies (CTG, NZLS, CA ANZ, EY). NZLS, EY and JGT agreed that there are already rules to disincentivise company ownership of privately used land. 116. However, EY did not support the broad asymmetry that arises by allowing companies deductions for interest, but not other entities. EY were particularly concerned about this in respect of vacant land, where the proposals would mean that a company could have full deductions because there cannot be private use, and individuals and other entities would get none. 117. EY also noted that focusing on private benefit could be said to be unfair in the context of look-through companies and trusts, where private use by some owners/beneficiaries gives rise to a detriment for all. In Confidence IR2019/622 – Land Rules Review: Tranche 1 Page 16 of 16 IN CONFIDENCE Amendments to rules for deductions of acquisition and improvement costs 118. There was general agreement with the proposals to amend the rules for the deductibility of acquisition and improvement costs to override the general permission and private limitation (NZLS, Tandem, CA ANZ, EY). 119. However, Findex and JGT suggested that it was not necessary to override the general permission because they submitted the general permission already allows for a deduction. In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee AMENDMENTS TO THE TAX RULES FOR LAND Proposal 1.This paper seeks agreement to a number of amendments to the tax rules for land t hat require changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Land Transfer Act 2017. 2.If approved, I propose including the necessary legislative amendments in the next o mnibus tax Bill scheduled for introduction in 2020. Executive Summary 3.As part of the Government’s tax policy work programme the rules around the taxation of land are being reviewed, particularly in relation to investment property and speculators, land banking, and vacant land. 4.This paper recommends a number of amendments to the tax rules for land and that they be included in the next omnibus tax Bill. In particular, this paper seeks agreement to changes regarding the deductibility of acquisition and capital improvement costs for land that is taxable on sale, the rules that restrict the use of the home or business premises exemptions by habitual buyers and sellers of land, and to make it easier to change the content of the Land Transfer Tax Statement. Acquisition and capital improvement expenditure 5.There is uncertainty around the extent to which the costs of acquisition of, and ca pital improvements to, land that is taxable on sale are deductible if it was not clear when the costs were incurred that the sale of the land would be taxable (e.g. a property taxable under the bright-line test). This paper recommends clarifying that these costs are always deductible in full when taxable land is sold. Habitual buyers and sellers of land 6.The land rules generally exempt from tax the sale of a person’s home or business p remises. To prevent these exemptions from being abused they are subject to regular pattern restrictions. The restrictions ensure that people who have a regular pattern of buying and selling their home or business premises cannot use the exemptions to avoid tax. 7.Given the recent tightening of the land rules there is a concern these restrictions may n ot be working as intended and could be structured around. This paper recommends amending the regular pattern restrictions to ensure taxpayers cannot structure around them. 1 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:18:30 IN CONFIDENCE 2. Land Transfer Tax Statement 8. This paper recommends that the content of the Land Transfer Tax Statement be moved from the Land Transfer Act 2017 to regulations. This change will make it easier to amend the Land Transfer Tax Statement, for example where changes would reduce compliance costs for property transfers. Background 9. As part of the Government’s tax policy work programme the rules around the taxation of land are being reviewed, particularly in relation to investment property and speculators, land banking, and vacant land. The objective of this review is to recommend ways to improve the efficient use of land, and ensure that the current tax settings are fair, balanced, and encourage and support productive investment. 10. The review of the tax rules for land is ongoing, however this paper seeks the Committee’s agreement to a number of policy changes from work undertaken to date. Acquisition and capital improvement expenditure 11. The current rules may not allow the costs of acquiring land and making capital improvements to the land to be deducted if it was not clear at the time the expenditure was incurred that the land would be taxable on sale (e.g. land subject to tax under the bright-line test). This would mean that a person who acquires a bach for $500,000, uses it entirely privately and sells it after four years for $600,000 may need to pay tax on the $600,000 sale price rather than the $100,000 gain. 12. It was always intended that the costs of acquisition and capital improvements should be deductible. As such, taxpayers returning income under the bright-line test for sales of privately used land are generally claiming deductions for the acquisition and capital improvements expenditure. 13. I therefore recommend that the rules be clarified to make it clear that acquisition and capital improvement expenditure should always be deductible for land that is taxable on sale. Consultation 14. Submitters on an Inland Revenue consultation document agreed with the proposal to clarify that acquisition and capital improvement expenditure for land that is taxable on sale will always be deductible. Financial implications 15. Allowing deductions for the costs of acquisition of, and improvements to, land, where the gains from the sale are taxable is not forecast to have any fiscal impact. This is because this proposal aligns the law with current practice. Habitual buyers and sellers of land 16. The rules taxing the sale of land exempt the sale of a person’s home (the main home and residential exclusions) or business premises (the business premises exclusion) if they would otherwise be subject to tax. For example, all sales of land by a land dealer are prima facie subject to tax but the exclusions ensure the dealer will not be taxed on the sale of their home. 2 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:18:30 IN CONFIDENCE 17. To ensure the exclusions are not abused, they are subject to regular pattern restrictions. These restrictions ensure that people who regularly buy and sell land cannot hide behind the exclusions to escape tax. For example, a person who has a regular pattern of buying, renovating and selling their homes should pay tax on their gains rather than being able to escape tax by relying on the residential exclusion. 18. The regular pattern restrictions are an important base maintenance measure. However, with the tightening of the land rules, officials are concerned that taxpayers now have greater incentives to structure around the current regular pattern restrictions to escape paying tax. 19. There are two main issues with the current regular pattern restrictions that enable taxpayers to structure around them. Firstly, the restrictions apply narrowly to the activities of a single person. This allows taxpayers to circumvent the application of the regular pattern restrictions by buying and selling land using different but associated persons or entities each time. To address this issue the regular pattern restrictions should be extended to also apply to a group of persons that undertake buying and selling activities together. 20. The second issue with the regular pattern restrictions is that the restrictions have been interpreted narrowly to apply only where there is a similarity or likeness between the transactions (i.e. a pattern of buying land, building a home on the land and then selling). This means the restrictions would not apply where a person does something different to each piece of land they buy and sell. This issue would be addressed by extending the regular pattern restrictions to apply to any pattern of buying and selling land, with a focus on the regularity of the transactions, rather than on what is done with the land while it is owned. 21. I therefore recommend that the regular pattern restrictions be amended to ensure taxpayers cannot structure around them to avoid tax. 22. To prevent any unintended overreach from extending the regular pattern restrictions, the restrictions from the residential exclusion and the business premises exclusion should be limited to only apply when the land was acquired with an intention of disposal. This intention test would ensure that the regular pattern restrictions are in line with the policy intent and do not tax land that was genuinely a person’s home or business premises. Consultation 23. Inland Revenue officials consulted in September 2019 on their concerns with the regular pattern restrictions and proposed solutions. 24. In general, submitters acknowledged the concern that taxpayers can structure around the regular pattern restrictions. However, submitters expressed concerns about the potential for overreach from the proposed amendments and, in particular, that the amendments risk taxing transactions that should not be subject to tax (i.e. sales of genuine homes or business premises). The proposal to add an intention test to the regular pattern restrictions should address submitters’ concerns around potential overreach. 3 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:18:30 IN CONFIDENCE Financial implications 25. The proposed amendments to the regular pattern restrictions are likely to be fiscally positive. However, the fiscal benefit is unquantifiable. Land Transfer Tax Statement 26. People buying and selling property are currently required to complete up to three forms: 26.1 the Land Transfer Tax Statement; 26.2 the Residential Land Statement; and 26.3 the Residential Land Withholding Tax Declaration. 27. Land Information New Zealand is interested in options for streamlining the land transfer process including these forms. 28. The content of the Land Transfer Tax Statement is largely prescribed by the Land Transfer Act 2017. Making any changes to streamline this form would require legislative amendment. Conversely, the Residential Land Statement and the Residential Land Withholding Tax Declaration are both able to be changed without legislative amendment. 29. The Minister for Land Information recommends that the content of the Land Transfer Tax Statement be moved from the Land Transfer Act 2017 be moved to regulations. This will make it easier to amend the Land Transfer Tax Statement, for example where changes would reduce compliance costs for property transfers. I support this amendment being included in the next omnibus tax Bill. Consultation 30. During feedback from consultation earlier this year regarding the removal of the main home exemption, a key theme was that the Land Transfer Tax Statement could benefit from simplification and streamlining. Officials will update key stakeholders on the proposal in this Cabinet paper following Cabinet decisions. This paper also seeks approval for officials to consult with these key stakeholders on drafting details of the proposed change. 31. Statistics New Zealand has been informed of this proposal. Financial implications 32. There are no financial implications from moving the content of the Land Transfer Tax Statement to regulations. Legislative Implications 33. Implementing the proposals in this paper requires changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Land Transfer Act 2017. 34. If approved, I propose including the legislative changes resulting from these recommendations in the next omnibus tax Bill currently scheduled for introduction in March 2020. 4 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:18:30 IN CONFIDENCE 35. The proposal clarifying that acquisition and capital improvement expenditure is always deductible for land that is taxable on sale should apply from 1 April 2008, being the commencement date of the Income Tax Act 2007. All other proposals in this paper should apply from the date of enactment. Impact Analysis 36. The Impact Analysis Requirements apply to the proposals in this Cabinet paper relating to habitual buyers and sellers and, therefore, the Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyers & sellers Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIA) has been prepared and is attached to this Cabinet paper. 37. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyers & sellers RIA and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it partially meets the quality criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. 38. As identified in the Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis section there is no data to support the current scale of the problem or the impact of the proposed changes if they were enacted. However, the RIA sets out the rationale for why the status quo is an issue and why a regulatory change is preferred. The reviewer considers that the information in the RIA is as complete as could be expected and identifies the main risks and uncertainties. 39. The Regulatory Quality Team at the Treasury has determined that the regulatory decisions sought in relation to deductions for acquisition and capital improvements costs of land that is subject to tax on sale and moving the content of the Land Transfer Tax Statement from the Land Transfer Act 2017 to regulations are exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Assessment as they have no or minor impacts on businesses, individuals or not for profit entities. Human Rights 40. The proposals in this paper do not impinge on rights and freedoms under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993. Gender Implications 41. There are no gender implications arising from these proposals Disability Perspective 42. No disability issues arise from these proposals Other Consultation 43. The Treasury has been consulted on this Cabinet paper. 44. The Ministry for Housing and Urban Development has been informed. Publicity 45. I will make an announcement on the contents of the next omnibus tax Bill, including these proposals, when the Bill is introduced. A commentary on the Bill will also be released at this time. Inland Revenue will include details of the new legislation in a Tax Information Bulletin after the Bill is enacted. 5 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:18:30 IN CONFIDENCE Proactive Release 46. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet Economic Development Committee: Acquisition and capital improvement expenditure 1. Agree that the costs of acquisition and improvements to land that is taxable on sale are always deductible in full; 2. Note that agreeing that the costs of acquisition and improvements to land that is taxable on sale are always deductible in full would not have a fiscal impact as it would align the law with current practice; Habitual buyers and sellers of land 3. Agree to amend the regular pattern restrictions in the main home, residential and business premises exclusions from the land tax rules, to ensure taxpayers cannot structure around them to escape tax; 4. Note that agreeing to amend the regular pattern restrictions would likely have a minor positive but unquantifiable fiscal impact; Land Transfer Tax Statement 5. Agree to amend the Land Transfer Act 2017 to allow changes to the Land Transfer Tax Statement to be made by regulation; Legislative vehicle 6. Agree that the legislative amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Land Transfer Act 2017 required to give effect to the changes recommended in this paper be included in the omnibus tax Bill scheduled for introduction in March 2020; 7. Invite the Minister of Revenue to instruct Inland Revenue to draft the necessary amendments to give effect to the changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 recommended in this paper; 8. Invite the Minister for Land Information to instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft the necessary amendments to give effect to the changes to the Land Transfer Act 2017 recommended in this paper; 9. Authorise officials to consult with stakeholders on the draft version of the amendments recommended in this paper to ensure they achieve the policy intent; 10. Agree to delegate authority to the Minister of Revenue to make decisions on the detailed design of the changes recommended in this paper; and 6 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:18:30 IN CONFIDENCE Proactive Release 11.

This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing key policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis There are a number of limitations or constraints. These are: •There is no data to confirm that the issues the policy proposals are intending to address are currently a problem. Instead, officials have identified a gap in the current legislation that may be exploited by taxpayers considering recent and ongoing changes to tighten the rules for taxing land disposals. On that basis, officials consider that it is important to address these issues at this time. •Options have been limited to considering making the current framework more effective. Officials did not consider options that would tax more categories of land. •The lack of data on the scope and scale of taxpayer practices and structuring makes it difficult to determine which options best address the problem. •The lack of data means that no qualitative impact analysis is possible. However, problem definition and solutions were subject to targeted and public consultation.

Responsible Manager (signature and date): Peter Frawley Policy Lead Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 19 November 2019 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 3 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 2 : Pro b le m de fin itio n an d o bjec tiv es 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? This RIA considers proposals to tighten the rules that apply where people regularly buy and sell land that is used mainly as a home or business premises while it is held by them. Current situation The land sales rules contained in part CB of the Income Tax Act 2007 tax gains from the sale of land when the land is held by a person effectively as trading stock (in the same way that a furniture vendor is taxed on the gains they make from selling their furniture). It is not intended that the rules tax gains on capital assets (e.g. gains from selling the furniture vendor’s shop or a person’s home). However, the rules are drafted quite broadly to ensure that people cannot easily structure around them, which means they can catch some land that is inherently a capital asset. To limit this potential overreach, the rules contain exclusions. Relevantly, the rules exclude from tax gains from the sale of: • a person’s main home, where land sales are subject to tax under the bright-line test 1 (the main home exclusion) • a person’s residence, where land sales are subject to tax because the land was acquired with an intention of disposal, or where the owner or an associated person is in a business involving land (the residential exclusion) • a business premises, where land sales are subject to tax because the land was acquired with an intention of disposal, or where the owner or an associated person is in a business involving land (the business premises exclusion). For example, the land sales rules tax all sales of land by a land dealer, but the exclusions ensure the dealer will not be taxed on the sale of their home. To ensure these exclusions are not abused, they are subject to regular pattern restrictions which stop the exclusions applying where a person has a regular pattern of buying and selling land used as a main home, residence or business premises. The regular pattern restriction in the main home exclusion for the bright-line test is also supplemented by a time- period rule, which states that the main home exclusion will not apply if a person has relied on it twice in the previous two years. These restrictions ensure that people who regularly buy and sell land effectively as trading stock cannot rely on the exclusions to escape tax. Why is the current situation a problem? Given the recent tightening of the land rules 2 there is a concern that taxpayers can avoid the regular pattern restrictions by arranging their affairs so they do not have a pattern of buying and selling main homes, residences or business premises. This is contrary to the policy intention. 1 The bright-line test taxes gains from the sale of residential land acquired and sold within five years. 2 Including the introduction of the bright-line test and the new residential rental ring-fencing rules that only allow deductions to be offset against income derived from land (e.g. rental income). 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 4 IN CONFIDENCE The risk is that the government is missing out on tax revenue from those that are effectively making trading profits from the buying and selling of land, but are relying upon the main home, residential or business premises exclusions to escape tax. Over time there is a risk that greater numbers of investors may become involved in trading homes and business premises to take advantage of the tax-free gains. We are unable to estimate the size of the current tax gap or how this could change with increased investor activity. The general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) will continue to effectively override other provisions of the tax legislation to deny the tax benefits of an arrangement where a more than incidental purpose of the arrangement is to obtain a tax benefit. In some circumstances the GAAR could be invoked where a taxpayer has structured their affairs in such a way that they have avoided establishing a regular pattern of purchase and sale of home or business premises. However, in many circumstances the GAAR may not be the most effective tool to counter such structuring. It is considered preferable for there to be clarity and transparency in the underlying law to give certainty to both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. What is the underlying cause of the problem? Officials have concerns that the current regular pattern restrictions are not working as intended. This undermines the integrity of the tax system by allowing people to take advantage of the exclusions in circumstances where this was not intended. As the restrictions are currently drafted, taxpayers who are undertaking regular buying and selling activity can structure around the regular pattern restrictions in one of two ways. Firstly, the regular pattern restrictions apply quite narrowly to the activities of a single person. This allows taxpayers to circumvent the application of the regular pattern restrictions by buying and selling land using different persons or entities each time (for example, the first property is purchased by the person, the second is purchased by their partner, the third by their family trust). Secondly, the regular pattern restrictions have been interpreted narrowly to apply only when there is a similarity or likeness between the transactions (for example, a pattern of buying land, building a home on the land and then selling). This means that the regular pattern restrictions will not apply where a person does something different to each piece of land. For example, the first property is bought, lived in and sold, the second is renovated while it is lived in and sold, or the third is a bare section where a house is built and occupied then sold. Why does it need to be addressed now? The Government has indicated that people who engage in property speculation will come under increasing scrutiny. This is why a review of the land rules was added to the Government’s Tax Policy Work Programme earlier in the year. One of the aims of this review is to consider ways to improve the integrity of the tax system. How much confidence is there in the evidence and assumptions for the problem definition? While there is currently no data, to the extent that there is currently a gap in the current land rules, it is reasonable to assume that some investors will look to exploit the existence of tax- free gains. Other context The issues considered in this RIA have been identified as part of a review of the current land tax rules undertaken by Inland Revenue. As part of this review, other regulatory changes 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 5 IN CONFIDENCE have been identified, including: • clarifying the extent to which holding costs (such as interest, rates and insurance) should be deductible when the gain from the sale of private use land (such as a bach) is taxable; and • moving the requirements of the Land Transfer Tax Statement (a form filed with Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) when people buy, sell or transfer property) from the Land Transfer Act 2017 to new secondary regulations operated by LINZ to provide a more flexible way to make any future changes to the form. A second tranche of the land review is planned which will include consideration of the following: • extending the bright-line test to farmland and commercial properties; • extending Residential Land Withholding Tax to New Zealand residents; • reviewing the re-zoning rule; • reviewing the land tax frameworks; • considering the introduction of a vacant land tax; and • various compliance and administration matters. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The group of people potentially affected by tightening the rules are taxpayers who regularly buy land to be used mainly as a home or business premises and then sell that land. The proposed regulatory changes seek to clarify and support, rather than depart from, existing policy in the area by ensuring that the regular pattern restrictions apply to people who regularly buy and sell land to stop them escaping tax. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The Government announced in April 2019 that it would not be proceeding with a capital gains tax, but that other initiatives to improve the fairness of the tax system would be considered, including tightening the rules around land speculation and working on ways to counter land banking. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 6 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 3: O p tio n s id e n tifica tio n 3.1 What options have been considered? This RIA deals with proposed regulatory changes to tighten the rules that relate to regular buying and selling of homes and business premises to ensure people cannot escape paying tax by relying on the exclusions where that was not intended. The proposals have arisen in the context of the review of the current land tax rules, to meet the Government’s objectives of improving the efficient use of land, and ensuring that tax settings are fair, balanced, and encourage and support productive investment. All options are assessed against the following criteria: a) Integrity of the tax system: the tax rules should operate so as to collect revenue where intended. b) Effectiveness: the tax rules should produce the right amount of tax at the right time; the potential for tax evasion and avoidance should be minimised while keeping counteracting measures proportionate to risks involved. c) Fairness: the tax rules should not be arbitrary and should be fair to different taxpayers. d) Certainty and simplicity: the tax rules should be as clear and simple as possible so that taxpayers who attempt to comply with the rules are able to do so. Increasing the integrity of the tax system is a primary objective of these changes. However, it is necessary to balance this objective against ensuring that the rules are effective, fair and balanced, and that they provide certainty and simplicity for taxpayers. Group of persons or entities The current regular pattern restrictions apply when a single person (which includes a company, trust or other entity type) has a pattern of buying and selling. This limited application gives rise to a risk that taxpayers can structure around the regular pattern restrictions by using other persons or entities to carry out each transaction, rather than carrying out multiple transactions on their own. Option 1: Status quo The first option is to maintain the status quo, so the regular pattern restrictions continue to apply only to the actions of a single person. This option undermines the integrity and effectiveness of the tax system because it allows taxpayers to structure around the rules to avoid tax. It also unfair as it benefits those taxpayers who are willing and able to structure around the rules. However, remaining with the status quo could be said to be a simpler option, and would avoid the need for more complex rules. Option 2: Extend the regular pattern restrictions to groups of people The second option is to expand the regular pattern restrictions to apply to groups of people, as follows: 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 7 IN CONFIDENCE • For the residential exclusion, a group of people will be undertaking buying and selling activity together if they all occupy all of the properties as their residence, or if the people who occupy all of the properties as their residences control the trusts or other entities that own the properties. • For the business premises exclusion, a group of people will be undertaking buying and selling activity together if they are all controlled by the same person or persons (e.g. all the companies have the same shareholders). This option will protect the integrity and effectiveness of the tax system by ensuring that people cannot structure to avoid their tax obligations. It will also ensure that taxpayers pay their fair share of tax. However, these changes will introduce further complexity to the rules. Similar activities The current regular pattern restrictions have been interpreted as only applying when there is a similarity or likeness in the transactions. There is a concern that this allows taxpayers to structure around the regular pattern restrictions by carrying out different activities on each piece of land so there is not sufficient similarity or likeness in the transactions. Option 1: Status quo The first option would be to maintain the status quo. This option undermines the integrity and effectiveness of the tax system because it allows taxpayers to structure around the rules to avoid tax. It is also unfair as it benefits those taxpayers who are willing and able to structure around the rules. Option 2: Focus on regularity of transactions The second option is to amend the rules to capture patterns of buying and selling, with the focus being on the regularity of the transactions, rather than on the similarity or likeness of what is done on the land. This option will protect the integrity and effectiveness of the tax system by ensuring that people cannot structure to avoid their tax obligations. It will also ensure that taxpayers pay their fair share of tax. This option will reduce complexity and add clarity to the legislation by simplifying the factors that must be satisfied before the restriction will apply. Intention test The residential and business premises exclusions currently apply both: • when a person acquired land with a purpose or intention of disposal or for business involving land; and • for disposals of land within 10 years when a person is associated with a person who carries on a business involving land. Therefore, it is possible that the current regular pattern restrictions could result in a person who is associated with a land dealer being taxed on the sale of their home or business premises because they have been forced to move for family or business reasons several times over a couple of years. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 8 IN CONFIDENCE It has been proposed by submitters that the regular pattern restrictions could be limited to situations where the land has been acquired with a purpose or intention of disposal. Option 1: Status quo The first option is to maintain the status quo and continue to apply the regular pattern restrictions to situations where a person is associated with a person in a business involving land. In the context of the other proposed amendments, this option has the potential to be unfair, because it risks capturing sales of genuine homes and business premises. The potential for unfairness undermines the integrity of the tax system, and heightens the risk of tax avoidance and evasion as taxpayers seek to escape a tax they consider unfair. However, retaining the status quo could be seen as being simpler as it applies the same rules to all taxpayers who are subject to the exclusions. Option 2: Introduction of intention test The second option is to limit the application of the regular pattern restrictions to situations where the owner of the land acquired it with an intention of disposal. This option improves the integrity of the tax system in that it helps to ensure the rules only operate to collect revenue where intended. It also improves the effectiveness and fairness of the tax system by only taxing true revenue gains. The introduction of a further limitation will, however, add some complexity to the rules. Amending the business premises regular pattern restriction The business premises exclusion applies only where the owner of the land mainly uses the land to carry on a substantial business. Because the business premises exclusion is limited in this way, it has been suggested by submitters that it is already hard to structure around and does not require amendment to cover activities by a group of people. Option 1: Status quo The first option is to maintain the status quo. This option is simple because it will not require complex grouping rules. However, this option risks allowing taxpayers to structure around the regular pattern restriction, which reduces the integrity and effectiveness of the tax system. It could also be argued that not amending the business premises exclusion if the residential and main home exclusions are amended (as proposed above) would be unfair in that it would allow those owning land for business purposes advantages over those owning land for residential purposes. Option 2: Amend the business premises regular pattern restriction The second option is to amend the regular pattern restriction in the business premises exclusion to apply when a person, or a group of people or entities that are all controlled by a person or group of persons, regularly buy and sell land used as business premises. This option would improve the integrity, effectiveness and fairness of the tax system by ensuring that taxpayers cannot avoid tax by using separate entities to carry on buying and selling activities where those activities would be subject to tax if they were carried on by one 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 9 IN CONFIDENCE person alone. By doing so, it will better ensure that the right amount of revenue is collected over time. This option also improves clarity for taxpayers by clearly indicating activity that should be subject to tax. This option will, however, not be simpler because it will require relatively complex rules to capture the intended group of people or entities. Time-period rule The regular pattern restriction in the main home exclusion for the bright-line test is supplemented by a time-period rule, which states that the main home exclusion will not apply if a person has relied on it twice in the previous two years. This time-period does not appear in the residential and business premises exclusions. To attempt to provide clarity and objectivity, a similar time-period rule could be added to the residential and business premises exclusions. Option 1: Status quo The first option is to maintain the status quo and have no time-period restrictions in the residential and business premises exclusions. This option is simple but leaves uncertainty in the rules because the current rules are subjective making them harder to apply. However, this option is more likely to maintain the integrity of the tax system by ensuring that transactions would not be subject to tax simply due to volume. In doing so, it would also ensure that the rules are perceived to be fair. Option 2: Add time period restrictions The second option is to add time-period restrictions (i.e. the exclusions will not apply if they have been used twice in two years) to the residential and business premises exclusions. This option could add clarity to the rules because it would introduce an objective test to apply. However, introducing an extra provision decreases the simplicity of the rules. However, this option could reduce the integrity of the tax system as it risks taxing sales of genuine homes and business premises merely due to the level of transactions undertaken with no consideration given to the person’s intention. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 10 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Officials consider that the following amendments to the regular pattern restrictions are the best options to resolve the issue: Group of persons or entities Recommendation: Option 2 - Extend the regular pattern restrictions to groups of people The regular pattern restrictions should be extended to apply to a person or a group of persons that undertake buying and selling activity together: • For the residential exclusion, a group of people will be undertaking buying and selling activity together if they all occupy all of the properties as their residence, or if the people who occupy all of the properties as their residences control the trusts or other entities that own the properties. • For the business premises exclusion, a group of people will be undertaking buying and selling activity together if they are all controlled by the same person or persons (e.g. all the companies have the same shareholders). This will protect the integrity and effectiveness of the tax system by ensuring that people cannot structure to avoid their tax obligations. It will also ensure that taxpayers pay their fair share of tax. Similar activities Recommendation: Option 2 - Focus on regularity of transactions The regular pattern restrictions should be extended to apply more broadly to any pattern of buying and selling land used as a residence or business premises. It should not matter whether properties were simply bought and sold, or whether any building or renovation work occurred while the person owned the land. What should be relevant is that there are “regular” transactions (that is, the transactions occur at sufficiently uniform or consistent intervals). This will ensure that the regular pattern restrictions are no longer restricted to applying only where there is a similarity or likeness between the transactions (for example, a pattern of buying land, building a home on the land and then selling). This will increase the integrity of the tax system. Intention test Recommendation: Option 2 - Introduce intention test The regular pattern restrictions in the residential and business premises exclusions should be targeted so they only apply where the person acquired the land with an intention of disposal. Expanding the regular pattern restrictions gives rise to an increased risk that they could catch ordinary residential transactions that occur for family reasons, and small businesses who are upgrading as their business grows because the person is, or is associated with, a person in a business involving land. Officials consider that the regular pattern restrictions should be limited to ensure that people who regularly buy and sell land effectively as trading stock cannot use the home or business premise exclusions to escape tax. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 11 IN CONFIDENCE This option improves the integrity of the tax system in that it helps to ensure the rules only operate to collect revenue where intended. It also improves the effectiveness and fairness of the tax system by only taxing true revenue gains. Amending the business premises regular pattern restriction Recommendation: Option 2 - Regular pattern restriction in the business premises exclusion should be amended The regular pattern restriction in the business premises exclusion should be amended to apply to activities by a group of people or entities. Under the current rules, a single person cannot escape tax by using land acquired as trading stock as a business premises while they hold it. This outcome should not be able to be structured around by using a group of entities controlled by a person. The proposed changes will ensure this is the case. The main concern raised by submitters appeared to be the concern of overreach. Officials consider that this risk is mitigated by limiting the regular pattern restrictions, so they only apply when land is acquired with an intention of resale. Time-period rule Recommendation: Option 1 - Status quo A time-period rule such as that included in the bright-line main home exclusion is not appropriate for the residential and business premises exclusions. In the context of the bright-line test, which taxes sales without consideration of intention, presuming the exclusion should not apply simply because there were multiple transactions within a defined period can be justified. However, regularity alone should not be enough to give rise to a taxable transaction under the other provisions. Instead, it is important that the owner also has an intention of disposal. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 12 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 4: Impac t An a ly s is (Pr o po se d ap p r oa ch) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non- monetised impacts Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Taxpayers who regularly buy land, use it as a main home, residence or business premises and then sell it, structuring the transactions around the regular pattern restrictions as the legislation is currently drafted Will need to return the disposal of land for tax purposes.

There are no other identified impacts of this approach. Sec tio n 5: Stak e hold er vie ws 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Consultation document Officials issued a consultation document “Habitual buying and selling” in September 2019 setting out the issues and proposing possible solutions and asked for taxpayers’ views on the proposals. Prior to releasing the document publicly, officials also tested their thinking with some private sector advisors. Feedback In general, submitters appear to understand officials’ concerns that taxpayers can structure around the regular pattern restrictions, and most supported changes in the area. However, almost all submitters expressed concerns about the potential for overreach from the proposed amendments and, in particular, that the amendments risk taxing transactions that should not be subject to tax (i.e. sales of genuine homes or business premises). Submitters also disagreed with proposals to amend the regular pattern restriction in the business premises exclusion. They submitted there was no evidence of any abuse of that exclusion. Submitters could see that a time-period rule may be useful to supplement the regular pattern restriction in the residential exclusion. However, there was concern that a time-period rule would be arbitrary and could not accommodate factors outside a person’s control. Submitters’ views and concerns were taken into account by officials in forming the preferred views discussed above. In particular, officials addressed submitters’ concerns around overreach i.e. that the proposals risk taxing the sale of homes or business premises for genuine reasons. In response to those concerns, officials propose to target the regular pattern restrictions to situations where there is an intention of resale. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 14 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 6: Imp le men ta tio n a n d op er a tio n 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals will require amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 which could be included in the omnibus tax Bill scheduled to be introduced in early 2020. The changes should apply prospectively, i.e. only properties acquired and sold after the application date would be taxable. However, properties acquired before the application date would be able to be considered for the purposes of determining whether a taxpayer has a regular pattern. Inland Revenue will release details of the Cabinet decision once it is made and further detail will be provided in a commentary released when the Bill is introduced and will also be included in the Tax Information Bulletin after the Bill is enacted. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the ongoing monitoring and enforcement of the rules. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 15 IN CONFIDENCE Sectio n 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lua tio n a n d re v ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue undertakes regular review of land transactions via its Property Compliance Programme (PCP), which is aimed at ensuring that those involved in property dealing or speculation pay their fair share of tax. Inland Revenue undertakes regular reporting to government as part of the PCP. Inland Revenue is also developing a Data Intelligence Platform (DIP) to enable right-time interaction and appropriate risk-based interventions, by identifying affected customers, understanding customer behaviours and needs, and highlighting areas of compliance focus as well as policy weakness, including how these matters relate to land. The DIP will be able to pull in relevant sources of data and can be used to identify certain types of customer groups, build customer profiles and understand the problem in a wider context. However, as with any other information system it will be dependent upon the personnel, data available and cases run in order to deliver its potential value. The DIP will continue to be developed to further refine Inland Revenue’s ability to target particular transactions including assisting Inland Revenue in monitoring whether the exclusions are operating as intended, and educating taxpayers on the matter as appropriate. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? Inland Revenue would closely monitor the effectiveness of the proposed changes as part of the PCP programme. The final step in the Generic Tax Policy Process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. A post-implementation review could occur around two years after the tax year that the amendments first apply. Any recommended changes identified from the review would be considered for potential inclusion on the Government's tax policy work programme. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 I N C O N F I D E N C E DEV-19-MIN-0352 Cabinet Economic Development Committee Minute of Decision This document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.

This report seeks cabinet approval to release GST Policy Issues an officials’ issues paper for public consultation. A draft officials’ issues paper and draft cabinet paper are attached to this report, for your consideration. 2. The GST system currently collects approximately $28 billion per annum (or approximately 32% of tax revenue) and like other tax revenue regimes, requires regular updates and improvements to maintain the certainty, efficiency and fairness of the GST system. 3. In recent months, officials have been engaging with internal and external stakeholders (including private sector GST advisors) to identify GST policy issues that need to be addressed by amending the Goods and Services Act 1985 (the GST Act). Officials have undergone a prioritisation process through consultation with internal and external stakeholders. As a result, officials are confident that the proposed items for inclusion should be addressed. 4. To consult on these changes, officials have prepared an officials’ issues paper on a range of current GST policy issues. The officials’ issues paper will seek feedback on various policy options to protect against identified gaps in the GST base as well as responding to changes to commercial practice and technology. 5. The key policy issues proposed for inclusion are: • modernising the tax invoice requirements; • the GST treatment of crypto-assets; • apportionment and adjustment rules for assets used both for taxable and private use; • the GST treatment of domestic transport of goods, where it is a part of the service of transporting goods internationally; • the difficulties for non-residents attending a business conference and staff training event in New Zealand and being unable to practically recover their GST costs; • the GST treatment of certain fees and services in the managed funds industry; • the GST treatment of insurance pay-outs to third parties; and • changes to the compulsory zero-rating of land. 6. These issues are discussed further in this report. A number of other technical and remedial policy issues will also be included in the officials’ issues paper. This report briefly summarises these issues and seeks your approval to publicly consult on these items. In Confidence IR2019/593: Cabinet paper – GST Policy Issues: an officials’ issues paper Page 2 of 11 IN CONFIDENCE 7. If you agree to the recommendations in this report, the next step is to obtain Cabinet’s approval to publicly release the GST Policy Issues consultation document for public submissions and feedback. A draft Cabinet paper is attached for lodgement with the Cabinet Office by 10.00am Thursday, for consideration by the Economic Development Committee the following Wednesday. 8. The estimated overall fiscal cost of the changes suggested in the paper are unknown. Public consultation will provide an opportunity for officials to obtain data to support the fiscal impact analysis process. Where a particular policy proposal has been well developed, officials have provided a likely range, depending on the final policy design. Any final policy decisions are likely not to be effective until the 2022/23 fiscal year onwards. 9. Officials anticipate the fiscal cost for the non-residents attending New Zealand business conferences policy issue could be up to . This is based on historical conference spend survey data and is based on all spending being zero-rated – and does not account for goods and services that are unlikely to be zero-rated as part of final policy decisions (such as private expenditure or domestic airfares).

Referred Graeme Morrison Policy Lead Policy and Strategy Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue / /2019 In Confidence IR2019/593: Cabinet paper – GST Policy Issues: an officials’ issues paper Page 5 of 11 IN CONFIDENCE Background Background 10. The latest Tax Policy Work Programme includes the release of a GST officials’ issues paper. The proposed changes in the officials’ issues paper will ensure the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the Act) is well maintained and best reflects new technologies and business practices. GST accounts for almost a third of total tax revenue in New Zealand and so any issues or potential loopholes in the GST base need to be remediated. 11. Over the years, Inland Revenue has established a tradition of releasing GST officials’ issues papers to consult on various changes to the Act. The previous GST officials’ issues papers were released in 2015 and 2012 and were well received. GST practitioners welcome these officials’ issues papers and increasingly expect regular consultation on these matters. 12. Since 2015, a number of GST issues have arisen. These include a mix of significant policy issues, as well as minor policy issues and base maintenance (remedial) items. 13. Officials have prepared a draft GST officials’ issues paper (GST Policy Issues) that outlines these GST issues and seeks public submissions on the problem definition and potential policy solutions. 14. Below is a brief description of the policy issues in the officials’ issues paper. The attached draft cabinet paper and officials’ issues paper provides more detail on each item. Tax invoice requirements 15. The GST system has relied in the widespread use of tax invoices since GST was first introduced. The tax invoice is a useful tool for both businesses and Inland Revenue. Significant changes in commercial practice and technology since then has meant the current tax invoice requirements are imposing excessive compliance costs on businesses. 16. Officials have proposed a number of changes to the tax invoice requirements, including better use of existing electronic information (such as accounting software), not requiring the permission of Inland Revenue to create buyer-created tax invoices, as well as other proposed initiatives. 17. It is anticipated that these changes will better align the tax invoice requirements with current commercial practice and will reduce compliance costs for businesses. The proposals should have no fiscal impact. Cryptocurrencies 18. Cryptocurrencies (also known as crypto-assets) are digital assets such as digital coins (or tokens) that use cryptography and a decentralised computer network to securely produce coins and verify the transfer and ownership of coins between individuals. New Zealand has a fast-growing market for crypto assets – including investors and exchanges. 19. For GST purposes, the definitions of “money” or “financial services” are classified as exempt supplies and consequently, GST does not apply. The current definitions were largely developed in 1985 with the introduction of GST and at the time did not contemplate crypto-assets. This has meant that certain crypto-assets may incur GST, but not others. In Confidence IR2019/593: Cabinet paper – GST Policy Issues: an officials’ issues paper Page 6 of 11 IN CONFIDENCE 20. As well, the broad definition of “money or money’s worth” used in the financial arrangements rules mean certain crypto-assets will be subject to income tax on unrealised gains and losses (crypto-assets can be very volatile). 21. The officials’ issues paper proposes to remove crypto-assets from both the GST rules (by deeming it an exempt supply) and the financial arrangements rules (by deeming it an exempted financial arrangement). Other services relating to crypto- assets such as computer services and exchange services will continue to be subject to the existing GST and income tax rules. 22. Given crypto-assets are often discussed in the media, it is likely that this issue and proposed solution will attract public and media interest. Officials expect most stakeholders will welcome the proposed solution, although some may suggest wider tax and regulatory crypto-asset reforms. 23. The proposals should have no fiscal or administrative costs as they align with current practices. Apportionment and adjustment 24. The apportionment and adjustment rules apply when a GST registered person uses goods and services for both taxable and non-taxable (private use) purposes. Essentially the rules determine the portion of GST that can be claimed back on the purchase of the asset (because it is being used for taxable purposes). These rules can be complex and difficult to apply to every situation. In some situations, the taxpayer can be over-taxed or under-taxed. 25. It is proposed to simplify the rules while also reducing the instances of over or under taxation. Importantly, the changes aim to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers. The officials’ paper is also seeking submitters suggestions on ways the rules could be further simplified. 26. Stakeholders are likely to appreciate simplifying the rules. Given the range of policy options available and the fact that they are not mutually exclusive, it is difficult to undertake a fiscal impact analysis. Some of the proposals may have a positive or negative fiscal impact. Officials will provide a fiscal impact analysis before final policy decisions are sought. Domestic leg of the international transport of goods 27. The GST Act zero-rat es (GST is charged at zero percent) the service of transporting goods into or out of New Zealand (e.g. Sydney to Auckland mail centre and then onto Hamilton) by transport suppliers, such as parcel courier service suppliers. Exported goods are zero-rated (so the underlying transport cost is also zero-rated) and the value of transport services is already included in the cost of importing goods and is subject to GST to the importer (and so GST has already been paid on the transport service). 28. The current zero-rated rule only applies where the whole transport service is supplied by one transport supplier (i.e. Sydney to Hamilton). The rule is strictly applied to the extent that where an international transport supplier subcontracts to a domestic transport supplier (for the Auckland to Hamilton leg of the transport service), the zero-rated rule does not apply and GST must be charged by the domestic supplier for the domestic delivery service. The international supplier cannot easily claim that GST back. This means the GST becomes imbedded into the price of an international transport service if the international transport supplier is not registered for New Zealand GST. In Confidence IR2019/593: Cabinet paper – GST Policy Issues: an officials’ issues paper Page 7 of 11 IN CONFIDENCE 29. Officials propose to allow domestic transport services supplied to a non-resident international transport supplier (as part of the international transport of goods) to be zero-rated. This will essentially involve extending the current zero-rated rule to include commercial subcontracting arrangements. This approach will also align existing rules for postal letters mailed to New Zealand and mirror similar GST rules in Australia and Singapore. 30. If adopted, it is anticipated that the likely fiscal cost will be minimal. It is understood that it is the current commercial practice within the industry not to impose GST where it is not a single transport supplier. 31. It is expected that stakeholders will be supportive of this change, as it will provide certainty and fairness as well as recognising that the law is catching up with commercial practice. Business conferences and staff training 32. Business conferences, conventions and staff training (for a New Zealand event) is subject to GST. This GST can be claimed back by businesses because GST is a tax on private consumption rather than business expenses. New Zealand residents can claim back the GST using the usual GST return processes. Non-residents can claim back the GST by registering for New Zealand GST (non-resident supplies). 33. For non-residents, the cost of having to register for GST and filing a GST return can exceed the GST recovered, especially where the non-resident is attending for a one- off NZ event. 34. It is proposed to zero-rate GST imposed on New Zealand events services provided to non-resident businesses. This change will not apply to education and training services provided to students. This change would remove a compliance cost that may be otherwise dissuading non-residents to attend New Zealand events. This is a similar approach to that taken by Australia and Singapore. 35. It is likely that the New Zealand conference and convention industry will support this change, as it will further encourage international conferences and conventions to be hosted in New Zealand. 36. Officials anticipate the fiscal cost for the non-residents attending New Zealand business conferences policy issue could be up to . This is based on historical conference spend survey data and is based on all spending included in the survey becoming zero-rated. 37. The expected fiscal impact is likely to be significantly less on the final policy design as the policy design is likely to exclude types of spending counted by the survey. This includes goods purchased in New Zealand as well as other forms of private expenditure, and certain domestic airfares (both which are unlikely to be zero- rated). As well, the survey results include non-resident spending that is already recovered by GST registered non-residents. Managed funds 38. For GST purposes, financial services are exempt from GST. This is because it is quite difficult to accurately determine the cost or the service fee of a financial service when it is bundled with a return on savings or investment income (which is considered “money” and GST exempt). Where the taxpayer is earning exempt income, they cannot claim GST paid on the business expenses incurred in providing the exempt good or service. This essentially means this GST exemption is used to partly tax financial services. s 9(2)(f)(iv) In Confidence IR2019/593: Cabinet paper – GST Policy Issues: an officials’ issues paper Page 8 of 11 IN CONFIDENCE 39. Within the fund manager and investment management industry, both financial services and other services (such as investment advice) can be supplied as a single service, meaning there can be differing treatment for GST claimed back, resulting in inconsistency, complexity and compliance costs. Some fund managers apply GST to all their fees (therefore claim back all GST paid on their business expenses), some do not apply GST (therefore cannot claim back any GST on their business expenses), and some have a mix. This situation is occurring to the extent that it is creating competitive distortions in the marketplace. 40. It is proposed to amend the definition of “financial services” to apply across the industry. The officials’ issues paper presents five potential options: • broadening the GST exemption to all fund management services; • narrowing the GST exemption to make their fees fully subject to GST; • deeming a percentage of their services to be exempt; • to zero-rate for all GST to be claimed back (without requiring GST on services); or • allow a reduced GST credits mechanism. 41. No option is preferred over the others currently, so this consultation is exploratory in nature at this stage . 42. 43. At this stage, it is difficult to accurately determine what the fiscal impact may be under any of the policy options. Insurance pay-outs to third parties 44. GST applies to general (non-life) insurance where the taxpayer is GST registered and they are insuring their taxable activity (i.e. their business). T hey can claim GST deductions on the insurance premiums paid, and correspondingly GST output tax is imposed on any insurance pay-outs and settlements. GST does not apply to compensation payments such as out-of-court settlements. 45. In certain situations, a third party may be paid directly by the insurer for damage or loss incurred by the insured claimant. The third party is still required to account for the GST – but may be unaware of whether the source of the funds is from a compensation payment or insurance settlement. Some insurers may not readily disclose the GST treatment of any potential payments as part of the settlement negotiation process. 46. Officials have received mixed reports about the scale of this issue. The insurers officials have spoken with believe this issue is not endemic within the industry, however both Inland Revenue investigators and external tax advisors have raised on-going concerns. 47. The officials’ issues paper proposes three options: • to make the insurer responsible for any GST obligations on behalf of the claimant; • require the insurer to disclose that the payment is subject to GST to the claimant or third party; and s 9(2)(g)(i) In Confidence IR2019/593: Cabinet paper – GST Policy Issues: an officials’ issues paper Page 9 of 11 IN CONFIDENCE • or provide education and guidance material for advisors and taxpayers. 48. Officials have discussed this policy issue with several large insurers. Industry stakeholders are likely to strongly oppose option one and, to a lesser extent option two as these options may impose compliance costs on insurers (however it will reduce compliance costs for the claimant and third party). The insurers are likely to prefer option three. 49. At this stage, it is difficult to accurately determine what the fiscal impact may be under any of the three policy options. Based on historical insurance data, officials do not anticipate that the fiscal impact will be significant. Compulsory zero-rating for land 50. The compulsory zero-rating rules for land were introduced to reduce the risk of phoenix fraud, whereby the purchaser of the land would claim a GST deduction but the vender did not return the GST paid on the sale price. 51. There are several technical and remedial issues with these rules in relation to where the GST resides if the GST registration status of the vendor or purchaser changes during or after the sale process, and circumstances where a GST adjustment is required if the GST deducted was incorrect. Additional issues 52. The officials’ issues paper also includes a range of smaller issues, alongside the eight key issues outlined above. These smaller issues are summarised below, under the same headings and in the same order as in the draft officials’ issues paper. It is not anticipated that the remedial items below will have any material fiscal impact. GST grouping rules 53. It is proposed to clarify that the GST grouping rules apply before applying the other provisions of the GST Act, rather than applying the other provisions of the GST Act before applying the GST grouping rules. As well, it is proposed to allow the representative member of the group to issue invoices on behalf of all members of the group. Members of non-statutory boards 54. The scope of the GST exclusion for board members from having a GST taxable activity may be narrower than was intended. Inland Revenue’s current view is that the rule only applies to members of statutory bodies and consequently members of non-statutory bodies are treated differently despite the documented policy intent being broader to exclude board members generally. 55. It is proposed to widen the exclusion, so it clearly applies to members of non- statutory boards. Right to challenge Commissioner’s decision to reopen time-barred GST returns 56. The Act does not allow a person to challenge the Commissioner’s decision to reopen a time-barred GST return. For income tax purposes, a decision of the Commissioner to amend a return outside the time bar is a decision which could be subject to challenge. In Confidence IR2019/593: Cabinet paper – GST Policy Issues: an officials’ issues paper Page 10 of 11 IN CONFIDENCE 57. It is therefore proposed that a decision of the Commissioner to amend a GST return outside the time bar is also subject to challenge. This would ensure consistency across returns for income tax and GST. Input credits on goods not physically received yet at the time a GST return is filed 58. Under the GST rules, where goods are acquired by a GST registered person, an input tax deduction is allowed to the extent that they are used for, or available for use, in making GST taxable supplies. An issue has been raised whether the goods are “available for use” but the taxpayer has not physically acquired the goods by the time they have filed their GST return (i.e. they have received an invoice for purchase, but the goods are still in transit). 59. It is proposed that the GST Act be amended to clarify that the taxpayer can claim a GST deduction for goods that have been purchased and “are expected to be used for ” making taxable supplies. This remedial amendment would be retrospective to 1 April 2011 from when the original section was introduced. Second-hand goods credits on supplies between associated persons 60. In many situations, a supplier may have purchased an asset for which they were not charged any GST, potentially denying them the ability to claim a second-hand goods input credit. 61. Officials propose to amend the second-hand goods credit rules to allow a second- hand goods credit to be limited to the original cost to the supplier. This law would apply prospectively. Providing more flexibility for the Commissioner to approve the end date of a taxable period 62. It is proposed to remove the requirement that the end of a taxable period must be within seven days before or after the last day of the month, to allow for certain accounting periods (such as the 4-4-5 accounting period commonly used for shift or manufacturing planning). Consultation 63. The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this report and agrees with its recommendations. 64. The New Zealand Customs Service, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Financial Markets Authority have been consulted about the policy proposals in the officials’ issues paper. Timing of an officials’ issues paper 65. The officials’ issues paper which includes the policy issues referred to in this report is attached. A draft cabinet paper is also attached to this report. 66. If you agree to the inclusion of the policy items outlined above, the next step is to obtain Cabinet approval to release the officials’ issues paper for public consultation. For the paper to be considered by the Cabinet Economic Development Committee at its weekly meeting, it will need to be lodged with the Cabinet Office by the preceding Thursday by 10.00am. In Confidence IR2019/593: Cabinet paper – GST Policy Issues: an officials’ issues paper Page 11 of 11 IN CONFIDENCE 67. If Cabinet approval is obtained, you will have the delegated authority to prescribe the date for officials to release the officials’ issues paper for public consultation. Next steps 68. Officials recommend you refer a copy of this report to the Minister of Finance. 69. If Cabinet approval is obtained, advise when you would like officials to release the officials’ issues paper for public consultation. Officials propose to proactively release the cabinet paper, minutes and key advice papers when the officials’ issues paper is released. 70. Officials will report back to you on public submissions received. The feedback will help develop final policy proposals with a view of obtaining Cabinet approval in time for their inclusion in the next available tax bill. 1 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee GST Policy Issues: an officials’ issues paper Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s agreement to the release of an officials’ issues paper, GST Policy Issues, which is attached. The paper discusses a number of policy issues with the existing goods and services tax (GST) legislation and suggests potential solutions. 2.I seek Cabinet’s approval for the paper to be finalised and publicly released for consultation. Subject to Cabinet approval, I plan to direct officials as to when the officials’ issues paper should be released for consultation. I also intend to publish a press release announcing the release of the officials’ issues paper. Executive Summary 3.A number of GST-related issues, mainly technical in nature, have been raised regarding the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the Act). These reflect circumstances where the legislation does not produce outcomes that are consistent with the underlying policy, or where an update is required in response to changing technology, business practices, jurisprudence or other factors. These issues need to be addressed to maintain the certainty, efficiency and fairness of the tax system. 4.In recent months, my officials have met with key stakeholders such as private sector GST advisors to identify relevant GST policy issues, for inclusion into a GST issues paper. 5.This consultation has informed the attached officials’ issues paper GST Policy Issues, which seeks public submissions on these policy issues and suggested solutions. The key issues raised in the officials’ issues paper include: •Proposal to remove cryptocurrency from the GST and financial arrangements rules, to ensure these tax rules are not an unreasonable barrier to investing into or using cryptocurrencies; •Proposal changes to the rules apportioning GST input tax deductions for assets with a mix of taxable and non-taxable use, particularly the apportionment and adjustment rules applying to land; •Proposal to make it easier for domestic freight transport suppliers to zero-rate their services to non-resident freight transport suppliers; 2. 2 IN CONFIDENCE • Proposal to allow non-resident businesses to recover their GST costs where their employees are attending business conferences, conventions and staff training events while in New Zealand; • A review of the GST treatment of investment management services to managed funds; and • Potential policy options to provide clarity to both insurers and GST-registered recipients of an insurance pay-out, to ensure GST is returned on these amounts. 6. The paper also contains a variety of smaller policy issues. These are issues where the current legislation does not give effect to the underlying policy, or where technical changes are required to ensure that the legislation continues to operate efficiently. The suggested solutions to these issues are consistent with the general principles and policy of the GST system. 7. The estimated overall fiscal impact of the changes suggested in the paper are unknown. Where a particular policy proposal has been well developed, a preliminary range has been provided, dependent on the final policy design. Any final policy decisions are likely not to be effective until the 2022/23 fiscal year onwards. 8. Officials anticipate the fiscal cost for the non-residents attending New Zealand business conferences policy issue could be up to . This is based on historical conference spend survey data and is based on all spending being zero- rated – and does not account for goods and services that are unlikely to be zero-rated as part of final policy decisions (such as private expenditure or domestic airfares). Background 9. GST is a broad-base, low-rate consumption tax on goods and services which are supplied by registered persons (such as businesses) in New Zealand. Most goods and services are subject to GST and are taxed at a single rate of 15%. 10. Although the GST system generally works well, many of the specific provisions in the GST Act need to be regularly maintained or updated in response to changing technology, business practices, jurisprudence and other factors. Where the requirements fall behind current technology and practices, it can lead to undue compliance costs and inadvertent non-compliance. 11. A number of issues have been identified where the legislation produces an outcome that does not reflect the underlying policy intent. These issues need to be addressed to maintain the certainty, efficiency and fairness of the tax system. 12. The Government’s tax policy work programme, published in August 2019, noted that tax policy officials would be developing “a GST issues paper to consult on various changes to ensure GST aligns with business practices and modern technology and to maintain the GST Act more generally.” s 9(2)(f)(iv) 3 IN CONFIDENCE 13. In recent months, my officials have met with some key stakeholders such as private sector GST advisors to identify relevant GST policy issues, for inclusion into this GST issues consultation paper. 14. Six key GST policy issues have been identified: • The GST treatment of crypto-assets; • The complexity of the current GST appointment and adjustment rules and the potential for these rules to over-tax or under-tax compared to the actual mix of business and private / exempt use; • Make it easier for domestic freight transport suppliers to zero-rate their services to non-resident freight transport suppliers, where it involves the international transport of goods; • The difficulty of non-residents attending a business conference or undertaking formal staff training in New Zealand to be unable to practically recover their GST costs, compared to New Zealand registered businesses; • The GST treatment of certain fees and services in the managed funds industry; and • The GST treatment of insurance pay-outs. 15. These six issues, and the anticipated views of the affected stakeholders are explained below. 16. In addition to these, a number of smaller issues have also been identified. These issues are mainly technical and remedial issues where the GST legislation does not effectively reflect the underlying policy intent or has become out-of-date compared to modern commercial practices. The proposed solutions provide appropriate policy outcomes whilst minimising compliance costs. 17. Officials have drafted the attached officials’ issues paper, GST Policy Issues, that consults on these issues and potential policy solutions. Resolving these issues would help to ensure that GST continues to operate efficiently as a broad-based, low-rate tax on consumption in New Zealand. Comment Cryptocurrencies 18. Cryptocurrencies (also known as crypto-assets) are digital assets (commonly known as coins or tokens) that use cryptography and a decentralised network of computers to secure transactions and verify the transfer of the coins and tokens between individuals. There are over 3,000 crypto-assets, with an approximate total market value of all crypto-assets exceeding US$222b. 19. New Zealand has a fast-growing crypto-asset market which includes currency start- ups, crypto-asset investors and crypto-asset exchanges for buyers and sellers 4 IN CONFIDENCE (exchanging crypto-assets and traditional currencies - such as the US or NZ dollar). The market value for crypto-assets can be very volatile. 20. The definitions used for money or financial services as “exempt supplies” (meaning they are not subject to GST) did not contemplate crypto-assets, meaning GST may be imposed on certain types of crypto-assets, but not others – depending on their particular purpose and design. This inequitable GST treatment is unintentionally favouring certain types of crypto-assets over others and likely resulting in a distortion in the crypto-asset marketplace. 21. As well, the broad definition of “money” or “money’s worth" used in the financial arrangements rules mean certain crypto-assets will be subject to income tax on unrealised gains and losses - as opposed to a realisation basis (taxed when the crypto- assets are sold). 22. The officials’ issues paper proposes to remove crypto-assets from both the GST rules (by making the crypto-asset an exempt supply) and the financial arrangements rules (by making a crypto-asset an excepted financial arrangement). Other services related to crypto-assets such as computer services, exchange services and professional advice will continue to be subject to the existing GST rules. Crypto-assets will also continue to be subject to income tax when they are sold under the ordinary income tax rules. 23. Given crypto-assets are often discussed in the media, there is likely to be public and media interest in the proposals raised in this chapter. This has been the case for previous guidance material Inland Revenue has published relating to crypto-assets. It is anticipated that most stakeholders will welcome the proposals, although some will consider that the proposals are too limited and wider reforms to the tax or regulatory treatment of crypto-assets are needed. Apportionment and adjustment 24. The apportionment and adjustment rules apply when a GST registered person uses or intends to use goods and services for both taxable and non-taxable purposes. The rules determine the proportion of GST incurred in purchasing an asset that can be claimed back as an input tax deduction. For example, a contractor that purchases a car to be used equally for both their contracting business and private travel will only be able to claim an input tax deduction for 50% of the GST they paid on acquisition of the car. 25. The apportionment and adjustment rules can be complex and difficult to apply. Furthermore, some of the rules can result in registered persons being either overtaxed or undertaxed compared to the actual mix of business and private / exempt use. This can be a particular problem for land due to the high and appreciating value of land. 26. The officials’ issues paper proposes a number of specific changes to ensure the rules do not result in over or under taxation, as well as reduce compliance costs. The officials’ issues paper also seeks submitters views on ways in which the rules could be simplified more generally. 5 IN CONFIDENCE 27. Stakeholders will likely appreciate simplifying these rules, as well as the opportunity to provide further simplification changes. Domestic legs of the international transport of goods 28. The GST Act zero-rates (GST is charged at zero percent) the service of transporting goods into or out of New Zealand. This is because exported goods are zero-rated, and the value of transport services is already included in the cost of imported goods which is subject to 15% GST. 29. The current rules only apply where the whole transport service is supplied by one transport provider (usually the international freight transport service supplier). Where a NZ-based courier is subcontracted by an international courier to supply the domestic transport portion of the freight delivery service, they must charge GST on this supply at 15%. This strict interpretation of the GST rules can lead to unrecoverable GST becoming imbedded in the price of international transport service as the international courier is often not registered for New Zealand GST. 30. It is understood that this zero-rating rule is not well understood. This has resulted in some goods transporters erroneously zero-rating domestic transport services they supply as part of the international transport of goods. 31. Officials propose to allow domestic transport services supplied to a non-resident transport supplier (as part of the international transport of goods) to be zero-rated. This aligns with a common commercial practice and existing rules for postal letters mailed to New Zealand. Similar rules have already been adopted in Australia and Singapore. 32. It is expected that stakeholders will be supportive of this change, as it will provide certainty and fairness to the current rules, as well as recognising that the law needs to catch up with commercial practice. Business conferences and staff training 33. Business conference and staff training services held in New Zealand is subject to 15% GST with both non-residents and New Zealand businesses claiming back the GST paid on the cost of attending these events. In 2018, it was estimated that international conference and convention attendees spent a total of $163 million, with an average delegate spend of $2,162 in New Zealand. New Zealand’s conference and convention industry is expected to grow over time. 34. To recover the GST paid on attending these events, non-residents businesses must be registered for New Zealand GST. For many of these businesses, the cost of GST registration and filing a GST return (to claim back the GST paid), can exceed the GST recovered. This issue is likely to arise where the non-resident is coming to New Zealand for a one-off conference or convention event. 35. The officials’ issues paper proposes to zero-rate GST on conference, convention and staff training events that are provided to non-resident businesses. This is consistent with GST being a tax on private consumption rather than business expenses and the fact that GST-registered New Zealand businesses can already recover these GST costs. 6 IN CONFIDENCE 36. Importantly, this change would not apply to education and training services provided to students in a personal capacity or “incentive tours” used to reward employees with tourism experiences – these activities will remain subject to 15% GST. 37. Officials anticipate the fiscal cost is unlikely to be more than . This is based on historical conference spend survey data and is based on all spending included in the survey becoming zero-rated. The expected fiscal impact is likely to be significantly less – because the final policy design is likely to exclude spending counted by the survey including goods purchased in New Zealand as well as other forms of private expenditure of conference attendees, and domestic airfares (both which are unlikely to be zero-rated). As well, the survey results include non-resident spending that is already recovered by GST registered non-residents. 38. Conference industry representatives have advised officials that the current rules place them at a disadvantage in attracting international conferences and conventions to New Zealand, compared to other destinations such as Australia and Singapore (that do not impose GST on these events). E nsuring that GST charged is practicably recoverable by overseas businesses will likely make New Zealand international conference and convention facilities more attractive to international conference and convention organisers. 39. Managed funds 40. The GST definition of “financial services” is broadly unchanged since the introduction of GST in 1986, with financial services provided to GST non-registered taxpayers being exempt from GST. This recognises that it is often difficult to accurately determine the cost or the service fee of a financial service where this has also been bundled with a return on savings or investment income (which is essentially money and not a good or service). The GST exemption is used to partly tax financial services because the taxpayer cannot claim GST input credits on any business costs such as office space, computer systems or outsourced services that they need to purchase to enable them to produce the financial services. 41. Because fund managers may be providing both financial services (such as arranging fin ancial products) and other services (such as investment advice) as a single product, the differing GST treatment can result in inconsistency, complexity and compliance costs. Some fund managers currently apply GST to all their fees, while others consider they supply a mix of taxable and exempt supplies. The complexity in GST treatment is also creating competitive distortions as some funds may prefer fund managers that do not charge GST on their fees. 42. The officials’ issues paper proposes to amend the GST definition of financial services to provide more certainty and consistency for manager and investment manager services that are supplied to managed funds. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(g)(i) 7 IN CONFIDENCE 43. Three potential options are discussed including: • broadening the current GST exemption for retirement scheme managers to all fund management services; • narrowing the GST exemption and making these fees fully subject to GST ( and consequently allow the fund managers to claim more of their GST input costs); or • deeming a percentage of the relevant services to be exempt (and the remaining services subject to GST). 44. These options involve trade-offs between different policy objectives including ensuring 15% GST applies to a broad range of services and ensuring GST does not unduly distort competition or increase managed fund fees overall. 45. Insurance pay-outs to third parties 46. The GST Act has special rules for applying GST to general (non-life) insurance. If the taxpayer is GST registered and they are insuring their taxable activity (i.e. their business) then they can claim GST deductions on insurance premiums paid and, correspondingly, GST output tax is imposed on any insurance pay-outs by insurance companies. Importantly, GST does not generally apply to compensation payments such as out-of-court settlements. 47. In some situations, an insured person may cause damage or loss to a third party and then arrange for their insurer to provide an insurance payout to the third party. In such cases a GST registered third party may be unaware of whether the source of the funds are from a compensation payment (not subject to GST) or insurance (subject to 15% GST). 48. In some situations, the insurer may have a commercial incentive to not disclose the GST treatment of the insurance pay-out. This can lead to adverse outcomes where the third party is required to pay GST on an insurance settlement, but the payment has not been grossed up to account for GST (so the third party is undercompensated), or the GST amount has not been returned to Inland Revenue. 49. Officials have received mixed reports about the scale of this problem. The insurers officials have spoken to do not consider this problem to be endemic within the industry, but Inland Revenue’s investigators and several legal and GST advisors have raised concerns about cases of GST non-compliance involving this issue. 50. As well as seeking stakeholder views as to whether this is a significant problem, the officials’ issues paper also discusses three potential options for mitigating this issue, with all three options seeking to provide more certainty to insured claimants and third parties when negotiating insurance settlements. s 9(2)(g)(i) 8 IN CONFIDENCE 51. The most effective policy option is to make the insurer responsible for any GST obligations, on behalf of the claimant. This will require insurers to be aware of the GST registration and business activities of the claimant and any associated third parties (including the GST apportionment rules - such as a home office). 52. Another policy option is for the insurer to disclose to the third party that part or all of the insurance payment is subject to GST and the claimant or third party may be required to return GST on the settlement amount. The third option is to provide education and guidance for advisors and taxpayers to be mindful of any GST implications when negotiating and finalising an insurance pay-out. 53. Insurance providers will likely strongly oppose option one (making the insurer responsible for GST) and, to a lesser extent, option two (requiring the insurer to disclose information) as these options will impose compliance and IT systems costs on insurers (however it will reduce compliance costs on the claimants and associated third parties). Insurers’ will likely prefer option three (education and guidance) because it does not have any significant compliance or systems costs for them. Some large insurers and their advisors have been notified about the proposed consultation options. Other issues 54. A number of other technical and remedial issues with the current legislation have been identified. The suggested solutions align with the existing GST policy intent and do not have a forecast fiscal impact and are likely to be supported by submitters. 55. An example of these technical changes is the proposal to allow a wider range of ordinary business-to-business information to be used to support a business’s GST tax invoice requirements. Allowing businesses to use more of its existing electronically held information to support their GST tax invoice requirements will reduce businesses compliance costs over time. Consultation 56. The attached officials’ issues paper has been prepared by Inland Revenue. 57. The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this paper and supports the proposals. 58. The New Zealand Customs Service, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Financial Markets Authority have been consulted about the policy proposals in this cabinet paper and attached officials’ issues paper. Financial Implications 59. There are no financial implications associated with releasing the GST Policy Issues officials’ issues paper. However, if following public consultation certain policy options are progressed, then their introduction may have an impact on forecast crown revenue. Any final policy decisions are likely not to be effective until the 2022/23 fiscal year onwards. 9 IN CONFIDENCE 60. In particular, it is anticipated that the proposal to allow non-resident businesses to recover their GST paid for attending NZ conferences and conventions events may have a negative fiscal impact of up to Legislative Implications 61. The decision to consult on the GST policy proposals does not give rise to any immediate legislative implications. If, following consultation, Cabinet decides to implement the changes suggested in the officials’ issues paper, enabling legislation will be required. The relevant Taxation Bill is likely to be introduced after the election in either late 2020 or early 2021. Impact Analysis 62. The officials’ issues paper substitutes for a Regulatory Impact Assessment. Inland Revenue’s Quality Assurance panel has reviewed the issues paper and confirms that it is likely to lead to effective consultation and support the delivery of Regulatory Impact Analysis to support subsequent decisions. Human Rights 63. The issues contained in the draft issues paper and their proposed solutions do not give rise to any human rights implications. Gender Implications 64. There are no gender implications arising from these proposals. Disability Perspective 65. No disability issues arise from these proposals. Publicity 66. The Minister of Revenue proposes to issue a media release when officials make the issues paper available for public consultation. Proactive Release 67. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet Economic Development Committee: 1. Note that a number of issues with the current GST legislation have been identified; 2. Note that the attached draft officials’ issues paper, in essence, suggests that: 2.1 Some of the rules for apportioning GST input deductions (especially for land) need to be amended to reduce over-taxation or under-taxation compared to the actual mix of business and private / exempt use or to be easier to apply. s 9(2)(f)(iv) 10 IN CONFIDENCE 2.2 Crypto-assets should not be subject to the GST or financial arrangements rules but will still be taxed under other ordinary tax rules. 2.3 New Zealand freight delivery suppliers should be able to zero-rate their delivery services to non-resident freight transport suppliers, where that service relates to transporting goods to and from New Zealand. 2.4 Non-resident businesses should be able to more easily recover their GST costs when attending conferences, conventions and staff training events in New Zealand (GST-registered New Zealand businesses can already recover these GST costs). 2.5 The GST rules relating to manager and investment management services to managed funds need to be reformed, but due to inconsistent practices within the industry, some managers will face compliance costs from changing how they apply GST. 2.6 There are fiscal and fairness concerns about non-compliance with the rules that require GST to returned on insurance pay-outs, and there are several options to address this issue, some of which impose costs on insurers. 2.7 Other amendments should be made that would ensure that continued effective operation of the Goods and Services Act, particularly in cases where the legal requirements need to be amended to align with the policy intent or to better accommodate modern technology and commercial practices. 3. Agree that, subject to minor editorial changes, the attached officials’ issues paper GST Policy Issues, be approved to be released on Inland Revenue’s website for public consultation. 4. Authorise the Minister of Revenue to approve minor changes to the officials’ issues paper prior to its release; 5. Authorise the Minister of Revenue to prescribe the date for when the officials’ issues paper will be released; 6. Note that the Minister of Revenue will issue a media release at the time that the GST Policy Issues officials’ issues paper is published; Authorised for lodgement Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue I N C O N F I D E N C E DEV-20-MIN-0005 Cabinet Economic Development Committee Minute of Decision This document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.

In Confidence IR2020/035: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue Page 1 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE 12 February 2020 Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue Mycoplasma bovis tax issue Executive summary 1. Some farmers have significant unexpected taxable income through their herds being culled following a primary sector/government decision to eradicate Mycoplasma bovis in New Zealand. Although this income should in effect be reversed over the next five to seven years, there are potential cash flow and interest costs for the farmers in the meantime, inhibiting their ability to restock. 2. This tax outcome undermines a core principle of the Biosecurity Act 1993 that no person should be any better or worse off because of the Crown’s use of its powers under that Act. Accordingly, Federated Farmers have requested an amendment to ensure there are no income tax implications from culling and replacing dairy and beef cattle impacted by Mycoplasma bovis. They cite the special treatment given to depreciation recovery income on buildings damaged by the Christchurch and the Hurunui-Kaikōura earthquakes as a precedent. 3. The issue arises for farmers who have used the national standard cost scheme (NSC) to value their breeding stock on hand for tax purposes (the income equalisation scheme is adequate for other situations). Of the around 200 properties that have had herds culled to date, probably up to 50 will have sizeable upfront taxable income. These are likely to be predominantly dairy operations but some beef breeding operations have also been affected. Further culls are expected. 4. A quick solution to this issue is needed as tax returns for the 2018/19 income year are due soon (by 31 March this year) with payment due shortly thereafter. 5. Officials have been discussing this issue with Federated Farmers and Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ). We all agree that the best immediate solution is to allow the additional income to be spread over the subsequent six income years. This would require amending the Income Tax Act. We recommend that the amendment apply retrospectively, from the 2017-18 income year, as the first culls began in late 2017. Standard tax rules would continue to apply to the farmers’ other income. 6. This solution has minimal fiscal and administrative impact. There is a minor change in the timing of tax payments so that there is an estimated upfront fiscal cost of $1.5 million with a balancing fiscal gain over the following five or so years. We recommend that this cost and subsequent gains be booked against the tax policy scorecard. Any administrative impact can be absorbed by Inland Revenue within its baseline. 7. If you agree in principle to this solution, officials will continue to work with Federated Farmers and CA ANZ on the detail and will prepare a draft Cabinet paper for your consideration. The aim is for that paper to be considered by the Economic Development Committee at its meeting on 18 March 2020. Any legislative change could then be made through a supplementary order paper to the omnibus tax bill planned for introduction in April.

Federated Farmers have requested an amendment to tax legislation to ensure there are no income tax implications from culling and replacing dairy and beef cattle impacted by the Mycoplasma bovis response. They argue that the disease is an unexpected event and reasonably draw parallels with the special treatment given to depreciation recovery income on buildings damaged by the Christchurch and the Hurunui-Kaikōura earthquakes. They consider that a quick response is required because there are affected farmers with sizeable increases in income in the 2018/19 income year, the returns for which need to be filed by 31 March 2020 and the tax paid in early April 2020. 10. The request was sent to the Minister of Revenue and copied to the Minister of Agriculture on 18 December 2019. 11. The Biosecurity Act 1993 provides the Government with powers for the purpose of eradicating or managing an organism. The Government, in partnership with the dairy and beef sectors has decided to try to eradicate the organism Mycoplasma bovis from New Zealand. As a result, Biosecurity New Zealand can require all the stock on a farm where Mycoplasma bovis has been found to be culled 1 . In exchange, the Government pays compensation at market rates to the affected farmers, designed to leave farmers in no better or worse position than a person whose property is not directly affected by the exercise of the powers. This compensation does not have to be used to purchase replacement stock, but the expectation is that farmers will use it for that purpose. 12. To date, around 200 properties have been cleared of stock with a similar number under surveillance. These have been predominantly dairy farms although Mycoplasma bovis is increasingly being found on beef farms that acquired young stock from affected dairy farms before the disease was identified. Of the total 90,000 stock culled and compensated for by the end of January, 52,000 were dairy cattle and 38,000 were beef cattle, with the bulk of the beef cattle being from fattening operations rather than breeding operations. Income tax implications 13. For income tax purposes livestock is trading stock and, like all traditional trading stock, must be valued annually to establish its opening and closing values as part of determining the cost of sales. An increase in the value of livestock can be taxable income. A farmer has the choice of several valuation options, but the main ones used are national standard cost (NSC) and the herd scheme. 14. The NSC scheme values the animals at, if the animal is homebred, a standard cost for the respective age and type of animal that reflects average home breeding costs, or at its purchase cost if the stock is purchased. 15. Under the herd scheme stock is valued annually using published national average market values, with tax being paid on entry into the scheme based on the difference between the market value and the stock’s cost. Unlike other trading stock valuation options, under the herd scheme subsequent changes in value generally have no tax implications. Dairy farmers predominantly use the herd scheme whereas beef farmers predominantly use NSC, although many farmers also use both schemes. 16. If the culled animals were valued under the NSC scheme, the difference between the cost of the animals and the market value is income even when the farmer immediately restocks their farm with equivalent stock. The stock value is, if it includes breeding cows, written down over the next five or so years as the stock ages 1 There have also been instances where only part of the herd has been culled because it was isolated from the rest of the herd. In Confidence IR2020/035: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue Page 4 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE and is itself gradually replaced from homebred animals. There are potential cash flow and interest costs for the farmer in the meantime. 17. For fattening stock valued under the NSC scheme, the tax issue is less acute as the livestock turn-over much more regularly, and in that case the income equalisation deposit scheme should provide sufficient flexibility to manage any tax issues. In contrast, the income equalisation scheme will not provide sufficient flexibility to deal with the tax issues created by the culling of breeding cows that are valued under the NSC scheme. 18. Overall, possibly up to 50 farmers could have unexpected tax liabilities because they value their dairy and/or beef breeding animals under the NSC scheme. The impact is most severe for those with a high proportion of mixed-age cows as, under normal circumstances, they would be relying on holding those animals for several years and on using them to breed replacement stock. Sharemilkers would be particularly hit as their main asset is livestock. Officials’ recommendations Spreading the additional income 19. Although it could be argued that Mycoplasma bovis is a business risk, we are mindful that the decision to eradicate the organism from New Zealand, and the resulting culling of herds is a government administrative decision. Its impact on individual farms is far more significant than say a destocking as a result of a drought or flood. 20. At the same time the tax outcome needs to be fair relative to farmers who have used other valuation methods, and to those farmers affected by Mycoplasma bovis who have already filed their tax returns for earlier years in which compensation has been provided. Compensation has been paid out since 2017. 21. We have discussed this issue with both Federated Farmers and Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ). We all agree that the policy issue should be addressed, and that the best immediate solution is to allow the additional income to be evenly spread over subsequent income years. Depending on the assumed herd profile, that spread could be between five and seven years. Therefore, for simplicity, we recommend a six-year spread. The income would then be offset each year by the increased deductions arising from the reducing cost of the stock on hand. 22. Certain requirements would need to be met for the income to be spread: • The farm would need to be subject to Biosecurity Security New Zealand requiring a cull of Mycoplasma bovis affected stock. • Stock would need to be substantially replaced with equivalent stock within a reasonable timeframe. • The farm would need to be a dairy operation or a beef breeding operation, with the female breeding stock valued under NSC. • Only the income derived from the culling of the stock valued under NSC or the self-assessed cost scheme 2 could be spread. 2 The self-assessed cost scheme is another cost-based valuation option. Very few farmers use the scheme because of its complexity, so it may be that none of the affected farmers are using it, but if they have there would be a tax liability as a result of the animal cull. In Confidence IR2020/035: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue Page 5 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE • The replacement stock must continue to be valued using, as relevant, NSC or self-assess cost. (This is to ensure that farmers cannot enter the herd scheme on more advantageous terms than those not affected by Mycoplasma bovis). 23. An amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 will be required to provide this spread. It cannot be handled administratively. 24. This recommended solution has parallels with the special treatment given to depreciation recovery income on buildings damaged by the Christchurch and the Hurunui-Kaikōura earthquakes. In those cases the recovery income was suspended until a replacement property was purchased. Tax returns for 2018/19 income year 25. It is possible that this amendment can be included in the tax bill planned for introduction in April, at the Select Committee stage, which would enable a quick response for those farmers immediately affected by having additional income in the 2018/19 income year. Inland Revenue will then be able to apply discretion in relation to the timing of tax payments. The farmers will still be required to file their tax return and to pay tax at the standard times on income that has not been derived from the culled animals. Already filed returns 26. Although the bulk of the impact to date will be in relation to 2018/19 income tax, we are also recommending that the amendment be backdated to include the effects in the 2017/18 income year as the culls began in late 2017. We are suggesting that those who have already filed have the option of having their returns reassessed or leaving them as is as there may be some impact on farmers social assistance entitlements and liabilities if the additional income is now spread. Implications for farmers using the herd scheme 27. The additional income from culling the Mycoplasma bovis affected animals is far less of an issue for those using the herd scheme. In their case, as with fattening stock valued under the NSC scheme, the existing income equalisation scheme can be used to neutralise any income that does arise. For example, when the additional income arises in one income year and the stock is replaced in the following income year, the income can be deposited into the income equalisation scheme in the meantime to defer the tax liability to the next year when the deductions for the replacement stock can offset the income. This is a standard and expected use of the income equalisation scheme. Longer term solutions 28. It may be possible longer-term to have a more generic process/provision for handling severe adverse events and future biosecurity incursions affecting livestock. To date the responses have been specific to the events. However, given the timeframe for addressing the current issue, a specific solution is recommended. Consultation 29. As well as CA ANZ and Federated Farmers, we have consulted the Ministry for Primary Industries on this issue. 30. Officials, CA ANZ and Federated Farmers have established a working team to work through the detail of the spreading option. In Confidence IR2020/035: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue Page 6 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE Financial implications 31. The expected fiscal cost is confined to situations where returns have been filed, tax has been assessed and the tax liability would now be spread. This is essentially 2017/18 income tax returns and some 2018/19 income tax returns. Officials estimate the upfront fiscal cost to be $1.5 million as there were relatively few culls and compensation pay-outs in the 2017/18 income year and many income tax returns for the 2018/19 income year will not be filed until closer to the 31 March 2020 deadline. There will be offsetting fiscal gains over the subsequent five or so income years as the higher stock values are gradually written down. This produces the following out-turn over the forecast period, with the final year of impact being in 2025/26: $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 & outyears Tax Revenue (1.500) 0.300 0.300 0.300 Total Operating (1.500) 0.300 0.300 0.300 32. We recommend that this estimated cost and subsequent gains be accounted for on the tax policy work programme scorecard. The current scorecard balance to the end of the 2023/24 fiscal year is $53.036 million. The implementation of this policy would reduce the cumulative scorecard balance to $52.436 million. 33. Given the relatively limited number of cases involved, the costs associated with administering the spread should be minimal. The costs will be absorbed within Departmental baselines. Farmers intending to spread the additional income will be required to advise Inland Revenue when filing their returns so that their files can be manually adjusted. The aim will be to keep the additional compliance costs to a minimum. Next steps 34. If you agree that there should be a law change, a draft Cabinet paper and Regulatory Impact Statement will be prepared for your consideration in early March so that the final Cabinet paper can be considered by Cabinet’s Economic Development Committee at its meeting on 18 March, before the Budget moratorium. 35. If agreed by Cabinet, we recommend including the legislative change in a supplementary order paper to the tax bill planned for introduction in April. At the same time, we recommend that the Minister of Revenue issue a press release advising of Cabinet’s decision and the process for the affected 2018/19 income tax returns due by 31 March 2020. This will help to provide farmers and their tax advisers with some certainty. 36. That release should also indicate that deposits into the income equalisation scheme for income arising from the Mycoplasma bovis response can be withdrawn early. That statement will enable Inland Revenue to simplify withdrawals by treating them as a “class of case”. 37. We recommend you refer a copy of this report to the Minister of Agriculture for his information.

As a result, Biosecurity New Zealand can require all the stock on a farm where Mycoplasma bovis has been found to be culled 1 .

A farmer has the choice of several valuation options, but the main ones used are national standard cost (NSC) and the herd scheme. A few farmers also use self-assessed cost. 15. The NSC scheme values the animals at, if the animal is homebred, a standard cost (determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue) for the respective age and type of animal that reflects average home breeding costs, or at its purchase cost if the stock is purchased. 16. Under the herd scheme stock is valued annually using published national average market values, with tax being paid on entry into the scheme based on the difference between the market value and the stock’s cost. Unlike other trading stock valuation options, under the herd scheme subsequent changes in value generally have no tax implications. Dairy farmers predominantly use the herd scheme whereas beef farmers predominantly use NSC, although many farmers also use both schemes. 17. If the culled animals were valued under the NSC scheme, the difference between the cost of the animals and the market value is income even when the farmer immediately restocks their farm with equivalent stock. The stock value is, if it includes breeding cows, written down over the next five or so years as the stock ages and is itself gradually replaced from homebred animals. However, there are potential cash flow problems and interest costs for the farmer in the meantime. Simplified example Cow A with a market value of $1,500 is culled because of Mycoplasma bovis. The farmer receives $1,500 for the cow from a combination of compensation and slaughter receipts. For tax purposes, as cow A was valued under the NSC scheme at $700, there is taxable income of $800 from its cull. The $1,500 is used to buy replacement cow B. Under NSC, cow B is valued at its purchase price of $1,500. Cow B remains in the herd for five years before being slaughtered and is replaced by a cow bred up through the herd (cow C) which has a NSC of $700 (its homebred cost). There is a tax deduction of $800 at that point, being the difference between the cost of cow B and the cost of cow C. If there had been no Mycoplasma bovis cull, cow A would have remained in the herd and been replaced by the equivalent of cow C with no NSC implications given that both cow A and cow C have a NSC value of $700. 18. For fattening stock valued under the NSC scheme, the tax issue is less acute as the livestock turn-over much more regularly, and in that case the income equalisation deposit scheme should provide sufficient flexibility to manage any tax issues. That scheme enables the recognition of income to be deferred by up to five years if the 3 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:50 IN CONFIDENCE income is deposited into the scheme. In contrast, the income equalisation scheme will not provide sufficient flexibility to deal with the tax issues created by the culling of breeding cows that are valued under the NSC scheme because the deposit would need to be withdrawn to pay for the replacement stock, at which point the income is recognised. 19. Overall, possibly up to 50 farmers could have unexpected tax liabilities because they value their dairy and/or beef breeding animals under the NSC scheme. The impact is most severe for those with a high proportion of mixed-age cows as, under normal circumstances, they would be relying on holding those animals for several years and on using them to breed replacement stock. Sharemilkers would be particularly hit as their main asset is livestock. 20. The self-assessed cost scheme is another cost-based valuation option.

Very few farmers use the scheme because of its complexity, so it may be that none of the farmers affected by Mycoplasma bovis are using it, but if they have there would be a tax liability as a result of the animal cull, so the same tax issues would arise as with NSC.

It is possible that this amendment can be included in the tax bill planned for introduction in April, at the Select Committee stage, which would enable a quick response for those farmers immediately affected by having additional income in the 2018-19 income year. The farmers will still be required to file their tax returns, and to pay tax at the standard times on income that has not been derived from the culled animals. Already filed returns 28. Although the bulk of the impact to date will be in relation to 2018-19 income tax, I am also recommending that the amendment be backdated to include the effects in the 2017-18 income year as the culls began in late 2017. We are suggesting that those who have already filed have the option of having their returns reassessed or leaving them as is as there may be some impact on farmers social assistance entitlements and liabilities if the additional income is now spread. For this to be effective, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will have to be allowed to make associated adjustments to the farmers’ tax positions. Implications for farmers using the herd scheme 29. The additional income from culling the Mycoplasma bovis affected animals is far less of an issue for those using the herd scheme. In their case, as with fattening stock valued under the NSC scheme, the existing income equalisation scheme can be used to neutralise any income that does arise. For example, when the additional income arises in one income year and the stock is replaced in the following income year, the income can be deposited into the income equalisation scheme in the meantime to defer the tax liability to the next year when the deductions for the replacement stock can offset the income. This is a standard and expected use of the income equalisation scheme. 5 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:50 IN CONFIDENCE Consultation 30. Tax officials consulted with CA ANZ and Federated Farmers and a joint team has been established to work through the detail of the spreading option. Treasury was also consulted. 31. The Ministry for Primary Industries was also consulted on the issue, particularly to obtain data on the type of dairy and beef cattle culled as part of the Mycoplasma bovis response culls, their market values and compensation paid. Financial Implications 32. The expected fiscal cost is confined to situations where returns have been filed, tax has been assessed and the tax liability would now be spread. This is essentially 2017/18 income tax returns and some 2018/19 income tax returns. Officials estimate the upfront fiscal cost to be $1.5 million as there were relatively few culls and compensation pay-outs in the 2017/18 income year. There will be offsetting fiscal gains over the subsequent five or so income years as the higher stock values are gradually written down. This produces the following out-turn over the forecast period, with the final year of impact being in 2025/26: $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 & Outyears Tax Revenue: -(1.500) 0.300 0.300 0.300 Total Operating -(1.500) 0.300 0.300 0.300 33. We recommend that this estimated cost and subsequent gains be accounted for on the tax policy work programme scorecard. 34. Given the relatively limited number of cases involved, the costs associated with administering the spread should be minimal. The costs will be absorbed within Departmental baselines. Farmers intending to spread the additional income will be required to advise Inland Revenue when filing their returns. For those that have already filed, Inland Revenue will need to do a retrospective manual adjustment. The aim will be to keep the additional compliance costs to a minimum. Legislative Implications 35. Implementing these proposals requires changes to the Income Tax Act 2007. 36. If approved, I propose including the legislative changes resulting from these recommendations in a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) to the omnibus taxation Bill scheduled to be introduced in April 2020. The SOP would be released at the Finance and Expenditure Committee stage in time for submissions to be made on the proposed amendments. 6 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:50 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 37. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Mycoplasma bovis tax issue RIA and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it meets the quality criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 38. The Ministry for the Environment has been consulted and confirm that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Human Rights 39. There are no human rights implications. Gender Implications 40. There are no gender implications. Publicity 41. If Cabinet agrees to the amendment, I will make an announcement advising of Cabinet’s decision and the process for the affected 2018-19 income tax returns due by 31 March 2020. This will help to provide farmers and their tax advisers with some certainty. 42. That release can also note any statement from Inland Revenue regarding the Commissioner’s acceptance of early withdrawals of deposits from the income equalisation scheme for income arising from the Mycoplasma bovis response, including whether withdrawals will be treated as a “class of case”, which will reduce farmers’ compliance costs. Proactive Release 43. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers with appropriate redactions within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1. agree that income arising from the culling of breeding livestock as a result of Mycoplasma bovis be able to be spread evenly over the subsequent six income years provided the stock is replaced after the cull with substantially equivalent stock and the farming operation has been valuing (and continues to value) its female breeding stock under the national standard cost scheme or self-assessed cost. 2. agree that the amendment in recommendation (1) apply retrospectively from the 2017/18 income year. 7 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:50 IN CONFIDENCE 3. note that agreeing to recommendation (1) and (2) will have the following impact on tax revenue, with the final year of impact being 2025/26. $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 & Outyears Tax Revenue: -(1.500) 0.300 0.300 0.300 Total Operating -(1.500) 0.300 0.300 0.300 4. agree that the estimated fiscal impact identified in recommendation (3) be accounted for on the tax policy work programme scorecard. 5. authorise the Minister of Revenue to make decisions on the detail of the spreading amendment. 6. note that if recommendations (1) and (2) are agreed, the Minister of Revenue proposes including the necessary legislative changes in a Supplementary Order Paper to the omnibus taxation Bill scheduled to be introduced in April 2020, with that SOP being released at the Finance and Expenditure Committee stage in time for submissions to be made on the proposed amendments. 7. invite the Minister of Revenue to issue a press release on Cabinet’s decisions.

This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing key policy decisions to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Range of options considered A more long-term generic process or provision for handling severe adverse events and future biosecurity incursions affecting livestock has not been considered. Given the timeframe for addressing the current Mycoplasma bovis issue (taxpayers that are clients of tax agents with a valid extension of time are due to file tax returns for the 2018/19 income tax year by 31 March 2020) a specific solution is required as it would not be possible to fully consider a longer-term solution. Consultation Consultation has been focussed on discussing the issue and potential solutions with Federated Farmers and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ). Given the timeframe for addressing this issue other groups have not been consulted at this stage. Officials will consider whether other groups should also be consulted as we work through the detailed design of the proposal before legislation is introduced and at the select committee stage.

Overview Some farmers that have had their livestock culled owing to the Government’s attempts to eradicate Mycoplasma bovis from New Zealand have faced an unexpected and significant tax liability as a result. This tax liability may impede their ability to replace their culled herd and is contrary to a key principle of the Biosecurity Act 1993 that no person is made better or worse off owing to the Crown’s use of its powers under that Act. Background Mycoplasma bovis is a bacterium that can cause a range of serious conditions in cattle. The disease may be dormant in an animal – causing no symptoms at all. But in times of stress (for example, calving, drying-off, transporting, or being exposed to extreme weather), the animal may shed bacteria in milk and nasal secretions. As a result, other animals may be infected and become ill or carriers themselves. The presence of Mycoplasma bovis in New Zealand was first detected in 2017. The Government, in partnership with the dairy and beef sectors, has decided to try to eradicate Mycoplasma bovis from New Zealand. As a result, Biosecurity New Zealand can require all the stock on a farm where Mycoplasma bovis has been found to be culled. In exchange, the Government pays compensation to the affected farmers for the difference between the normal market value of the stock and the amount received when the stock is slaughtered. This compensation is intended to leave farmers in no better or worse position than a person whose property is not directly affected by the exercise of the powers. To date, around 200 properties have been cleared of stock with a similar number being monitored for the presence of Mycoplasma bovis. These have been predominantly dairy farms although Mycoplasma bovis is increasingly being found on beef farms that acquired young stock from affected dairy farms before the disease was identified. Of the total 90,000 stock culled and compensated for by the end of January 2020, 52,000 were dairy cattle and 38,000 were beef cattle, with the bulk of the beef cattle being from fattening operations rather than breeding operations. 1 For income tax purposes livestock must be valued annually to establish its opening and closing values as part of determining the cost of sales. A farmer has the choice of several valuation options. Many use the national standard cost (NSC) scheme which values the animals at: • a standard cost (determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue), if the animal is homebred, for the respective age and type of animal that reflects average home breeding costs; or • at its purchase cost if the animal is purchased. 1 Fattening operations involve the growing of animals for meat. Such operations have much quicker turnover of stock than breeding operations as the stock will be slaughtered within 1-2 years. Conversely, breeding operations involve the rearing of animals for the ultimate replacement of existing herd animals and the sale of any excess. The quicker turnover of stock for fattening operations means the tax issue discussed in this impact summary is less significant for fattening operations. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 4 IN CONFIDENCE A few farmers also use the self-assessed cost scheme which involves farmers using their own farm costs rather than standard costs. Policy problem in detail When breeding livestock has been valued under either the NSC scheme or the self- assessed cost scheme, culling the herd can result in a significant and unexpected tax liability that can impede a farmer’s ability to restock their farm. This is because the compensation payments plus slaughter receipts are income, and there is no immediate comparable deduction in relation to the replacement stock to offset that income. The replacement stock value for NSC and self-assessed cost purposes is its purchase price and this stock value is only gradually written down (over the next five or so years) as the stock ages and is itself replaced from homebred animals. Although this is a tax timing issue, there are potential cash flow problems and interest costs for farmers in the meantime that can impede the recovery process. Simplified example Cow A with a market value of $1,500 is culled because of Mycoplasma bovis. The farmer receives $1,500 for the cow from a combination of compensation and slaughter receipts. For tax purposes, as cow A was valued under the NSC scheme at $700, there is taxable income of $800 from its cull. The $1,500 is used to buy replacement cow B. Under NSC, cow B is valued at its purchase price of $1,500. Cow B remains in the herd for five years before being slaughtered and is replaced by a cow bred up through the herd (cow C) which has a NSC of $700 (its homebred cost). There is a tax deduction of $800 at that point, being the difference between the cost of cow B and the cost of cow C. If there had been no Mycoplasma bovis cull, cow A would have remained in the herd and been replaced by the equivalent of cow C with no NSC implications given that both cow A and cow C have a NSC value of $700. As farmers will have a herd made up of different age cows that will be progressively slaughtered the single $800 deduction in this example will result in a deduction each year when considered on a whole of herd basis. For fattening stock valued under the NSC scheme or self-assessed cost scheme, the tax issue is less acute as the livestock turn-over much more regularly so that normal tax rules should apply. In that case, or when other valuation methods (such as the herd scheme) are used to value the herd, the income equalisation deposit scheme should provide sufficient flexibility to manage any tax issues. The income equalisation scheme enables the recognition of income to be deferred by up to five years if the income is deposited into the scheme. The income equalisation scheme will not provide sufficient flexibility to deal with the tax issues created by the culling of breeding animals that are valued under NSC or self-assessed cost because the deposit would need to be withdrawn to pay for replacement stock, at which point the income is recognised. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 5 IN CONFIDENCE 2.2 Who is affected and how? The affected parties are farmers that use the NSC scheme or the self-assessed cost scheme to value their breeding stock on hand for tax purposes and have had their herds culled and replaced because of Mycoplasma bovis. Overall, possibly up to 50 farmers to date could have unexpected tax liabilities because they value their dairy and/or beef breeding animals under the NSC or self-assessed cost schemes. The impact is most severe for those with a high proportion of mixed-age cows as, under normal circumstances, they would be relying on holding those animals for several years and on using them to breed replacement stock. Sharemilkers would be particularly affected as their main asset is livestock. Since very few farmers use the self-assessed cost scheme, because of its complexity, it may be that none of the farmers affected by Mycoplasma bovis are using it. However, if they have there would be a sizeable tax liability as a result of the cull. Federated Farmers wrote to the Minister of Revenue in December 2019 asking for this issue to be addressed. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ) also supports the proposals. 2.3 What are the objectives sought in relation to the identified problem? A core principle of the Biosecurity Act 1993 is that no person should be any better or worse off because of the Crown’s use of its powers under that Act. The objective of the proposal is to ensure that farmers are not made worse off because of a tax liability arising from the culling of Mycoplasma bovis infected livestock. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 6 IN CONFIDENCE Secti o n 3: O p ti on s id en ti fi cati o n 3.1 What options have been considered? The following criteria have been used to assess the options: • Equity – the option should result in farmers using the NSC or self-assessed cost scheme not being made worse off as a result of their herds being culled or better off than farmers who have used other valuation methods. • Timeliness – the option should be able to be enacted as soon as possible to provide certainty to farmers with culled and replaced herds • Compliance and administration costs – the option should be as simple as possible. Option 1: No law change (Status quo) The status quo would not be an equitable option as farmers using the NSC scheme would face a significant and unexpected tax liability owing to their herds being culled because of the presence of Mycoplasma bovis. This is contrary to the principle of the Biosecurity Act 1993 that no person should be made better or worse off owing to the Crown’s use of its powers under that act. Option 2: Spreading the additional income (preferred option) Under this option, the additional taxable income arising from culling and replacing a herd would be able to be spread evenly over subsequent income years. This would allow the income to be offset each year by the increased deductions arising from the reducing cost of the stock on hand. The ideal length of this spread for farmers would be between 5 and 7 years depending on the profile of their herds. Therefore, for simplicity the length of the spread would be 6 years, starting from the income year after the income originally arose. Certain requirements would need to be met for the income to be spread: • The business would need to be subject to Biosecurity Security New Zealand requiring a cull of Mycoplasma bovis affected stock. • Stock would need to be substantially replaced with equivalent stock within a reasonable timeframe, say twelve months. Farmers that choose not to replace their stock after a cull are in a similar position to a farmer that sells their stock to exit the industry. • The business would need to be a dairy or a beef breeding operation, with the breeding stock valued under the NSC or self-assessed cost schemes. • Only the income derived from the culling of the breeding stock valued under the NSC or the self-assessed cost schemes could be spread. Income derived from culling fattening stock would not be able to be spread as the tax issue is less acute owing to the more frequent turnover of stock. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 7 IN CONFIDENCE • The replacement stock must continue to be valued using, as relevant, NSC or self-assessed cost. This is to ensure that farmers cannot enter the herd scheme on more advantageous terms than those not affected by Mycoplasma bovis. Analysis of option This option increases equity as it would ensure affected farmers do not suffer from an unexpected tax burden and associated cash flow issues. This is consistent with the core principle of the Biosecurity Act 1993 that no person should be made better or worse off owing to the Crown’s use of its powers under that act. This option would also be a more timely solution to the problem as it could be announced by the Minister of Revenue prior to the 31 March 2020 due date for 2018/19 income tax returns for clients of tax agents with a valid extension of time. This will help to provide certainty to farmers and their tax advisers. This option is not expected to have a significant impact on compliance costs for affected farmers. Farmers intending to spread the additional income will be required to advise Inland Revenue when filing their returns so that their files can be manually adjusted. Given the relatively low number of affected farmers, the costs associated with administering this option for Inland Revenue should be minimal and could be absorbed within existing baselines. Option 3: Offset the taxable income against the cost of replacement stock This option would involve offsetting the taxable income against the cost of the replacement livestock, which would essentially write down the purchase price to what the NSC would have been had the incident not occurred. While this option would conceptually achieve the desired outcome, it would be complex to achieve in practice as it would require an exact matching of the culled stock with the replacement stock, and rules about adjustments where that did not arise. Therefore, this option was not preferred as the option of spreading the income evenly over a number of income years is simpler. Option 4: Amending the income equalisation scheme This option would involve enabling deposits made in relation to Mycoplasma bovis to be withdrawn from the income equalisation scheme without being treated as income. This option would compromise the integrity of the scheme and is, therefore, not preferred. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 8 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is spreading the additional income arising from culling and replacing a herd affected by Mycoplasma bovis. Spreading the income over the six subsequent income years offsets the income against the expected increased deductions, in effect leaving the farmer in a similar position to if no unexpected income had arisen. This is the proposed approach as it is the only option that can be implemented in a timely manner and is consistent with the principle of the Biosecurity Act 1993 that no one is made better or worse off owing to the Crown’s use of its powers under that Act. The proposed approach is compatible with the Government’s “Expectations for the design of regulatory systems”. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 9 IN CONFIDENCE Secti o n 4: I mp ac t An al ysi s (Pr o po sed ap p r o ach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits NB.

No other impacts have been identified from the proposed option. Federated Farmers and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ) will continue to be consulted on the detailed design of the proposal to ensure there are no unintended impacts. Secti o n 5: Sta keh o ld er vi ew s 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? This issue was raised by Federated Farmers in a letter sent to the Minister of Revenue in December 2019. Since then officials have worked with Federated Farmers and CA ANZ on developing a solution to the issue. Federated Farmers and CA ANZ both consider that an immediate solution is required and support the proposed income spreading option. Officials, CA ANZ and Federated Farmers have established a working team to work through the detailed detail of the proposed spreading option. Given the urgent timeline for addressing this issue the focus has been on consulting with Federated Farmers and CA ANZ. However, officials will consider whether other groups should also be consulted as we work through the detailed design before legislation is introduced and at the select committee stage. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 11 IN CONFIDENCE Secti o n 6: I mpl em en tati o n an d op er ati o n 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposal will require amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007. These amendments would be included in a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) to an omnibus taxation Bill scheduled to be introduced in April 2020. The SOP would be released at the Finance and Expenditure Committee stage in time for submissions to be made on the proposed amendments. Guidance material will be published on the amendments following the Bill’s enactment. Following Cabinet approving the proposed option the Minister of Revenue will issue a press release advising of Cabinet’s decision and the process for affected 2018/19 returns due by 31 March 2020. This will help to provide certainty for farmers and their tax advisers. Already filed returns Although the bulk of the impact to date will be in relation to 2018/19 income tax, as the culls began in late 2017, this option would be backdated to include the effects of the cull in the 2017/18 income year. Affected farmers who have already filed returns for 2017/18 or 2018/19 would have the option of applying the spread retrospectively and having their returns reassessed. However, some may instead choose to leave their returns as is as there may be some impact on farmers social assistance entitlements and liabilities if the additional income is now spread. For this to be effective, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will have to be allowed to make associated adjustments to the farmers’ tax positions. Secti o n 7: M o ni tori n g, eval uati o n an d r evi ew 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes to confirm that they match the policy objectives. This will be facilitated by farmers who choose to spread their additional income being required to advise Inland Revenue of their intention to do so. The proposed option has been developed alongside Federated Farmers and CA ANZ. Officials expect that, once the proposals are enacted, these two groups will raise any concerns affected farmers are having with the rules in practice. Any necessary changes identified as a result would be recommended for addition to the Government’s tax policy work programme. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The review will be the monitoring described in section 7.1 above. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 I N C O N F I D E N C E DEV-20-MIN-0045 Cabinet Economic Development Committee Minute of Decision This document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.

This report seeks your agreement to the scope of a review of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 (the Act) and for us to engage with relevant stakeholders. As part of release 5 of our business transformation programme, the administration of the Act will be deployed into START. This creates an opportunity to review current legislative settings to modernise administration and reduce compliance costs. 2. The scope of this review is intended to simplify our administration of the Act and compliance by holders of unclaimed money (UCM) . Engagement with organisations representing the interests of the various holders of UCM would help us to define the scope of the desirable amendments. Background 3. UCM is money held by a person or organisation, such as a solicitor or a bank (a wide range of organisations are covered), that cannot be attributed to its owner after a certain period of time (the length of time varies depending on the type of account and is either six or 25 years). It includes KiwiSaver contributions that Inland Revenue receives but is unable to associate with a specific member. 4. There are approximately 2, 000 holders and 377,000 owners of UCM. Inland Revenue’s UCM database currently has a total value of approximately $195,890,000, with the average amount available for refund being $518. 5. During the 2018-19 reporting period, most of the payments that Inland Revenue received were from lawyers clearing monies from their trust accounts in accordance with the new anti-money laundering legislation. The highest value payments were received from banks. There is a break-down of the figures for November 2018 – November 2019 in the Appendix. 6. Once a year, holders of UCM transfer the UCM and associated information about the owner to Inland Revenue (and a range of other organisations including the Treasury, depending on the source of the UCM). UCM is then transferred to the Crown Account and, if there is subsequently a successful claim to it, it is disbursed to the owner. There is no time limit on the ability to submit a UCM claim. 7. The Act has become out-dated in a number of respects, as it is highly prescriptive about operational matters. For example, it requires holders of UCM to maintain physical registers at their head office. It has not been substantively reviewed since it was enacted. 8. While officials do not propose a full re-write of the Act, we do consider that certain amendments may be desirable. These could be made via a tax Bill in 2020 and implemented as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation, Release 5, in April 2021. IR2019/671: BT release 5 - Updating the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 Page 1 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Scope of review 9. We have considered whether it would be worth undertaking a substantial review and consolidation of all UCM-related processes under various enactments and giving UCM responsibilities to a single organisation such as Inland Revenue. However, this would be a significant inter-agency project. 10. Instead, we consider that it would be desirable to change some of the key parameters around UCM, to simplify the operation of the Act and reduce compliance costs. For example, we consider that it may be useful to: a) reduce the period of time that money must sit in an account before it is deemed to be “unclaimed” (as noted above, this is currently six or 25 years, but could be a shorter time period, to be determined in consultation) – while UCM holders would lose the use of this money, we consider that it is more appropriate for the Crown to have the use of the money, for the benefit of the community; b) remove the requirements for UCM holders to: i. hold the UCM and associated information for a year after the funds become UCM (instead, this could be transferred to Inland Revenue more quickly, or even immediately, effectively making Inland Revenue the first point of contact for many UCM claimants); ii. keep a register of UCM at their head offices (instead, this could be held electronically, if it is still required); iii. provide occupation information for owners of UCM (instead, it would be more useful for them to provide IRD numbers, where available, and other information that they hold about the owner, such as date of birth, and start and stop dates of their account, and type of account, improving Inland Revenue’s ability to verify a claimant’s identity and match them to their UCM); iv. make so much information publicly available on the register, to avoid privacy concerns and the risk of fraudulent claims; c) review the threshold for UCM – this is currently $100 and could, for example, be raised to an amount to be determined in consultation (to reduce compliance costs for UCM holders), or could be reduced to zero (as we currently accept any amounts that are provided to us); d) consider a time bar on the ability to claim UCM (to assist with our administration, as there is currently no time bar in place, so theoretically UCM claims can be made for all periods back to the first UCM record, in 1908); e) define the Act as an “Inland Revenue Act” under the Tax Administration Act 1994, so that Inland Revenue can use information that it holds to help administer it (and, therefore, improve its matching ability and reduce its administration costs); and f) require UCM holders to provide UCM information and funds to Inland Revenue electronically and in a standard format (this would help to reduce Inland Revenue’s administration costs, as it would facilitate matching of the information with potential owners in Inland Revenue’s systems, and reduce the manual processing required) – the appropriate transfer mechanism and format would be worked through in consultation. IR2019/671: BT release 5 - Updating the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 Page 2 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence 11. We intend to engage with key stakeholders on the merits, feasibility, costs and benefits of these proposals and obtain their views on whether there are any other desirable amendments. Consultation 12. Treasury and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment have been consulted on this report and they support the recommendations. 13. Treasury has noted in the past that improvements to the management of the UCM system are likely to delay the growth of the UCM balance. In the longer term, the Government is expected to earn less interest from the UCM balance than it would without the proposed improvements. Officials cannot, at this stage, estimate the fiscal cost associated with the proposed improvements. Next steps 14. If you agree, we will consult relevant stakeholders on our proposals. We propose to engage relatively informally at first, by writing to organisations representing the interests of the various UCM holders, and to invite comment from the public via our website. 15. Key organisations include the Law Society, the Bankers’ Association, the Financial Services Council, the Real Estate Institute, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, the Corporate Taxpayers Group, Business New Zealand, the Auctioneers’ Institute and the Motor Trade Association. 16. We would report to you on the results of our consultation early in the new year, before progressing any legislative amendments via a tax Bill in 2020. Recommended action 17. We recommend that you: (a) agree that the Act should be reviewed to simplify administration and compliance with the relevant requirements; Noted (b) agree that officials should consult relevant stakeholders on proposed amendments to the Act; Agreed/Not agreed (c) refer a copy of this report to the Minister of Finance for his information.

This report seeks your agreement to recommendations to modernise the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 (Act) following feedback from stakeholders on the document, Unclaimed money: A tax policy consultation document (“Consultation Paper) released in January 2020. Officials continue to engage with several stakeholders on the design detail for implementing the Government’s proposals. 2. The report also attaches a draft Cabinet Economic Development Committee (DEV) paper for your consideration and authorisation to the Cabinet Office. This DEV paper seeks agreement to the UCM policy proposals and the release of a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) giving effect to these changes. It is our intention that this SOP be referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee for consideration and inclusion in the Taxation (Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill (Bill) which is scheduled to be introduced into Parliament on 16 June 2020. 3. The Consultation Paper invited public feedback on a number of proposals for updating the administration of the Act. The key themes from submissions and our recommendations are as follows: • General o Many submitters considered the unclaimed money (UCM) regime should be overhauled and modernised to reflect changes in modern business practice including new types of financial products such as portfolio investment entities (cash-PIEs). Others welcomed the proposals and the anticipated reduction in compliance and administrative costs. o We recommend refining the definition of unclaimed money to ensure it is wide enough to deal with new financial products such as portfolio investment entities (“cash-PIEs”). o Submitters suggested the concept of what constituted “activity” on an account should be expanded to include online activity. o Officials also recommend that the forms of account “activity” which would prevent money being deemed UCM be extended to include new forms of activity (e.g. online activity). • Time until money is deemed UCM o Submitters typically suggested that while some “deeming” timeframe is necessary, the 25-or six-year period (depending on monetary category) should be shortened and consolidated. o We recommend that the period which must elapse before money is deemed unclaimed be reduced from six or 25 years (depending on the category) to five (5) years for all categories of UCM. For a term deposit of say 10 years this period would commence following the maturity of the deposit. IR2020/221: Proposed Changes to the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 Page 2 of 15 IN CONFIDENCE Executive Summary In Confidence o A submitter requested that it be possible for holders of money to, in limited circumstances, be paid to IR before the relevant time period had expired. An example of when this might be utilised is where a service provider notes that a former client has either been overcharged for services or under paid an amount owed (e.g. interest). o Officials recommend that, in such circumstances, UCM holders be permitted to transfer funds to IR prior to the funds becoming UCM provided reasonable efforts have been made to contact the owner. • Time period UCM and associated information must be held by UCM holders o Submitters generally considered that the period UCM is required to be held for should be reduced. Some submitters suggested that UCM could be transferred to Inland Revenue (IR) immediately. o We recommend that UCM can be transferred to IR immediately upon being classified as UCM, provided that reasonable efforts have been made to contact the UCM owner over the intervening period. Where reasonable efforts have not been made to contact the owner, the UCM holder should retain the funds for an additional three-month period during which the holder must seek to contact the UCM owner before transferring the UCM to IR. • Requirement to provide occupation information o Submitters typically felt that providing IR with the occupation of UCM holders is of limited value as it is an obsolete, legacy practice and does not usually assist in locating owners of UCM. o Other information (e.g. IRD numbers, where held) was thought to be more helpful. Submitters argued that information collection requirements should not extend beyond what holders of UCM had available or collect in the ordinary course of their business. o We recommend removing the requirement for UCM holders to provide occupation information and instead allow UCM holders to provide IR with other identifying information (e.g. IRD numbers) collected in the ordinary course of their business (IR would still accept occupation information where it is available and provided, however). • Remove the need for holders of UCM to hold a physical register of UCM o Most submitters agreed that there is limited value in holding a physical register of UCM. Instead, any relevant information should be held electronically. o We recommend that the requirement for UCM holders to maintain a physical register of UCM at their head office or place of business be removed. • Making details of UCM publicly available o Submitters indicated a preference for less information regarding UCM to be made public both for privacy reasons and to reduce the risk of fraudulent claims. o We recommend that the Act be amended to provide that holders of UCM are not required to provide the public with the details of the UCM which they hold. This is because in most cases the UCM will be transferred to Inland Revenue as soon as it becomes UCM. IR2020/221: Proposed Changes to the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 Page 3 of 15 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence • UCM threshold o Views on the appropriate UCM threshold differed, with some submitters viewing the current $100 as too high, others as too low and still others as largely correct. On this issue, there was no clear consensus although the largest holders, financial institutions, preferred the status quo which we concur with. o However, we recommend that the Act be amended to allow the Commissioner the discretion to accept smaller amounts of UCM where the UCM holder has little practical alternative but to pay it to the Commissioner. • Introduction of a time bar on claiming UCM o Submitters were generally of the view that some form of time bar on claiming UCM should be implemented, although submitters differed on how long it ought to be. Submitters’ concern was balancing efforts to reunite people with their money with the need to reduce the current, infinite claim period. Submitters’ suggestions for appropriate limitation periods ranged between 40 and 80 years. o We recommend introducing a 60-year time bar on the ability to claim UCM. We note that this may be seen as removing a property right (ownership of the UCM). • Defining the Act as an Inland Revenue Act o Submitters were mostly supportive of the proposal that the Act be defined as a revenue Act, so long as the penalties and interest regimes did not apply to UCM. Submitters considered that making the Act a revenue Act would improve IR’s ability to match claimants with UCM. o We recommend that the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 be listed within Schedule 1 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 thereby defining it as an “Inland Revenue” Act. The Unclaimed Money Act 1971 would nonetheless be excluded from the application of Parts 4A (Disputes), 7 (Penalties) and 8 (Interest) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. o One submitter requested that it be clarified that the Act does not apply to unclaimed money which is covered by the Public Finance Act 1989. Officials agree there is some scope for confusion and recommend that this be clarified as part of the reforms. • Providing IR with funds and information in a standard format o There was general support for providing information to IR electronically and in a standard format if this was done in consultation with stakeholders and did not raise compliance costs. Submitters emphasised that the obligation to provide information should only extend to the information which the holder of UCM has available. o We recommend that UCM holders be required to provide information and UCM to IR electronically and in a standard format. • Transitional period o Officials also recommend that holders be provided with a transitional period of two years to update their systems to incorporate the new rules. • Application date o Officials recommend an application date following the date of Royal assent.

Officials released the consultation document: Unclaimed money: a tax policy consultation document in January 2020. Submissions closed on 28 February 2020. Officials have continued to engage with stakeholders on the design detail of the proposals. 22. The Consultation Paper invited feedback on a series of proposals designed to: 22.1 Make it easier for people to claim amounts of money which are held in defunct accounts; and 22.2 reduce the compliance costs for organisations which hold UCM. 23. While the Act is intended to provide a framework for reuniting owners with their UCM, many of the processes contained with the Act are now archaic and out of step with modern business practice. For example, under the current Act, holders of UCM are required to maintain a physical register of UCM at their head office and must also write a letter to the last known address of the owner of the UCM once money has become unclaimed. 24. IR’s Business Transformation Release 5 presents an opportunity to modernise the administration of the Act, reduce compliance costs for UCM holders and more efficiently reunite owners of UCM with their money. Summary of Submissions 25. IR received 17 submissions on the Consultation Paper. Submissions were received from accounting and law firms, associations and organisations (e.g. the Corporate Taxpayers’ Group, New Zealand Bankers’ Association and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand). Submitters provided their submissions in writing, via email or chose to meet with officials and discuss the proposals in person. 26. A full summary of the submissions received is contained in the Appendix to this report. Proposals General 27. Submitters generally supported the proposals. Stakeholders expressed the view that the Act was outdated in many respects and should be amended to reflect modern business practice. However, submitters requested that the implementation of reforms give UCM holders sufficient time to update their computer systems to include the reforms. Definition of unclaimed money 28. The general theme among submissions was a request for the modernisation of the current definition. 29. Officials agree the definition of UCM should be updated to include modern categories of UCM, including portfolio investment entities (“cash-PIEs”) , the values of which are held in units (rather than in currency). Officials intend to continue discussions with stakeholders to ensure that all relevant categories of UCM are appropriately captured. Account activity IR2020/221: Proposed Changes to the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 Page 7 of 15 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence 30. Another matter which emerged from consultation was that the current definition of UCM in the Act can require a customer to have not operated on the account “by deposit, withdrawal, or instruction in writing”. 31. This definition is obsolete as in the present era, customers may be active in administering their account without necessarily making deposits or withdrawals. For example, customers may use telephone or internet banking to check their account balance without necessarily altering the amount in the account. 32. Officials recommend that the definition of UCM be expanded to allow for different forms of activity on an account. This would avoid money which is not unclaimed falling within the definition of UCM. Length of time until money is deemed unclaimed Consolidation of timeframes 33. Currently, the Act requires money to remain “untouched” for six or 25 years (depending on the category of money) before it is deemed UCM. 34. There are two issues with this approach; first, (and particularly in the case of the 25-year category) these periods are lengthy and second, it creates an artificial distinction between categories of money which neither officials nor submitters generally feel is necessary. 35. Officials recommend consolidating the various categories into one, thereby treating all monies alike. This would streamline the UCM process by deeming monies UCM after the expiry of a standardised period. 36. Although submissions varied on the appropriate length of time which should elapse before money is deemed UCM, a number of submitters argued that the 25-year period should at least be reduced. Another submitter argued the six -year time frame was appropriate and should not be shortened. However, submissions tended to favour some reduction in both timeframes. 37. Officials recommend that the period of time (or “deeming period”) which must elapse before money is deemed UCM should be reduced to five (5 ) years. Any period is somewhat arbitrary and a judgement. Under this approach, a ten-year term deposit would become UCM if there was no activity on the account for five years following the maturity of the term deposit. Officials note that transitional arrangements will be necessary to allow UCM holders to smoothly transition to the new time frame. Transfer of money to IR prior to becoming UCM 38. One submitter requested that it be possible for holders of money to, in limited circumstances, pay money to IR before the relevant time period had expired. An example of when this might be utilised is where a service provider notes that a former client has either been overcharged for services or under paid an amount owed (e.g. interest). In these situations, it may be preferable for the service provider to pay the funds directly to IR instead. 39. Officials agree that there is little to be gained by requiring service providers to retain amounts owed to former clients for a mandated period and recommend that service providers be permitted to pay those amounts directly to IR, subject to the proviso that service providers make “reasonable efforts” to contact the former client prior to transferring the money to IR. This would ensure that IR only receives funds owed to a former client where the client is, in fact, not contactable by the service provider rather than in all cases in which a former client is owed money. IR2020/221: Proposed Changes to the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 Page 8 of 15 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence Time period UCM and associated information is held by UCM holders 40. Under the current regime, UCM holders can retain UCM for over 12 months before they are required to transfer UCM to IR. 41. Before an UCM holder may transfer UCM to IR they must complete a statutory process which includes writing to the last known address of the owner and providing IR with the details of the money which has become unclaimed in the last year. 42. Submitters were generally of the view that the length of time UCM holders were required to retain money once it had become UCM should be reduced, with several suggesting that UCM could be transferred to IR immediately upon qualifying as UCM. 43. Officials agree with this suggestion and recommend the legislation be amended to allow the immediate payment of money to IR once it has qualified as UCM. This could be made subject to the proviso that the UCM holder has made “reasonable efforts” to contact the owner of the money which has become unclaimed. This would mean that an UCM holder could transfer UCM to IR five years after maturity or inactivity. 44. Where a UCM holder has not sought to contact the owner of the UCM within the last five years, officials recommend that UCM holders be required to transfer UCM to IR after three (3) months of it becoming UCM. A UCM holder would be required to attempt to contact the owner of the UCM during this three-month period. Once this period has passed, the UCM holder would be able to transfer the UCM to IR. Requirement to provide occupation information 45. The Act requires UCM holders to retain occupation information for owners of unclaimed money. Submitters typically expressed the view that collecting and retaining occupation information was of little assistance in locating owners of UCM. 46. Submitters were willing to provide IR with other information which is more likely to assist in locating owners of UCM such as IRD numbers, date of birth, contact information and the like as long as that information is normally collected by them. 47. Officials recommend that the legislation be amended to remove occupational information but allow UCM holders to provide IR with other information (e.g. IRD numbers and the like) which may assist IR in more easily locating the owners of UCM (IR would still accept occupation information if available and provided, however). In order to avoid raising compliance costs for UCM holders, this information should be limited to only the data which the UCM holder normally collects. Remove the need for a physical register of UCM to be held at head offices 48. Under the Act, UCM holders are required to maintain a physical register of UCM at their head office. Submitters were generally of the view that this requirement should be removed. 49. Officials agree that the maintenance of a physical register is outdated in an age in which the storage of information has become largely electronic. Officials recommend that the requirement for UCM holders to hold a physical register of unclaimed money be removed. Making less detailed information publicly available on a register Removing the requirement to make UCM owners’ information publicly available 50. Submitters generally took the view that making less information available publicly would address privacy concerns and reduce the risk of fraudulent claims. IR2020/221: Proposed Changes to the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 Page 9 of 15 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence 51. Officials agree with submitters’ views and recommend that the amount of publicly available information be reduced. In practice this would mean that UCM holders would not be required to provide the public with information relating to the UCM which they hold. Officials recommend that it be made explicit within the Act. This is because in most cases the UCM would be paid to Inland Revenue once it became unclaimed money. UCM threshold 52. The threshold for UCM is currently set at $100. While, strictly speaking, amounts below $100 do not come within the definition of UCM, IR has for some time adopted the operational practice of accepting smaller amounts of UCM where these are provided by UCM holders. 53. Submitters differed in their views on the matter. While officials’ initial view was that the threshold should be lowered, officials’ thinking has now changed through the submission process. 54. Officials recommend that the current $100 threshold should be retained but modified to allow UCM holders to pay amounts below $100 to IR where the circumstances require it (such as for lawyers’ trust accounts). This would give the Commissioner the discretion to accept smaller amounts of UCM where the UCM holder has little practical alternative but to pay the UCM to the Commissioner. Introduce a time bar to owner’s ability to claim UCM 55. Currently, there is no time bar on the ability to claim UCM under the Act. This means that, theoretically, a claimant could mount a claim for UCM stretching as far back as the regime’s inception in 1908. 56. While submitters agreed that some form of time bar was desirable, they also maintained that it was important to ensure claimants did not miss out on the ability to claim money which belonged to them. For most submitters, the issue was finding the appropriate balance between these two aims, with suggestions for an appropriate time period typically ranging between 40 and 80 years. 57. Officials appreciate the tension between these two ends and recommend, as a compromise, introducing a period of 60 years as a maximum claimable period. This would end the Crown’s (current) perpetual liability for UCM while also allowing claimants sufficient time to claim any money they own. This could be viewed as removing a property right (access to one’s own money). 58. Officials note, however, that there will be a point in time at which, for practical purposes, money will be rendered unclaimable owing to passage of time removing any realistic prospect of the UCM being claimed by its owner. Seen in this light, the introduction of a time bar could be viewed as merely formalising an existing state of affairs. Defining the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 as an Inland Revenue Act 59. While the Act is administered by IR, it is not specifically listed among the revenue Acts in Schedule 1 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). This inhibits IR’s ability to use the information which it holds in its systems to match owners of UCM with their money. 60. Although submitters were generally supportive of IR defining the Act as an “Inland Revenue Act”, submitters wanted to ensure that UCM would not be brought within the penalties and use of money interest (UOMI) regimes. IR2020/221: Proposed Changes to the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 Page 10 of 15 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence 61. Officials agree that there is no reason to include UCM within these regimes, as UCM does not represent an undischarged liability to tax on the part of UCM holders. Officials therefore recommend that the Act be brought within Schedule 1 of the TAA 1994, but be excluded from the Disputes, UOMI and Penalties regimes of the TAA 1994. Clarifying that the Unclaimed Money Act does not apply to money covered by the Public Finance Act 1989 62. During consultation, one submitter requested that it be clarified that the Act does not apply to money covered by the Public Finance Act 1989. The Public Finance Act contains its own rules pertaining to certain types of unclaimed money. Officials agree with this suggestion and recommend the reforms to the Act include this clarification. Requiring UCM holders to provide information and funds to IR electronically and in a standard format 63. While submitters were supportive of this initiative in principle, some submitters expressed concern at the prospect of increased compliance costs arising from the move to a standardised format in supplying information to IR. 64. Officials do not expect that the compliance costs of supplying information in a standard format will represent a significant cost for UCM holders. However, we recommend the move to a standardised format should proceed in consultation with UCM holders in order to minimise compliance costs and promote flexibility of format where necessary. Transitional period 65. Submitters requested that UCM holders be given time to update their systems and transition from the various UCM periods. Officials recommend that a two-year transitional period be adopted subject to discussions with holders. Date of Application and Effect 66. Officials recommend an application date following the date of Royal assent. 67. However, as discussed above, officials recommend that the proposed changes to the UCM Act take effect two years following the enactment of the legislation. This is in order to allow UCM holders the ability to upgrade their systems to include the changes. In practice, a suitable date would be 1 June 2023. This would mean the last transfer of UCM from holders of UCM to IR under the current regime would take place in October 2023. Consultation 68. We consulted with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, the Ministry of Justice and the Treasury in the course of formulating this report. Next steps 69. If you agree to provide a legislative solution, we recommend that it is included in a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill which is due for introduction in June.

We attach a draft Cabinet Economic Development Committee paper for your consideration and authorisation of the paper to the Cabinet Office seeking agreement to the policy proposals set out in this paper and approval to release an SOP giving effect to these proposals. It our intention that the SOP be referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee for their consideration and calling of submissions as part the call for submission on the above Bill. 71. The following timeline sets out indicative dates for consideration of the DEV paper and the release of the SOP: • The Cabinet paper would be considered by DEV on either 27 May 2020 or 3 June 2020 (pending Ministerial consultation); • The SOP would be released prior to 13 June 2020; • The first reading of the Bill would then be 16 June 2020; and • Submissions would be called at FEC on 17 June 2020. IR2020/221: Proposed Changes to the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 Page 12 of 15 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence Appendix One – Summary of submissions Issue Key point General • The administration of the Act should be updated to incorporate modern technology as the current administrative burden upon holders of UCM is high. • The definition of UCM should be updated to reflect modern business practice. • The definition of UCM has widened with time. A clearer definition would minimise confusion. • The implementation of reforms should include a transitional period to allow holders of UCM time to update their systems. Length of timeframe before money is deemed UCM • The amount of time money must sit in an account before it is deemed unclaimed should be reduced. • The current six-year timeframe is effective and should not be shortened. • The current period of either six or 25 years seems lengthy, however UCM largely affects the bank and insurance sectors (which may require a longer timeframe). • Current timeframes could be varied by industry, but the 25-year period could be halved. • There is benefit in having a minimum period before money is deemed unclaimed. Three years may be appropriate. • Timeframes could be shortened significantly, although inactivity on the account over a short period should not be treated as abandonment. • The current two separate timeframes of six and 25 years should be consolidated into a single timeframe. • The current timing of when money becomes UCM should be clarified, although IR should not be too prescriptive in its timeframes for when money should be transferred to IR. • One option is to leave providers to decide the timeframes for themselves. If a timescale is retained it could reflect normal payment timeframes. • Provided a proper process is followed, UCM should be able to be paid at any time. • Online account activity or a customer’s expressed intention should be sufficient to prevent money being deemed UCM. • No activity for an account can differ from no activity for a customer. • The Commissioner should have the discretion to accept unclaimed money prior to the expiration of six or 25 years. Time period UCM and assoc. information is held by UCM holders • Information should largely be held electronically. • The required time to hold UCM should be reduced as it is difficult to locate owners of UCM. Holding UCM imposes administrative costs on the holder. • UCM could be transferred to IR immediately or at any time. This would make IR the first point of contact for claimants. • The requirement for UCM holders to hold associated information for an extended period after funds become UCM should be removed. Associated information could be transferred more quickly. • Transferring UCM after a year is too soon as (in the case of credit balances) customers may return and seek their credit carried forward. Three years would be a realistic timeframe for transferring unclaimed monies. • Subject to proper process, UCM should be eligible for transfer at any time. • If transfers occur quickly IR may need additional resourcing. Need for a physical copy of UCM register at head office • Requiring a holder of UCM to maintain a physical register no longer makes sense and it is rare for an owner to contact a holder seeking funds. • The need to keep a register of UCM at head office should be removed. Information could be held electronically. • It is practical for holders of UCM to keep an electronic register, although other changes may mean that maintaining a separate register is no longer required. • An electronic register would reduce compliance costs and allow information to be more easily stored. • The requirement to maintain a register should not prevent a company from being wound up. IR2020/221: Proposed Changes to the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 Page 13 of 15 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence Issue Key point Provision of occupation information • Occupation information could assist IR in seeking the owners of UCM. • Occupation information may be of little assistance where it is out of date. The requirement to provide occupation information should be removed. • IRD numbers may be more effective in tracing owners but are not held for all investors. • Information which is required should be limited to that held. • It would not be difficult to provide occupation information where it is available. Information available on public register • If proposals proceed as outlined, public disclosure requirements could be reduced. • There is a balance between reducing compliance costs and making it easier for people to claim amounts in defunct accounts. • Less information should be publicly available for privacy reasons and to mitigate the risk of identity theft. UCM Threshold • The current threshold is too low and should be increased to between $250 and $500 • The threshold should be reduced to zero and the requirement to contact the owner prior to paying UCM to IR should be removed. • The threshold could be raised or reduced to zero so long as the requirement for holders to retain unclaimed money for an extended period is removed from the Act. • Any change to the threshold should consider compliance costs. • A threshold reduces the change of transferring credit balances arising from ‘sign-up’ incentives. • The current $100 threshold should be lowered provided this can be achieved while lowering (or retaining) compliance cost levels. • Having a threshold reduces expediency. Companies need to have the ability to pay unclaimed monies to IR so they can be wound up. • The current $100 threshold should be retained. Time bar for claiming UCM • UCM should be paid to charity after being in Crown accounts for a given period (e.g. 15 years). • UCM should be distributed to charitable purposes in the form of a social bank. • A time bar may be appropriate so long as those who are eligible do not miss out on the opportunity to claim. A time period of 50 years might be appropriate. • A period of 60-80 years should elapse before the funds are barred from future claim. • A time bar could cause some people to narrowly miss out. A long date (e.g. 40 years) might be appropriate (or alternatively, the longest standing claim could be a guide. • A time bar which aligns with period within which most UCM is successfully claimed may be appropriate. Defining the Act as an “Inland Revenue Act” • If the Act is defined in this way, the information should only be used to improve IR’s matching ability and not for any other purpose. • It should be clarified that the Act does not apply to money covered by the Public Finance Act 1989. • UCM should not come within the penalties and UOMI regimes. • Defining the Act as an IR Act will assist in identifying owners of UCM and reduce the time accounts holders retain UCM before sending it to IR. • IR should offer practical guidance on the operation of the Act. IR2020/221: Proposed Changes to the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 Page 14 of 15 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence Issue Key point Requiring UCM holders to provide information and funds to IR • It is logical/sensible that information be provided in a standard format set by IR. • To avoid raising compliance costs, a standard format should be developed in consultation with stakeholders. • Formatting requirements should not create a new burden for UCM holders. • A standardised process will decrease compliance costs if it is simple and easy to administer. UCM holders should only have to provide the information which they have available. • This would streamline the information transfer process while reducing the risk of fraud. Use of a secure portal is preferable. • Providing data in an homogenous format could prove challenging as the money may sit in different “product” categories, meaning flexibility in data supply requirements may be necessary. Other • If the proposal proceeds, a transition period of 1-2 years should allow holders sufficient time to update their systems. • Notification requirements should be reduced. A threshold for when someone must be contacted could be introduced. • Lawyers who cannot find the person to whom trust account money is owed sometimes pay funds to IR as UCM. • The use of a formal letter to contact a customer may be less effective than another form of communication (e.g. email, etc). • Customers occasionally approach Banks seeking unclaimed money after it has been transferred to IR. • It is not clear how the Act applies to PIE funds held in units rather than currency. • An education campaign should be considered to inform the public of UCM.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair Cabinet Economic Development Committee REVIEW OF UNCLAIMED MONEY SCHEME: POLICY APPROVAL AND RELEASE OF SUPPLEMENTARY ORDER PAPER Proposal 1. This paper seeks the agreement of the Cabinet Economic Development Committee (DEV) to policy proposals to modernise the administration of the Unclaimed Money Act. It also seeks approval for the release of a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill (Bill) to give effect to these proposals. This Bill is scheduled to be enacted in March 2021. Executive Summary 2. Issues with the administration and transfer of unclaimed money (UCM) have led to the formulation of proposals designed to modernise the administration of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 (the Act). 3. Many of these issues arise from obsolete administrative practices (e.g. a requirement for a holder of UCM to hold a physical register of unclaimed money at its head office). 4. Inland Revenue’s (IR) Business Transformation project offers the opportunity to update both the Act and the underlying UCM process. 5. In recent months, my officials have met with key stakeholders (e.g. private sector UCM holders such as banks) to gauge their response and reaction to the proposals and these have helped form the recommendations. 6. The key recommendations to modernise administration are: 6.1. redefining UCM to ensure its definition is wide enough to deal with new financial products that are similar to savings accounts and term deposits (e.g. Portfolio Investment Entities such as cash-PIEs); 6.2. reducing the period which must elapse before money is deemed UCM from six or 25 years (depending on the product category) to five years for all categories of UCM; 6.3. allowing UCM to be transferred to IR immediately upon being classified as UCM; 6.4. removing the requirement for UCM holders to maintain a physical register of UCM at their head office or place of business; IN CONFIDENCE 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:16:38 6.5. introducing a 60-year time bar on prospective claimants’ ability to claim UCM; 6.6. designating the Act as an “Inland Revenue Act” to allow better matching to locate claimants; and 6.7. requiring UCM holders to provide information and UCM to Inland Revenue electronically and in a standard format. 7. Other less significant recommendations include requiring UCM holders to provide better information, such as IRD numbers, than is currently required. This will improve IR’s ability to match owners with their UCM. 8. The estimated overall fiscal impact, if any, of the changes is expected to be small and may even be positive due to the introduction of a time bar on the ability of claimants to claim UCM. This means that amounts of UCM in the Crown account will not need to be held as a contingent liability. Legislative Implications 9. I propose that these changes be included in a SOP to the Bill. I seek the Committee’s approval to release the SOP following Cabinet’s consideration of this paper. Policy Items 10. The Act is based on administrative practice and principles which date from the 1970s, when the Act was last substantially revised. This resulted in a focus on the use of physical record keeping which is now out of step with modern administrative practice. The UCM system requires holders of UCM such as banks to transfer money held by them which has remained unclaimed by the owner after a certain period of time. 11. IR’s Business Transformation Release 5 (BT 5) will see the UCM integrated into IR’s START computer system. This represents an opportunity to review current administrative practice and reduce administrative and compliance costs. As at November 2019, IR’s UCM database had a total value of approximately $199 million (including amounts from KiwiSaver). In the period 1 November 2018 to 30 November 2019, IR received payments of approximately $13.1 million in UCM from UCM holders and returned approximately $2.4 million to UCM owners 1 . 12. Consultation began with the release of the document Unclaimed money: A tax policy consultation document (“Consultation Paper”) in January 2020. IR received 17 submissions on the consultation paper. Submissions were received from accounting and law firms, associations and organisations. Submitters provided their submissions in writing, via email or chose to meet with officials and discuss the proposals in person. 1 KiwiSaver contributions that cannot be allocated or attributed to a member are treated as unclaimed money and subject to the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. IN CONFIDENCE 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:16:38 Expanding the definition of UCM 13. The current definition of UCM in the Act is focused on various categories of UCM. However, this does not capture new financial products such as, for example, units held in PIEs. I propose that the definition of UCM be expanded to include new categories of banking products that are similar to term deposits. Amending the definition of UCM to allow for “account activity” 14. Under the current Act, the absence of a deposit or withdrawal for a six- or 25- year period is generally required. However, submitters commented that it was not unusual for account holders to monitor their account (via online banking, for example) and thereby engage with their deposits without necessarily altering the balance of their account. 15. I therefore propose that the definition of UCM be amended to provide that the presence of account activity, broadly defined, will not cause money to become unclaimed. Consolidating the existing timeframes before money is deemed unclaimed 16. Some submitters felt the existing six or 25-year period before money was treated as UCM was unduly lengthy. I agree and propose that the standard period applying to all money be set at five (5) years. However, this would not affect money which has been deposited for a term longer than five years. This means that a term deposit of 10 years would not become UCM until 5 years after it had reached maturity, if there is no activity. Payment of money to IR prior to it becoming UCM 17. Where remediation work is undertaken by service providers, it may be discovered that a former client has been overcharged or has overpaid for services provided. Where it is impossible to locate the former client, little would seem to be gained by the UCM holder retaining the funds for the duration of the deeming period. I therefore propose that, in such circumstances, UCM holders be permitted to transfer the funds to IR before they become unclaimed money provided the UCM holder has made reasonable efforts to contact the owner. Removing the requirement for UCM holders to hold UCM for an extended period after the funds become UCM 18. Under the current Act, once money has been deemed UCM, UCM holders may end up holding UCM for over 12 months before transferring it to IR. Submitters’ feedback was generally that this period could be reduced. 19. I propose that UCM holders be permitted to transfer UCM to IR immediately upon it qualifying as UCM, provided that reasonable efforts have been made to contact the UCM owner over the intervening period. Where reasonable efforts have not been made to contact the owner, the UCM holder should retain the funds for an additional three- month period during which the holder must seek to contact the UCM owner before transferring the UCM to IR. Remove the requirement for UCM holders to provide occupation information for owners of UCM 20. Currently, the Act requires UCM holders to provide IR with the occupation of owners of UCM. Instead, I propose that UCM holders be required to provid e IR with other, more useful information (e.g. IRD numbers, date of birth and contact details), where such IN CONFIDENCE 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:16:38 information is collected by UCM holders in the ordinary course of their business (IR would still accept occupation information if available and provided, however). Remove the requirement for UCM holders to hold a physical register of UCM at their head offices 21. The Act currently requires UCM holders to maintain a physical register of UCM at their head office. As an outdated practice, I propose that this requirement be removed. Making less detailed information publicly available on a register 22. Currently, the Act requires UCM holders to make details of the UCM which they hold publicly available for inspection. I propose that this requirement be abolished, both for privacy reasons and to reduce the risk of fraudulent claims. Amending the current $100 threshold for UCM to permit smaller amounts to be transferred 23. Currently, the Act provides that only amounts over $100 may qualify as UCM (although IR, will as a matter of operational practice, often accept smaller amounts where these are provided by UCM holders). 24. I propose that this threshold be retained but that it be formalised in legislation that IR will accept smaller amounts where these are paid to Inland Revenue as unclaimed money. Introduce a time bar on claiming UCM 25. There is currently no time bar on the ability of a prospective claimant to claim UCM under the Act. In order to address the current, indefinite claim period I propose that a limitation period of 60 years be placed on a prospective claimant’s ability to claim UCM. This proposal may give rise to the concern that a property right (claim to one’s money) is being removed. However, a time bar reflects what is happening in practice that after a lengthy period UCM is not claimed. 26. This will result in UCM not being accounted for as a contingent liability in the Government’s accounts over time as amounts become subject to the time bar. Defining the Act as an Inland Revenue Act under the Tax Administration Act 1994 27. While the Act is administered by IR, it is not listed among the revenue Acts contained within Schedule 1 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This inhibits IR’s ability to use existing tax information to match owners of UCM with their money. 28. However, a number of parts of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should not apply to UCM due to UCM not being a tax debt. Specifically, parts 4A (Disputes), 7 (Penalties) and 8 (Interest) should not apply to UCM. 29. I propose to define the Act as an Inland Revenue Act in order to better facilitate the matching of owners of UCM with their money and exclude UCM from parts 4A (Disputes), 7 (Penalties) and 8 (Interest) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Clarifying that the UCM Act does not apply to money covered by the Public Finance Act 1989 30. To avoid confusion, I propose that it be clarified that unclaimed money covered by the Public Finance Act 1989 does not come within the UCM regime. IN CONFIDENCE 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:16:38 Requiring UCM holders to provide UCM information and funds to IR electronically and in a standard format 31. I propose that the Act be amended to require UCM holders to provide information and UCM electronically and in a standard format. Transitional Period 32. I propose that a transitional period be included within the Act to allow holders sufficient time to transition to the new rules and account for funds that were held for the longer 25-year period to the new shorter 5- year period. Application Date 33. Officials recommend an application date following the date of Royal assent. Legislative Vehicle 34. Subject to the Committee’s approval of the policy proposals, I also seek approval for me to release a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill (Bill) to give effect to these proposals. I intend to invite the Finance and Expenditure Committee to consider and include the SOP’s proposals in the Bill. This will provide an opportunity to call for submissions on the proposals in the SOP. Impact Analysis 35. A Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) for the Reform of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 was prepared and submitted to Cabinet at the time the approval for this policy was sought. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the RIA prepared by Inland Revenue and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the RIA meets the quality assurance criteria. Compliance 36. The proposed SOP complies with: 36.1. the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 36.2. the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990; 36.3. principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 36.4. relevant international standards and obligations; and 36.5. the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Consultation Relevant government departments or other public bodies 37. The Treasury and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner were consulted on the proposed reforms to the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. IN CONFIDENCE 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:16:38 38. The Ministry for the Environment has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Relevant private sector organisations and public consultation processes 39. Officials have undertaken consultation with key stakeholders on the proposed reforms to the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. These stakeholders include the Corporate Taxpayers’ Group, Chartered Accountants Australia & New Zealand (CA ANZ) and the New Zealand Law Society. Binding on the Crown 40. The Unclaimed Money Act 1971 is binding on the Crown. The SOP does not alter the status quo in this respect. Creating new agencies or amending law relating to existing agencies 41. The SOP will not create a new agency. 42. The SOP will not amend the existing coverage of the Ombudsman Act 1975, the Official Information Act 1982, or the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987. Allocation of decision-making powers 43. The SOP does not involve the allocation of decision-making powers between the executive, the courts, and tribunals. Associated regulations 44. No regulations are required to bring the proposed legislation into operation. Other instruments 45. The SOP does not include provisions empowering the making of their instruments that are deemed to be legislative instruments or disallowable instruments (or both). Definition of Minister/department 46. The SOP does not contain a definition of Minister, department or chief executive. Commencement of legislation 47. Each provision of the SOP comes into force on the date specified for the particular provision. Legislative implications 48. Implementing these proposals requires changes to the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Human rights 49. There are no human rights implications as a result of the proposals in this paper. Gender and disability implications 50. The proposals do not have gender or disability implications. IN CONFIDENCE 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:16:38 Publicity 51. I will make an announcement on the contents of the SOP when the SOP is released. Inland Revenue will include details of the new legislation in a Tax Information Bulletin after the Bill is enacted. Proactive release 52. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper and associated minutes and the relevant policy report in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions, subject to redactions under the Official Information Act 1982. Recommendations 53. I recommend that the Cabinet Economic Development Committee 1. Agree that: 1.1. The definition of UCM be amended to ensure it is wide enough to cover new financial products such as PIEs and to make the definition clearer. 1.2. The forms of account “activity” which would prevent money being deemed UCM be expanded to include new forms of activity (e.g. online activity). 1.3. The period which must elapse before money is deemed unclaimed be reduced from six or 25-years (depending on the UCM category) to five (5) years for all categories of UCM. 1.4. UCM holders be permitted, in limited circumstances (e.g. as part of a financial remediation process) to transfer money to IR before it is deemed UCM provided reasonable efforts have been made to contact the owner. 1.5. That UCM can be transferred to IR immediately upon being classified as UCM, provided that reasonable efforts have been made to contact the UCM owner over the intervening period. Where reasonable efforts have not been made to contact the owner, the UCM holder should retain the funds for an additional three-month period during which the holder must seek to contact the UCM owner before transferring the UCM to IR. 1.6. The requirement for UCM holders to provide occupation information with UCM be removed and instead allow UCM holders to provide IR with other identifying information (e.g. IRD numbers, date of birth and contact details) collected in the ordinary course of their business (IR would still accept occupation information if available and provided, however). 1.7. UCM holders be no longer required to maintain a physical register of UCM at their head office or place of business. IN CONFIDENCE 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:16:38 1.8. UCM holders no longer be required to make information relating to the UCM which they hold available to the public. 1.9. The current UCM threshold at $100 be retained, while also permitting the Commissioner the discretion to accept smaller amounts if necessary. 1.10. A 60-year time bar be introduced on the ability to claim UCM. 1.11. The Unclaimed Money Act 1971 be listed within Schedule 1 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in order to define it as an “Inland Revenue” Act. 1.12. Parts 4A (Disputes), 7 (Penalties) and 8 (Interest) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 be excluded from applying to UCM. 1.13. The Act be clarified so that it does not apply to unclaimed money covered by the Public Finance Act 1989. 1.14. UCM holders be required to provide information and UCM to Inland Revenue electronically and in a standard format. 1.15. UCM holders be allowed a transitional period to transition to the recommendations in (1.1) – (1.14) 2. Delegate authority to the Minister of Revenue to make decisions on the detailed design of the proposals recommended in this paper and, in consultation with the Minister of Finance and the Leader of the House, to release a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill (Bill) containing these proposals as soon as practicable. 3. Note that the Minister of Revenue will invite the Finance and Expenditure Committee to consider the SOP and include its proposals in the Bill. 4. Note that I will make a public announcement as part of the release of the SOP. Authorised for lodgement Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue IN CONFIDENCE 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:16:38 4. Impact Summary: Review of Unclaimed Money Act Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of final decisions be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Timing To maximise the administrative efficiencies of the proposals, the implementation of changes needs to align with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Release 5. This is currently scheduled to take place in April 2021. However, this time constraint has not materially affected officials’ ability to undertake consultation or provide the Minister with appropriate advice on the merits of the proposals. Scope of review The scope of the review of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 focused on modernising the administration of the UCM system . Because of time constraints to ensure that any legislative changes were enacted to coincide with the deployment of BT release 5, the review did not undertake a first princ iples review of the scope of the Act including the holders and unclaimed money that could be covered by the Act. There are a number of pieces of legislation that cover unclaimed money and assets and the review did not consider the consolidation of this legislation. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Mike Nutsford Policy Lead Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 24 April 2020 Review of Unclaimed Money Act | 1 2r4hxlcklw 2020-06-17 12:56:45 IN CONFIDENCE To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Review of Unclaimed Money Act Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by Inland Revenue, and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the quality assurance criteria. This RIA considers a large number of small changes to the unclaimed money rules to improve its overall efficiency. In comparison with a RIA that considers a single or small number of larger changes, this makes it practically difficult for the pros and cons of individual changes to be fully explained. The RIA provides a good explanation of why the changes should proceed and we consider the summarised detail on the individual proposals does not subtract from the overall conclusions reached. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of the Regulatory Impact Assessment have been incorporated into the final version. Review of Unclaimed Money Act | 2 2r4hxlcklw 2020-06-17 12:56:45 IN CONFIDENCE Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? As part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation (BT) programme, the administration of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 will be integrated into our new technology platform (START). This is currently scheduled to take place in April 2021. Currently UCM is administered as a stand-alone product using paper based and spread-sheet information provided by a holder of UCM. Inland Revenue is unable to use information it holds as part of administering the tax and social policy system to assist in identifying owners of unclaimed money. Our BT programme provides an opportunity to review the administration of the UCM system to modernise its administration to reduce compliance costs for holders of UCM and administration costs for Inland Revenue. The Act has not been reviewed since it was enacted in 1971 and that Act was very much based on the original 1908 Act. Unclaimed money (“UCM”) is the term applied to money subject to the regime established by the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 (the Act). Most often, this takes the form of deposits which have been left untouched by their owner in their bank accounts for some years, or even decades. UCM holders are not limited to banks, however, as UCM can arise in a variety of contexts and among other service providers (e.g. real estate agents, lawyers and utility providers) whose role is often to hold monies on trust. KiwiSaver contributions held by Inland Revenue that cannot be allocated to a KiwiSaver scheme or member are also treated as unclaimed money. Eventually, in situations in which contact with the depositor is lost, these amounts become “unclaimed” and are transferred to Inland Revenue (“IR”). Such amounts are deposited into the Crown’s bank account and can be used by the Crown. UCM is a contingent liability in the Crown’s accounts. The Crown does not pay interest on UCM when it is paid out to its owner. As at As at November 2019, IR’s UCM database had a tot al value of approximately $199m (including amounts from KiwiSaver). In the period 1 November 2018 to 30 November 2019, IR received approximately $13 million in transfers of UCM from UCM holders. IR then seeks to locate the owners of UCM, and makes information available so owners can contact IR, so their money can be returned to them. This is the regime’s ultimate aim: the reunification of UCM owners with their money. In the period 1 November 2018 to 30 November 2019 IR returned approximately $2.4 million to UCM owners. However, aspects of the UCM regime have either become outdated or do not accommodate technological developments which have occurred since the enactment of the Act. This has resulted in the Act not meeting its policy objective of efficiently reuniting owners of UCM with their money. For example: • The current definition of UCM within the Act does not take account of new financial products that are very similar to products currently covered by the Act. For example, cash-PIEs which are similar to a term deposit. • The Act currently applies different “deeming” periods (i.e. the period which must elapse before money becomes UCM) to money based on its “product” category. For example, a deposit made for a fixed term and a deposit made for an unlimited term will be subject to different qualifying periods. The deeming period in the former case is six years, while in the latter case, it is 25 years. Other examples of such product distinctions can also be found within the Act. These product distinctions are somewhat artificial and relevant timeframes lengthy. Review of Unclaimed Money Act | 3 2r4hxlcklw 2020-06-17 12:56:45 IN CONFIDENCE • In some cases, for the relevant deeming period to have expired on a deposit, the owner must not have operated on the account for the relevant period, by “deposit, withdrawal or instruction in writing”. This does not account for new forms of activity developed since the Act’s enactment such as telephone or internet banking. Accordingly, it is possible that some amounts of money may become UCM notwithstanding their owners taking an active interest in their administration. • The Act currently requires a holder of UCM to keep a physical register of the UCM which has accrued in the current year, and to make this register available for inspection by the public. As modern data storage is largely digital, maintenance of a physical register does not take advantage of new technological developments, thereby imposing compliance costs on UCM holders. This requirement also raises privacy issues, as the physical register is required to record, among other things, the name, occupation and last known address of the owner. • Once money has become UCM, UCM holders may end up holding it for almost months as they proceed through a somewhat convoluted statutory process. This in summary requires a holder of UCM to: • maintain a register of money which has become unclaimed in the period 1 June of the preceding year to 31 May of the current year (and to make this register available for inspection by the public); • by the end of June in the current year, write to the UCM owner’s last known address, and provide the particulars of money which has become UCM; • by the end of September in the current year, provide the Commissioner with a copy of the register of the money which has become UCM in the current year (the UCM holder must also advise the Commissioner of any amounts which have been paid to the owner since the end of June in the current year year) and • by the end of October each year, pay any UCM which has been left unclaimed to the Commissioner. • This process is both lengthy and administratively taxing for UCM holders. It also does not envisage new methods of information transfer (e.g. electronic data transmission in an agreed format). • While UCM holders are required to provide IR with the occupation information of UCM owners, there is no requirement to provide any other information which they may hold (e.g. IRD numbers, date of birth and contact details such email address and the like) and which may be more helpful in locating owners of UCM. • UCM holders are currently unable to transfer money to IR before the deeming period has expired. This would be beneficial in limited circumstances (e.g. as part of a routine remediation process). This means that UCM owners end up waiting much longer than is necessary for IR to have the opportunity to reunite them with their money. Review of Unclaimed Money Act | 4 2r4hxlcklw 2020-06-17 12:56:45 IN CONFIDENCE • The Act is currently not listed as a revenue Act in Schedule 1 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This means that IR is unable to use existing tax information to facilitate the more efficient matching of owners with their UCM. • Currently, there is no limitation (or “time bar”) on the period during which UCM may be claimed by a prospective claimant from Inland Revenue. This means that there is an ongoing contingent liability on the part of the Crown for all UCM currently held. The reasoning for removing is as follows: o Installing a time bar recognises that there is a point in time beyond which owners are unlikely to ever make a claim for UCM. This reflects a judgment that the probably of an owner claiming UCM eventually becomes extremely remote. This makes retaining UCM as a contingent liability on the Crown’s accounts indefinitely impractical as there comes a point at which the liability ceases, for practical purposes, to exist; o From a cost-benefit perspective, it could be said that the cost and duties imposed on regulators (and regulated parties) outweigh the benefits to individual owners of UCM 2.2 Who is affected and how? UCM holders As noted in the examples above, UCM holders bear administrative costs in the form of outdated information collection and storage requirements. UCM holders are unable to take advantage of new methods of communication (e.g. email) when seeking to contact owners of UCM or transferring information to IR. UCM owners Owners of UCM are affected by the administrative requirements of the current regime which does not optimise their chances of being reunited with their money. The lengthy “deeming” period and requirement to use traditional methods of contact (i.e. post) means that some owners may miss out on being returned their UCM. The inability of IR to use existing tax data to match owners of UCM with their money makes IR’s matching processes less than optimal. Inland Revenue Under the Act, IR is required to receive physical copies of UCM records kept by UCM holders. It also unable to use existing tax data to match owners of UCM with their money, which presents a source of administrative inefficiency and increased cost. Review of Unclaimed Money Act | 5 2r4hxlcklw 2020-06-17 12:56:45 IN CONFIDENCE 2.3 What are the objectives sought in relation to the identified problem? The objectives of the proposals are to: • modernise and update the Act to take advantage of new administrative practice; • reduce compliance costs for holders and owners of UCM; • reduce administrative costs for IR; and • increase the likelihood of owners of UCM being reunited with their money (and more rapidly than is presently the case). Review of Unclaimed Money Act | 6 2r4hxlcklw 2020-06-17 12:56:45 IN CONFIDENCE Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? The following criteria were used to assess the options considered: • Compliance: compliance costs should be minimised as far as possible. • Administration: administrative costs should be minimised as far as possible. • Equity: the option should ensure that UCM owners are, so far as possible, being reunited with their money. • Sustainability: the option should be consistent with wider financial practice settings and utilise modern communication practices. Option One: Maintain the status quo Compliance: The cost of collating UCM and dispatching letters to the last known addresses of its owners can be costly for UCM holders both in time and in the resources required. Administration: The status quo requires IR to use its resources less than optimally by attempting to match UCM with its owners using information which may be limited or outdated. Equity: Some owners of UCM are not being reunited with their money due to a lack of information. Another factor is the inability of IR to reconcile information collected from UCM holders with current tax data held by Inland Revenue. Sustainability: The current UCM regime settings were doubtless intended to promote best administrative practice when originally enacted, but now pose a burden for UCM holders who are required to undertake a process which is no longer in keeping with current business practice. Option two: Administrative refinements and reforms Option two would use the opportunity created by Business Transformation Release 5 (“BT 5”) to update the Act and modernise the UCM regime. BT 5 is the final step in the modernisation of IR’s computer systems. The proposals which address the issues noted above by making the following changes to the administration of the UCM Act: • The definition of unclaimed money could be refined to ensure it is wide enough to deal with new financial products such as cash-PIEs and to make the definition clearer. • The “qualifying” or “deeming” period which must elapse before money is deemed unclaimed could be reduced from six or 25 years (depending on the UCM category) to five years for all UCM categories. (This would not, however, encompass deposits made for a term of five years or more, as the “deeming period” would not begin until the deposit reached maturity). • The definition of unclaimed money should be amended to allow new forms of activity on an account (e.g. online activity) to prevent an amount of money being deemed UCM. • UCM holders could in limited circumstances (e.g. where a service provider seeks to refund money to a former client who cannot be located as part of a Review of Unclaimed Money Act | 7 2r4hxlcklw 2020-06-17 12:56:45 IN CONFIDENCE remediation process), be permitted to transfer money to Inland Revenue before the requisite period for deeming unclaimed money has elapsed. • UCM could be able to be transferred to Inland Revenue immediately upon being classified as unclaimed money, provided that reasonable efforts have been made to contact the UCM owner over the intervening period. Where reasonable efforts have not been made to contact the owner, the UCM holder should retain the funds for an additional three-month period during which the holder must seek to contact the UCM owner before transferring the UCM to IR. • The requirement for UCM holders to maintain a physical register of UCM at their head office or place of business could be removed. As UCM could be paid to IR immediately upon qualifying as such, record keeping requirements could be limited to retention of a record evidencing the transfer of the UCM to IR, for seven years. • The requirement for UCM holders to provide occupation information could be removed. Instead, UCM holders should provide IR with other identifying information (e.g., IRD numbers, date of birth and contact details) where collected in the ordinary course of their business (IR would still accept occupation information if available and provided, however). • The UCM threshold should be retained where it is presently (i.e., $100), while also giving the Commissioner the discretion to accept smaller amounts if necessary. • A 60-year time bar on a prospective claimant’s ability to claim UCM would be introduced. A prospective claimant would have 60 years within which to claim money to which they are entitled from IR. This will allow the Crown to gradually remove 1 its contingent liability for UCM at the end of a sufficiently long period to enable claimants to access those funds. As mentioned above, this a judgment that the probably of an owner claiming UCM becomes extremely remote. Retaining UCM as a contingent liability on the Crown’s accounts indefinitely is impractical Compared to the status quo the introduction of time bar removes a property right in that if the money is not claimed within the 60 year period, it will become the Crown’s money. • The Unclaimed Money Act 1971 would be listed within Schedule 1 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in order to define it as an “Inland Revenue” Act. The application of Parts 4A (Disputes), 7 (Penalties) and 8 (Interest) of the Tax Administration Act would be excluded as they are not applicable to UCM. This would allow IR to use its existing tax data to more efficiently match owners of UCM with their money. It is not intended that UCM be permitted to offset tax debts. • It could be clarified that the Act does not apply to unclaimed money covered by the Public Finance Act 1989. This is in order to remove any confusion created by the UCM regime for organisations such as the Public Trust, which operate under the Public Finance Act 1989. While money covered by the Public Finance Act 1989 does not fall within jurisdiction of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971, there is potential for UCM holders to be confused as to which regime applies to the UCM which they hold. 1 This time bar would apply only to UCM after the application of the new rules so the time bar would never apply to existing UCM. As a consequence the contingent liability for existing UCM would never be removed unless the money was claimed. Review of Unclaimed Money Act | 8 2r4hxlcklw 2020-06-17 12:56:45 IN CONFIDENCE • UCM holders could be required to provide information and UCM to Inland Revenue electronically and in a standard format. Administration: the option proposed above would increase administrative efficiency and reduce administrative costs. Compliance: the changes above would reduce ongoing compliance costs for holders of UCM overall. However, the requirement to provide information to IR in a standard format may result in an increase in upfront compliance costs for some holders of UCM to comply with the new requirements, although this should be mitigated through ongoing consultation and dialogue with stakeholders in the legislative design process. Equity: the additional information received from accounts holders and new ability to use existing tax data will assist IR in matching owners of UCM with their money, and more rapidly than is presently the case. Sustainability: This option enhances the current UCM administrative settings. Implementing all the above changes as a “package” would maximise efficiency and compliance cost reduction. This approach is compatible with the Government’s Expectations for the design of regulatory systems. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Option Two is officials’ preferred option. This option addresses the issues outlined in section 2.1 above by updating the UCM Act to take advantage of technological developments in data storage and transmission. It reduces compliance costs for UCM holders by removing many outdated administrative requirements and allows for the faster transfer of money to IR. It also reduces administrative costs for IR by allowing it to use existing tax data to match owners of UCM with their money. In this way, owners of UCM are more likely to be reunited with their money, and more quickly. Review of Unclaimed Money Act | 9 2r4hxlcklw 2020-06-17 12:56:45 IN CONFIDENCE Section 4: Impact Analysis (Proposed approach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg, ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg, compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value where appropriate, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non-monetised impacts Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (holders of UCM) Minor costs in form of UCM holders being required to update their systems in order to account for changes to the existing UCM regime. There may also be some small costs for UCM holders in being required to supply information in a standard format. Officials will continue to consult with stakeholders in order to keep these costs to a minimum and ensure that stakeholders have sufficient time to upgrade their systems. Low Regulators (Inland Revenue) IR will bear some cost in amending its systems to incorporate the changes required by the proposals These system changes and the associated cost will be undertaken as part of Inland Revenue’s BT release 5 deployment and will not require additional funding. Low/Med Wider government None None Other parties None None Total Monetised Cost None Non-monetised costs Low Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Compliance cost savings for UCM holders who are who will no longer be required to conform to a range of outdated regulatory requirements. Low/Med Regulators (Inland Revenue) Cost savings arising from operating a simplified regime. Low Wider government None None UCM Owners Compliance cost savings for owners of UCM who will have an increased chance of being reunited with their money, and of receiving it more rapidly. Med Review of Unclaimed Money Act | 10 2r4hxlcklw 2020-06-17 12:56:45 IN CONFIDENCE Total Monetised Benefit None None Non-monetised benefits Reduced compliance costs for UCM holders and administrative benefits for Inland Revenue. Med 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? While the purpose of the change is to improve the efficiency of Inland Revenue’s administration and reduce compliance costs for holders and claimants, there is a risk that deposit takers may not prioritise efforts to reunite monies with beneficial owners by instead relying on Inland Revenue to fulfil the role of the Act. Officials consider this risk is low as industry regulations on deposit takers generally impose certain duties and obligations in respect of taking that deposit. Review of Unclaimed Money Act | 11 2r4hxlcklw 2020-06-17 12:56:45 IN CONFIDENCE Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Consultation with stakeholders occurred following the release of IR’s consultation document Unclaimed money: A tax policy consultation document on the public tax policy website in January 2020. Officials either met with (or received submissions from) 16 individuals, organisations or businesses. These included Business New Zealand, the New Zealand Law Society, the New Zealand Bankers’ Association and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. Stakeholders were generally supportive of the proposals, but eage r for consultation to continue on matters that could present compliance costs (e.g. movement toward a new definition of UCM and standard format for the supply of information, etc). Stakeholders also sought sufficient time to allow them to transition their systems to the new regime. Some minor changes to the proposals have occurred following consultation. These include: • Clarifying that the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 will not apply to money covered by the Public Finance Act 1989; • formalising IR’s ability to accept smaller amounts of money (which fall below the current, $100 threshold); and • allowing UCM holders to, in limited circumstances, transfer money to IR before it becomes UCM. These changes have been developed in response to information gathered in the course of consultation. Review of Unclaimed Money Act | 12 2r4hxlcklw 2020-06-17 12:56:45 IN CONFIDENCE Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? It is intended that the preferred option be included as a Supplementary Order Paper (“SOP”) to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill (“Bill”). The SOP would be referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee for their consideration and calling of submissions on the proposed law changes, if the Committee so decides. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the operation of this preferred option, which will form part of its business as usual function. It is proposed that compliance with legislative reforms become compulsory two years after the enactment of the Bill. However, the Bill will provide for a transitional period to allow UCM holders to transition to the new rules. This transition period is necessary to allow stakeholders sufficient time to incorporate the necessary changes into their systems and gradually account for UCM where the time period reduces through the changes noted above. Review of Unclaimed Money Act | 13 2r4hxlcklw 2020-06-17 12:56:45 IN CONFIDENCE Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue would monitor the effectiveness of the proposed reforms to the UCM legislation on an ongoing basis. In the event IR should identify any issues in the operation of the new regime, IR would undertake a review of the legislation in order to assess whether further amendments or reforms may be required. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? Officials will be kept appraised of operational developments as they arise by the IR team responsible for operating the UCM regime and for liaising with UCM claimants. Officials will also maintain contact with the IR team responsible for implementing the systems changes necessary as part of BT5, who will also keep officials updated of developments.

IN-CONFIDENCE Office of the Minister of Revenue Office of the Minister for Regional Economic Development Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee PROVINCIAL GROWTH FUND LIMITED: ORDERS IN COUNCIL Proposal 1This paper seeks the Committee’s authorisation to submit the attached Orders in Council to the Executive Council to: 1.1 add Provincial Growth Fund Limited (PGFL) to Schedule 4A of the Public Finance Act 1989 (PFA) and; 1.2 add PGFL to the list of public purpose Crown-controlled companies in Schedule 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Background 2On 10 April 2019, the Cabinet Economic Development Committee agreed to establish PGFL as a Schedule 4A company under the PFA \[DEV-19-MIN-0084\]. PGFL is being established as an asset holding company to hold loan and equity investments made through the Provincial Growth Fund (PGF). 3Establishing PGFL as a Schedule 4A company was considered the most appropriate form of Crown entity to provide the necessary structure and flexibility to best manage loan and equity investments beyond the life of the PGF. 4The purpose of PGFL will be to: 4.1 act solely as the nominated legal entity for taking assignment of PGF debt and equity investments; 4.2 act at all times in accordance with its constitution and its management agreement with the Provincial Development Unit (PDU) in relation to any matter relating to those investments; 4.3 subject to compliance with the Companies Act 1993, distribute the receipts or proceeds of any PGF investments to Shareholding Ministers, as agents of the Crown, unless otherwise agreed between PGFL, the PDU and Shareholding Ministers. 5PGFL will have no operational role in the day-to-day management and administration of PGF investments. PGFL will outsource these functions to the PDU through a management agreement. Decision making responsibilities on PGF investments will remain unchanged. 1 4wfdz76cs6 2019-09-30 08:45:00 6Existing investments are currently being managed by the PDU, and will be novated or transferred to PGFL once it is established and operational. Thereafter, new investments will be novated to PGFL once executed. 7On 1 July 2019, Cabinet noted the appointment of Mr Rodger Finlay (as Chair of the Board), Mr Neville Harris QSO and Mr Graeme Mitchell as directors of PGFL \[CAB- 19-MIN-0320.01\]. PGFL directors commenced their three year term on 1 August 2019. 8On 3 September 2019, PGFL was incorporated with the Companies Office with the Minister of Finance and Minister for Regional Economic Development, on behalf of the Crown, each holding 50% of the issued ordinary shares in the capital of the company. 9The authorisation of the attached Orders in Council is now required to implement PGFL’s addition to Schedule 4A of the Public Finance Act 1989 and Schedule 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Such authorisation does not require any new policy decisions to be made. Public Finance (Provincial Growth Fund Limited) Order 2019 10This Order in Council will add PGFL to Schedule 4A of the PFA and apply certain financial power restrictions on PGFL under section 161 to 165 of the Crown Entities Act 2004. This Order will place restrictions on PGFL to borrow (section 162) and use derivatives (section 164) while restrictions on acquiring financial products (section 161) and giving guarantees and indemnities (section 163), and requirements to pay net surplus to the Crown (section 165) will not apply. 11Applying only some of the restrictions to PGFL will provide flexibility and avoid any potential issues that would prevent PGFL from carrying out activities aligned with the company’s intended role and purpose such as holding loan agreements. Regardless of the form and structure of the investment, PGFL will only be accepting and holding investments once they have proceeded through the standard PGF approval process. 12Schedule 4A companies must comply with certain provisions of the Crown Entities Act 2004, as set out in section 45OA of the PFA. These provisions include obligations to provide information to shareholding Ministers, to prepare a statement of intent, to be a good employer, to give effect to directions to support a whole of government approach, and reporting obligations. The provisions of the Official Information Act 1982 and the Ombudsmen Act 1975 will also apply to PGFL. 13The PFA provides that the Governor General by Order in Council, made on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, may amend Schedule 4A of the PFA to add the name of a company that meets the following criteria: 13.1 Ministers of the Crown hold, on behalf of the Crown, more than 50% of the issued ordinary shares in the capital of the company; and 13.2 shares in the company are not listed on a registered market (within the meaning of the Securities Markets Act 1988); and 2 4wfdz76cs6 2019-09-30 08:45:00 13.3 the company is not a Crown entity or a State enterprise named in Schedule 1 of the State-Owned Enterprises Act 1986. 14These requirements have been met. PGFL was incorporated under the Companies Act 1993 on 3 September 2019, with the Minister of Finance and Minister for Regional Economic Development, on behalf of the Crown, each holding 50% of the issued ordinary shares in the capital of the company. Income Tax (Provincial Growth Fund Limited) Order 2019 15The Income Tax Act 2007 authorises the Governor General by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue to add the name of a company to the list of public purpose Crown-controlled companies in Schedule 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 16The Minister of Revenue has agreed that PGFL should be added to Schedule 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007 on the basis that it meets the following criteria outlined in that Act: 16.1 the company is listed in Schedule 4A or it is a subsidiary of a company listed in Schedule 4A; 16.2 Ministers of the Crown hold, on behalf of the Crown, more than 50% of the voting interests in the company; 16.3 all other voting interests, if any, in the company are held by local authorities; and 16.4 the company’s primary purpose is the carrying out of a public policy objective of the Government of New Zealand. 17The first criterion will have been met by the time the Income Tax (PGFL) Order 2019 is made, as the Public Finance (PGFL) Order 2019 would have inserted PGFL into Schedule 4A of the PFA. 18The other criteria have already been met, the Minister of Finance and Minister for Regional Economic Development each hold, on behalf of the Crown, 50% of the voting shares in PGFL, and the company has the primary purpose of investing in regional economic development in New Zealand, a public policy objective of the Government. 19The effect of PGFL’s addition to the list of public purpose Crown-controlled companies in Schedule 35 is that the company will be exempt from income tax, better enabled to claim back the goods and services tax paid on its purchases, and be eligible for a resident withholding tax exemption certificate. Timing and 28-day rule 20A waiver of the 28 day rule is sought. The proposals outlined have little or no impact on the public. The Orders will be adding PGFL to Schedule 4A of the PFA and Schedule 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007. PGFL itself will play a limited role in managing the investments that have already been approved through the PGF. 3 4wfdz76cs6 2019-09-30 08:45:00 21A waiver will allow PGFL to be established and operational as soon as possible for investments to be novated to the company. Compliance 22The Orders comply with or have no implications for: 22.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 22.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993; 22.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 22.4 relevant international standards and obligations; 22.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Regulations Review Committee 23There are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Orders to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 24The Orders have been certified by Parliamentary Counsel as being in order for submission to Cabinet, subject to a waiver of the 28-day rule. 25Further, they are certified on the basis that the Public Finance (PGFL) Order 2019, which inserts PGFL into Schedule 4A of the PFA, is made (signed) first. This is necessary because one of the criteria for the making of the Income Tax (PGFL) Order 2019 is that PGFL is listed in Schedule 4A. Regulatory Impact Analysis 26A Regulatory Impact Statement is not required for the proposals in this paper. Publicity 27The Orders will be notified in the New Zealand Gazette. Proactive release 28We plan to proactively release this Cabinet paper without redaction, once the Orders in Council have been gazetted. Consultation 29The following agencies have been consulted on this paper: Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Treasury, and State Services Commission. 4 4wfdz76cs6 2019-09-30 08:45:00 Recommendations We recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1note that on 10 April 2018 the Cabinet Economic Development Committee agreed to establish PGFL as a Schedule 4A company under the Public Finance Act 1989 \[DEV-19-MIN-0084\]; 2note that the Public Finance (Provincial Growth Fund Limited) Order 2019 gives effect to the decision referred to in paragraph 1 above; 3note the Minister of Finance has agreed to recommend that Provincial Growth Fund Limited be added to Schedule 4A of the Public Finance Act 1989; 4note that Schedule 4A companies must comply with certain provisions of the Crown Entities Act 2004, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Ombudsmen Act 1975; 5authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Public Finance (Provincial Growth Fund Limited) Order 2019 adding Provincial Growth Fund Limited to Schedule 4A of the Public Finance Act 1989 and applying sections 162 and 164 of the Crown Entities Act 2004 to Provincial Growth Fund Limited; 6note that on 21 August 2019 the Minister of Revenue agreed that Provincial Growth Fund Limited should be added to Schedule 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007; 7note that the Income Tax (Provincial Growth Fund Limited) Order 2019 gives effect to the decision referred to in paragraph 6; 8authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Income Tax (Provincial Growth Fund Limited) Order 2019 adding Provincial Growth Fund Limited into Schedule 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007; 9note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought: 9.1 so that the Orders can come into force as soon as possible; 9.2 on the grounds that the Orders have little or no effect on the public. 10agree to waive the 28-day rule so that the regulations can come to force on the day after the date of their notification in the Gazette.

If you agree with the proposed change, the Parliamentary Counsel Office will be instructed to draft the necessary regulations and officials will provide these to you before consideration by Cabinet.

Ref erred Marai na Hak Policy Lead Policy and Strategy Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue 24/10/2019 In Confidence IR2019/577: Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2020 Page 4 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE Background 7.The student loan repayment threshold determines the level of income at which a New Zealand-based borrower is required to begin making repayments towards their outstanding student loan balance. The threshold is a mechanism to limit the chance that a low-income borrower is in financial hardship as a consequence of their student loan repayment obligations. 8.New Zealand-based borrowers are required to repay 12 cents on each dollar earned above the prescribed repayment threshold and are not required to make repayments if their income is under the threshold. 9.The repayment threshold is prescribed by regulation through Order in Council and is currently adjusted annually to ensure that price increases do not diminish the real value of income someone can earn before they are required to begin repaying their loan balance. 10.The Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2018 prescribed the annual repayment threshold for the 2019/20 tax year at $19,760 ($380 per week). This was an increase from $19,448 and reflected a 1.59% movement in the CPI-ex tobacco index for the year ended September 2018. Process for calculating the threshold adjustment 11.In 2016 it was agreed that the student loan repayment threshold for 2018/19 and subsequent years be calculated with regards to the consumer price index-all groups excluding cigarettes and other tobacco products in the year to 30 September and rounded up to the next multiple of $52.00 \[CAB-16-MIN-0655 refers\]. 12.Adjustments in line with the rate of CPI-ex tobacco ensure that increases to prices do not change the real value of the threshold. Without these adjustments, inflation over time could result in the repayment threshold maintaining the same dollar amount but being worth less in real terms, requiring borrowers to make repayments from a relatively lower amount of income. 13.Officials recommend that annual adjustments continue to be made with reference to the CPI-ex tobacco index, consistent with inflation adjustments made to other forms of social assistance. 14.Rounding the threshold amount to the nearest multiple of $52 makes it easier for employers and borrowers to work out the amount of weekly income at which compulsory repayments commence. Proposed threshold for 2020/21 tax year 15.The value of CPI-ex tobacco for 30 September 2019 is 1035. Applying this value to the method of calculation (outlined in Annex 1) produces a new annual threshold of $20,020 or $385 per week. 16.We therefore propose that you set the annual repayment threshold for the 2019/20 tax to $20,020 ($385 per week). 17.As a result of this adjustment, New Zealanders will be able to retain an additional $5 of income per week ($260 per year) before borrowers are required to make repayments. In Confidence IR2019/577: Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2020 Page 5 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE Regulations to be made by Order in Council 18.If you agree to the proposed adjustment to the threshold from 1 April 2020, we propose that you authorise the issue of drafting instructions to the Parliamentary Counsel Office for making regulations under section 215(a) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 to set the student loan repayment threshold for the 2020/21 tax year at $20,020. 19.The Order in Council should ideally be made prior to the end of the 2019 calendar year to provide sufficient time for payroll providers to build the new threshold amount into payroll specifications in time for the 1 April 2020 application date. Indicative financial implications 20.There are no funding implications associated with adjusting the repayment threshold for 2020/21 using the current methodology as funding changes were agreed to by the previous government for 2018/19 and out-years on 5 December 2016 \[CAB-16-MIN-0655 refers\]. Administrative and system implications 21.Threshold adjustments need to be built into payroll specifications for the relevant tax year. Inland Revenue issue a number of draft specifications to allow payroll users to gauge the impacts of payroll changes well in advance of their application. These specifications are normally finalised in November before being published in December to apply for the following tax year. Proactive release considerations 22.Officials recommend that this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers should be proactively released without redaction within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Next steps 23.If you agree to officials’ recommended adjustment to the student loan repayment threshold for the 2020/21 tax year, the Parliamentary Counsel Office will be instructed to draft the necessary regulations and officials will provide these to you prior to the Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting on 3 December. 24.A draft Cabinet paper has been attached for your approval for submission to the Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting on 3 December. 25.Speaking notes have been prepared and are attached for you to take to the Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting on 3 December. In Confidence IR2019/577: Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2020 Page 6 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE Appendix Appendix 1 Method Application for 1 April 2020 The formula to calculate the student loan repayment threshold for the 2020/21 tax year is: Tnew = Ru (19084 x CPIexcl2 / 986.6778) Whe re: Tnew is t he new threshold to be effective from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 Ru() is a function which rounds its argument up to the next multiple of 52. CPIexcl2 is the value of the Consumer Price Index excluding cigarettes and tobacco products for 30 September Y-1. 19084 is the unrounded repayment threshold for the year ended 31 March 2017. And 986.6778 is the All groups less cigarettes and tobacco subgroup (series SE9NS14800) for September 2015. CPIexcl2 = 1035 (index for September 2019) Tne w = Ru (19084 x CPIexcl2 / 986.6778) Ru (19084 x 1035 / 986.6778) Ru (19084 x 1.04897 ) Ru ($20,018.63) Tne w = $20,020 ($385 per week) Pro posed new threshold for the 2019/20 tax year is $20,020 ($385 per week). In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee STUDENT LOAN SCHEME (REPAYMENT THRESHOLD) REGULATIONS 2019 Proposal 1.I propose that the Cabinet Legislation Committee authorise the submission to the Executi ve Council of the attached Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2019 (the Regulations). The Regulations increase the income threshold at which New Zealand-based student loan borrowers must begin to repay their student loan, from $19,760 to $20,020, for the tax year beginning 1 April 2020. Policy 2.Section 215(a) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 allows the Governor-General to ma ke regulations setting the annual repayment threshold, or a means by which it may be calculated or ascertained via Order in Council. 3.The student loan repayment threshold is a mechanism to limit the likelihood that a low-income borrower is in financial hardship as a consequence of their student loan repayment obligations. The threshold amount is adjusted so that inflation over time does not force borrowers to begin making repayments from a relatively lower amount of real income. 4.The method for annually adjusting the student loan repayment threshold is to use the Sept e mber quarter annual consumers price index-all groups excluding cigarettes and other tobacco products (CPI-ex tobacco) as the basis for adjustment for the following tax year. This approach was agreed to in 2016 \[CAB-16-MIN-0655 refers\]. 5.I propose to increase the annual student loan repayment threshold from $19,760 ($380 per week) to $20,020 ($385 per week) for the tax year beginning 1 April 2020. This increase was calculated using the September 2019 quarter CPI-ex tobacco value of 1035, as published by Statistics New Zealand. 6.This adjustment would allow New Zealand-based borrowers to retain an additional $5 of income per week ($260 per year) before they are required to begin making repayments on their outstanding student loan balance. Financial implications 7.There will be no financial implications associated with increasing the student loan repaym ent threshold to the proposed new amount as funding was agreed to for 2018/19 and out years in 2016 \[CAB-16-MIN-0655 refers\]. Administrative implications 8.Threshold adjustments need to be built into payroll specifications for the relevant tax year. Inland Revenue issues a number of draft specifications to allow payroll users to 1 9m5hl7xpqb 2020-01-21 13:36:01 IN CONFIDENCE 2. gauge the impacts of payroll changes well in advance of their application. These specifications are normally finalised in November before being published in December to apply for the following tax year. Impact analysis 9.The Treasury’s Regulatory Quality Team has determined that the proposal is exempt from the Regulatory Impact Analysis requirements on the basis that it has no or only minor impacts on businesses, individuals or not-for-profit entities. Consultation 10.Inland Revenue has consulted with the Ministry of Education on the proposal to in crease the repayment threshold for the 2020/21 tax year. Timing and 28-day rule 11.A waiver of the 28-day rule is not required as the Regulations are not proposed to come into force until 1 April 2020 and will apply for the 2020/21 tax year. Publicity 12.Inland Revenue will publish information about the new threshold and its impact in the stu dent loan section of its website. The Minister of Education and I will also issue a joint press release prior to the proactive release of this Cabinet paper and associated documents. 13.Inland Revenue will publish an article about this change in its Ta x Information Bulletin. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 14.The Regulations have been certified by the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) as being in order for submission to Cabinet. Regulations Review Committee 15.Officials consider that as the adjustment is of a minor and routine nature, it is un necessary to refer the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2019 to the House of Representatives under Standing Order 319. Compliance 16.The regulations comply with: 16.1 The principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 16.2 The rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993; 16.3 The principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; and 16.4 Relevant international standards and obligations. Proactive release 17.I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key ad vice papers in part, in line with the provisions of the Official Information Act 1982, within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. 2 9m5hl7xpqb 2020-01-21 13:36:01 IN CONFIDENCE Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: a)note that on 5 December 2016 the Cabinet Legislation Committee agreed to the methodology for calculating the student loan repayment threshold and funding changes for 2018/19 and out-years \[Cab-16-MIN-0655\]. b)note that an Order in Council is required under section 215(a) of the Student Loan Sch eme Act 2011 to set the student loan income repayment threshold. c)note that the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2019 will i ncrease the student loan repayment threshold to $20,020 for the 2020/21 tax year. d)authorise th e submission to the Executive Council of the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2019. e)note that the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2019 will co me into force on 1 April 2020.

Hon Stuart Nash, Minister of Revenue Information Release Tax Administration (Direct Credit of Refunds of Excess Financial Support and Student Loan Payments) Order 2020 July 2020 Availability This information release is available on Inland Revenue’s Tax Policy website at https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2020-ir-c ab-leg-20-sub-0027/overview Documents in this information release 1.LEG-20-SUB-0027 – Cabinet paper: Tax Administration (Direct Credit of Refunds of Excess Financial Support and Student Loan Payments) Order 2020 (3 March 2020) 2.LEG-20-MIN-0027 – Minute: Tax Administration (Direct Credit of Refunds of Excess Financial Support and Student Loan Payments) Order 2020 (3 March 2020) Additional information The Cabinet paper was considered by the Cabinet Legislation Committee on 3 March 2020 and confirmed by Cabinet on 9 March 2020. One attachment to the Cabinet paper is not included in this information release as it is publicly available: •Tax Administration (Direct Credit of Refunds of Excess Financial Support and Student Loan Payments) Order 2020 Information withheld No information was withheld for this information release. Copyright and licensing Cabinet material and advice to Ministers from the Inland Revenue Department and other agencies are © Crown copyright but are licensed for re-use under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ ). In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee TAX ADMINISTRATION (DIRECT CREDIT OF REFUNDS OF EXCESS FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS) ORDER 2020 Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit an Order i n Council making Tax Administration (Direct Credit of Refunds of Excess Financial Support and Student Loan Payments) Order 2020 to the Executive Council. 2.It is proposed that the Order in Council applies to the refunds of financial support 1 and student loan deductions be made by direct credit from 9 April 2020. Direct credit of refunds 3.I recommend that refunds of financial support and student loan payments be made b y direct credit from April 2020. Refunds will be made by direct credit unless it would result in undue hardship or is not practicable (for example, if the bank account is overseas and it is not possible to direct credit). This proposal aligns with the movement of the administration of financial support and student loans deductions by employers to the new technology platform in the next release planned for April 2020. 4.The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for progressive implementation of ma ndatory direct crediting of refunds by Order in Council. It was enacted with effect of 1 April 2000 to benefit taxpayers by eliminating time delays associated with the postal system and costs related to the banking of cheques. Inland Revenue would also benefit from reduced administration costs. The provision also allows for exemptions when direct crediting would cause undue hardship or is impracticable. 5.Progressive implementation for the various tax types through Orders in Council was t o allow Inland Revenue the necessary flexibility to determine the dates when direct crediting of refunds relating to different tax types could best be implemented in terms of system readiness. It was also to give taxpayers time to provide Inland Revenue with up to-date bank account details and taxpayers with complex business activities more time to plan and adapt their processes. The intent was that the Commissioner would eventually be required to direct credit all refunds into taxpayers’ bank accounts. 6.Compulsory direct crediting of refunds has been implemented for gaming machine d uty, income tax, and goods and services tax as part of moving the administration to Inland Revenue’s new technology platform. 1 Meaning child support and domestic maintenance as defined in the Child Support Act 1991. 1 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-02-27 15:55:59 IN CONFIDENCE 1. Timing and 28-day rule 7. I propose that direct crediting of refunds for financial support and student loan deductions under section 184A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies to refunds made from 9 April 2020. The Order would therefore be in accordance with the rule that regulations must not come into force until at least 28 days after they have been notified in the New Zealand Gazette. Compliance 8. The Order complies with: 8.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 8.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 8.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 8.4 relevant international standards and obligations; and 8.5 the Legislation Guidelines, which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. 9. No statutory prerequisite exists for making this Order. Regulations Review Committee 10. There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 11. The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the Order in Council is in order for submission to Cabinet. Impact Analysis 12. The Regulatory Quality Team at the Treasury has determined that the regulatory decisions sought in this paper are exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Assessment as they have no or minor impacts on businesses, individuals or not for profit entities. Publicity 13. The new Order in Council will be published in the New Zealand Gazette and on Inland Revenue’s website. Inland Revenue will also publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. 2 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-02-27 15:55:59 IN CONFIDENCE Proactive Release 14. I propose to release this Cabinet paper, and associated Order in Council, in full shortly following the publication of the signed Order in Council in the New Zealand Gazette. Consultation 15. The Treasury has been informed in the preparation of this paper and the Parliamentary Counsel Office have been consulted in the preparation of this paper. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1. agree that Inland Revenue should issue refunds of excess financial support and student loan deductions be made by direct credit, unless that would result in undue hardship or is not practicable; 2. note that the Tax Administration (Direct Credit of Refunds of Excess Financial Support and Student Loan Payments) Order 2020 will give effect to the decision referred to in paragraph 1 above; 3. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (Direct Credit of Refunds of Excess Financial Support and Student Loan Payments) Order 2020.

The Bill will implement the policy items listed below. These are made up of policy items that require Cabinet approval, policy items that already have Cabinet approval, and items that have been approved by me in my capacity as the Minister of Revenue (in the appendix of this paper). A Bill is necessary as amendments to existing legislation are required to implement the proposals. Policy Proposals Requiring Cabinet Approval Setting the Annual Rates for Income Tax for the 2020–21 Tax Year 6. The Income Tax Act 2007 requires the rates of income tax to be set each tax year by an annual taxing Act. 7. It is proposed that this Bill set the annual rates of income tax for the 2020–21 tax year at the same rates currently specified in part A of schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 for the 2019–20 tax year (that is, confirm that the current rates remain unchanged). Policy Items with Cabinet Approval Measures to Reform the Tax Deductibility of Feasibility and Innovation Expenditure \[DEV-19-MIN-0255 (18 September 2019) and CAB-19-MIN-0491 (23 September 2019)\] 8. The Bill proposes to provide greater deductibility of feasibility and other currently non- deductible expenditure to encourage business innovation and investment. This measure has been developed with a view to supporting business growth and innovation, while also maintaining the integrity of the tax system. This proposal is one of a number of tax measures the Government is implementing to support its Economic Strategy. 9. The proposals would: 9.1 Allow taxpayers to deduct (spread over five years) expenditure incurred to investigate whether to invest in a new asset, process or business model (commonly known as feasibility expenditure) that is subsequently abandoned, in circumstances where the expenditure is otherwise not deductible. 9.2 Reduce complexity and compliance costs by allowing taxpayers an immediate deduction of feasibility expenditure, if in a year that expenditure, in total, amounted to $10,000 or less. 9.3 Ensure integrity of the new rules, by requiring deductions previously claimed for abandoned or impaired assets that are subsequently reinstated to be reversed in the year of reinstatement, with that asset now being depreciable. 9.4 Remove tax barriers for businesses to invest in innovation, new assets and business expansion. 9.5 Respond to recommendations of the Tax Working Group and have long- standing support within the business community. 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:10:40 3 Purchase Price Allocation Issues Paper \[DEV-19-MIN-0336 (4 December 2019) and CAB-19-MIN-0652 (9 December 2019); DEV-20-MIN-0042 (18 March 2020) and CAB-20-MIN-0120 (23 March 2020)\] 10. The Minister of Finance and I were delegated authority to make final policy decisions following consultation on the measures in this issues paper. We informed Cabinet of our decisions in March this year. The Bill proposes amendments to the rules governing how parties to the sale of two or more assets with different tax treatments (a ‘mixed supply’) allocate the total sale/purchase price between the various assets, for tax purposes. The objective of the amendments is to prevent an overall revenue loss when sellers and buyers adopt different price allocations that minimise their own tax liabilities. 11. The Bill includes the following requirements: 11.1 If the parties agree an allocation, they must follow it in their tax returns. 11.2 If the parties cannot agree an allocation, the seller determines the allocation, and notifies both the buyer and Inland Revenue within two months of the change in ownership of the assets. However, the seller must allocate amounts to taxable property (depreciable property, revenue account property, financial arrangements) such that there is no further loss on the sale of that property. 11.3 If the seller does not make an allocation within the two-month timeframe, the buyer must determine the allocation, and notify both the seller and Inland Revenue of it. 11.4 Inland Revenue may challenge an allocation if it believes the allocation does not reflect market values. 11.5 The purchase price allocation rules will not apply to a transaction if the total purchase price is less than $1 million, or the buyer’s total allocation to taxable property is less than $100,000. 12. The amendments will apply to sales agreements entered into on or after 1 April 2021. Amendments to the Tax Rules for Land \[DEV-19-MIN-0352 (11 December 2019) and CAB-19-MIN-0675 (16 December 2019)\] 13. The Bill proposes a number of amendments to the tax rules for land. 14. The amendments are a result of the on-going review of the taxation of land, particularly in relation to investment property and speculators, land banking, and vacant land. The objective of this review is to improve the efficient use of land, and ensure that the current tax settings are fair, balanced, and support productive investment. 15. The proposals relate to: 15.1 Clarifying that the cost of purchasing and improving taxable land are deductible, even if it was not clear when the costs were incurred that the sale of the land would be taxable. The policy is that these costs should be deductible in full when taxable land is sold. This includes land sales that are subject to the bright-line test. 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:10:40 4 15.2 Responding to concerns that the rules that apply to habitual buyers and sellers of land are not working as intended. Currently, there are tax exemptions for taxpayers who sell their home or business premises. However, these exemptions are subject to restrictions on taxpayers that have a regular pattern of buying and selling their home or business premises (known as the regular pattern restrictions). The current regular pattern restrictions are too narrow resulting in some habitual buyers and sellers structuring their way around these restrictions to avoid tax. To address these issues, it is proposed to extend the regular pattern restriction rules: 15.2.1 To apply to a group of persons that undertake buying and selling activities together, rather than allowing associated persons and entities to undertake different transactions in a way that currently does not constitute a regular pattern. 15.2.2 To apply to a group of transactions that have a similarity or likeness between them (that is, a pattern of buying land, building a home and then selling the completed property). This will involve shifting the focus away from similarities in what is done with the land and instead having a stronger focus on the regularity of particular transactions. 15.3 Confirming the amendments to the regular pattern restrictions will be limited to land that is acquired with the intention of disposal. This will prevent any unintended overreach by ensuring the amendments do not apply to land that genuinely was a person’s home or business premises. 15.4 Making it easier to update the content of the Land Transfer Tax Statement by moving the Land Transfer Tax Statement from the Land Transfer Act 2017 to regulations. This amendment will make it easier to amend the Land Transfer Tax Statements in the future. This could include situations where potential changes are required to incorporate new technology and consequently reduce compliance costs for property transfers. Income Tax Treatment of Leases Subject to New Zealand International Financial Reporting Standard 16 \[DEV-19-MIN-0299 (13 November 2019) and CAB-19-MIN-0593 (18 November 2019)\] 16. The Bill proposes to allow taxpayers who apply New Zealand International Financial Reporting Standard 16 Leases (NZ IFRS 16) to more closely align their tax treatment with their accounting treatment for certain operating leases. 17. The introduction of NZ IFRS 16 (from 1 January 2019) provides an opportunity to more closely align the tax and accounting treatment of operating leases. The changes will reduce compliance costs, and the likelihood of potential inadvertent errors as taxpayers would not be required, to the same extent, to reverse certain accounting expenditure and complete a separate tax deduction. 18. The Bill proposes to: 18.1 Allow taxpayers to elect to follow their NZ IFRS 16 accounting treatment when calculating income tax deductions on operating leases other than real (for example, land and buildings) property. 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:10:40 5 18.2 Require certain exclusions and adjustments (rather than complete alignment) to ensure taxpayers that choose this proposed method do not obtain a significant tax timing advantage, compared to taxpayer to continue to use the existing rules. Mycoplasma Bovis Tax Issue \[DEV-20-MIN-0045 (18 March 2020) and CAB-20-MIN-0120 (23 March 2020)\] 19. The Bill proposes to allow dairy and beef cattle farmers that have derived unexpected taxable income as a result of their herd being culled (in pursuit of eradicating mycoplasma bovis from New Zealand), to evenly spread that income forward over six years. This will allow the taxable income to better match the replacement cost of the farmer’s cattle herd. 20. This amendment supports a core principle of the Biosecurity Act 1993, that no person should be any better or worse off because of the Crown’s use of its powers under that Act to eradicate an organism. 21. The Bill proposes the amendment will apply retrospectively from the 2017–18 income year as the first culls began in late 2017. Standard tax rules would continue to apply to the farmers’ other income. It is anticipated that up to 50 farmers could be impacted by this proposal. Goods and Services Tax on Outbound Roaming Charges \[DEV-19-MIN-0315 (20 November 2019) and CAB-19-MIN-620 (25 November 2019)\] 22. The Bill proposes to apply GST to outbound roaming services, at the standard rate of 15%. Outbound roaming services are the telecommunications services provided to New Zealand registered mobile phones, when the mobile phone is in use overseas. 23. Applying GST to outbound mobile roaming services is consistent with New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) international VAT/GST guidelines. 24. The Bill proposes to: 24.1 Apply GST to outbound roaming services received by a person with a New Zealand registered mobile device while they are travelling overseas. Conversely, inbound roaming services received by a non-resident while in New Zealand will not be subject to GST. 24.2 Apply from 1 April 2022 to give sufficient time for telecommunications suppliers to amend their customer billing systems. Goods and Services Tax on Credit Notes \[DEV-19-MIN-0315 (20 November 2019) and CAB-19-MIN-620 (25 November 2019)\] 25. The Bill proposes to amend the GST credit note rules to ensure the rules remain flexible and fair. 26. Credit notes are issued when the price of a good or service is reduced after a tax invoice has been issued, for example if a refund is provided when faulty goods are returned to the supplier. The benefit of the credit note rules is that taxpayers can 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:10:40 6 correct the GST component of a change in price in a future return, instead of applying to Inland Revenue to seek an amendment to their original return. 27. The Bill proposes to: 27.1 Clarify the credit note rules to ensure the correct GST adjustment is made in a future GST return (so the amount of GST adjustment is the same as if the taxpayer had amended their original GST return). 27.2 Introduce a time limit for credit note adjustments being included in past GST returns. This time limit is consistent with the existing “time bar” rules for amending past GST returns. Schedule 32 Donee Status \[DEV-19-MIN-0300 (13 November 2019) and CAB-19-MIN-0593 (18 November 2019)\] 28. The Bill proposes to amend the Income Tax Act 2007 by adding three charities to the donee organisations listed in schedule 32. New Zealand charities that support activities overseas must be listed in schedule 32 in order for their donors to be eligible for tax benefits (in particular, the donation tax credit). The proposed new additions to schedule 32 are Active Hearts Foundation, Kiwilink, and Shimshal Trust. Items Not Requiring Cabinet Approval 29. The Bill also includes a range of remedial amendments that I recommend be included in the Bill. The amendments described in the appendix cover a range of tax issues and typically ensure that the relevant tax laws are consistent with their policy intent. The amendments do not involve any significant policy change and do not require Cabinet approval. The amendments do not have any material revenue or other fiscal effects. Minor Remedial and Maintenance Items 30. The Bill also contains a number of minor remedial and maintenance items. These correct minor faults of expression, reader’s aids, and incorrect cross-references. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessments 31. Regulatory impact assessments were prepared, where required, for several policy items in the Bill. These were submitted at the time that Cabinet Committee approval for the policy items was sought. These assessments are: 31.1 Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets, Inland Revenue, 13 September 2019; 31.2 Impact Summary: Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyers and sellers, Inland Revenue, 19 November 2019; 31.3 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16, Inland Revenue, 17 October 2019; 31.4 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue, Inland Revenue, 26 February 2020; 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:10:40 7 31.5 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services, Inland Revenue, 23 October 2019; and 31.6 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes, Inland Revenue, 23 October 2019. Remaining Policy Proposals in the Bill 32. A regulatory impact assessment was not required for the purchase price allocation proposal because decisions on this were delegated to Ministers. However, an assessment will be prepared for the introduction of the Bill. 33. The regulatory impact analysis requirements do not apply to the remaining items in the Bill as the proposed changes result in little or no change to the status quo position. 34. A number of the items (particularly those of a remedial nature) involve technical revisions or consolidations that substantially re-enact the current law to improve legislative clarity and understanding (including the fixing of errors, the clarification of the existing legislative intent, and the reconciliation of inconsistencies). Other items repeal or remove redundant legislative provisions, or have no or only minor impacts on businesses, individuals or not-for-profit entities. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 35. The CIPA requirements do not apply to the policy proposal of confirming annual rates for income tax for the 2020–21 tax year; as the proposed changes result in little or no change to the status quo. 36. The CIPA requirements do not apply to the mycoplasma bovis tax issue policy proposal; as it was confirmed the threshold for significance is not met. 37. The remaining policy proposals previously approved by Cabinet were considered by Cabinet before the CIPA requirements came into effect. Compliance 38. The Bill complies with: 38.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 38.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 38.3 the disclosure statement requirements (the draft disclosure statement is attached); 38.4 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 38.5 relevant international standards and obligations; and 38.6 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:10:40 8 Consultation 39. The substantive policy initiatives to which this Bill is intended to give effect were subject to public and other consultation in accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process. Relevant Government Departments or Other Public Bodies 40. The Treasury was consulted on the development of many of the proposals in the Bill. Other government departments and public bodies were also consulted on relevant aspects of the proposals where appropriate, including the Department of Internal Affairs – Charities Services, Kāinga Ora – Homes and Communities, Land Information New Zealand, Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Pacific and Development Group), Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, Ministry of Social Development, Ministry for Primary Industries and Statistics New Zealand. Feedback from government departments and public bodies was used to develop and refine these proposals. Relevant Private Sector Organisations and Public Consultation Processes 41. A number of the proposals in the Bill were subject to public consultation, which was undertaken in various forms. In addition, private sector organisations were consulted on specific matters of relevance to them. The feedback provided by these stakeholders was taken into account when finalising policy proposals. The attached draft disclosure statement provides further information on the various parties consulted and the form in which consultation was undertaken for the policy items in the Bill. The Government Caucus and Other Parties Represented in Parliament 42. Both Government caucus and coalition and support parties will be consulted on this Bill prior to its proposed introduction. Binding on the Crown 43. A number of Inland Revenue Acts currently bind the Crown (including the Income Tax Act 2007). This amending Bill does not alter the status quo in this respect – the amendments follow the position of the principal Acts. 44. The Bill will not create a new agency. 45. The Bill will not amend the existing coverage of the Ombudsman Act 1975, the Official Information Act 1982, or the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987. Allocation of Decision Making Powers 46. The draft Bill does not involve the allocation of decision-making powers between the executive, the courts, and tribunals. Associated Regulations 47. No regulations are required to bring the proposed Bill into operation. 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:10:40 9 Other Instruments 48. The proposed amendment to section 227 of the Land Transfer Act 2017 empowers the making of regulations by Order in Council prescribing the content of the Land Transfer Tax Statement administered by Land Information New Zealand. Currently, the content is largely prescribed by the Land Transfer Act. The amendment will bring the requirements for the Land Transfer Tax Statement into alignment with other information requirements in the Land Transfer Act. 49. The proposed provision has a number of safeguards built in. Any regulations drafted will need to be consistent with the existing framework set out in the Land Transfer Act 2017, including only disclosing information in aggregate form. Any regulations will be drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel Office, subject to Cabinet scrutiny, and not come into force until at least 28 days after their making. In accordance with the Legislation Act 2012, the regulations will be presented to Parliament and be disallowable following review by the Regulations Review Committee. Definition of Minister/Department 50. The Bill does not contain a definition of Minister, department, or chief executive. Commencement of Legislation 51. Each provision of the Bill comes into force on the date specified in the Bill for that provision. Parliamentary Stages 52. The Bill should be introduced on or soon after 3 June 2020, referred to the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee and reported back to the House by the end of 2020. This will allow a second reading early next year, providing some certainty as to what the law is likely to be for taxpayers. 53. As the Bill includes setting the annual income tax rates for the 2020–21 tax year, and because a number of the proposals in the Bill have an application date of 1 April 2021, the Bill should be enacted by the end of March 2021 at the latest. Publicity 54. I will make an announcement about the proposals in the Bill when it is introduced. A commentary on the Bill will also be released at this time. Inland Revenue will include details of the new legislation in a Tax Information Bulletin after the Bill is enacted. Proactive Release 55. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers, with appropriate redactions, when the Bill is introduced. 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:10:40 10 Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1. note that the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill holds a category 3 priority on the 2020 Legislative Programme (to be passed if possible in the year); 2. note that the Bill makes substantive, remedial, and technical amendments to the: 2.1 Income Tax Act 2007; 2.2 Tax Administration Act 1994; 2.3 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985; 2.4 Student Loan Scheme Act 2011; 2.5 KiwiSaver Act 2006; 2.6 Companies Act 1993; 2.7 Land Transfer Act 2017; 2.8 Social Security Act 2018; 2.9 Accident Compensation Act 2001; 2.10 Taxation (Disclosure of Information to Approved Credit Reporting Agencies) Regulations 2017; and 2.11 Public and Community Housing Management (Prescribed Elements of Calculation Mechanism) Regulations 2018. 3. agree that the income tax rates for the 2020–21 tax year be the same as the rates currently specified in part A of schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; 4. agree to the content of the Bill as contained in this paper; 5. approve the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill for introduction, subject to the final approval of the government caucus and sufficient support in the House of Representatives; 6. agree that the Bill be introduced on or soon after 3 June 2020; 7. agree that the government propose that the Bill be: 7.1 referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee for consideration; 7.2 reported back to the House by the end of 2020; and 7.3 enacted by 31 March 2021. 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:10:40 11 Authorised for lodgement Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:10:40 12 Appendix – Items Not Requiring Cabinet Approval 1. The following items cover a range of tax issues and typically ensure that the relevant tax laws are consistent with their policy intent, and do not require Cabinet approval. The amendments do not have any material revenue or other fiscal effects. Reuniting New Zealanders with lost Australian retirement savings 2. The Trans-Tasman Retirement Savings Portability Arrangement allows for the transfer of retirement savings between complying Australian superannuation schemes and New Zealand KiwiSaver schemes. However, this arrangement does not allow for New Zealanders’ lost Australian retirement savings held by the Australian Tax Office (ATO) to be transferred to a KiwiSaver account. Existing legislation in Australia and New Zealand also does not allow for this transfer. 3. The Bill proposes to amend the KiwiSaver rules to allow for lost Australian retirement savings to be directly transferred from the ATO to a nominated KiwiSaver account. 4. Consistent with other retirement savings transferred from Australia to New Zealand KiwiSaver accounts, the same rules that currently apply to these funds will be extended to lost Australian retirement savings transferred from the ATO to a KiwiSaver account. Research and development tax credit: changes to the capital expenditure eligibility rules 5. Currently, expenditure that contributes to the cost of tangible depreciable assets (such as a plant or machinery) is ineligible for the research and development tax credit, unless the asset is solely used in research and development. 6. There are concerns that expenditure on certain tangible depreciable assets may be eligible for the tax credit – contrary to the policy intent. For example, where an asset may be used for non-research and development purposes in subsequent years. 7. The Bill proposes to introduce an intention test, so that such expenditure is only eligible if the tangible depreciable asset is intended to only be used in research and development in the future (not just in the tax year to which the tax credit relates to). 8. The Bill also proposes an additional requirement that the expenditure will be eligible only if the asset is created as a result of a core research and development activity. This amendment will be retrospective for the 2019–20 income year (the first year of the research and development tax credit regime) because it is not a change in policy and is intended to clarify the legislation. Research and development tax credit: employee costs on creating tangible depreciable property 9. Expenditure that contributes to the cost of tangible depreciable property (such as the construction of a building) is ineligible for the tax credit, unless the property is used only for research and development activities. The intent of this exclusion is to minimise the fiscal risk associated with the construction of large capital assets. However, it is acknowledged that some genuine research and development related to creating tangible depreciable property may be excluded from the tax credit. 10. The Bill proposes an amendment to allow employee costs that support the creation of tangible depreciable property, where they relate to core research and development 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:10:40 13 activities. This amendment will allow some businesses to claim more research and development tax credits, and will be retrospective from the 2019–20 income year (the first year of the research and development tax credit regime). Officials acknowledge that further refinement in this area may be required. Research and development tax credit: clarifying definition of eligible expenditure 11. The policy intent is that expenditure must have a close connection to an eligible research and development activity to be eligible for the credit. Recently, officials have discovered that some taxpayers are interpreting the existing definition of research and development expenditure in ways that are wider than the policy intent, and are seeking to claim expenditure with only a tenuous connection to research and development activities. 12. The Bill proposes to amend the research and development expenditure rules, to clarify that costs only directly connected to eligible research and development activities are eligible. This amendment will be retrospective from the first year of the research and development tax credit regime. Research and development tax credit: list of ineligible research and development expenditure and activities 13. The Bill proposes to amend schedules 21 and 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007, to clarify that certain activities and expenditure are ineligible for the credit. These are: 13.1 corporate governance costs; 13.2 in-house research and development claim preparation costs; 13.3 costs of acquiring land; 13.4 decommissioning costs; 13.5 land remediation costs; 13.6 mining development activities; and 13.7 the up-front costs of acquiring property that would have been depreciable in the absence of an election under section EE 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 14. The Bill proposes the amendments above will be retrospective from the first year of the research and development tax credit regime. Research and development tax credit: time limit for amending tax credit claims 15. A time limit prevents the Commissioner of Inland Revenue from amending a tax credit claim in response to a request by the claimant (in the claimant’s favour), if the request is made more than 12 months after the claimant’s income tax return for the relevant year was due. 16. The Bill proposes a clarifying amendment to ensure the Commissioner is able to consider and complete a request for amendment to a tax credit claim, even if more than a year has passed since the claimant’s income tax return due date (provided the 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:10:40 14 request is initiated within the prescribed timeframe). This amendment will apply from the first year of the research and development tax credit regime. Research and development tax credit: due date for criteria and methodologies approval applications 17. In year two of the research and development tax credit regime, all businesses that want to claim the research and development tax credit will be required to obtain either general approval or criteria and methodologies approval (known as CAM). CAM is intended as an alternative approval regime for businesses undertaking significant research and development activity. 18. Currently, the CAM applications are due after the end of the income year. Having the same due date for both the general or CAM approvals may potentially adversely impact both applicants and officials in fulfilling their requirements under either approval regime. 19. The Bill proposes to amend the due date for businesses to file a CAM application to six months before the end of the claimant’s income year. For multi-year CAM applications, applications will be due six months before the end of the first income year to which the approval relates. This amendment will apply from the 2021–22 income year (the third year of the research and development tax credit regime). Unpaid voluntary KiwiSaver employer contributions 20. The Bill proposes to subject unpaid voluntary KiwiSaver employer contributions to the penalties, recoveries and use of money interest regimes. This will be achieved by amending the definition of “tax” to include a reference to voluntary KiwiSaver employer contributions. These amendments apply from 1 April 2021. Definition of activities for non-resident custodial institutions 21. Custodial institutions are able to use specific reporting and withholding tax rules, on behalf of investors. However, the current rules mean certain non-resident custodians that operate in New Zealand through a fixed establishment (rather than a local subsidiary) are excluded from these rules. This places them at a commercial disadvantage to resident custodial institutions. 22. The Bill proposes to amend the definition of activities for non-resident custodial institutions to remedy this situation. The amendment will be retrospective from 1 April 2020 to align with the introduction of the custodial institutions’ withholding and reporting rules. Withhold non-resident withholding tax from certain payments 23. Custodial institutions should be required to withhold resident withholding tax (RWT) and non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) when they pay or transfer investment income to the investor. However, the current law only creates an obligation to withhold RWT. 24. The Bill proposes to clarify that custodial institutions should withhold RWT or NRWT as applicable. The amendment will apply retrospectively to align with the introduction of the custodial institutions’ withholding and reporting rules. 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:10:40 15 Housing New Zealand Build Limited subject to income tax 25. To ensure they pay income tax, Kāinga Ora – Homes and Communities (formerly known as Housing New Zealand Corporation) and Kāinga Ora’s main subsidiary Housing New Zealand Limited are listed in schedule 36 of the Income Tax Act 2007. There is a view that other Kāinga Ora subsidiaries need to be explicitly listed in schedule 36. 26. The Bill proposes to add Housing New Zealand Build Limited to schedule 36, to ensure it is subject to income tax. This amendment will apply from 23 May 2018 – the date on which Housing New Zealand Build Limited was incorporated. Changing the filing due date for locked-in portfolio investment entities 27. Most portfolio investment entities (PIEs) are required to file income information relating to member accounts on 15 May each year. This is to provide sufficient time for Inland Revenue to complete its tax year-end processes. 28. However, locked-in PIEs (that is, superannuation funds and retirement savings schemes) currently have a filing date of 30 June. This filing date means the year-end process runs much later, impacting taxpayers (such as KiwiSaver). 29. The Bill proposes to change the due date for locked-in PIEs to 15 May, for the 2020– 21 income year onwards. Officials are communicating with affected PIE managers to ensure they can make the necessary adjustments to their systems and processes. Minors’ income tax exemption 30. Currently, the Income Tax Act 2007 provides school children with an income tax exemption on income up to $2,340 (per annum) which has not already had tax withheld (known as the minors’ income tax exemption). This compliance cost saving measure ensures that in certain circumstances, children are not required to file an income tax return with Inland Revenue. 31. This exemption was not intended to be used in situations where a trustee pays tax on behalf of a beneficiary that is a minor. The Bill proposes to amend the minors’ income tax exemption to ensure it does not apply to beneficiary income paid by a trustee to a minor. 32. This amendment will apply from the 2012–13 income year, so to align with the original commencement date of the minors’ income tax exemption, with a savings provision for taxpayers that have already filed a return before the date of introduction of the Bill. Definition of a settlor of a trust 33. A settlor of a trust is typically someone that transfers value to a trust. As such, a beneficiary of a trust may also become a settlor when they know that their current account balance of $25,000 or more is being used by the trustee, and the beneficiary is not paid interest on these funds at or above the market rate of interest. Being a settlor can have wide-ranging consequences, including for social assistance and student loan purposes. 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:10:40 16 34. It is difficult for Inland Revenue to determine if a beneficiary is fully aware of the use of the funds by the trust (to the extent that it results in the beneficiary becoming a settlor). 35. The Bill proposes to amend the definition of the settlor so that a beneficiary with more than $25,000 in their current account on which interest has been underpaid, is deemed to be a settlor of a trust, regardless of their level of knowledge. This amendment will apply from 1 April 2020, to align with recent related amendments. Settlor of a trust migrating to New Zealand 36. A settlor of a foreign trust that migrates to New Zealand may elect to pay New Zealand tax on worldwide trustee income from a specified date. If they do, then there is no additional tax to pay when a beneficiary receives a distribution out of tax-paid income. If this election is not made, distributions from the trust may be taxed at 45%. 37. It is possible for a settlor of a foreign trust to make a retrospective election to pay New Zealand tax on up to four years of worldwide trustee income. The Bill proposes amendments to ensure that distributions out of tax-paid income are tax free. This amendment will apply from 23 March 2020 to align with the application date of a related amendment. 38. As well, it is possible for settlors who have migrated to New Zealand, and not made an election to pay New Zealand tax on worldwide trustee income, to voluntarily disclose this information to Inland Revenue. In these situations, New Zealand tax (including penalties and interest) would be assessed but can result in some future distributions still being taxed at 45%. 39. The Bill proposes a clarifying amendment to ensure future distributions out of tax-paid income covered by a voluntary disclosure are tax free. This amendment will be retrospective from 1 April 2008 to ensure the policy intent for tax positions under existing voluntary disclosures is achieved. Exemption for energy consumer trusts to own more than 20% of a portfolio investment entity 40. Currently, the portfolio investment entities (PIEs) rules restrict taxpayers from owning more than 20% of a PIE and requires a PIE to have at least 20 investors – this is to prevent a single investor from controlling a PIE. However, there are entities that can be a PIE without meeting these requirements if they are effectively holding assets for a sufficiently wide group of persons. The Bill proposes including energy consumer trusts (known as “lines trusts”) to this group because they hold their investments for the benefit of electricity customers and communities within their local areas. Changes to the employee share scheme and exempt ESS rules 41. A company that offers an employee share scheme (ESS) may nominate a trustee to carry out scheme-related activities (such as holding shares on trust for employees). As a nominee, the trustee is treated like the company, meaning that transfers of shares between the company and the trustee have no tax implications. 42. The Bill proposes to allow a trustee of an exempt ESS scheme to be a nominee of the company providing the scheme, as there is no policy reason to treat exempt ESS 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:10:40 17 trustees differently from ESS trustees in this context. It also proposes to allow the disposal of shares held by the company (known as “treasury stock”) by an ESS or exempt ESS trustee nominee to be exempt from income tax. This change aligns with existing tax rules involving the sale of treasury stock. Use of pre-consolidation imputation credits 43. The imputation credit regime aims to prevent double taxation of company income distributed to shareholders (that is, dividends). Where two companies have consolidated, the consolidated group can hold imputation credits generated before consolidation. The Bill proposes to allow group member taxpayers to use their pre- consolidation credits before using their group credits. This approach is more consistent with how taxpayers have historically used their imputation credits. This amendment will be retrospective to 1 April 2008 (the commencement date of the Income Tax Act 2007) to ensure tax positions that follow this approach are valid. GST and zero-rated transfers of commercial land leases 44. The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 requires business-to-business land sales to be zero-rated (GST applied at 0%). Because certain leases and lease transfers are close substitutes for land ownership, they are also zero-rated. 45. The amendments clarify that when a business is sold and the sale involves transferring or cancelling an existing lease and then arranging a new lease, these will be treated as being a zero-rated supply. As well, the Bill proposes remedial amendments to how the assignment or surrender of leases are treated under the zero-rated rules. The proposed amendments will apply retrospectively from 30 June 2014, the commencement date of the original amendment. Definition of deferrable tax 46. When a taxpayer has a tax dispute with Inland Revenue, the amount being disputed can be deferred until the dispute is settled. However, the current rules do not consider the situation where a disputed amount in one taxpayer’s return affects an associated taxpayer. 47. The Bill proposes to amend the definition of “deferrable tax” to include consequential adjustments to associated taxpayer assessments. This adjustment will reduce compliance cost for taxpayers and shorten the dispute process. Ability for a taxpayer to dispute a tax position outside the permitted time limit 48. Currently, taxpayers can circumvent the time limit for disputing a tax assessment by making a voluntary disclosure for a particular item and consequently, reopen the entire tax assessment for dispute. 49. The Bill proposes to amend the tax dispute rules by limiting taxpayers’ dispute rights to the subject raised in the voluntary disclosure. A similar rule already exists that prevents Inland Revenue from disputing unrelated items to any amended assessment made for a taxpayer. 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:10:40 18 New Zealand superannuitants and the end-of-year auto calculation process 50. The end-of-year income tax square-up rules allow taxpayers that only receive New Zealand Superannuation or Veteran Pension income, and consequently incur a tax liability (that is, under-deduction of PAYE from these gross amounts), to have this tax liability written off. This includes situations where a taxpayer has used a tailored tax code. 51. The underlying policy intent of these write off rules (when combined with a tailored tax code), is that the write off is limited to $50. 52. The Bill proposes to clarify that taxpayers that receive New Zealand Superannuation and the Veteran’s Pension payments, and have used a tailored tax code, are entitled to a write off concession of up to $50. Clarify that dividends are derived on a cash basis 53. Currently, dividends that are paid in money, are assessable on a cash or accrual basis. Stakeholders have suggested that dividends should only be assessable on a cash basis, as this will reduce compliance costs and aligns with other legal requirements. 54. The Bill proposes to clarify that dividends must be assessed on a cash basis. Notice to spread fertiliser costs 55. The Income Tax Act 2007 allows taxpayers to spread the cost of fertiliser over one to four years, to match these costs with the benefits generated by the fertiliser. Taxpayers are required to provide a “notice” to Inland Revenue advising they are electing to use this spreading method. 56. The Bill proposes to deem the notice to be provided to Inland Revenue when the taxpayer files their tax return on that basis. This will reduce compliance costs of taxpayers having to otherwise provide a separate written notice to Inland Revenue. Non-resident contractors’ exemption 57. Currently, non-resident contractors who earn income in New Zealand are subject to withholding tax; this is to minimise the risk that taxpayers will leave New Zealand without fulfilling their New Zealand tax obligations. However, a non-resident contractor may apply to Inland Revenue for an exemption where there is no New Zealand tax ultimately due. 58. One way to be granted an exemption is to demonstrate that payments received are not “income”. This is too broad, and the Bill proposes to narrow this requirement to “assessable income”. Amendment to the transfer pricing rules 59. For particular forms of related party lending between a non-resident and a New Zealand resident borrower, the transfer pricing rules use a third-party test to determine if the particular features of a related party loan (such as subordination or terms beyond five years) would also feature in an arm’s length (unrelated party) loan, and if they 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:10:40 19 would, then the resulting interest deductions the borrower incurs are allowed for tax purposes. 60. The Bill proposes an amendment to the third-party test to exclude loans where the lender has any ownership interest in the borrower. This amendment will be retrospective from 1 July 2018, when the rules were introduced, with a savings provision to protect the position of taxpayers that have already filed tax returns following the current transfer pricing rules. Non-resident deferral calculation formula amendment 61. The Bill proposes an amendment to the non-resident financial arrangement income calculation formula to ensure that in certain situations, the formula cannot produce an undefined outcome. This issue arose from an earlier amendment to the formula that sought to include a hybrid deductions element into the existing formula. Technical changes to the thin capitalisation rules 62. The thin capitalisation rules are part of New Zealand’s international tax rules and place limits on the interest deduction that foreign companies can claim on their New Zealand operations. 63. The Bill proposes two technical amendments to the thin capitalisation rules: 63.1 denying interest deductions when a New Zealand group is controlled by a group of non-residents, in line with existing policy intent; and 63.2 to not apply the thin capitalisation rules to a trust solely due to a New Zealand resident settlor making an investment in, or settlement on, a non-resident. Commissioner’s powers to uplift extracts or copies of taxpayer documents 64. The Bill proposes to clarify a cross-reference error that resulted in the Commissioner of Inland Revenue being potentially unable to obtain extracts or copies of documents or other material that is created when the Commissioner is in the course of exercising her authority to undertake formal inquiries about a taxpayer. The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Removing the requirement to review parental tax credit every three years 65. As part of the Families Package, the parental tax credit ceased to be paid to children born after 1 July 2018; instead they will qualify for the Best Start tax credit. Therefore, the requirement to undertake a review of the parental tax credit every three years is now redundant and should be removed. 66. The Bill proposes to remove the requirement in the Income Tax Act 2007 to undertake a review of the parental tax credit every three years. Updating references to main benefit payments 67. The Bill proposes to align the terminology of the definitions of the various monetary payments, or groups of payments, between the Revenue Acts and the Social Security Act 2018. These include references to “benefits” and “income-tested benefits” in the 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:10:40 20 Revenue Acts, being amended to refer to “main benefits” currently used in the Social Security Act 2018. 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:10:40 I N C O N F I D E N C E LEG-20-MIN-0058 Cabinet Legislation Committee Minute of Decision This document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.

This report seeks your agreement to increase the write-off threshold of income tax debts from automatic calculations for people with reportable income 1 from $50 to $200 for the 2019/20 income tax year only. This increase can be achieved by the making of an Order in Council. This would reduce compliance and administrative costs for customers and Inland Revenue, and would remove a liability from customers which will assist with the economic recovery from the COVID-19 restrictions. The report also seeks your agreement to invite the Parliamentary Counsel Office to commence drafting the Order in Council. 2. A draft Cabinet Economic Development Committee paper is attached for your consideration and authorisation to the Cabinet Office. The draft paper seeks Cabinet’s agreement to the increase in the write-off threshold and the submission of an Order in Council to the Executive Council giving effect to this increase. Context and background 3. Inland Revenue implemented changes in 2019 to simplify individuals’ year-end income tax filing obligations for the 2019 income tax year onwards. As part of these changes, tax liabilities of $50 and under are automatically written off. The purpose of this threshold was to remove compliance and administration costs by not having to collect small amounts. This level of debt indicates that the source deductions have minor errors and consequently there is often negligible benefit in further collection action. 4. There is a cost to Inland Revenue collecting these debts and the cost of further collection activity can outweigh any potential monies gained. The administration of debt collection is putting additional stress on our already stretched resources. 5. The process of writing off small tax bills happens every year, although with the fuller information receipt and tax calculation process in place this year, we should see more accurate assessments issued in the first instance. 6. Customers have options for paying off debt that include setting up an instalment arrangement to repay an agreed amount over time, and/or writing off an agreed amount if we decide that full payment will cause the customer serious hardship. Inland Revenue also can write-off outstanding tax to pay if it considers recovery of the debt would be an inefficient use of resources. 7. Many New Zealanders are experiencing financial difficulties due to economic and physical restrictions resulting from attempts to control the COVID-19 epidemic. Inland Revenue is dealing with increasing contacts from people about current tax debts and future tax bills. With job losses and/or reductions in income, it is likely that a number of customers will be required to pay tax as a result of the 2019/20 auto-calculation. This will add to the financial difficulties that many people with only reportable income are currently facing. While there are current mechanisms to 1 Reportable income is income that has had tax withheld at source and is reported to Inland Revenue by the payers, for example, salary, wages and investment income. Proactively Released Sensitive IR2020/204: Raising the automatic calculation write-off threshold Page 3 of 6 \[SENSITIVE\] assist people in financial hardship, such as the write-off under the serious hardship provisions, it requires the person to apply for relief, usually by calling us. 8. While New Zealand recovers from the economic effects of COVID-19, one avenue to help alleviate pressure on individuals with a tax bill for the 2019/20 income year would be to increase the threshold for writing off lower value income tax bills for that tax year, which is payable by 7 February 2021 (or by 7 April 2021, if the customer has a tax agent). This would be one less financial burden faced by a number of people during a period when their finances are most severely affected. Financial considerations Income retained by customers 9. Based on 2018/19 figures, we calculated the likely amount of revenue foregone by Inland Revenue due to increasing the write-off threshold, and the amount of income retained by customers to spend elsewhere if they did not need to pay it to Inland Revenue, as well as the number of customers affected: • For the 2018/19 income tax year, 581,312 customers had debt below $50, totalling $4,050,847, which was written off. This is an average of $6.97 per person. • If we were to increase the threshold for debt to be written off from $50 to $200, this would – based on 2018/19 figures – be an additional $17,047,354 written off for a further 149,174 individuals, leaving an average of $114 to remain with each of the customers in this group or not being required to be paid. • Total debt under $200, including that under $50, in the same period totalled $21,098,201, spread over 730,486 customers. 10. For comparison purposes, the number of people with tax debts between $200 and $500 in 2018/19 was a further 90,472 people with debts totalling $28,302,021, showing that the majority of people incur debt under $200. 11. We note that providing relief this way may help many of those least likely to be able to pay when the bill becomes a tax debt: • Almost 50% of those with a debt under $200 in 2018/19 earned less than $60,000. • 48,669 customers receiving Working for Families Tax Credits had a 2018/19 tax bill of up to $200. However, we do note that such an increase will also provide relief to customers who can afford to pay the tax. In other words, it is not exclusively targeted to those that cannot afford to repay the tax or are impacted by Covid-19. 12. Additionally, the limitation to focusing on only individuals subject to the auto- calculation rules is that the write-off will mainly benefit those receiving salary/wage income with PAYE deducted and/or income from passive investments. The write-off does not cover self-employed individuals or individuals for whom Inland Revenue does not receive information directly from payments sources but who may be in the same financial situation as qualifying individuals. Such individuals and those who have a tax bill of over $200 as a result of the auto-calculation, will be able to enter into instalment arrangements to pay the tax owing or seek write-off under the serious hardship rules. Proactively Released Sensitive IR2020/204: Raising the automatic calculation write-off threshold Page 4 of 6 \[SENSITIVE\] Fiscal and administrative costs for Inland Revenue and the Government 13. There is no fiscal impact from this proposal. The additional debt written-off will be managed within existing baselines of the non-departmental appropriation, Non- departmental Other Expenses: Impairment of Debt and Debt Write-offs, being a decrease to the amount of the contingency ring-fenced within the appropriation. However, if this threshold increase were to be extended beyond the 2019/20 year, there would either be a fiscal cost or Inland Revenue would have a permanently lower amount of contingency. 14. Writing off small debts is within the context that the Commissioner must collect the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law, having regard for the resources available. Debts under $200 indicate that the source deductions include a minor error; consequently, there is negligible benefit in further collection action. It is an inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources to collect small amounts of tax, and not collecting these would not compromise the integrity of the tax system. 15. An increase in the automatic write-off threshold will also reduce our contacts from customers during the period we undertake the auto-calculation process and allow us to focus on the issuing of refunds. 16. Further, it will reduce compliance costs for customers who might otherwise apply for hardship and need to provide the necessary information to support their application. In the 2019 year, there were 7,262 applications for hardship and other adjustments to write off individual income tax where the balance was under $200. The number of applications for the 2020 tax year is likely to increase as a result of Covid-19. 17. We note that if the threshold is not increased, we will still write-off some of these amounts under the serious hardship relief rules, which imposes additional burdens on both the customers and Inland Revenue staff. We will also still write-off some of these amounts where we consider it is an inefficient use of resources to collect the tax where no payment has been made by the due date. 18. There is also the opportunity cost of the time taken to administer multiple smaller debts where we could instead spend time recovering fewer larger debts. This would result in the collection of more revenue over the longer term. 19. As part of the 2019/20 automatically calculated tax returns, some people will also receive refunds. Based on 2018/19 data we issued refunds totalling about $653 million and a total of $115 million in tax bills and expect the same level for the 2019/20 tax year. The tax bills issued included those to over 145,000 people for amounts over $200 totalling $94 million. If people cannot afford to pay income tax, they can enter into an instalment arrangement or seek to have the tax written-off under the hardship rules. 20. Increasing the threshold will result in reduced contacts from customers who receive such tax bills. An average contact costs around $44, and for tax bills we usually have about three contacts. It also removes postage costs in that we do not need to issue such customers with reminder notices. This will free up our resources to deal with other COVID-19 related enquiries and deal other Government COVID-19 priorities. 21. We recommend that the threshold be increased to $200 for the 2019/20 tax year to provide financial relief to this group of people and free up Inland Revenue our already stretched resources to deal other contacts and delivery the Government’s response to Covid-19 Proactively Released Sensitive IR2020/204: Raising the automatic calculation write-off threshold Page 5 of 6 \[SENSITIVE\] Consultation 22. We consulted with Treasury who agree there is no fiscal impact for the 2019/20 year and this change can be completed within the current Impairment of Debt and Debt Write-Offs appropriation. 23. We have also consulted Parliamentary Counsel Office in preparation of this report and the Cabinet Committee paper. 24. We are currently undertaking targeted consultation in line with the requirements for the making of an Order in Council. We are consulting with the: • Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ) • New Zealand Council of Trade Unions Te Kauae Kaimahi (NZCTU) • National Beneficiary Advocacy Consultation Group (NBACG). CA ANZ and the NBACG have indicated their support for the increase in write-off threshold for the 2019/20 tax year. We will update the Cabinet Committee paper once we hear back from the NZCTU to reflect their feedback. Regulatory Impact Assessment 25. We have been informed by The Treasury that a Regulatory Impact Assessment is not required for this issue. It is exempt on the basis that the proposal has no or minor impact on businesses, individuals or non-for-profit organisations. Next steps 26. If you agree with the temporary increase in the write-off threshold for the 2019/20 tax year, we attach a Cabinet Economic Development Committee paper for your consideration and authorisation to the Cabinet Office. The paper seeks the Committee’s agreement to the increase in the threshold and the submission of an Order in Council to the Executive Council giving effect to the increase. The Cabinet Committee paper seeks waiver of the 28-day rule. This is because the Order in Council needs to be made as soon as possible to allow for the write-off to occur as part of 2019/20 auto-calculation process which commences in mid-May. We note that the Order in Council is taxpayer friendly. We will draft you a letter seeking such a waiver. 27. The indicative timeline for the Order in Council approach is as follows: Activity Date Drafting instructions to PCO 7 May 2020 Authorisation and submission of DEV paper to Cabinet Office 21 May or 28 May (depending Ministerial consultation) DEV consideration of proposed increase and authorisation of Order in Council to Executive Council 27 May or 3 June (depending on Ministerial consultation) Cabinet endorsement of increase and authorisation of the Order in Council to 2 June or 8 June Order in Council takes effect 2 June or 8 June for the 2019/20 tax year Proactively Released Sensitive IR2020/204: Raising the automatic calculation write-off threshold Page 6 of 6 \[SENSITIVE\] We have indicated to the Parliamentary Counsel Office that we are reporting to you on this matter. We seek your agreement for us to invite the Parliamentary Counsel Office to commence to draft an Order in Council to give effect to the increase. 28. We recommend you provide a copy of this report to your colleague, the Minister of Finance, for his information. Recommended action We recommend that you: 1. agree to increase the write-off threshold for automatic calculation income tax write- offs from $50 to $200 for the 2019/20 tax year; Agreed/Not agreed 2. agree to officials providing drafting instructions to the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council giving effect to the above recommendation; Agreed/Not agreed 3. note that a waiver of the 28-day requirement for the making of the Order in Council will need to be sought so that it comes into effect as soon as possible after being made; Noted 4. authorise the submission of the attached Cabinet Economic Development Committee paper seeking approval of the increase in the debt write-off level and approving the submission of the Order in Council to the Executive Council to the Cabinet Office by 28 May 2020 at the latest; Agreed/Not agreed 5. refer a copy of this report to the Minister of Finance for his information. Referred/Not referred Policy Lead Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue / /2020 s9(2)(a) Proactively Released 1 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence O ffice of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee T AX ADMINISTRATION (WRITE OFF AMOUNT) ORDER 2020 Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to increase the write-off threshold from $50 to $200 of income tax debts from automatic calculation for individuals with reportable income. This increase will alleviate the need for some 149,000 customers to have to worry about the payment of this tax debt and contact Inland Revenue about repayment options and possible write-off in the case of serious hardship. 2.It also seeks the Committee’s agreement to submit an Order in Council making Tax Administration (Write Off Amount) Order 2020 which gives effect to this increase to the Executive Council. 3.It is proposed that the Order in Council applies to the write-offs of automatically calculated tax debts from the date it comes into effect. An amendment will be made to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to limit the application of this increase to the 2019-20 tax year. The paper seeks the Committee’s agreement to the inclusion of this amendment in an appropriate Supplementary Order Paper. Relation to Government Priorities 4.Increasing the write-off threshold for these tax debts will reduce financial pressure for many New Zealanders due to the impacts of Covid-19. I t will also allow Inland Revenue to concentrate on other aspects of the Government’s response to COVID-19. Policy 5.Income tax obligations for customers with only reportable income (income that has had tax withheld at source and is reported to Inland Revenue by the payers, for example, salary, wages and investment income) are automatically calculated by Inland Revenue. Customers are advised of the resulting refund or tax liability. 6.Tax liabilities of $50 and under are automatically written off under the current rules. This removes compliance and administration costs for both Inland Revenue and their customers through not having to collect small amounts. In the 2018-19 tax year, this resulted in writing off $4,050,487 for 581,312 customers with debt below $50. As part of this process, Inland Revenue also issued $653 million in refunds in the 2018-19 tax year and a total of $115 million in tax bills. Inland Revenue expects that the amount of refunds and tax bills issued for the 2019-2 0 tax year will be similar. 7.While New Zealand suffers from the economic effects of COVID-19, one avenue that I think wil l help alleviate pressure on certain New Zealanders who only earn salary or wage and investment income with tax liabilities for the 2019-20 tax year would be to increase the threshold for writing off lower value income tax bills This would be one less financial burde n f aced by a number of people during a period when their finances are most severely affected by the impact of Covid-19. 3jnp0i3ub4 2020-06-11 10:09:14 Proactively Released 2. 2 IN CONFIDENCE 8. While there are current mechanisms to assist people in financial hardship, such as the write- off under the serious hardship provisions, it requires the person to apply for relief, usually by calling Inland Revenue and proving that they are in serious hardship. This adds to the administrative pressure Inland Revenue staff are already under. In the 2019 tax year, there were 7,262 applications for hardship and other adjustments to write off individual income tax where the balance was under $200. The number of applications for the 2020 tax year is likely to increase as a result of Covid-19. 9. In addition, Inland Revenue has the power to write-off tax debt within the context that it must collect the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law, having regard for the resources available. Debts under $200 indicate that the source deductions are not quite right; consequently, there is negligible benefit in further collection action. It is an inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources to collect small amounts of tax, and not collecting these would not compromise the integrity of the tax system. Inland Revenue cannot use this power until the tax debt becomes outstanding which is usually 7 February 2021. 10. While Inland Revenue has the ability to help their customers facing financial hardship due to Covid-19 or write-off small debts because it is inefficient to collect them, I recommend that the write-off threshold be increased to $200 for the 2019-2 0 tax year. This will result in about 149,000 individuals, based on 2018-19 tax year data, having their tax liability of between $50 and $200 written-off. 11. This has the benefits of providing certainty to these persons and reducing the compliance and administration costs of having these people contacting Inland Revenue and worrying about having to pay this tax debt. It also allows Inland Revenue to focus its limited resources on delivering our policies to cushion the economic effects of Covid-19. 12. My officials inform me that by providing relief this way we are expecting that we will impact many of those least likely to be able to pay when the bill becomes a tax debt. Almost 50% of those with a debt under $200 in the 2018-19 tax year earned less than $60,000, and 48,669 customers receiving Working for Families Tax Credits had a 2018/19 tax bill of up to $200. I do recognise that this proposal is not very well targeted as there will be individuals who can afford to pay these tax debts. 13. I am informed that there will still be about 145,000 individuals who will be issued with tax bills over $200 as part of the auto-calculation process amounting to about $ 94 million. If such individuals cannot afford to pay their tax liability, they can seek to enter into an instalment arrangement or request that tax be written-off under the serious hardship rules. Financial Implications 14. There is no fiscal impact from this proposal. The additional debt written-off will be managed within existing baseline of the non-departmental appropriation, Non-departmental Other Expenses: Impairment of Debt and Debt Write-offs. 15. Inland Revenue will manage the implementation and administration of the increased write-off threshold within existing baselines. Legislative Implications 16. If this increase is approved, I propose to give effect to it by the making of an Order in Council under section 22J of the Tax Administration Act. I am required by legislation to undertake a consultation process. My officials have consulted with the following and I consider that I have met the legislative requirement to consult: 16.1 Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ) 16.2 New Zealand Council of Trade Unions Te Kauae Kaimahi (NZCTU) 3jnp0i3ub4 2020-06-11 10:09:14 Proactively Released Proactively Released 16.3 National Beneficiary Advocacy Consultation Group (NBACG). 17 . s912)(f)(iv} Impact Analysis 18 .

I note that the increase in the threshold will provide immediate rel ief in the current economic climate to some taxpayers liable to pay tax debts of between $50 and $200, so I recommend that t hese changes come into force at the earliest possible date.

Policy 3.I recommend that refunds from income equalisation accounts and environmental restoration accounts be made by direct credit from 23 July 2020. Refunds will be made by direct credit unless it would result in undue hardship or is not practicable (for example, if the bank account is overseas and it is not possible to direct credit). This proposal aligns with the movement of the administration of income equalisation accounts and environmental restoration accounts to the new technology platform in the Business Transformation Release 4. 4.The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for progressive implementation of the d irect crediting of refunds by Order in Council. It was enacted with effect from 1 April 2000 to benefit taxpayers by eliminating the time delays associated with the postal system and costs related to the banking of cheques. Inland Revenue would also benefit from reduced administrative costs. The provision also allows for exemptions when direct crediting would cause undue hardship or is impracticable. 5.Progressive implementation for the various tax types through Orders in Council was t o allow Inland Revenue the necessary flexibility to determine the dates when direct crediting of refunds relating to different tax types could best be implemented. It was also to give taxpayers time to provide Inland Revenue with up to-date bank account details and taxpayers with complex business activities more time to plan and adapt their processes. The intent was that the Commissioner would eventually be required to direct credit all refunds into taxpayers’ bank accounts. 6.Compulsory direct crediting of refunds has been implemented for gaming machine d uty, income tax, and goods and services tax as part of moving the administration to Inland Revenue’s new technology platform. 1 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:20:47 1. \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Timing and 28-day rule 7. I propose that direct crediting of income equalisation and environmental restoration accounts under section 184A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 be applied to refunds made from 23 July 2020. The Order would therefore be in accordance with the rule that regulations must not come into force until at least 28 days after they have been notified in the New Zealand Gazette. Compliance 8. The Order complies with: 8.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 8.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 8.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 8.4 relevant international standards and obligations; and 8.5 the Legislation Guidelines, which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. 9. No statutory prerequisite exists for making this Order. Regulations Review Committee 10.

In Confidence 7 May 2020 Minister of Revenue Decrease in FBT prescribed rate of interest Purpose 1. This report seeks your agreement to lower the prescribed interest rate used to calculate fringe benefit tax (FBT) on low-interest loans provided by employers to employees from 5.26% to 4.50%. This change is required to align the rate with current market interest rates. The new rate should apply from the beginning of the next quarter – 1 July 2020. 2. An Order in Council is required to make this change. Therefore, this report also seeks your approval for the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) to draft an Order in Council to lower the rate. As changes to the FBT prescribed interest rate have become a routine matter, we consider that your approval is sufficient for PCO to draft the Order. PCO can provide the Order in Council directly to Cabinet Office. Background 3. The FBT rules tax non-cash benefits provided to employees. Included in the definition of ‘fringe benefit’ is any employment-related loan on which the employer is charging a rate of interest that is below the market rate. The interest differential is taxable. A prescribed rate set by regulations is used as a proxy for the market rate of interest, to save employers the compliance costs associated with determining the market rate relevant to loans that they have provided to their employees. 4. The Income Tax Act 2007 permits the making of regulations by Order in Council to set a prescribed rate of interest for the purpose of calculating FBT on low-interest loans. Once a rate is set, it remains the prescribed rate until changed by a subsequent Order in Council. 5. The prescribed interest rate was last changed from 5.77% to 5. 26%, effective from the quarter beginning 1 October 2019. Determination of appropriate prescribed rate 6. The Reserve Bank conducts a survey of first mortgage housing interest rates on the last day of each month, producing a ‘floating first mortgage new customer housing rate’. The rate is calculated as the weighted average interest rate for the surveyed institutions, the weightings being based on each institution’s share of total lending for housing purposes. This Reserve Bank series is a suitable indication of general market interest rates, and is therefore used as the benchmark for setting the FBT prescribed rate. 7. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate of 4.50% for March 2020 indicates that the current FBT prescribed rate of 5.26% is higher than the prevailing market rate. 4.50% could still be perceived as a high borrowing rate in the context of the current low-interest environment, but this figure is consistent with floating rates offered by major banks. 8. Longstanding administrative policy has been to adjust the FBT prescribed interest rate when there has been a change in the floating first mortgage new customer IR2020/225: Decrease in FBT prescribed rate of interest Page 1 of 3 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence housing rate of 20 basis points or more. We recommend that the rate be adjusted to ensure that there is no long-term misalignment. Process issues 9. When regulations are made declaring the rate of interest applying to employment- related loans, they apply to quarters starting from a date at least 1 month following the date the regulations were made. Regulations that reduce the prescribed rate may apply to a quarter if made at least 1 month before the end of that quarter, however there is not sufficient time for that to be possible for this rate change. Therefore, the reduced rate of 4.50% should apply from the start of the next quarter – 1 July 2020. 10. The Order in Council should be referred to the Cabinet Office by 11 June 2020, so that it can be considered by the Cabinet Legislation Committee on 16 June 2020. PCO has arranged for the Order in Council to be provided directly to the Cabinet Office. 11. A Cabinet paper recommending that Cabinet approve the Order in Council and authorise its submission to the Executive Council is attached. We recommend that you lodge the Cabinet paper with the Cabinet Office by 10am on Thursday 11 June 2020. Revenue implications 12. Lowering the FBT prescribed interest rate to 4.50% will decrease the amount of FBT that will be collected by approximately $0.4 million per quarter. This amounts to $6.4 million over the current forecast period (2020-21 to 2023-24). 13. A forecasting adjustment will be necessary, to account for the decrease in expected FBT revenue. It will not affect the balance of the tax policy work programme scorecard. Consultation 14. The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this report and the attached Cabinet paper. IR2020/225: Decrease in FBT prescribed rate of interest Page 2 of 3 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence Recommended action We recommend that you: 15. agree that the FBT prescribed rate of interest for low-interest employment-related loans should be lowered to 4.50%, effective from 1 July 2020. Agreed/Not agreed 16. note that decreasing the prescribed rate to 4.50% will result in a decrease in revenue of approximately $0.4 million per quarter ($1.6 million per annum), which amounts to $6.4 million over the current forecast period (2020-21 to 2023-24). Noted 17. agree that the Parliamentary Counsel Office should be instructed to draft an Order in Council to implement the proposed rate change. Agreed/Not agreed Paul Fulton Principal Policy Advisor Policy and Strategy Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue / /2020 IR2020/225: Decrease in FBT prescribed rate of interest Page 3 of 3 IN CONFIDENCE \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee INCOME TAX (FRINGE BENEFIT TAX, INTEREST ON LOANS) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2020 Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit an Orde r in Council amending the Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Amendment Regulations 2019 to the Executive Council. The proposal is to lower the FBT prescribed interest rate for low-interest, employment-related loans from 5.26% to 4.50%, in line with a decrease in market interest rates. 2.Changes to the prescribed interest rate are a routine matter and do not involve a chan ge of policy. The methodology used for setting the rate has been applied consistently since the early 1990s. Policy 3.The fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules tax non-cash benefits provided to employees. Included in the definition of ‘fringe benefit’ is any employment-related loan on which the employer is charging a rate of interest that is below the market rate. The interest differential is taxable. A prescribed rate set by regulations is used as a proxy for the market rate of interest to save employers the compliance costs associated with determining the market rate relevant to loans that they have provided to their employees. 4.The Income Tax Act 2007 (‘the Act’) allows regulations to be made to set the prescr ibed rate. Once a rate is set, it remains the prescribed rate of interest until changed by a subsequent Order in Council. The current FBT prescribed rate, which has applied since 1 October 2019, is 5.26%. 5.The prescribed rate of interest is based on a Reserve Bank survey of first mortgage hou sing interest rates on the last day of each month (‘floating first mortgage new customer housing rate’). This is calculated as the weighted average interest rate for the surveyed institutions, the weightings being based on each institution’s share of total lending for housing purposes. This Reserve Bank series is selected as the benchmark for setting the FBT prescribed rate because it is seen as a good indication of market interest rates. 6.The proposed new FBT rate of 4.50%, despite being 76 basis points lower than the curren t rate, might still be perceived as a high borrowing rate in the current low- interest environment. However, this figure is consistent with floating rates offered by major banks. 1 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:24:08 2. \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Timing 7. The Act provides that when regulations to change the prescribed rate of interest are made, they apply to quarters starting at least one month following the date the regulations were made by the Governor General by Order in Council. Regulations that reduce the rate may apply for the current quarter if made at least one month before the end of the quarter. 8. In accordance with the Act, I recommend that the regulations to lower the rate have ef fect from 1 July 2020 – the beginning of the next quarter. Because this is a reduction of the rate, the regulations could be made as late as 31 August 2020 and still have effect from 1 July 2020. Therefore, no waiver of the 28-day rule is required. Compliance 9. The regulations comply with each of the following, where applicable: 9.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi No t applicable 9.2 the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 No t applicable 9.3 the Human Rights Act 1993 Not applicable 9.4 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 Not applicable 9.5 relevant international standards and obligations Not applicable 9.6 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Complies Regulations Review Committee 10. Officials consider that there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 11. The regulations have been certified by Parliamentary Counsel as being in order for sub mission to Cabinet. Impact Analysis 12. The proposal is of a minor and mechanical nature and does not substantially alter exi sting arrangements. Therefore, a regulatory impact assessment is not required. 13. The proposal will not increase compliance costs as it is simply a change in the prescribed interest rate. 2 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:24:08 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Publicity 14. Inland Revenue will publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release 15. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key ad vice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 16. The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this paper. Revenue implications 17.

In Confidence 26 May 2020 Minister of Revenue Cabinet paper: Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return on Attributing Interests in Foreign Investment Funds, 2019–20 Income Year) Order 2020 Purpose 1. This report informs you about the required annual change to the deemed rate of return on attributing interests in foreign investment funds. A Cabinet paper is attached that recommends an Order in Council be made to set the deemed rate of return for the 2019–20 income year. Background 2. The Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act) requires the deemed rate of return under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules fo r each income year to be set by Order in Council. 3. New Zealand’s FIF rules tax New Zealand residents on attributed income from non- controlling investments in foreign companies, life insurance policies, and certain superannuation schemes. Since 1 April 2014, most interests in foreign superannuation schemes are taxed on transfer, rather than under the FIF rules. 4. The Act provides a number of different methods to calculate FIF income (or loss) for tax purposes, one of which is the deemed rate of return method. An investor must use the deemed rate of return where: 4.1 The interest consists of certain non-ordinary shares that have debt characteristics; and 4.2 The comparative value method cannot be used because the end-of-year market value of the interest cannot be determined. 5. Under the deemed rate of return method, income from a FIF is calculated each year by multiplying the opening book value of the investment by the rate set annually by Order in Council. 6. An Order in Council is now required to set the deemed rate of return for the 2019– 20 income year. Calculation 7. The method for calculating the annual deemed rate of return was established and approved in 1994 (CAB (94) M 35/3 C(vi) refers) and published in Inland Revenue’s October 1994 Tax Information Bulletin. The calculation involves taking an average of the five-year “risk-free” Government bond rates at the end of each quarter of the income year and adding a risk premium margin of four percentage points. If the last day of a quarter falls on a weekend or statutory holiday, the rate on the next business day is used. 8. Officials recommend that the current method for calculating the deemed rate of return be used again for the 2019–20 income year. It is a simple way of approximating the expected return on foreign equities, incorporating a risk premium IR2020/262: Cabinet paper: Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return on Attributing Interests in Foreign Investment Funds, 2019–20 Income Year) Order 2020 Page 1 of 3 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence of four percentage points above the return on “risk-free” debt such as Government bonds. The method has been used for every income year since 1994. 9. The average of the quarterly five-year Government bond interest rates for the 2019–20 income year is 1.05%. This means that the deemed rate of return for the 2019–20 income year will be 5.05% (1.05% plus four percentage points). This is a decrease from last year’s deemed rate of return, which was 5.86%. Regulatory Impact Analysis 10. A Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required for this Cabinet paper because no policy decision is being sought. The deemed rate of return has been calculated in accordance with a formula that was approved by Cabinet in 1994 (CAB (94) M 35/3 C(vi) refers). Timing 11. Because the deemed rate of return is based on five-year Government bond rates from across the year for which the rate applies, it must always be calculated after the end of the income year but apply retrospectively from the beginning of that year. 12. This Order in Council will enable taxpayers using the deemed rate of return method to calculate their FIF income for the 2019–20 income year and therefore needs to apply retrospectively from 1 April 2019. 13. The attached Cabinet paper is drafted so that the Order in Council complies with the 28-day rule for regulations and therefore comes into force on 6 August 2020. 14. However, officials recommend that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought. Taxpayers that use the deemed rate of return are not able to use the old rate to file a return for the 2019–20 year; they must wait for the new rate to come into force. It is of no benefit to taxpayers or the Government to require some taxpayers to wait an extra 28 days to be able to file a return solely because they are waiting on the rate to come into force. 15. If you agree to recommend a waiver, we will supply you with an updated Cabinet paper. Cabinet paper and associated materials 16. The Cabinet paper and the advice sheet for the Order in Council are attached to this report. These should be signed and referred to the Cabinet Office by 10am, Thursday 25 June 2020, for consideration at the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s meeting on Tuesday 30 June 2020. 17. The Parliamentary Counsel Office will provide copies of the finalised Order in Council directly to the Cabinet Office. 18. A media statement will be issued once the Order in Council has been made. Consultation 19. The Treasury was consulted on the Cabinet paper and agrees with its recommendations.

Background 2.New Zealand’s foreign investment fund (FIF) rules tax New Zealand residents on i ncome from certain foreign investments. There are several methods for calculating the taxpayer’s income or loss from these investments, as set out in legislation. One of these methods is the deemed rate of return method. 3.The deemed rate of return method is used to calculate FIF income or loss from non- ordinary shares with debt-like properties, such as shares that guarantee a return. The method can only be used if the market value of the foreign investment cannot be determined at the end of the income year. 4.Under the deemed rate of return method, income from a FIF is calculated each year b y multiplying the opening book value of the investment by a deemed rate set annually by Order in Council. 5.The method for calculating the annual deemed rate of return was established and a pproved in 1994 (CAB Min (94) 35/3 C(vi) refers) and published in Inland Revenue’s October 1994 Tax Information Bulletin. The calculation involves taking an average of the five-year “risk-free” Government bond rates at the end of each quarter of the income year and then adding a risk premium margin of four percentage points. 6.The current method is a suitable way of approximating the expected return on foreign e quities and has been used for every income year since 1994. Comment 7.The average of the quarterly five-year Government bond interest rates for the 2019– 2 0 income year is 1.05%. The attached Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return on Attributing Interests in Foreign Investment Funds, 2019–20 Income Year) Order 2020 therefore sets the deemed rate of return for the 2019–20 income year at 5.05% (1.05% plus four percentage points) in accordance with the current method of 1 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:27:11 2. \[IN CONFIDENCE\] calculation. This is a decrease from last year’s deemed rate of return, which was 5.86%. Timing 8. The new deemed rate of return should come into force as soon as practicable to allow taxpayers using this rate to file their tax returns as soon as they can. I therefore recommend that the new rate comes into force on 10 July 2020. 9. To ensure a commencement date of 10 July 2020, I recommend that the 28-day rule be waived for the coming into force of this Order. This will ensure that taxpayers using the deemed rate of return method for calculating their income are able to promptly file their tax return using the correct rate for the 2019–20 income year. 10. If a waiver is not agreed to, then taxpayers that use the deemed rate of return method will not be able to file a return until the 28-day period has been satisfied. Taxpayers in this situation are unable to use last year’s deemed rate of return to file for the 2019–20 income year and must wait for the current year’s rate to come into force. 11. It is of no benefit to taxpayers or the Government to require taxpayers using the deemed rate of return to wait an extra 28 days to be able to file their tax return. This would be a source of frustration for taxpayers who want to file their tax returns quickly but are unable to do so. Therefore, I recommend that the 28-day rule be waived. Consultation 12. The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this paper and agrees with its recommendations. Compliance 13. The Order complies with each of the following: 13.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 13.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 13.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 13.4 relevant international standards and obligations; and 13.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Legislative Implications 14. The proposal of this Cabinet paper is that the attached Order in Council be submitted to the Executive Council. 2 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-07-13 12:27:11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Impact Analysis 15.

There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 17. The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the attached Order in Council is in order for submission to Cabinet. Publicity 18. Once the Order in Council is made, Inland Revenue will publish the new rate on their website. Proactive Release 19. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions, subject to minor redactions under the Official Information Act 1982. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1. note that the attached Order in Council sets the deemed rate of return on attributing interests in foreign investment funds at 5.05% for the 2019–20 income year; 2. note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought: 2.1 so that the Order can come into force on 10 July 2020; 2.2 on the grounds that taxpayers using the deemed rate of return method for calculating their income must wait for the 2019–20 rate to come into force, and that it is of no benefit to taxpayers or the Government to require taxpayers using the rate to wait an extra 28 days to be able to file their tax return; 3. agree to waive the 28-day rule so that the Order comes into force on 10 July 2020; 4. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return on Attributing Interests in Foreign Investment Funds, 2019–20 Income Year) Order 2020.

This report asks you to approve and lodge the attached Cabinet paper and accompanying revised disclosure statement with the Cabinet Office by 10 am, Thursday 18 June 2020 for consideration at the Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting on Tuesday 23 June 2020. 2. The Cabinet paper seeks approval to introduce a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) to the Child Support Amendment Bill proposing: 2.1 the repeal of child support incremental penalties, and 2.2 the simplification of the penalty write-off rules in the Child Support Act. 3. In lieu of a regulatory impact analysis (RIA), attached to this report is a supplementary analysis report (SAR) for your information. The SAR will be released with the SOP to improve transparency and understanding of the policy as the amendments go through the legislative process. A RIA is not provided as the temporary suspension of the RIA for COVID-19 policy responses applies to this initiative. Background 4. The Child Support Amendment Bill was introduced in March 2020 and is currently being considered by the Social Services and Community Committee. The proposal to repeal child support incremental penalties was not included in the Bill due to the fiscal cost of repealing incremental penalties. 5. Cabinet has now approved the repeal of incremental penalties as part of the COVID- 19 Response and Recovery Fund Foundation Package (CAB-20-MIN-0219.2 refers). 6. The proposal not to charge incremental penalties also allows for the penalty write- off provisions to be significantly simplified, and these two proposals can be progressed in tandem. 7. You have previously agreed that the child support penalty write-off rules should be simplified to allow for the write-off of penalties when: 7.1 there was a reasonable cause for the late payment; 7.2 the late payment was due to the failure of another person to make a deduction; 7.3 the late payment was due to an honest mistake by the liable parent; 7.4 an error was made by Inland Revenue; 7.5 a person is in serous hardship; or Sensitive - Budget IR2020/290: Cabinet paper – Supplementary Order Paper to the Child Support Amendment Bill – repeal of incremental penalties and simplification of the write off rules Page 2 of 4 SENSITIVE 7.6 it is an inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources to collect the penalty (IR2019/240 and IR2019/334 refer). 8. Further, you have also previously agreed that to ensure parents who are charged penalties on or before 31 March 2021 are not worse off under the new rules, a “fair and reasonable” penalty write-off provision would be retained that would only be used to write off penalties charged on or before 31 March 2021. 9. The proposed application date for the repeal of incremental penalties and the consequential simplification of the penalty write-off rules should be 1 April 2021, which aligns with the application date for the other penalty proposals in the Child Support Amendment Bill. 10. The Cabinet Social Wellbeing Committee authorised you to approve minor technical changes (SWC-19-MIN-0110 refers). Officials consider that this authority extends to approving the inclusion of the simplification of the write-off provisions together with the repeal of child support incremental penalties in the SOP to the Child Support Amendment Bill as it is in large part consequential to the repeal. Approval for an additional amendment 11. You have previously agreed that the child support penalty write-off rules should be simplified to allow for the write-off of penalties when a parent carer has uplifted the debt 1 and a write-off would be fair and reasonable. We recommend that this also apply when a non-parent carer has waived the right to the payment to which the penalty relates, and a write-off would be fair and reasonable. This is consistent with the current write-off provisions. Timing 12. We recommend that the SOP be introduced on the same day that Cabinet approves it for introduction. This will allow the most time for the Social Services and Community Committee to consider the SOP. To achieve same day introduction, 1 Uplifting debt means that a payee agrees that Inland Revenue does not pursue a debt. In these cases, the debt becomes directly payable to the receiving carer rather than being paid via Inland Revenue. Example Rhea is a non-parent carer who provides full time care for her granddaughter Athena. Both of Athena’s parents are liable to pay child support for her. Athena’s mother, Mere, negotiates a private arrangement with Rhea. Rhea then seeks a payment waiver so that Mere will no longer be liable to pay child support through Inland Revenue. The waiver applies to the full amount of unpaid child support due to Rhea from Mere, whether future amounts or debt. A waiver can only apply to one parent, and Athena’s father is still liable to pay child support. Six months earlier, Mere had been between jobs and unable to pay her child support for two months. Because of the waiver, Mere is no longer required to pay the child support amounts for these two months. The penalties charged on these amounts remain. However, Mere is eligible to have the penalties written off because of the waiver, if it would be “fair and reasonable”.

Policy 2.The Bill was introduced in March 2020 and is currently being considered by the So cial Services and Community Committee. The proposals in the SOP were developed alongside the proposals in the Bill but have been progressed separately as funding was required. 3.As part of its five-year Business Transformation (BT) programme, Inland Revenue is mo dernising its systems and processed to be more flexible and customer-focused. This includes modernising Inland Revenue’s functions in collecting and disbursing child support. Almost all areas that are administered by Inland Revenue (including income tax, GST and Working for Families) have already migrated. 4.The administration of child support is the final major area of Inland Revenue that will mi grate to the new computer system and processes. Migration is scheduled for the start of the child support year in April 2021 (as BT Release 5). 5.The SOP is necessary because amendments to existing legislation are required to i mplement the proposed policy changes. The policy changes are listed below: Policy items with Cabinet approval (CAB-20-MIN-0219.2) 6.Repeal of the child support incremental penalty rules. Items not requiring Cabinet approval 7.Cabinet has authorised me to approve minor technical changes for inclusion in the Bi ll (SWC-19-MIN-0110, CAB-19-MIN-0447). I ask Cabinet to note that I have approved: 7.1 the simplification of the child support penalty write-off rules to allow for write- o ff of child support penalties when: 1 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:32 2. \[SENSITI E\] 7.1.1 there was a reasonable cause for the late payment; 7.1.2 the late payment was due to the failure of another person to make a deduction; 7.1.3 the late payment was due to an honest mistake by the liable parent; 7.1.4 an error was made by Inland Revenue; 7.1.5 a person is in serous hardship; 7.1.6 it is an inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources to collect the penalty; 7.1.7 the receiving carer has waived the right to the payment, or uplifted 1 the debt to which the penalty relates, and a write-off would be fair and reasonable; or 7.1.8 the penalties were charged on or before 31 March 2021 and it is “fair and reasonable” that the penalty be written off. Impact analysis 8. A regulatory impact assessment was not required due to the temporary suspension of RIA requirements for COVID-19 policy responses. However, a supplementary analysis report has been produced to improve transparency and understanding of the policy as the amendments go through the legislative process. Compliance 9. The SOP complies with: 9.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 9.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993; 9.3 the disclosure statement requirements; 9.4 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 9.5 relevant international standards and obligations; and 9.6 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. 1 In these cases, the debt becomes directly payable to the receiving carer rather than being paid via Inland Revenue. 2 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:32 \[SENSITI E\] Consultation Relevant government departments or other public bodies 10. As part of the Cabinet paper Business Transformation — Amendments to the Child Support Act 1991, officials consulted with the Treasury, Ministry of Social Development, Oranga Tamariki — Ministry for Children (as Inland Revenue collects child support for beneficiaries and wards of the State), the Ministry of Justice, and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (Child Poverty Unit). These agencies were consulted on all the proposals relating to debt and penalties in that paper, and generally agreed with the proposals. Relevant private sector organisations and public consultation processes 11. Although it did not canvass this specific proposal, the 2017 discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy (the discussion document) explored proposals for not penalising people who are trying to comply, and better support early intervention to prevent debt. The discussion document was subject to wider consultation. 12. The discussion document canvassed proposals relating to Working for Families and student loans as well as child support. It generated 37 email submissions, 183 comments on online forums, 374 responses to the surveys and one response to the foreign language surveys. Inland Revenue officials held 17 face-to-face meetings with stakeholders. 13. Submitters generally supported the proposals in the discussion document. Binding on the Crown 14. The Child Support Act 1991 is binding on the Crown. The amendments will follow the position of the principal Act. Creating new agencies or amending law relating to existing agencies 15. The legislation will not create a new agency. 16. The legislation will not amend the existing coverage of the Ombudsman Act 1975, the Official Information Act 1982, or the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987. Allocation of decision making powers 17. The draft legislation does not involve the allocation of decision-making powers between the executive, the courts, and tribunals. Other instruments 18. The SOP does not include any provision empowering the making of other instruments that are deemed to be legislative or disallowable instruments. 3 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:32 \[SENSITI E\] Definition of Minister/Department 19. The SOP does not contain a definition of Minister, department, or chief executive. Commencement of legislation 20. Each provision of the SOP comes into force on 1 April 2021. There will be appropriate transition provisions relating to penalties imposed before 1 April 2021. Parliamentary stages 21. The Bill was introduced in March 2020 and has been referred to the Social Services and Community Committee 22. I recommend that the SOP be released as soon as possible and referred to the Social Services and Community Committee. Publicity 23. Inland Revenue will publish a supplementary commentary to the Bill to provide more information on this topic. If enacted, Inland Revenue will include details of the new legislation in a Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive release 24. I propose that proactive release of this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers occur once the SOP is released. Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1. note that the SOP makes substantive, remedial, and technical amendments to the Child Support Act 1991; 2. note that the I have approved the following minor or technical changes under delegated Cabinet authority: 2.1 the simplification of the child support penalty write-off rules to allow for write- off of child support penalties when: 2.1.1 there was a reasonable cause for the late payment; 2.1.2 the late payment was due to the failure of another person to make a deduction; 2.1.3 the late payment was due to an honest mistake by the liable parent; 2.1.4 an error was made by Inland Revenue; 2.1.5 a person is in serous hardship; 4 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:32 \[SENSITI E\] 2.1.6 it is an inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources to collect the penalty; 2.1.7 the receiving carer has uplifted the debt, or waived the right to the payment, to which the penalty relates and a write-off would be fair and reasonable; or 2.1.8 the penalties were charged on or before 31 March 2021 and it is “fair and reasonable” that the penalty be written off. 3. approve the release of the Supplementary Order Paper to the Child Support Amendment Bill. Authorised for lodgement Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue 5 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:32 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 1 \[SENSITIVE\] Coversheet: Supplementary Analysis Report — Repeal of child support incremental penalties and simplification of penalty write-off rules Sum m ar y: Pr o bl em an d Pr o po sed Ap pr o ach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? A key aim of the child support scheme is to support liable parents to meet their child support obligations. To encourage compliance with the scheme, late payment penalties are charged on overdue child support payments. 1 Two types of penalties are applied: •initial penalties, which are applied in two stages: othe greater of 2% of the outstanding amount or $5 the day after the due date; and oa subsequent 8% of the outstanding amount eight days after the due date. •incremental penalties, which are applied at: o2% of the outstanding amount including penalties from one month after the due date for the next 12 months; and o1% of the outstanding amount including penalties each month from 13 months after the due date. This Supplementary Analysis Report (SAR) covers three areas where the repeal of incremental penalties offers benefits for both child support customers and Inland Revenue. The proposal offers the benefits of: •improving liable parent compliance and engagement with the scheme; •creating simplification opportunities for Business Transformation (BT) Release 5, particularly by enabling simplification of the child support penalty write-off rules; and •alleviating pressure on Inland Revenue to deliver policy responses to COVID-19 by reducing transactions and customer contacts. Incremental penalties do not support liable parents to meet their obligations Research 2 undertaken by Inland Revenue shows that many customers feel that the current penalty rules are overly punitive and complex. Because incremental penalties compound and create further debt for liable parents, it can lead to them disengaging with the scheme and their debt spiralling. Inland Revenue considers that the policy of charging incremental penalties does not support liable parents to meet their obligations. Inland Revenue considers 1 Under the Child Support Act, Inland Revenue administers payments of financial support – that is, both child support and domestic maintenance. Domestic maintenance refers to payments made by a person to a former partner under both Court Orders registered in the New Zealand Family Courts and voluntary agreements. Throughout this document the term “child support” is used to refer to financial support for readability purposes. 2 Changing Penalties to Incentivise Child Support Payment, 2019. The research consisted of 27 one-on-one interviews around the country. The interviewees were a mix of liable parents and receiving carers, and a mix of levels of income including beneficiaries. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 3. Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 2 \[SENSITIVE\] that other approaches - including measures to “get it right from the start” - will be more effective. As at January 2019, the child support debt was $2.2 billion, of which $558 million was unpaid child support and $1.6 billion was penalties. Currently, most penalties can be written off – for example, if the person complies with a payment arrangement for 26 weeks. In the child support year 1 April 2018-31 March 2019, Inland Revenue wrote off $244 million in child support penalties. This is down from the $594 million written off in the 2017-2018 child support year, but will increase again in 2020 and 2021 as we focus more on resolving historical debt cases to minimise the impacts of converting data to go into our new system, START. The recovery of debt is challenging and currently 97 percent of child support penalty debt is written down at initial recognition as we do not expect to collect the debt. Repealing incremental penalties is a key simplification opportunity for Business Transformation Release 5 As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation (BT) programme to modernise the tax system, the child support scheme will move to new systems and processes in 2021 (Release 5). Alongside this process, the Child Support Amendment Bill has been introduced containing proposals to take advantage of the opportunity created by BT to improve and simplify the administration of the child support scheme. The current proposal was developed alongside the proposals in the Child Support Amendment Bill but has been progressed separately as it requires funding; it should be considered alongside the proposals in the Bill. 3 As a consequence of repealing incremental penalties, the child support penalty write-off rules can be considerably simplified. The current rules are highly complex, both for customers to understand and Inland Revenue to administer. The complexity of these rules is reflected in that the incremental penalty and write-off rules are some of the most complex code in Inland Revenue’s FIRST IT system (in which child support is currently administered). With no change, moving child support to Inland Revenue’s new IT system (START) will require us to write and configure bespoke code. This increases the cost and risk profile of Release 5, with increased build and testing effort. In the long run, having bespoke configuration will increase the ongoing administrative cost as Inland Revenue must undertake additional work each time a version upgrade to the system is implemented. Repealing incremental penalties would simplify the penalty and write-off rules and reduce the complexity they present for the BT Release 5 IT build. Repealing incremental penalties will reduce transactions and allow Inland Revenue to focus on implementing COVID-19 policy responses With the advent of COVID-19, the repeal of incremental penalties has been reprioritised along the COVID-19 funding track as it will allow Inland Revenue to focus on implementing other COVID-19 policy responses. 3 Regulatory Impact Assessment for the proposals in the Child Support Amendment Bill: http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2020-ria-child-support.pdf 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 3 \[SENSITIVE\] The proposal will do so by reducing the high volume of transactions created for Inland Revenue by the current penalty rules. In the 12-month period to 31 December 2019, 41 million penalty or penalty write-off transactions were applied to the accounts of about 105,000 liable parents with child support debt – an average of 390 transactions per customer per annum. Inland Revenue estimates that we manage around 62,000 customer contacts per annum in relation to child support penalty write offs. As noted above, most penalties are written off. Repealing incremental penalties would eliminate these transactions and reduce customer contacts. This would alleviate pressure on Inland Revenue to deliver the COVID-19 policy responses which have been agreed to. Summary of Preferred Option or Conclusion (if no preferred option) How will the agency’s preferred approach work to bring about the desired change? Why is this the preferred option? Why is it feasible? The preferred option is to repeal incremental penalties from the child support scheme and simplify the write-off rules, alongside other measures in the Child Support Amendment Bill. This is the preferred option because it offers the greatest simplicity, and is the option which will maximise the benefits for customers and Inland Revenue. Secti o n B: Su mm ar y I m p acts: Ben efi ts an d co sts Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The parents, carers and children in the scheme are expected to benefit from the proposed change As at March 2020 the child support customer base was made up of: • 163,429 liable parents (including 29,067 with debt only); • 135,617 receiving carers; and • 182,233 children. The proposal will make the penalty rules simpler and less punitive, and is therefore expected to improve compliance. In theory, a benefit to imposing incremental penalties is that it may (even if they are written- off) encourage liable parents to contact Inland Revenue, and Inland Revenue can then help them comply in their circumstances. However, because child support is due each month, if a person is late paying month-after-month there already opportunities to engage with the person when initial penalties are imposed. Therefore, in this respect, no benefits are offered by charging incremental benefits. Although penalties are intended to discourage non-compliance, research 4 undertaken by Inland Revenue suggests that they can have the opposite effect. This is because incremental penalties compound causing debt to grow continuously, often resulting in customers 4 Changing Penalties to Incentivise Child Support Payment, 2019. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 4 \[SENSITIVE\] disengaging with the scheme. In many cases, the amount of the penalties owed is significantly larger that the unpaid child support. Improved compliance would benefit all those in the scheme; liable parents would be penalised less, and receiving carers could have more certainty and timeliness in receiving payments, which contributes to the welfare of their children. Inland Revenue would also benefit from the proposed change Inland Revenue would also benefit from the repeal of incremental penalties as a major simplification measure to support the implementation of child support in BT Release 5. Implementing the current incremental penalty and write-off rules in the new system presents great complexity for, and therefore greater cost and risk profile to, BT release 5 when compared to the option of repealing incremental penalties and simplifying the write-off rules. Further, the number of transactions on customers’ accounts and customer contacts resulting from penalties represent considerable administrative resources for Inland Revenue. Repealing incremental penalties would reduce transactions for Inland Revenue and alleviate the pressure on Inland Revenue to deliver the COVID-19 responses that have been committed to. In the long-term, the preferred option would enable version upgrades to the new system to be implemented with less work, and therefore less cost. Where do the costs fall? Repealing incremental penalties has a fiscal cost to the Government of $2m per annum. Simplification of the write-off rules has no fiscal cost. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts? how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? Some liable parents may not respond as expected to the repeal of incremental penalties and levels of compliance could reduce. We do not think this is likely. If our expectations are incorrect, this can be mitigated by use of customer education, existing enforcement provisions and improved information made available through Inland Revenue’s BT programme. Initial penalties will still be charged. These will continue to discourage non- compliance and provide Inland Revenue an opportunity to contact the liable parent to get them back on track. Certain proposals in the Child Support Amendment Bill, which is also intended to support BT release 5, are intended to improve compliance (for example, the proposed compulsory deductions of child support from payments made by employers to newly liable parents). These proposals would further mitigate any reduction in compliance due to the removal of incremental penalties. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 5 \[SENSITIVE\] Secti o n C: Evid en c e cer tain ty an d q u ali ty assu r an c e Agency rating of evidence certainty? Inland Revenue has a medium–high level of confidence in the evidence base. The key uncertainty is the impact of repealing incremental penalties on customer behaviour, which cannot easily be modelled However, literature suggests that measures designed and perceived to be fairer are more likely to lead to better compliance outcomes. Research conducted by Inland Revenue with child support liable parents and receiving carers 5 indicated that penalties had a role to play in encouraging compliance but that the overly punitive nature of the current penalties and the complexity of the penalty rules acted as a barrier to compliance. Inland Revenue collects data relating to numbers of liable parents, compliance levels, debt and penalties imposed. This data has been used to estimate the potential direct impacts of removing incremental penalties. Some of the administrative data is manually input and therefore subject to errors. However, their impact should be minor and would not change the “dollar” value of the impacts.

The purpose of this report is to explain the policy rationale and development behind the repeal of incremental penalties and simplification of the write-off provisions as a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) was not required for these proposals. This was because the repeal of incremental penalties was subject to the temporary suspension of RIA requirements for direct COVID-19 responses, and the simplification of the write-off rules is consequential to that proposal. Inland Revenue has produced this report to improve transparency and understanding of the policy as the amendments go through the legislative process; it has not been used to inform Cabinet’s final decisions to proceed with a policy change. 1.2 Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The key uncertainty is the impact of repealing incremental penalties on customer behaviour, which cannot easily be modelled. However, research conducted by Inland Revenue with child support liable parents and receiving carers 6 indicated that the overly punitive nature of the current penalties and the complexity of the penalty rules acted as a barrier to compliance. 1.3 Responsible Manager (signature and date): Carolyn Elliott Policy Lead Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 4 June 2020 6 Changing Penalties to Incentivise Child Support Payment, 2019. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 7 \[SENSITIVE\] Secti o n 2: Pr obl em d efi ni ti o n an d o bj ecti ve s 2.1 What is the current state within which action is proposed? Inland Revenue’s multi-year business transformation (BT) programme is modernising the administration of New Zealand’s revenue system. Once complete, customers will spend far less time and effort ensuring they meet their obligations and receive their correct social policy entitlements. Child support is part of BT release 5, which provides an opportunity to review how the revenue system is administered and consider what changes may be needed. The Government is also concerned with improving the welfare of children and minimising the impact of government agency debt on New Zealanders. Further to these, the Child Support Amendment Bill (the Bill) is currently part way through its first reading. The proposed repeal of incremental penalties relates to the proposals in the Bill aimed at improving compliance; however, the repeal is being progressed separately as it requires funding. Unlike the proposals in the Bill, the repeal of incremental penalties can be implemented in Inland Revenue’s current IT system, and its benefits can be realised sooner. Consequently, it is intended for it to be progressed in a different legislative vehicle. The child support scheme and penalties The child support scheme works to ensure that children are appropriately supported by both their parents even when they are not living together as a family. Inland Revenue assesses, collects and disburses payments. As part of the assessment process Inland Revenue will identify the liable parent (the parent responsible for making the child support payment) and the receiving carer (the parent (or other carer) entitled to receive the child support payment). Most liable parents do, or are willing to, comply with their child support obligations, but at times may have trouble meeting their payments. For example, 70 percent of payments are made on time; 81.5 percent of child support payments assessed in a year are paid within that year (which increases to 85 percent if only considering child support payable by parents living in New Zealand). Although some payments are late, it illustrates liable parents are generally trying to comply. However, when a liable parent does not pay or pay on time they are charged initial late payment penalties and continue to be charged incremental penalties each month until they pay or come to an arrangement to pay the outstanding amount. The financial burden when a liable parent does not pay falls on the receiving carers and their children. As at January 2019, child support debt was $2.2 billion, of which $558 million was core child support debt and $1.6 billion was penalties. Currently, most penalties can be written off – for example, if the person complies with a payment arrangement for 26 weeks. In the child support year 1 April 2018-31 March 2019, Inland Revenue wrote off $244 million in child support penalties. This is down from the $594 million written off in the 2017-2018 child support year, but will increase again in 2020 and 2021 as we focus more on resolving historical debt cases to minimise the impacts of converting data to go into our new system, START. The recovery of debt is challenging and currently 97 percent of child support 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 8 \[SENSITIVE\] penalty debt is written down at initial recognition as Inland Revenue does not expect to collect the debt. In the 12-month period to 31 December 2019, 41 million penalty or penalty write-off transactions were applied to the accounts of about 105,000 liable parents with child support debt - an average of 390 transactions per customer per annum. Inland Revenue estimates that we manage around 62,000 customer contacts per annum in relation to child support penalty write offs. Incremental penalties are mostly written-off. Changes introduced to penalties and write-offs in 2015 have slowed the growth of child support debt but primarily through write-offs and reducing penalty charges rather than addressing debt prevention. Write-offs have been successful as an incentive to get some parents to re-engage with the scheme but are not effective at preventing debt. Some liable parents are concerned that the rules do not encourage them to comply with their child support payments and at times could promote non-compliance. This is because the rules are complex. Receiving carers are most concerned about the non-payment of child support as it impacts on their ability to support their children. 2.2 What regulatory system(s) are already in place? Child Support Act 1991 The New Zealand administrative child support scheme has been in place since July 1992. The key feature of the regulatory system is to assess, collect and disburse child support in accordance with the Child Support Act 1991. The key objective of child support is to ensure that children are appropriately supported by both their parents even when they are not living together as a family. Any parent or carer can make an application for a child support assessment. Using a formula that is legislated for under the Act, Inland Revenue assesses which parent is liable for a child support payment (the liable parent) and which parent will receive child support payments (the receiving carer), and the amount to be paid by the liable parent. This formula includes components such as the income of each parent, the age of the child, and how much care of the child each parent does. Changes were made in the child support reforms (effective 1 April 2015) to modernise the scheme and improve fairness, primarily through changes to the formula assessment and by assessing the income and other circumstances of both parents (rather than just the liable parent). Once Inland Revenue has determined who the liable parent is, the liable parent must make the child support payment to Inland Revenue. Child support payments are due to Inland Revenue monthly. Inland Revenue then passes the payment on to the receiving parent. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 9 \[SENSITIVE\] When payments are not made, or not made on time, the financial burden generally falls on carers and their children. 7 Penalties and other tools (such as contact by Inland Revenue and compulsory deductions for defaulting liable parents) are used by Inland Revenue to encourage compliance. Initial late payment penalties apply if a payment is not paid on time. In addition to the initial late payment penalties, for each subsequent month that the child support remains outstanding (with no repayment arrangement in place), compounding incremental penalties are also applied (initially at 2 percent, but reduced to 1 percent after 12 months). International agreements There is a reciprocal agreement with Australia which allows for the enforcement of payments when a liable parent moves to Australia or a parent liable under the Australian child support scheme moves to New Zealand. Further, the Family Proceeding Act 1980 details the rules for recognition of overseas maintenance orders made in Commonwealth countries as well as countries that are parties to the United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance (UNCRAM). Finally, New Zealand signed the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other forms of Domestic Maintenance on 27 November 2019. Generally, a child support assessment is raised under the jurisdiction of the country in which the receiving carer resides; when Inland Revenue administers the child support assessment, initial and incremental penalties are applied to overdue payments. Why is Government regulation preferable? Government regulation in the form of the Child Support Act is preferable because parents may not be able to come to agreement between themselves regarding the support of their children. Because the existing penalty rules are imposed by legislation, they require legislation to be repealed. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? On balance, the New Zealand child support scheme has been very successful in collecting assessed child support debt. Since the scheme’s introduction in 1992, Inland Revenue has collected 89 percent of all the child support payments assessed by Inland Revenue. This rate compares very favourably internationally. However, the child support debt remains substantial. The table below illustrates the value of overall child support debt and the proportion made up of penalties: 7 If the receiving carer is a sole parent beneficiary or in receipt of an Unsupported Child’s Benefit, their child support is retained by the Crown to offset the cost of their benefit. Therefore, in these cases the impact is on Government revenue. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 10 \[SENSITIVE\] Mar 16 Sept 16 Mar 17 Sept 17 Mar 18 Sept 18 Mar 19 Assessment debt $651m $633m $621m $596m $579m $562m $558m Penalty debt $2.67b $2.59b $2.48b $2.03b $1.80b $1.65b $1.66b Penalties as % of debt 80% 80% 80% 77% 76% 75% 75% Total debt $3.3b $3.2b $3.1b $2.6b $2.4b $2.2b $2.2b Further, the current penalty rules are perceived to be overly harsh. The imposition of penalties means that some people stop interacting with Inland Revenue and do nothing, resulting in spiralling debt and further disengagement. Finally, the current penalty and write-off rules present considerable complexity for the move of child support to the new system. The system load of the high volume of transactions (41 million per annum) created on customers’ accounts currently caused by, and the high number of customer contacts (around 62,000 per annum), regarding penalties and write- offs, represent considerable administrative resource for Inland Revenue. 2.4 What do stakeholders think about the problem? The main stakeholders are parents and carers who are in the child support scheme. Inland Revenue has undertaken research to determine what interventions would encourage customers to comply with their child support obligations and why currently compliant customers comply. 8 The options canvassed ranged from removing all penalties through to removing incremental penalties and changes to initial penalties. This research showed that customers felt that penalties are necessary to encourage compliance. There were concerns that if no penalties were applied when child support is not paid on time, people would stop complying – that is, penalties are needed as an incentive to keep child support “top of mind”. However, customers felt that Inland Revenue was too quick to penalise customers and the penalties imposed are too high. Many customers did not understand the rules and therefore did not understand how to “fix things”. Customers felt that the rules need to provide “clarity, flexibility and the perception that Inland Revenue is working with customers.” The discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy was released in July 2017, and contained proposed approaches to social policy debt management that included no longer charging penalties and interest in certain situations and supported an early intervention approach aimed at debt prevention. However, it did not canvass the specific proposal to repeal incremental penalties put forward here. Submitters broadly agreed with the proposals, and supported Inland Revenue working proactively with customers to manage debt. 8 Changing Penalties to Incentivise Child Support Payment, 2019. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 11 \[SENSITIVE\] 2.5 What are the objectives sought in relation to the identified problem? The key objectives are to encourage engagement and compliance with the scheme, simplify the rules, and make them fairer. And further, to realise fully the benefits made available by the opportunity offered in the move of the child support scheme to Inland Revenue’s new system as part of BT release 5. Secti o n 3: O p ti on i d en ti fi cati o n 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? Option 1: Maintain the status quo with some operational improvements offered by BT Release 5 including better education, improved statements and better online content. Option 2: Charge no incremental penalties. This option would help prevent debt increasing to levels which cause customers not to engage with Inland Revenue on managing that debt as they feel it is unmanageable. It would also slow the growth of the debt book. Further, it would allow for simplification of the write-off rules. Initial penalties would still be charged, and would continue to discourage non-compliance and provide Inland Revenue an opportunity to contact the liable parent to get them back on track. Option 3: Charge neither initial nor incremental penalties. This option would slow the escalation of the debt book due to the accumulation of penalty growth but could increase the value of assessment debt. It would also mean no penalty or write-off rules would need to be built for the new system. It could mean some liable parents stop paying altogether. Research 9 conducted showed penalties do play a part in incentivising compliance by keeping child support “front of mind”. Charging no penalties may reduce compliance with the scheme. Option 3: Lowering the rate at which incremental penalties are charged. This option would slow the escalation of the debt book, but is unlikely to have much impact on preventing debt in the first instance and improving compliance behaviours and would have no impact on simplifying the write-off rules. Option 4: Do not apply penalties by default and start applying penalties if the customer falls into arrears more than a certain number of times per year. This option may slow the escalation of the debt book, however it could encourage occasional non-compliance as liable parents would have a certain number of instances 9 Changing Penalties to Incentivise Child Support Payment, 2019. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 12 \[SENSITIVE\] they could default without being penalised. As such, it may reduce compliance and have a negative impact on receiving carers. Further, it would have no impact on simplifying the write-off rules. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The following criteria have been used to assess the likely impact of the options under consideration: Simpler for customers – the option should make the rules simpler for customers to understand. Impact on compliance – the option should have a positive impact on compliance with the child support scheme and incentivise timely payment. Administration costs – the option should result in simpler penalty and write-off rules which will be easier to build for the Inland Revenue’s new system. Effectiveness – the option should lead to a reduction in the child support debt. The balance between having penalties to incentivise timely payment and not having overly punitive rules presents a trade-off. While research does suggest that overly punitive penalty rules discourage compliance and engagement with the scheme, too lenient rules could reduce compliance with the scheme. While simplification of the penalty and write-off rules presents significant benefits for BT release 5, and to slow the escalation of the debt book, this is secondary to the primary purpose of having penalties: to encourage compliance with the scheme. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? Several other changes to the penalty rules canvassed in the research document Changing Penalties to Incentivise Child Support Payment and the discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy are being progressed separately in the Child Support Amendment Bill. This is because they did not require funding, whereas the proposal to repeal incremental penalties does. Simplification of the write-off rules was also not progressed alongside the proposals in the Child Support Amendment Bill because it is consequential to, and dependent on, the repeal of incremental penalties. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 13 \[SENSITIVE\] Secti o n 4: Im p act An al ysi s Marginal impact: How does each of the options identified in section 3.1 compare with taking no action under each of the criteria set out in section 3.2? Status quo Repeal incremental penalties Repeal all penalties Apply incremental penalties at a lower rate Allowing a number of defaults before penalties are applied Simpler for customers 0 ++ This approach would greatly reduce the complexity of the existing penalty rules for customers as they will only need to understand one set of penalty rules (initial penalties). + Mechanically, this approach would be easier for customers to understand, however carers could struggle to see the rationale for not penalising non-compliance. 0 Customers would still need to understand the underlying rules, just at different penalty rates. - Customers would need to understand the same rules, with increased complexity in knowing when penalties will be applied. Impact on compliance 0 + Repeal of incremental penalties is expected to improve compliance. However, it is possible that it could remove a further incentive for some parents to comply. - - Penalties play an important role in incentivising timely payment and keeping child support top of mind. 0 Inland Revenue research 10 notes that child support customers find it hard to quantify percentages and prefer thinking in dollar figures; the difference between (for instance) 2 percent and 1 percent might not be meaningful enough to customers to change their attitudes. - This approach could decrease compliance as liable parents would have a certain number of times when they could default without being penalised. Simpler for R5 IT build 0 ++ This approach would mean that the current, complex incremental penalty rules will not need to be built for the new system, and will enable simplification of the write-off rules. ++ This approach would mean that no penalty or write-off rules would need to be built for the new system. 0 Largely similar penalty and write-off rules would need to be built for child support in the new system. - The current penalty and write-off rules would need to be built for the new system, as well as additional rules to know when to apply penalties. Reduction in child support debt 0 ++ This approach would have a significant impact on penalty debt as the amount of penalties charged would be greatly reduced. The expected positive impact on compliance would also help lessen overdue child support payments. ++ This approach would greatly slow the growth of penalty debt as no new penalties would be charged. However, the likely negative impact on compliance would likely increase the amount of unpaid child support. + Because incremental penalties would be applied at lower rates, the amount of penalties charged would be less. 0 Although fewer penalties would be applied at first, the likelihood that this approach could encourage occasional non-compliance would lessen the impact of that. Overall assessment This option would be unlikely to deliver significant improvements on current state. This option is able to realise the benefits of simpler penalty and write-off rules for both customers and Inland Revenue, while also likely having a positive impact on compliance. The likely negative impact on compliance by removing all penalties outweighs any benefits of this proposal. This option would slow the escalation of the debt book, but is unlikely to have much impact on preventing debt in the first instance and improving compliance behaviours. Further, it would not address the concerns of simplicity for customers and BT release 5. This option would add complexity to the current rules, while not offering improvements to compliance.

On the basis of the above analysis, the preferred option is to repeal incremental penalties from the child support scheme (Option 2). This option is best able to meet policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits. That is, the benefits of simpler penalty rules for both customers and Inland Revenue, particularly in allowing for simpler write-off rules, and improvements in compliance with the scheme. Inland Revenue has high confidence that the rules will be simpler for customers to understand, and for child support to be implemented in the new system, if incremental penalties are repealed. Research suggests that removing incremental penalties will improve compliance. 11 Research undertaken by Inland Revenue shows that customers felt that penalties are necessary to encourage compliance. 12 There were concerns that if no penalties were applied when child support is not paid on time, people would stop complying – that is, penalties are needed as an incentive to keep child support “top of mind”. However, customers felt that Inland Revenue was too quick to penalise customers and the penalties imposed are too high. Many customers did not understand the rules and therefore did not understand how to “fix things”. Customers felt that the rules need to provide “clarity, flexibility and the perception that Inland Revenue is working with customers.” The proposal to repeal incremental penalties was mentioned at a high level in the Regulatory Impact Assessment for proposals in the Child Support Amendment Bill. 13 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach 11 Changing Penalties to Incentivise Child Support Payment, 2019. 12 Changing Penalties to Incentivise Child Support Payment, 2019. 13 Regulatory Impact Assessment: Child Support Business Transformation, pp 17-8.

High High 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 16 \[SENSITIVE\] 5.3 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? A potential risk is that liable parents may not respond as expected to the repeal of incremental penalties and levels of compliance could reduce. We do not think this is likely. If our expectations are incorrect, this can be mitigated by use of customer education, existing enforcement provisions and improved information made available through Inland Revenue’s BT programme. Initial penalties will still be charged, which will continue to discourage non-compliance and provide Inland Revenue an opportunity to contact the liable parent to get them back on track. Certain proposals in the Child Support Amendment Bill, which is also intended to support BT release 5, are intended to improve compliance (for example, the proposed compulsory deductions of child support from payments made by employers to newly liable parents). These proposals would further mitigate any reduction in compliance due to the removal of incremental penalties. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 17 \[SENSITIVE\] Secti o n 6: Im pl em en tati o n an d op er ati o n 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The proposal would require amendment to the Child Support Act 1991. It is intended that the preferred option be included in a Supplementary Order Paper to the Child Support Amendment Bill. The proposed changes would apply from April 2021, which aligns with the application date for the proposals in the Child Support Amendment Bill and also the go-live date of BT Release 5. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the operation of these options and they will form part of its business as usual function. Although not the key driver, the preferred option will reduce the implementation risks associated with transferring the child support scheme from the current computer platform to the new systems and processes. Incremental penalties charged before the application date of the repeal would remain. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? The implementation will be done by Inland Revenue only. No issues concerning implementation were raised during internal consultation and Inland Revenue considers that repealing incremental penalties will reduce implementation risks for BT Release 5. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 18 \[SENSITIVE\] Secti o n 7: M o ni tori n g, eval u ati o n an d r evi ew 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue already monitors timeliness of child support payments, obligations paid on time (including for newly liable parents), amounts collected and dispersed (including amounts collected through employers). Inland Revenue is currently building a monitoring and evaluation framework for child support. These tools will be used to monitor and evaluate the proposals when they are implemented. Inland Revenue will monitor the effectiveness of the proposed legislation when implemented. If we identify any evidence that suggests the legislation is not operating as intended, we will consider options for addressing the issues raised. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the Generic Tax Policy Process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post-implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. Any necessary changes identified from the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. Inland Revenue is currently building a monitoring and evaluation framework for child support. These tools will be used to monitor and evaluate the proposals when they are implemented. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 I N C O N F I D E N C E LEG-20-MIN-0093 Cabinet Legislation Committee Minute of Decision This document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee USE OF MONEY INTEREST RATES SETTING PROCESS AMENDMENT REGULATION Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit an Order i n Council: Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Amendment Regulations 2020 amending the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulation 1997 to the Executive Council. 2.It is proposed that the Order in Council applies from 9 April 2020. Introducing a zero percent floor 3.Use of money interest is a cornerstone of the tax compliance system in New Z ealand. Taxpayers must pay it if they have underpaid their tax and the Commissioner pays it where tax has been overpaid. The legislated twin objectives of the use of money interest provisions are to: 3.1 fairly compensate the party (either the Crown or the taxpayer) that does not have the use of its money; and 3.2 encourage taxpayers to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. 4.The Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulation 1997 o utlines the method used for setting the overpayment rate (the Commissioner’s paying rate). This method uses the Reserve Bank of New Zealand 90-day bank bill rate minus 100 basis points (1%). 5.There is currently no floor on the calculation of the rate. This means the 90-day bank b ill rate dropping below 1% will cause the Commissioner’s paying rate to be negative. This is a real possibility and this proposal will add a zero percent floor to the method ensuring it is not set at a negative rate. 6.The Commissioner charging negative interest on overpaid tax would likely be p erceived as being inconsistent with the principles of use of money interest – to fairly compensate taxpayers. This would be especially true if the 90-day bill rate were still positive, but the Commissioner’s paying rate was negative. 7.The proposal would be implemented through an Order in Council under the existing l egislative framework in section 120H of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This section outlines that the Governor-General may, by Order in Council, specify the criteria and other requirements by and against which interest rates will be set. 1 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-03-16 11:21:45 IN CONFIDENCE 1. 8. I recommend that the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Amendment Regulations 2020 is made to amend the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulation 1997 to prevent the Commissioner’s paying rate becoming negative. Financial implications 9. There is a potential opportunity cost to the Crown from the introduction of a floor as any revenue that might otherwise potentially be received from a negative UOMI rate will not be received. 10. Assuming the Government would use negative interest rates ahead of the market doing so, the size of this opportunity cost is estimated to be approximately $7 million per year, or $28 million less revenue over the forecast period if such an event is triggered in the near future. This estimate is based on a presumption the lowest the 90-day bill rate will drop to 0.7% by April 2020. 1 Therefore, the cost of this policy change is calculated using the difference between switching the UOMI rate from 0.81% to 0.00% (the floor) and changing the UOMI from 0.81% to -0.3% (the lowest it is currently forecast to reach). Timing and 28-day rule 11. I propose that changes to the Commissioner’s use of money interest paying rate be made from 9 April 2020. The Order would therefore be in accordance with the rule that regulations must not come into force until at least 28 days after they have been notified in the New Zealand Gazette. Compliance 12. The Order complies with: 12.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 12.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 12.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 12.4 relevant international standards and obligations; and 12.5 the Legislation Guidelines, which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. 13. No statutory prerequisite exists for making this Order. Regulations Review Committee 14.

It also proposes a number of technical amendments to the Child Support Act 1991 (the Act). This is the first in a series of reports proposing amendments to the Act as part of the Business Transformation work programme. Background 2.Inland Revenue’s multi-year transformation programme will modernise New Zealand’s revenue system. Once complete, customers will spend far less time and effort ensuring they meet their obligations and receive their correct social policy entitlements. 3.Business transformation is enabled by a combination of changes to policy, process, technology and the organisation design of Inland Revenue. It is far more than an upgrade of technology and has provided the opportunity to fundamentally review how the revenue system is administered and consider what changes may be needed. 4.It is currently planned that the child support scheme will move to the new system and processes, in April 2021. This creates opportunities to improve the administration of the scheme at the same time. 5.In July 2017, the previous Government released the discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy (the discussion document). One of the issues contained in the document was that child support deductions from employees’ wages would be compulsory for all domestic liable parents in the same way as PAYE and student loan deductions are made. 6.This report proposes advancing the compulsory deductions policy change and two other minor or technical measures: •improvements to the income estimation provisions; and •improvements to debt offsetting. 7.In report IR2019/050 we noted we would report on a proposal to limit the back- dating of some changes of circumstances. However, reporting on this issue ha s b een deferred to a post-budget report so it can be considered along with other items intended to improve surety of assessment. We had also intended to include in this report a proposal to repeal a redundant court order provision, however furthe r c onsultation is required with the Ministry of Justice. In Confidence IR2019/125: Business Transformation, Child support, better payment options and remedial items Page 2 of 5 Co mment Compulsory deductions 8.The discussion document proposed that child support deductions from employees’ wages would be compulsory for all domestic liable parents. Compulsory employer deductions of child support were descoped from the 2013 child support reform s largely because the monthly PAYE system meant they could not be effectively administered. This is because Inland Revenue must first calculate and notify a person’s employer of the amount to be deducted. The monthly employer reportin g f or PAYE meant Inland Revenue may not know about a person’s employer soon enough to notify them before the initial payments are required. This is in contrast, for example, to student loans when the borrower provides their employer with a tax code advising a loan payment is required and a percentage is deducted from each pay from the start. 9.As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation, from 1 April 2019 pay-day reporting will be mandatory. This means PAYE details will be provided to Inlan d R evenue following each pay day. This change should mean Inland Revenue can eff ectively implement compulsory employer deductions of child support when child support moves to Inland Revenue’s new systems. Deductions are already compulsory for liable parents in receipt of a benefit (including a war pension or NZ Super). Compulsory deductions would assist liable parents first entering the scheme by helping them get their payments right from the start and avoid them going into debt. Currently compliance for new liable parents in the first few months is very low – less than a third pay on time. 10.Eleven written submissions were received on this proposal. Eight supported it, tw o were concerned about compliance costs for employers and one was concerned about privacy. We acknowledge the compliance cost concerns, but note employers are already required to make deductions for PAYE, student loan repayments, ACC an d K iwiSaver. Some employers are already making child support deductions (when a liable parent is in debt or asks for deductions). The proposal to make child support deductions compulsory from the start, aligns child support with these othe r c ompulsory payments. We consider making child support deductions compulsory will only marginally increase compliance costs for employers and only if it increases the number of employees they must make child support deductions for. Officials consider that the compulsory deduction proposal should be progressed. 11.However, in some cases it may not be appropriate for child support to be deducte d f rom a person’s salary or wages – for example, if they have multiple employers o r f or privacy reasons. Officials recommend that in such cases the Commissioner should have the discretion to determine the compulsory deduction rules not apply (and alternative arrangements are made to collect child support). 12.The change would apply to all new child support applications. As part of the transition to the new compulsory deduction rules, if at the time of transition a person is not having child support deducted from their salary and wage income and is compliant with their child support obligations, officials recommend tha t c ompulsory deductions are not made immediately. If the person stops complying or decides to opt in, compulsory deductions would then apply. This would smooth the impact of the change on employers, liable parents and the department. In Confidence IR2019/125: Business Transformation, Child support, better payment options and remedial items Page 3 of 5 Im provements to income estimations 13.Child support assessments are based on a past year’s income. An exception is whe n a p erson’s income in the current year will decrease when compared to the income in the past year. The decrease must be 15% or more. In such cases the person can “estimate,” and elect to use their current income as the basis of their child support assessment. At the end of the year, any estimate is reconciled with the actual income earned in the period of estimation to assess the final child support payment. If a person estimates more than once during the year, each estimation is reconciled separately at the end of the year. We have identified two issues with the estimation rules. 14.First, if a person estimates more than once during the year, when their estimate is reconciled they can be assessed on income that is greater than what they earned in some periods. The issue arises because each period is reconciled using the actual income earned from the date of the estimate to the end of the child support year, rather than the income earned over the period the estimate applies for . Example 1 Samuel has been assessed to pay child support on his past income of $75,000. In April, he is in a lower paying job and estimates he will earn $52,000 over the child support year (1 April – 31 March). In July, Samuel receives a pay increase, so he makes a new estimate to reflect this. Samuel has already earned $13,350 from 1 April to 30 June (his year-to-date income). He estimates he will earn a further $43,500 from 1 July to 31 March (this is annualised to $57,947). Based on this second estimate, Samuel believes his total income for the year will be $56,850 (the amount already earned of $13,350 plus the estimate of $43,500). At the end of the year he actually earned $57,700. The outcome – current state When the first estimate is reconciled for 1 April – 30 June, the income earned for the full year of $57,700 is used. However, Samuel only earned $13,350 in the period, at an annual rate is $53,547. By using his end of year income, Samuel’s liability is increased for the period 1 April – 30 June. He will now have additional child support to pay, due in the next 30 days. 15.T o prevent child support income being overstated, for a person who estimates more than once, year-to-date income could be used to determine the income for the reconciliation of the previous period. To reconcile the final period, the actual income earned in the year less any year-to-date income in the final estimate would be used. Example 2 Using the same facts, when Samuel’s estimate is reconciled for 1 April – 30 June the income he earned $13,350, an annual equivalent of $53,547 is used. This reflects what Samuel earned in those months. The period 1 July – 31 March is reconciled using the income earned of $44,350 (being his total income for the year of $57,700 less the year-to-date amount for the earlier estimation period of $13,350), an annual equivalent of $59,079. In Confidence IR2019/125: Business Transformation, Child support, better payment options and remedial items Page 4 of 5 16.The second issue relates to the policy that an estimation is only accepted from the beginning of the month in which the estimate is received. This can mean that a person new to the child support scheme may lose the opportunity to estimate for periods (generally the previous month), because they receive their notice of assessment or entitlement in a later month. Officials recommend that when a person joins the child support scheme an estimation can be backdated to the start of the assessment if Inland Revenue receives the estimation on or before the first due date for payment. This would mean that a person has at least 30 days to estimate their income when child support is first assessed. Debt offsetting 17.Another issue that was descoped during the child support reforms was debt offsetting. It was intended that amounts owed between parents could be automatically offset. The amendment was repealed due to the low numbers who would qualify and the expense of building the systems changes in FIRST. 18.Instead the offset was replaced with an administrative review ground . A dministrative review is a process where a person’s formula assessment can be changed to better fit a person’s situation. The offset applies if a parent wants the child support they owe the other parent offset (or reduced) by the child support that parent owes them. 19.The number of times the ground has been used is very low, and the provision i s d ifficult to administer. Officials recommend that a provision permitting the Commissioner to initiate an offset of the amount owed would be preferable. The offset would net out child support debts two parents owe each other. The person owing the higher amount would be required to pay the difference. Such a provisio n w ould be simpler, cheaper, easier for customers to understand and would be more effective at reducing debt. Administration, compliance and fiscal costs 20.Generally, the proposals would not have any fiscal implications and would reduce administration and compliance costs as the rules would be easier to understand . Th e exception is compulsory employer deductions which could see a marginal increase in compliance costs for employers from having to make deductions and record and pay the money to Inland Revenue. The increase in the number of deductions would, however, be small relative to the volumes already being processed at the same time to account for PAYE, student loan repayments, ACC and KiwiSaver contributions and for child support payments that are already being deducted by employers. Consultation 21.The Treasury were involved in the development of the proposals contained in the discussion document, including compulsory deductions from salary and wages. They have been informed of the contents of this report. Next steps 22.This report is the first in a series setting out possible changes as part of Busines s T ransformation.

These changes relate to: 1.1 the application of the temporary exemptions from paying child support; 1.2 the removal of unintended outcomes from the use of the mixed age expenditure table in calculating the costs of children and to provide some discretion for Inland Revenue to deal with complex cases where the formula gives unintended outcomes; and 1.3 clarifying the law that a child support assessment ends when a child leaves Oranga Tamariki’s care. Background 2.Inland Revenue’s multi-year transformation programme will modernise New Zealand’s revenue system. Once complete, customers will spend far less time and eff ort ensuring they meet their obligations and receive their correct social policy entitlements. 3.Business transformation (BT) is enabled by a combination of changes to policy, process, technology and the organisation design of Inland Revenue. It is far more than an upgrade of technology and has provided the opportunity to fundamentally review how the revenue system is administered and consider what changes may be needed. 4.It is currently planned that the child support scheme will move to the new system and processes, in April 2021 – BT release 5. This creates opportunities to improve the administration of the scheme at the same time. 5.In July 2017, the previous Government released the discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy (the discussion document). On e of the proposals was to introduce general principle-based discretion to work with social policy customers with unusual circumstances. It was considered discretion would allow Inland Revenue to better apply the law in a way that achieves overall objectives. It was also noted that if a relatively straightforward legislative fix could address an unusual situation this is preferable. Comment 6.Officials previously reported to you on the use of discretions to support customers with unusual or special circumstances \[Report IR2018/237 refers\]. We presented options for introducing either a principle-based general discretion or a more specifi c In Confidence IR2019/241: Business Transformation: Child support – working with customers with unusual circumstances Page 2 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE discretion to deal with child support issues arising as the result of a sex offence. You confirmed a strong preference for more specific discretions. 7.Child support has an administrative review process under which certain circumstances can be considered, for example a parent can ask for a review to have extra costs associated with a child’s special needs taken into account. However, officials have identified other areas where customers with unusual circumstance s co u ld be better supported by specific discretion or remedial legislative amendment. Temporary exemptions from paying child support 8.A person, subject to meeting certain income criteria, can be granted a temporary exemption from paying financial support (child support and domestic maintenance 1 ) if they are under 16 or they are a long-term (13 weeks or more) prisoner or hospital patient. These exemptions are justified on the basis that the person has no capacit y t o earn an income for a limited time, or for those under 16 the law requires they are attending school (which limits their ability to earn). The exemptions do not apply if the liable person has a source of income – for example, interest income over a set threshold. There is allowance for a hospital patient to receive a reduced benefit 2 , o r for a prisoner to receive the small incentive payments the Department of Corrections pays for participating in prisoner employment activities. 9.The current rules mean neither the prisoner or hospital patient exemptions are available to a person overseas. This is because a prisoner must be held in custody in a New Zealand corrections prison or police jail and a hospital patient must be in a New Zealand hospital or residential care facility. Additionally, a person in a similar position to someone in hospital cannot likewise apply for an exemption if they are being cared for in some other facility or in their home. For example, a person may have a terminal illness and be cared for at home while accessing hospice services . 10.O fficials recommend that the exemption rules are updated to remove some of the inequities that result from the current rules by: 10.1 extending the ability to grant a prisoner exemption to a liable person in the overseas equivalent of a New Zealand corrections prison or police jail; and 10.2 introducing discretion to allow Inland Revenue to grant a hospital exemption to a person not receiving an income due to suffering from long-term illness or injury even when they are not in a New Zealand hospital or residential care facility. 11.If the person started to receive an income or Inland Revenue was no longer satisfied the person was suffering from illness or injury, the exemption would end. 12.Officials also recommend the income tests are amended to ensure an exemption is granted to a person living overseas if that person’s only income is analogous to that allowed for a New Zealand based liable person . 1 Domestic maintenance is a payment for ex-spouses or ex-partners, either ordered by the Court or agreed to by the ex-spouses. 2 Long-term hospital patients can receive a benefit at the rate specified in Part 12 of Schedule 4 of the Social Security Act 2018 and qualify for an exemption. This payment is currently $45.28 a week and is provided to cover small personal costs. In Confidence IR2019/241: Business Transformation: Child support – working with customers with unusual circumstances Page 3 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE 13.These changes would align with the original policy intent that long-term prisoners and hospital patients should be given temporary relief from their financial suppor t o bligations given they have no capacity to earn an income. 14.The Act allows a receiving person to ask Inland Revenue to overturn a temporary exemption. This provides a safeguard for situations when a receiving person i s a ware of financial resources that make it just and equitable for the liable person to continue paying even when they would otherwise qualify for an exemption. 15.The proposals to amend exemptions would result in more exemptions being granted although we do not know how many more. More receivers would be entitled to nil child support for a temporary period. In practice, this is what occurs now as a liable person who would qualify for an amended exemption is unlikely to be making payments. The extent to which a receiver will be disadvantaged is likely to be minimal and may be minimised if they are eligible for government support. Child expenditure calculations 16.The child support formula uses expenditure tables to calculate the costs of children. They have been developed based on research that concluded teenagers cost more than younger children and economies of scale apply – that is, each subsequent child costs less. 17.Th ere are three tables – one for children aged 12 and under, one for children aged 13 and older and a ‘mixed age’ table which is the average of the other two, designe d to simplify calculations when children in the child support calculation fall into both age brackets. Also, although the expenditure table is developed using economies of scale the child support formula then provides that total expenditure is divided equally by number of children, rather than identifying the ‘marginal’ costs of each subsequent child. 18.Although the intended result is reached for most, officials are aware of some unintended outcomes. Using the mixed age table means younger children are allocated a portion of the costs intended for older children. When all children are living in the same household the total amount of child support is still appropriate . Wh en older and younger children from the same family have different care arrangements this leads to the person with the older child in their care receiving less support than they should for that child and paying more than they should for the younger child in the other parent’s care. Example Sam and Gina have child support for their children Tom (12) and Sara (9). Tom lives with Sam and Sara lives with Gina. Sam earns $70,000 and Gina $35,000. Using Sam and Gina’s combined income and the expenditure table for children aged 12 and younger Tom and Sara will ‘cost’ their parents $7,600 each for the year. Sam is asked to pay $5,836 for the care of Sara, and Gina is asked to pay $1,763 for the care of Tom. (In practice, Sam is asked to pay Gina the difference of $4,073). Tom turns 13 and as costs for teenagers are higher, child support is reassessed. The mixed age expenditure table is used. The cost of each child is $8,416. Sam is asked to pay $6,463 and Gina is asked to pay $1,952. (Sam will pay Gina $4,511). Some of Tom’s increased cost is allocated to Sara and Sam’s payment goes up. In Confidence IR2019/241: Business Transformation: Child support – working with customers with unusual circumstances Page 4 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE 19.O fficials recommend the repeal of the mixed age table and making consequential updates to the child support formula to reflect this. Costs for a child would be calculated on the child’s age (still accounting for the total number of children) and better reflect that costs are higher for older children. Using the example above, this would mean that when Tom turns 13, the cost for Sara ($7,600) would not change and Sam’s payment would remain $5,863. However, the cost for Tom would increase to $9,232 and Gina’s share of those costs goes up to $2,142. This would not introduce undue complexity as calculations are already done this way for the allowance 3 for parents who have children in more than one child support calculation. 20.Other more complex situations may not be resolved by the repeal of the mixed age table. Rather than attempting to introduce complex legislative fix es each time a new situation is identified, officials recommend the introduction of discretion to allow Inland Revenue to adjust calculations when children from the same family live in different care arrangements and the formula is not achieving the intended outcome. This would allow, f or example, some complex cases to be resolved by identifying the actual marginal costs of subsequent children. 21.There is precedent for this type of provision in the Act. The Act is written on the assumption that a child has two parents and those parents are living apart. Whe n the se assumptions are not correct Inland Revenue must (for the purposes of raising a formula assessment) modify the provisions of the Act to reflect the true position . T his provision has been used administratively to alter formula calculations in situations when a child has only one parent, or the child is living in the care of a non-parent carer, say a grandparent, and their parents have not separated. Children leaving the care of Oranga Tamariki 22.The 2013 child support reforms introduced a formula that assesses both parents to determine child support. Unlike the old formula the new formula does not require a new child support application when a child moves into the care of the liable parent. T his means there is a seamless transition when care of children changes rather than a stopping and starting of child support payments and missed periods of support. 23.However, the practice of ending child support is still applied in situations when a child is in state care. Oranga Tamariki can apply for child support from the parents of children in their care 4 . If a child leaves the care of Oranga Tamariki and is placed in the care of one of their parents, child support is stopped, and a new application is required before it can be re-established. This practice is followed due to potential safety concerns for the child and their carer as notification of the change in carer would be given to the other parent. It allows parents in these cases to make a conscious choice to access child support from the other parent. Officials recommend this practice is clarified in the legislation by specifying that a child leaving Oranga Tamariki’s care explicitly ends a child support assessment. 3 The child support formula provides for a ‘multi-group’ allowance for a parent who has more than one child support calculation. This allowance ensures all of a parent’s children are accounted for in each child support calculation. 4 Oranga Tamariki can apply for child support when they are making payments to a carer under s363 of the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989. Payments to Oranga Tamariki will end when these payments cease. In Confidence IR2019/241: Business Transformation: Child support – working with customers with unusual circumstances Page 5 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE Administration, compliance and fiscal costs 24.The proposals would not have fiscal implications and would reduce compliance and administration costs as they would improve the fairness of the scheme and allow Inland Revenue to better work with customers to achieve appropriate polic y o bjectives. These changes if agreed would be implemented as part of release 5 of Inland Revenue’s BT programme. Implementation costs such as those incurred for communicating policy changes are included in BT. No additional funding is required. Consultation 25.The Treasury was involved in the development of the proposals contained in the discussion document, including the proposal to introduce discretion to deal with unusual circumstances. The Treasury, Ministry of Social Development and Oranga Tamariki have been consulted on the proposals and are comfortable with the recommendations in this report. 26.Five written submissions were received on the proposal to introduce discretions t o b etter work with customers with unusual circumstances. All broadly supported the introduction of more flexibility to work with customers with unusual circumstances. One submitter noted that they strongly supported it and saw it as a “...positive step towards supporting people living in highly vulnerable situations.” Next steps 27.This report is one in a series setting out possible child support amendments as part of Business Transformation. When you have provided feedback on the recommendations in the reports, we will prepare a Cabinet paper with the aim of seeking Cabinet approvals in July 2019 and for amendments to be included in a bill introduced in late 2019. Officials recommend all agreed changes should be effective from 1 April 2021 to align with child support’s move to the new technology platform. 28.Officials recommend that a copy of this report be referred to the Minister of Finance.

It is part of a series of reports proposing amendments to the Child Support Act 1991 as part of the Business Transformation work programme. Background 2.Inland Revenue’s multi-year transformation programme will modernise New Zealand’s revenue system. Once complete, customers will spend far less time and effort ensuring they meet their obligations and receive their correct social policy entitlements. 3.Business transformation is enabled by a combination of changes to policy, process, technology and the organisation design of Inland Revenue. It is far more than an upgrade of technology and has provided the opportunity to fundamentally review how the revenue system is administered and consider what changes may be needed. 4.It is currently planned that the child support scheme wi ll move to the new system and processes in April 2021 – BT release 5. This creates opportunities to improve the administration of the scheme at the same time. Proposals Income definition 5.There are differences between the definition of income that currently applies for child support purposes and that which applies to other social policy products. 6.Officials consider that some of these differences are justified as the purpose of defining income for child support differs to that for other social policy products. 7.For child support, parents’ income is one of the components used to calculate the financial support that should be provided for a child by its parents. It is not a basi s to determine eligibility. In contrast, income is used for Working for Families to determine how much a family receives from the Government. The more a family earns, the less they will be entitled to receive. 8.In this sense, it is less important to capture all possible sources of income for child support (so long as the main ones are captured) and more important to take a balanced approach that considers likely compliance costs and provides some certainty as to payments and entitlements. I R2019/243: Business Transformation: Amending child support definitions Page 2 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE 9.If a parent considers that there is other relevant income that should be taken into a ccount, child support has a provision that allows for them to pursue this via an ad ministrative review . 10.H owever, officials consider it desirable and practicable that the income definition i s a mended to ensure that a wider range of income is taken into account than is currently the case. This would make the rules fairer and easier to understand. 11.For parents whose sole income is from income that has had tax withheld at source, only their employment income is included in their assessment. This means that interest and dividends subject to resident withholding tax is not captured, as it wa s n ot observable until the end of the tax year. By excluding interest and dividends, Inland Revenue can use the previous calendar years’ employment income in the child support assessment. New rules require that interest and dividend income is now reported to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis, so officials recommend the income definition for this group should be widened to include interest and dividends from the preceding calendar year. This would be easy to administer and would not cause undue compliance burden on parents, given this income is already provided to Inland Revenue for tax purposes . 12.O fficials also recommend moving from a taxable income to a net income base for child support. This would mean that tax losses would no longer be carried forward to reduce the income used to calculate child support obligations. Similar amendments would need to be made to the estimation provisions to move them from a taxable to a net income base. One of the objectives of child support is that the level of financial support parents provide for their children in that year is determined according to their relative capacity to pay. It is at odds with tha t o bjective to reduce one parent’s relative capacity to support a child in that year due to tax losses that occurred in an earlier year. Inland Revenue’s administrative review process can currently be used to mitigate the impact of tax losses on the assessment, if appropriate. However, this takes time and additional cost fo r a pplicants and Inland Revenue. 13.These amendments would further ensure that relevant income is taken into account and would create greater alignment with other social policy products. Officials estimate that around 500 to 1000 liable parents would have increased income used in their assessments as a result of this move to using net income. This would also impact the income used to calculate receiving carers’ obligations. H owever, it is expected that fewer receiving carers would be affected, as they are more likely to have earnings solely from benefits or salary and wages. 14.While considering the alignment of the child support income definition with that used for student loans and Working for Families, officials have also identified potential problems with the general “catch-all” provision in relation to “other income” in section MB 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 that applies to Working for Families. The provision is overly complex and leads to parents incorrectly providing in come and receiving reduced entitlements. Officials will undertake further analysis and report to you before the end of this year. I R2019/243: Business Transformation: Amending child support definitions Page 3 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE Maximum age of child 15.The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child defines a child as someone under 18 years old. Legislation for Working for Families and child support generally aligns with this maximum age, but allows for it to be extended when the child is still in school. 16.Working for Families applies until the end of the calendar year in which the child i n school or tertiary education turns 18. Child support ends when a child turns 18 unless they are still in school and then it can continue until the child in school turns 19. 17.Officials propose that, like Working for Families, for children over the age of 18, child support should also apply until the end of the calendar year in which the child turns 18 (but we should retain the requirement to be in school rather than a tertiary institution). As a transitional arrangement, if a child in school turns 18 prior to 1 A pril 2021, the old rules will apply and child support will continue to apply until they turn 19. 18.This change should simplify carers’ interactions with Inland Revenue. While it would reduce entitlements for some receiving carers as their entitlements would en d s ooner, this is only likely to be the case for a few and only for a few months. Minimum age of financially independent child 19.There is currently no minimum age at which a child may be considered financiall y i ndependent for child support purposes so, in theory, a child could be considered financially independent at any age. For example, they might be considere d f inancially independent if they worked 30 hours or more on average per week over a period of employment. 20.For Working for Families, a child must be at least 16 before they can be considered financially independent. This is because the test for financial independence is based on being in full-time work or in receipt of a main benefit or student allowance . C hildren under 16 are required to be in full-time schooling and cannot apply for a main benefit, therefore, they cannot meet this test. 21.Apart from the minimum age requirement, child support has the same test for financial independence. It is rare for a child under 16 to meet the tests to be considered financially independent for child support purposes. Officials consider i t i nappropriate for a child to be expected to contribute to his or her own cost of living in such cases. Rather, policy settings should encourage any such income to be kept for future use. 22.Officials recommend aligning the minimum age of financial independence for child support purposes with that which applies for Working for Families. In the rare case when a child under 16 earns a significant amount of income, a parent could sti ll r equest an administrative review of child support obligations. I R2019/243: Business Transformation: Amending child support definitions Page 4 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE Residency 23.At this stage, officials do not propose aligning the residency rules across social policy products as outlined in the July 2017 discussion document that was released by the previous Government Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy. However, officials have identified an issue with the child support definition. 24.Child support is payable by a person who is a New Zealand citizen or is ordinarily resident in New Zealand or in a country with which New Zealand has entered into a reciprocal agreement. 25.A person is “ordinarily resident in New Zealand” if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand or they meet a “day count” test – that is, they are in New Zealand for at least 183 days in a year and are not overseas for 325 days a year. 26.The residency assessment for tax purposes is generally made once the day count test has been met. However, this is difficult to apply to child support, as it would mean decisions to say, accept a child support assessment may need to be delayed for up to 325 days to see if the residency criteria are met. Therefore, in practice, Inland Revenue usually makes residency decisions based on a person’s intended, rather than actual, movements. 27.Officials consider that the legislation should be amended to better reflect curren t operational practice, that is, that the person’s intended movements should be taken i nto account. Officials consider that this best meets the policy intent of ensuring that decisions to assess and end child support are made as promptly as possible. Administration, compliance and fiscal costs 28.These proposals would have minimal fiscal implications. Officials estimate that up to 1,000 liable parents would have increased income used which could increase their assessments. Where the receiving carer is a sole parent beneficiary, the child support is retained by the Crown to offset their benefit. However, the increase in the amount retained is unquantifiable. The proposals would reduce administration and compliance costs as the rules would be easier to understand and are better aligned with other social policy products where appropriate. If agreed to, these proposals will be implemented as part of BT release 5 (April 2021). Implementation costs such as communicating policy changes are included in BT. No additional funding is being requested. Consultation 29.In July 2017, the previous Government released the discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy. The discussion document included proposals to amend the definitions referred to in this report, to create greater alignment across social policy products. Submitters were supportive of the proposals, but made suggestions aimed at avoiding increased compliance cost. 30.The proposals in the discussion document that related to both child support and Working for Families (namely, the dollar amount that applies when defining financial independence and alignment of the residency definition) will be considered at a later date as part of officials’ response to the recommendations of the Welfare Exper t A dvisory Group. This report relates to the proposals that apply solely to child support. I R2019/243: Business Transformation: Amending child support definitions Page 5 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE 31.Officials have reflected further on the child support-related amendments that were proposed in the discussion document in light of the feedback provided in the consultation process and this report recommends the following departures from the previous proposals: 1 31. 1 Broadening the income definition to a lesser extent than was originally proposed, to keep compliance costs to a minimum. 31.2 Retaining the requirement that a child must be in school, in relation to the maximum age of a child definition. 31.3 Not progressing any further work to align residency definitions at this stage. 32.The Treasury was involved in the development of the proposals contained in the discussion document, including the proposed amendments to definitions. The Treasury, Ministry of Social Development and Oranga Tamariki have been consulted on the proposals and are comfortable with the recommendations in this report. Next steps 33.This report is part of a series setting out possible changes as part of Busines s T ransformation. When you have provided feedback on the recommendations in the reports, we will prepare a Cabinet paper with the aim of seeking Cabinet approvals in July 2019 and for amendments to be included in a bill introduced in late 2019. 34.Officials recommend that a copy of this report be referred to the Minister of Finance.

This will reduce retrospective assessment s t hat can arise creating uncertainty for child support customers and problems suc h a s new debt for liable parents or overpayments to receiving carers. This report also proposes other minor amendments aimed at improving the certainty of assessments. This report is one of a series of reports covering child support proposals as part of the Business Transformation work programme. Background 2.Inland Revenue’s multi-year transformation programme will modernise New Zealand’s revenue system. Once complete, customers will spend far less time and effort ensuring they meet their obligations and receive their correct social policy entitlements. 3.Business transformation is enabled by a combination of changes to policy, process, technology and the organisation design of Inland Revenue. It is far more than an upgrade of technology and has provided the opportunity to fundamentally review how the revenue system is administered and consider what changes may be needed. 4.It is currently planned that the child support scheme will move to the new system and processes, in April 2021 (BT release 5). This creates opportunities to improve the administration of the scheme at the same time. 5.In May 2019, we reported to you seeking agreement to undertake targeted consultation with a small number of relevant groups on a proposal to improve the certainty of assessments for child support parents and carers by introducing a time bar for reassessing past periods \[report IR2019/234 refers\]. Proposals 6.Child support is based on several variables. In some cases, after child support has been assessed, changes to those variables can cause retrospective child support assessments. This creates uncertainty for carers (including new debt for liable parents or overpayments to receiving carers which need to be repaid). 7.To improve the certainty of child support assessments, officials recommend: 7.1 the introduction of a four-year child support time bar subject to a number of exceptions; In Confidence IR2019/242: Business Transformation: Child support – certainty of assessments Page 2 of 8 IN CONFIDENCE 7.2 extending the 28-day notification rules that apply to changes of circumstances during a child support assessment to notification of circumstances that existed at the time child support was applied for; 7.3 introducing time constraints for the provision of paternity orders and the backdating of child support assessments; and 7.4 repealing the urgent maintenance order provision. Child support time bar 8.As noted in report IR2019/234, unlike tax child support does not have a statutory time bar stopping reassessments for past periods. This means that reassessment s c an be made as far back as July 1992 if Inland Revenue is given information that is relevant to a past child support year. Reassessments can occur for a number of reasons – for example, changes in income, changes in care arrangements and parents reconciling. 9.The report proposed a child support time bar which would operate in a similar way to the tax time bar in that reassessments to child support for past years could only be made within a certain timeframe (subject to a number of exceptions) . 10.T he current lack of a time bar provides a degree of uncertainty to both liable parents and receiving carers. A reassessment could result in either party owing money depending on the specific circumstance. The amount of change to the assessments would usually be modest. For all reassessments for past years completed in 2018, 37 percent had no change and for a further 38 percent the change was less than $1,000 (either up or down). The introduction of a four-year time bar would provide certainty to parents, and provide a clean slate going forward, albeit at the cost of some being worse off. However, there would be specific exceptions which would allow reassessments in earlier periods – fo r e xample, in cases of fraud, which would help to mitigate those who situations when a person might be worse off. 11.Officials have undertaken targeted consultation with: 11.1 Chartered Accountants New Zealand and Australia; 11.2 Citizen’s Advice Bureau; 11.3 FinCap; and 11.4 National Beneficiaries Advocates Consultative Group. 12.The National Beneficiaries Advocates Consultative Group were comfortable with the proposal and thought that the proposed exceptions addressed any possible inequities. 13.Citizen’s Advice Bureau advised that it bases its advice to government on evidence from client’s enquiries. They do not have the capacity to analyse each child support enquiry. FinCap did not respond in the time frame given. In Confidence IR2019/242: Business Transformation: Child support – certainty of assessments Page 3 of 8 IN CONFIDENCE 14.The Chartered Accountants supported a time bar when there has been a default assessment 1 and a reassessment would result in a reduction of child support paid b y the liable parent and a debt for the receiving carer. However, they do no t s upport the introduction of a time bar when there has been a default assessment and a reassessment would result in an increase in child support being payable by the liable parent and money due to the receiving carer. Their concerns include: 14.1 that the proposal undermines the integrity of the child support scheme and may be perceived by the public and those who pay the correct amount of child support as unfair; 14.2 it fails to meet the objective of the child support scheme which is to ensure parents fulfil their responsibilities to financially support their children; and 14.3 that it fails to ensure that Inland Revenue meets its responsibilities to administer the scheme for those parents who voluntarily choose to receive their child support through Inland Revenue. 15.Officials consider that since the child support formula uses both parents’ incomes , t he proposal, including its exceptions, does not undermine the scheme. The optio n o f only reassessing if it was to increase the liable parent’s payment would introduce inequities in that it would effectively only provide for a reassessment if it is in the receiving carer’s favour – even if it is the receiving carer’s income that was the default assessment. We consider it is a trade-off of a small number of people being worse off (some of which would be mitigated by the exceptions), c ompared to the current situation of thousands 2 of customer’s being affected every year by reassessments and the inherent uncertainty this creates. 16.Officials, therefore, recommend the introduction of a child support time bar. Under the time bar reassessments could only be made within a four-year time frame. Unlike the tax time bar which starts the four-year period from the end of the income year in which the return is filed, the child support time bar would star t from the end of the relevant child support year. Four years is consistent with the tax rules and covers the period over which most reassessments occur. The time bar would also apply to administrative reviews – that is, there would be a four- year period in which to seek an administrative review. 17.The time bar would not apply: 17.1 if information provided by a person in the child support assessment is fraudulent or wilfully misleading or omits income of a particular nature in a return; 3 17.2 when a person who is part of the child support assessment dies; 17.3 when a person should never have been made liable – for example, when a person is subsequently found not to be the father of a child; 1 A default assessment is when a parent has not filed a relevant return and the Commissioner has determined the income on which to base the child support assessment. 2 In the 2018 child support year, 41,000 reassessments were made, of which approximately 3,800 were done for the years 1993 to 2013 (that is, the period that would be outside a four-year time bar). 3 Including if the assessment is a default assessment which does not include income of a particular nature. In Confidence IR2019/242: Business Transformation: Child support – certainty of assessments Page 4 of 8 IN CONFIDENCE 17.4 when an amendment is required for the purposes of avoiding a dual liability (for the same child) with an overseas jurisdiction; 17.5 if Inland Revenue does not meet the notification requirements; or 17.6 if a Court Order is granted that applies to a time barred period. 18.If an exception applies and a retrospective reassessment is made, objection rights would still be available to affected parties and a person would have up to four months to ask for an administrative review for that year. Changes of circumstances 19.When Inland Revenue is satisfied that a relevant change of circumstance, has occurred – for example the birth of a new dependent child or a change in care arrangements, rules in the Child Support Act determine when the change is to be treated as having occurred. If a change is notified within 28 days of it occurring, it is recognised from the date it occurred. If the change is notified outside the 28- day timeframe, it is treated as having occurred on either the date Inland Revenue received the notification or the date the event occurred whichever would result in better outcome for the other parent or carer affected by the change. 20.These rules are designed to encourage customers to notify Inland Revenue of changes in a timely manner and to limit the impact on associated parties if the notification is not timely. 21.However, the rules do not apply when the circumstance existed at the time the child support was assessed. In these cases, the assessment is considered incorrect and must be corrected effective from the start of the child support assessment. If the start of the assessment is in a previous child support year, discretion can be applied to limit the change to the start of the child support year in whic h n otification was received. 4 22.B ackdating child support assessments in this manner causes several issues, including: 22.1 Overpayments for receiving carers, when they have received and relied on the payment of child support. 22.2 Increases in child support payments for past periods that liable parents must pay within 30 days. If not paid within this timeframe, late payment penalties apply. 23.To increase the certainty of assessments, officials recommend that similar notification rules that apply to changes of circumstances during a child support assessment should also apply to the notification of circumstances that existed a t the time child support was assessed. The parent should have 28 days from the date of their notice of assessment to advise of their existing circumstances. 4 Standard Practice Statement SPS 16/02 Child support and domestic maintenance – amendments to assessments In Confidence IR2019/242: Business Transformation: Child support – certainty of assessments Page 5 of 8 IN CONFIDENCE Paternity orders 24.When a person applies for child support they must provide proof of parentage – usually this is the child’s birth certificate. If a person does not have proof of parentage, they may seek a paternity order. If a person already has a paternity order at the time of applying for child support but it is provided later, the child support will be established from the date the order is provided. 25.However, if a paternity order has not been granted when the child support application is made but is then granted and received by Inland Revenue, child support is backdated to the date the original child support application was received. In some cases, it can be many years later that the paternity order is submitted to Inland Revenue and private payments may have been made durin g th is time that Inland Revenue is unable to account for. This delay can create large debts and difficulties in raising a correct assessment. 26.Inland Revenue officials have worked with officials from the Ministry of Justice looking at the time period between applying for a paternity order and the date the order is granted and the period is le ss than a year. 5 27.O fficials recommend that if paternity has not been established when a child support application is made, a child support liability can be backdated on the receipt of the paternity order, provided: 27.1 the paternity order was applied for before or within two months of the child support application being given to Inland Revenue; and 27.2 having been granted, the paternity order is given to Inland Revenue within two months. 28.If these rules are not met, child support would be established from the date the paternity order is given to Inland Revenue. 29.A two-month period is consistent with the timeframe a parent or carer has to appeal matters under the Child Support Act to the Family Court. It would also allow sufficient time for a person to seek advice on the matter before applying for the paternity order and gives sufficient time to try and negotiate other arrangements for child support with the father before deciding to give the paternity order to Inland Revenue to establish child support. 30.Officials also recommend that there is discretion for Inland Revenue to accept paternity orders outside the two-month periods if the delay was due to circumstances outside the control of the person – for example, because the person was seriously ill. 31.While still providing for child support to be backdated, the recommendation limits retrospectivity and puts the onus on the carer to make timely decisions. 5 Based on a sample of 50 cases, 30 percent of paternity orders are received more than a year after the child support application was received, with nearly 5 percent provided approximately ten years after the application, resulting in retrospective assessments for those periods which are due in 30 days. In Confidence IR2019/242: Business Transformation: Child support – certainty of assessments Page 6 of 8 IN CONFIDENCE Redundant provision – urgent maintenance orders 32.Under section 116 of the Child Support Act, if after an application for child support is made, the Family Court considers the child needs urgent financial assistance, the Court may make an order of payment towards the maintenance of the child. If the child support application is subsequently declined the urgent maintenance order becomes invalid. Once a child support assessment is made, the order end s o n receipt of the first payment under the assessment. Officials consider that the provision was included in the Act to cover the possibility of a delay by Inland Revenue in processing child support applications. The provision has never been used. Between 2013 and 2018 there was one application for an urgent maintenance order, which was not granted. Child support applications are generally made within ten days, which makes it extremely unlikely that an orde r c ould be made by the Court before Inland Revenue making an administrative assessment. To prevent the provision being built in the new system, officials recommend that the provision be repealed. Administration, compliance and fiscal costs 33.If agreed to, these proposals will be implemented as part of BT release 5 (April 2021). Implementation costs such as communicating policy changes are included in BT. No additional funding is being requested. 34.The proposals are expected to have minor fiscal impacts which are no t q uantifiable. They would result in more or less being transferred between parent s o r parents and carers (depending on the specific situation) for past years. The proposals would reduce compliance and administration costs by limiting the retrospectivity of assessments and reducing the creation of historic debt (for bot h liable parents and receiving carers). Consultation 35.The Treasury, Ministry of Social Development and Oranga Tamariki have been consulted on the proposals and are comfortable with the recommendations in this report. 36.The Ministry of Justice has been consulted on the paternity order proposal and the proposal to repeal the urgent maintenance order provision. It is comfortable with the proposal. 37.Officials conducted targeted consultation on the proposal to introduce a time bar. One group was comfortable with the proposal and another had integrity concerns. Officials consider it is trade off of a small number of people being worse off, compared to the current situation of Inland Revenue reassessing thousands of customer’s assessments every year and the inherent uncertainty and disruption this causes to customers.

Background 3.Inland Revenue’s multi-year transformation programme will modernise New Zealand’s revenue system. Once complete, customers will spend far less time and effort ensuring they meet their obligations and receive their correct social policy entitlements. 4.Business transformation is enabled by a combination of changes to policy, process, technology and the organisation design of Inland Revenue. It is far more than an upgrade of technology and has provided the opportunity to fundamentally review how the revenue system is administered and consider what changes may be needed. 5.It is currently planned that the child support scheme will move to the new system and processes, in April 2021 – BT release 5. This creates opportunities to improve the administration of the scheme at the same time. 6.In July 2017, the previous Government released the discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy (the discussion document). The discussion document proposed that penalties not apply while missed payments are being actively managed and that Inland Revenue would be able to set a due date and impose penalties when the debt is not being managed, there is fraud or the customer has a history of non-compliance. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) In Confidence IR2019/240: Business Transformation: Child support – debt and payments Page 2 of 7 IN CONFIDENCE Comment 7.The penalty rules were reviewed as part of the 2013 child support reforms. The reforms resulted in a move to impose the initial penalty for paying late in two stages, to reduce the incremental penalties when a debt has been owing for a year or more, and to introduce more provisions to allow for the write off of penalty debt. These provisions serve to reduce the amount of child support debt, but they were not aimed encouraging ongoing compliance. 8.Currently, if a person does not pay their child support or domestic maintenance 1 on time penalties apply. An initial penalty of 2% is imposed the day after the due date and if payment is not made a further 8% penalty is applied seven days later. Incremental penalties are then charged each month the payment is outstanding, at the rate of 2% each month for the first 12 months and then 1% each month until the debt is cleared. The penalties are payable to the Government. When a payment is made, it is first allocated to the child support debt and then to any penalties . There is a complex set of write-off rules, which have been added to over the years, which mean that in many cases the penalties charged can be written off. Use-of- money interest is not charged on child support debt. 9.Penalties play an important role in encouraging parents to meet their child support obligations. However, excessive penalties can discourage the payment of child support to the detriment of the children concerned. As at February 2019 the child support debt was $2.2 billion, $558 million of which was core child support debt and $1.6 billion was penalties. Currently, most penalties can be written off – for example, if the person complies with a payment arrangement for 26 weeks. The recovery of debt is challenging and currently 97% of child support penalty debt is written down at initial recognition as we do not expect to collect the debt. 10.The current penalty rules are seen as overly harsh. The imposition of penalties means that some people stop interacting with Inland Revenue and do nothing, resulting in spiralling debt and further disengagement. 11. 12.The research showed that customers felt that penalties are necessary to encourage compliance. There were concerns that if no penalties were applied when child support is not paid on time, people would stop complying – that is, that penalties are needed as an incentive to keep child support “top of mind”. However, customers felt that Inland Revenue was too quick to penalise customers and the penalties imposed are too high. Many customers did not understand the rules and therefore did not understand how to “fix things”. Customers felt that the rules need to provide “clarity, flexibility and the perception that Inland Revenue is working with customers”. 1 Domestic maintenance is a payment made to an ex-spouse or ex-partner, either ordered by the Court or agreed to by the ex-spouses. 2 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) In Confidence IR2019/240: Business Transformation: Child support – debt and payments Page 3 of 7 IN CONFIDENCE 13.Most customers do, or are willing to, comply with their child support obligations, but at times may have trouble meeting their payments. For example, 70 percent of payments are made on time; 81.5 percent of child support payments assessed in a year are paid within that year ( which increases to 85 percent if only considering child support payable by parents living in New Zealand). Although some payments are late, it illustrates customers are generally trying to comply. 14.Customers who are trying to comply, face the same penalty rules as customers who are habitually non-compliant. To introduce more clarity, flexibility, fairness and show that Inland Revenue is working with customers to get payments right, o fficials propose that the penalty rules be amended to do the following: 14.1 Change the way the initial penalties are charged by moving the imposition of the second phase of the penalty, the 8%, to be imposed 28 days after the due date (that is, on or before the due date for the payment due for the following month). This delay would give Inland Revenue the opportunity to contact and engage with customers (via Online services, text message, phone, letter etc) and explain the consequences of not paying or not entering an instalment arrangement (that is, the imposition of the 8% penalty and in some cases the use of other collection tools). 14.2 Remove the $5 minimum penalty rule. Currently, the 2% initial late payment penalty rule provides that the minimum penalty imposed is $5 – even if 2% of the amount owed is less than $5. This rule means that the penalty is not proportionate to the default a nd over-penalises debts of less than $226. 14.3 14.4 Introduce a grace period for customers who are new to paying child support including those returning to the scheme. Customers would not be charged penalties during the grace period, although enforcement action (such as, deductions from bank accounts) could take place. Compliance in the first few months when a person enters the scheme is generally low (26 percent of payments in the first three months are paid on time). From the research, a common theme was that when partners separate, and the child support process is started, customers’ situations are in flux and many felt unprepared to make payments immediately. Introducing a grace period would allow Inland Revenue to work with customers to help them get things right from the start and result in better ongoing compliance. The grace period would apply to their first due date and then for any due dates that occur within the next 60 days (which would usually cover the next two payments). 14.5 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) In Confidence IR2019/240: Business Transformation: Child support – debt and payments Page 4 of 7 IN CONFIDENCE 3 15. Currently, if a liable parent falls into debt, early intervention is a priority. The proposals would provide more opportunity for Inland Revenue to engage with customers and encourage them to comply with their child support obligations. 16.These proposals are consistent with the proposal to apply compulsory deductions of child support from salary and wages for domestic liable parents \[as agreed in report IR2019/125\]. Together these proposals are aimed at encouraging the prompt payment of child support and ensuring customers comply with their child support obligations. The proposals would also apply to domestic maintenance obligations. 17. 18.In some cases, customers may still not comply. In these cases, the current collection tools available to Inland Revenue could be used – for example, deductions from bank accounts, charging orders over property or warrants for the arrest of a person who is about to leave New Zealand and intending to avoid paying their child support. 19.Behavioural interventions aimed at improving a liable parent’s compliance with their child support obligations could also be implemented. Such interventions could be done administratively – that is, they would not require any legislative change. These types of interventions were trialled in the United States and mainly involved changes to communications to liable parents, such as incorporating references to social norms, simplifying letters, using coloured envelopes and paper, removing references to the other parent and personalising communications. They were low cost and led to an increase in responses from liable parents and a small increase in payment rates. 20.All of these proposals, both legislative and administrative, would form part of a package aimed at improving ongoing compliance to ensure payments can be passed on to receiving carers. 21.These proposals are also consistent with recent changes to late payment penalties charged on tax debt. Administration, compliance and fiscal costs 22. 3 An uplift is when a receiving carer elects to take over the collection of the liable parent’s debt from Inland Revenue. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) In Confidence IR2019/240: Business Transformation: Child support – debt and payments Page 5 of 7 IN CONFIDENCE 23. 24. 25.I ntroducing a grace period would result in a small amount of initial penalties not be imposed and minimal fiscal implications of $30,000. These penalties can be, and some are, written off under current provisions but some of them are collected. 26.It is anticipated that the proposals would reduce compliance and administration costs as they would improve the clarity and fairness of the scheme and allow Inland Revenue to better work with customers to achieve policy objectives. Any impact on compliance and administration costs is appropriately dependent on customer behaviour. 27. Consultation 28.The Treasury was involved in the development of the proposals contained in the discussion document, including the proposals relating to debt. The Treasury, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Ministry of Social Development and Oranga Tamariki have been consulted of the contents of this report.

Background 3.Earlier this year off icials sent you a series of reports proposing amendments to the Child Support Act 1991 as part of the Business Transformation (BT) programme, which will go live in April 2021. The reports were: 3.1 Business Transformation: Child support, better payment options and remedial items \[IR2019/125 refers\]; 3.2 Business Transformation: Child support – debt and payments \[IR2019/240 refers\]; 3.3 Business Transformation: Child support – working with customers with unusual circumstances \[IR2019/241 refers\]; 3.4 Business Transformation: Child support – certainty of assessments \[IR2019/242 refers\]; and 3.5 Business Transformation: Amending child support definitions \[IR2019/243 refers\]. 4.The attached Cabinet paper seeks Cabinet approvals for the recommendations set out in those reports and for the amendments to be included in a bill introduced in late 2019 and enacted before the end of 2020. Financial considerations 5.Officials have identified the following costs of these proposals over the forecast period, which are set out in the Cabinet paper: 5.1 5.2 $30,000 per annum to introduce a grace period; and 5.3 $23,000 per annum to repeal the minimum $5 penalty charge. 6.The Cabinet paper sets out the fiscal implications of the proposals and options. The costs of introducing the grace period and repealing the minimum $5 penalty charge s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) In Confidence IR2019/334: Cabinet paper – Business Transformation child support Page 2 of 5 IN CONFIDENCE are immaterial and will not impact on revenue forecasts. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. Further policy changes 13.During the drafting of the Cabinet paper several issues came to light that require clarification. Child support, better payment options and remedial items 14.The better payment options and remedial items report recommended that deductions of child support from salary and wages be compulsory for all domestic liable parents who are new to the child support scheme as well as for existing liable parents when they default. Officials recommend that this proposal be extended to deductions of financial support from source deduction payments made by New s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) In Confidence IR2019/334: Cabinet paper – Business Transformation child support Page 3 of 5 IN CONFIDENCE Zealand employers. Financial support includes domestic maintenance 1 as well as child support. Referring to source deduction payments means that deductions could also be made from schedular payments. 2 This is consistent with the compulsory deduction proposal which was descoped in 2013 and would help liable parents comply. Amending child support definitions 18.The amending child support definitions report recommended that child support should apply to 31 December of the year in which a child in school turns 18. This would better align the child support rule with a similar Working for Families rule. You indicated that you did not agree with this proposal and asked that the issue be discussed with officials. When we discussed the issue with you, you agreed with the proposal as set out in the report. This agreement has not been reflected in the reports returned to officials. For completeness, t his recommendation is included in this report. Next steps 19.Officials recommend that you refer the attached Cabinet paper entitled “Business Transformation – Amendments to the Child Support Act 1991” (with any changes that you wish to make to it) to the Cabinet Office by 10am Thursday 15 August 2019 so that it may be considered by the Cabinet Social Wellbeing Committee at its meeting on Wednesday 21 August 2019. 20.A regulatory impact assessment is being separately provided to your office for you to attach to the Cabinet paper. 1 Domestic maintenance is a payment made to an ex-spouse or ex-partner, either ordered by the Court or agreed to by the ex-spouses. 2 Schedular payments are certain types of payments that are made to contractors. s 9(2)(f)(iv) In Confidence IR2019/334: Cabinet paper – Business Transformation child support Page 4 of 5 IN CONFIDENCE 21.Speaking notes will be supplied to you for the Social Wellbeing Committee’s meeting on Wednesday 21 August 2019. 22.Officials recommend that the attached Cabinet paper should be proactively released in full but that its release should be delayed until the introduction of the proposed child support amendment bill containing legislative changes to give effect to the proposals.

Mike Nutsford Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue / /2019 s 9(2)(f)(iv) Impact Statement T emplate | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Coversheet: Child support Business Transformation Advising agencies Inland Revenue Decision sought Approve proposed amendments to the Child Support Act 1991 intended to improve the administration of the scheme and incentivise compliance and payments Proposing Ministers Minister of Revenue Su mma r y : Pr o ble m a n d Pr o po se d Ap pr o ac h Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation (BT) programme to modernise the tax system, the child support scheme will move to new systems and processes in April 2021. Some aspects of the current child support scheme are overly prescriptive and do not support engagement and compliance with the scheme as well as they could do. The BT change provides an opportunity to make legislative changes to improve administration, make the rules fairer, less complex and more flexible, thereby improving compliance (particularly for liable parents) with the scheme which in turn supports improvements to the welfare of children. If policy changes to simplify the legislation are not made now, the existing complexity of the current legislation will need to be built into the new system. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? The proposals are to: •change the penalty rules – including introducing a penalty grace period for people newly liable, or returning to the scheme; •introduce compulsory employer deductions from salary and wages for newly liable parents; •put a time limit of four years on retrospective reassessments; •change the definition of “income”; and •make a number of minor and technical amendments, including working with customers in unusual circumstances. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 7. Impact Statement T emplate | 2 IN CONFIDENCE Taken together, the proposals will make the rules fairer and less complex. This should improve engagement and compliance with the scheme which would in turn support improvements to the welfare of children. They will allow Inland Revenue to work better with parents to help prevent debt occurring in the first place. Sec tio n B: Su mma r y Imp a c ts : Be ne fits a n d c o s ts Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The beneficiaries of the proposals are parents, carers and children in the child support scheme. As at 31 May 2019 the child support customer base was made up of: •164,000 liable parents (including 29,700 with debt only); •135,500 receiving carers; and •182,800 children. The proposals are expected to simplify parts of the scheme and make it fairer which should better incentivise and improve compliance of liable parents. This improves payment certainty and timeliness for receiving carers which contributes to the welfare of their children. Where do the costs fall? The costs of administering the child support scheme fall on Inland Revenue. There is the potential for increased costs on employers as a result of the compulsory deduction proposal for newly liable parents. However, employers are already required to deduct in cases when the liable parent has chosen employer deduction as a payment method or has defaulted on a payment. Accordingly, this proposal should only result in a marginal increase in costs for employers who do not currently deduct child support, or for those employers for whom the proposal increases the number of employees that they must make deductions for. Over time we estimate an additional 3,800 employers will be asked to make child support deductions. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? Some people may not respond as expected to the penalty measures and levels of compliance could reduce. This can be mitigated by use of customer education and existing enforcement provisions, the proposed introduction of compulsory deductions for newly liable parents and improved information made available through Inland Revenue’s BT programme. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. The proposals are compatible with the Government’s “Expectations for the design of regulatory systems”. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 3 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n C: Ev id e nc e c er ta in ty a n d q u ality a ss u ra n ce Agency rating of evidence certainty? Inland Revenue has a medium–high level of confidence in the evidence base. The key uncertainty is the impact of the penalty proposals on customer behaviour which cannot be modelled. However, literature suggests that measures designed to be fairer are more likely to lead to better compliance outcomes. Research Inland Revenue conducted with child support liable and receiving carers 1 indicated that penalties had a role to play in encouraging compliance but that the overly punitive nature of the current penalties and the complexity of the penalty rules acted as a barrier to compliance. Inland Revenue collects data relating to numbers of liable parents, compliance levels, debt and penalties imposed. This data has been used to estimate the potential direct impacts of the penalty proposals, compulsory deductions for employers, the effect of the time bar proposal and the change that the income definition could have. Some of the administrative data is manually input and therefore subject to errors however their impact should be relatively minor and would not change the “dollar” value of the impacts. The data relating to interest and dividends (which is relevant to the proposal to change the definition of income) is being sourced from Inland Revenue’s new system START and it is the first period that this income has been provided. While every effort has been made to ensure it is complete, there is no benchmark to compare to and it is likely some data is missing given the newness of these rules. Currently, all dividend information is sourced from records provided by parents. It will become compulsory for third parties to provide this information from 1 April 2020 which should improve the data from that point onwards. We are unable to identify the impacts of some of the more minor and technical amendments - such as allowing overseas liable parents to apply for prisoner exemptions. However, we consider that these changes will affect few customers and will help to make the child support rules fairer. Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Child support Business Transformation Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by Inland Revenue, and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the quality assurance criteria. 1 The research consisted of 27 one-on-one interviews around the country. The interviewees were a mix of liable parents and receiving carers, and a mix of levels of income including beneficiaries. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Withheld under section 9(2)(f)(iv) of the Offcial Information Act 1982 Impact Statement T emplate | 4 IN CONFIDENCE Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of the Regulatory Impact Assessment have been incorporated into the final version. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Withheld under section 9(2)(f)(iv) of the Offcial Information Act 1982 Impact Statement T emplate | 5 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Statement: Child support Business Transformation Sec tio n 1 : G en er a l in fo r ma tion Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice have been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 6 IN CONFIDENCE Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The proposals were developed as part of the Business Transformation (BT) programme that Inland Revenue is undertaking. The scope of the programme was predominately focussed on changes to improve the overall administration of the New Zealand tax and social policy systems by reducing compliance and administrative costs rather than any fundamental policy shifts. A time constraint exists to implement the recommended options because the opportunity to progress any changes is provided by Inland Revenue’s BT programme which sees child support move from the current system (FIRST) to the new system (START) in April 2021. If policy changes to the child support administrative rules are not made in time for the roll-out of START, the complexity of the existing administrative rules would need to be incorporated into the design of START. Extensive public consultation took place on the main proposals in this Regulatory Impact Assessment with the exception of the proposal to introduce a time bar for reassessing past years, and the specific penalties proposals relating to the penalty changes. Research was conducted with a small number of liable parents and receiving carers to gauge their attitudes towards the penalty rules and how they see penalties affecting compliance. The problems around the current policy that reassessments can happen at any time for any year was identified more recently. Due to time constraints, consultation on the proposal to introduce a child support time bar was limited to interest groups rather than parents and carers. Some of the minor or technical changes were not consulted on due to their minor nature. However, the use of discretion for those in unusual circumstances was included in the 2017 discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy. The data used to analyse reassessments in relation to the time bar proposal are liable parent-centric and identify impacts specifically on liable parents (although this means the opposite impact occurs for the receiving carer). Also, some of the administrative data is manually input and therefore subject to errors. However, this impact should be relatively minor and would not change the “dollar” value of the impacts. The income data relating to interest and dividends has been sourced from Inland Revenue’s new system START and it is the first period that this income has been provided.

Inland Revenue’s multi-year transformation programme is modernising New Zealand’s revenue system. Once complete, customers will spend far less time and effort ensuring they meet their obligations and receive their correct social policy entitlements. Child support is part of release 5 2 of BT which provides an opportunity to review how the revenue system is administered and consider what changes may be needed. The Government is concerned with improving the welfare of children and minimising the impact of government agency debt on New Zealanders. The child support scheme works to ensure that children are appropriately supported by both their parents even when they are not living together as a family. Inland Revenue assesses, collects and disburses payments. As part of the assessment process Inland Revenue will identify the liable parent (the parent responsible for making the child support payment) and the receiving carer (the parent (or other carer) entitled to receive the child support payment). When a liable parent does not pay or pay on time they are charged initial late payment penalties and continue to be penalised each month until they pay or come to an arrangement to pay the outstanding amount. The financial burden when a liable parent does not pay falls on the receiving carers and their children. Aspects of the current penalty rules unreasonably penalise parents. Child support debt is significant at $2.2 billion dollars 3 with penalties making up a large portion – 75%. Changes introduced to penalties and write-offs in 2015 have slowed the growth of child support debt but primarily through write-offs and reducing penalty charges rather than addressing debt prevention. Liable parents’ compliance in their first three months of liability is very low – less than 30% pay on time as they adjust to being required to make payments. Liable parents are proportionately over-penalised by a $5 penalty rule that requires the 2% initial penalty for defaulting on payment to be a minimum of $5. This rule affects any liable parent with a monthly obligation of less than $226, which means it particularly affects liable parents on lower incomes. The minimum monthly child support assessment is $78. Penalty debt is 97% impaired (when imposed) meaning it is largely not expected to be collected. Write-offs have been successful as an incentive to get some parents to re-engage with the scheme but are not effective at preventing debt. Some liable parents are concerned that the rules do not encourage them to comply with their child support payments and at times could promote non-compliance. This is because the rules are complex, can penalise parents unreasonably, and in some cases create uncertainty for all parties (including Inland Revenue). Receiving carers are most concerned about the 2 BT is being progressively rolled out over each tax and social policy type. Release 5 is scheduled for April 2021. 3 Includes liable parent, receiving carer, and employer debt. Liable parent debt arises from payments by the liable parent to the receiving carer being made late, or not being paid. Receiving carer debt arises from overpayments to the receiving carer. Employer debt arises when the employer has deducted a child support payment from a liable parent’s wages or salary but has not passed the payment on to Inland Revenue. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 9 IN CONFIDENCE non-payment of child support as it impacts on their ability to support their children. There are some unintended or inequitable outcomes as a result of some of the rules in the scheme. For example, because the rules do not cater for some complex family arrangements a liable parent may be assessed to pay more than they should be. These outcomes can contribute to a liable parent’s willingness to engage with the scheme and therefore lead to non-compliance. If the current rules were left in place reliance would solely be placed on operational improvements that may be provided through BT. However, the policy problems outlined above would largely remain and improvements to child support compliance and engagement may not be achieved. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? Child Support Act 1991 The New Zealand administrative child support scheme has been in place since July 1992. The key feature of the regulatory system is to assess, collect and disburse child support in accordance with the Child Support Act 1991. The key objective of child support is to ensure that children are appropriately supported by both their parents even when they are not living together as a family. Any parent or carer can make an application for a child support assessment. 4 Using a formula that is legislated for under the Act, Inland Revenue assesses which parent is liable for a child support payment (the liable parent) and which parent will receive child support payments (the receiving carer), and the amount to be paid by the liable parent. This formula includes components such as the income of each parent, the age of the child, and how much care of the child each parent does. Changes were made in the child support reforms (effective 1 April 2015) to modernise the scheme and improve fairness, primarily through changes to the formula assessment and by assessing the income and other circumstances of both parents (rather than just the liable parent). Once Inland Revenue has determined who the liable parent is, the liable parent must make the child support payment to Inland Revenue. Child support payments are due to Inland Revenue monthly. Inland Revenue then passes the payment on to the receiving parent. When payments are not made, or not made on time, the financial burden generally falls on carers and their children. 5 Penalties and other tools (such as contact by Inland Revenue and compulsory deductions for defaulting liable parents) are used by Inland Revenue to encourage compliance. 4 For parents receiving a sole parent rate of benefit from the Ministry of Social Development the scheme is mandatory, and they must apply for a child support assessment against the child’s other parent. Child support payments are used to offset the cost of benefits paid. 5 Or if the receiving parent is on a sole parent benefit, there is an impact on Government revenue because in those cases the payment is not passed on to the carer. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 10 IN CONFIDENCE Initial late payment penalties apply if a payment is not paid on time. In addition to the initial late payment penalties, for each subsequent month that the child support remains outstanding (with no repayment arrangement in place), compounding incremental penalties are also applied (initially at 2%, but reduced to 1% after 12 months). International agreements There is a reciprocal agreement with Australia which allows for the enforcement of payments when a liable parent moves to Australia or a parent liable under the Australian child support scheme moves to New Zealand. The Family Proceeding Act 1980 details the rules for recognition of overseas maintenance orders made in Commonwealth countries as well as countries that are parties to the United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance (UNCRAM). The Family Court registers overseas court orders and refers them to Inland Revenue for enforcement. The Family Court can also make child support orders to be sent for enforcement in other countries if an administrative assessment cannot be raised under the Child Support Act. Why is Government regulation preferable? Regulation is preferable because parents may not be able to come to agreement between themselves regarding the support of their children. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The opportunity provided by BT allows Inland Revenue to introduce changes to work better with customers when they are new to the scheme and assist them to get things right from the start – particularly those who are willing to comply but might have trouble at times meeting their payments. Penalty rules Impact of current penalty charges On balance, the New Zealand child support scheme has been very successful in collecting assessed child support debt. Since the scheme’s introduction in 1992, Inland Revenue has collected 89% of all the child support payments assessed by Inland Revenue. This rate compares very favourably internationally. However, parents who are new to the scheme have a low initial level of compliance. Research indicates this is because parents are adjusting to the changes in the family situation (i.e. recent separation), there is lack of understanding of the child support rules and their obligations, or previous negative interactions with Inland Revenue. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 11 IN CONFIDENCE The table below illustrates the value of overall child support debt and the proportion made up of penalties. Mar 16 Sept 16 Mar 17 Sept 17 Mar 18 Sept 18 Mar 19 Assessment debt $651m $633m $621m $596m $579m $562m $558m Penalty debt $2.67b $2.59b $2.48b $2.03b $1.80b $1.65b $1.66b Penalties as % of debt 80% 80% 80% 77% 76% 75% 75% Total debt $3.3b $3.2b $3.1b $2.6b $2.4b $2.2b $2.2b In April 2016, the initial late payment penalty was split into a two-stage penalty charge. An initial charge of 2% on the day after the due date and a further 8% seven days later. Before this, the penalty was combined and a single 10% penalty was charged the day after the due date. The introduction of the two-stage penalty was intended to reduce penalty charges on those who were only a few days late and give Inland Revenue an opportunity to try and contact parents and remind them of their payment. The change has had little impact on overall compliance or reduced penalty charges. This is because the time between charging the 2% and 8% penalty is not long enough for Inland Revenue to undertake any interventions such as a reminder notice. Research indicated it also wasn’t long enough for parents to adjust their budgets to make the payment. Low-income liable parents are over-penalised proportionately to their assessment by a $5 penalty rule that requires the first stage 2% initial penalty to be a minimum of $5. This means anyone with an assessment of less than $226 per month is over penalised. The table below shows on average how many are proportionately over-penalised each month. Number of liable parents incurring the initial penalty Number of parents who are charged as a result of the $5 minimum rule Total amount charged as a result of the $5 minimum rule Amount of penalty that would be charged if there is no $5 rule Amount over- penalised per month as a result of the $5 minimum rule 38,171 19,435 $97,175 $34,547 $62,628 Compulsory deductions There is an opportunity to improve the timeliness of child support payments and reduce defaults as a result of the pay-day reporting rules 6 introduced into the tax rules from 1 April 2019. Making deductions compulsory has been considered before, but the monthly PAYE system meant this could not be effectively administered. This is because the information was not timely enough to ensure Inland Revenue knew who a liable parent’s employer was and to inform those employers of amounts required to be deducted before the payments became 6 A number of changes have been introduced including requiring employment information to be provided to Inland Revenue each time an employee is paid. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 12 IN CONFIDENCE overdue. Deductions of child support by employers are already compulsory once a liable parent defaults on their payment or when a liable parent is receiving a benefit. Additionally, a person can choose employer deductions as their payment method. Time bar A child support assessment takes into account a number of factors - for example, income and shared care arrangements for the child. If Inland Revenue becomes aware of a change to one of these factors, a reassessment is required. These reassessments can be made retrospectively and as far back as 1992 (when the child support scheme began). This retrospective approach becomes more unsustainable and costlier administratively as the scheme gets older. Further, this creates uncertainty for liable parents and receiving carers and possibly debt as a result of increased assessments (for liable parents) or over payments (to receiving carers) which then needs to be repaid. Often the reassessment results in no change to the child support payment obligation but creates a notification to all parties that a reassessment has occurred which can cause confusion and stress. In some cases, the liable parent and receiving carer have exited the child support scheme and the reassessment brings them back in. In practice, most reassessments to a past year occur within four years of that child support year ending. Less than 2% of reassessments occur more than four years after the end of the child support year. A four-year time bar, applying from the end of the relevant child support year would allow for 98% of current reassessments to occur. From 1 April 2017 to 30 June 2019 about 156,000 liable parents (and their associated receiving carers) were reassessed a total of 611,000 times (this includes reassessments during a current year). About 2,830 of these liable parents were reassessed on average 2.3 times (6,690 occasions in total) for years that would be time barred under the proposals. Many reassessments affect more than one year. At an aggregate level, the net impact of reassessments for child support years that ended more than four years ago has been a reduction in liabilities for liable parents and therefore a reduction in entitlements to receiving carers. The table below shows the number of liable parents who saw no change to their payment obligations, or an increase or a decrease to their payments. Some parents were reassessed for multiple years so will appear in more than one “change” row – hence the number of liable parents in each change group shown in the table is more than the total number of liable parents reassessed (2,830). Change Liable parents Annual change Per liable parent No change 1,000 $0 N/A Decrease 1,590 ($15,492,300) ($9,743) Increase 960 $6,386,200 $6,652 Net change 3,550 ($9,106,100) ($3,091) 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 13 IN CONFIDENCE Reassessments occur for a variety of reasons. The table below shows the main reason for the reassessment and the net impact to liabilities that can be attributed to the change. Some parents will have more than one reason for change, hence the number is greater than total liable parents reassessed (2,830). Reason for change Number of liable parents Net change Income 1,997 ($5,490,787) Cessation 419 ($3,839,438) Child change 287 $470,070 All other reasons 322 ($245,948) Total 3,025 ($9,106,103) An “income” change most commonly occurs because a person has confirmed their taxable income for a past year and that income is replacing a default income amount used in the child support assessment. “Cessation” means the child support obligation for the liable parent has ended – this could be because the liable parent and receiving carer have reconciled, or the last child that a parent is liable for no longer qualifies for child support. “Child change” covers a variety of changes specific to a child – for example, parents start to share the care of the child or a child turns 13 (which changes the costs associated with a child). There are many other reasons a reassessment of child support can occur - for example, a child or parent dies. These have been combined in the above table in “all other reasons.” The aggregate net impact on reassessed liable parents is to reduce liable parents’ obligations –that is, the majority of the reassessments resulted in the liable parent’s child support obligations being reduced. If the liable parent has not already paid the amount assessed (before the reassessment) the receiving carer has a reduced amount owed to them. Alternatively, if the liable parent has met their obligation, the receiving carer has been overpaid their child support. When the payment has been paid to the receiving carer, Inland Revenue will undertake collection action to recover the overpaid amount from the receiving carer. Amounts overpaid to receiving carers can be written-off if it is shown that collection of the overpayment would create serious hardship for them. 7 If the receiving carer is in receipt of a sole parent rate of benefit, the child support payment is not paid to the receiving carer but is kept by the Government to cover the cost of their benefit. In these cases, it is the Crown that is “overpaid,” and a refund is issued to the liable parent. 7 The liable parent will still receive a refund of overpaid child support – the cost of the written-off overpayment of child support to the receiving carer is met by Crown revenue. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 14 IN CONFIDENCE Although the aggregate net impact is a reduction in child support obligations, 960 liable parents do have an increase in their obligations. In the main, this becomes a debt because the liable parent does not pay the increased amount by the due date (30 days from the date of reassessment). Only 33 (of the 960) liable parents paid the new amounts on time, 875 were already in debt and the new amounts owed increased the size of their debt. The remaining 52 liable parents were fully compliant with their child support obligations (and possibly no longer in the scheme) and the reassessment caused them to fall into debt as did not pay by the due date. Changes to the definition of “income” for child support Adding investment income (such as interest and dividends) Currently, if during a year a parent earns solely withholding income (any income where tax is deducted before it is paid to the parent), they are assessed using only their income from employment (salary and wages). This means investment income such as interest or dividends they earn is not included in their child support assessment – this is because it was not readily available (other than annually). Changes to the income tax rules require that interest and dividends are now reported more frequently by third parties (for example, banks) which means the income can now be included in a parent’s child support assessment. The table below indicates how much additional interest income is not currently being included in a parent’s annual child support assessment. Annual interest income Parent type Number of parents Total interest Median Receiving 37,680 $4,979,100 $0.57 Both 15,150 $2,424,800 $0.52 Liable 26,800 $3,934,100 $0.47 Total 79,630 $11,338,000 N/A The table shows all parents in the scheme over the course of a child support year. Where parent type is “both” the parent has either been both a liable parent and receiving carer during the year or they are registered as both a liable parent and receiving carer (usually because shared care is in place). They are in the “both” category to avoid double counting. The median interest is less than $1 which indicates the large majority have an immaterial amount of interest but that a few have significant amounts of interest income that is currently not being accounted for when calculating a parent’s capacity to support their children. The following table shows the distribution of interest income: Distribution of annual income Parent type <$1 $1<$1,000 $1,000<$5,000 >$5,000 Receiving 21,301 15,491 614 125 Both 8,616 6,157 292 60 Liable 15,767 10,384 488 291 Total 45,684 32,032 1,394 476 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 15 IN CONFIDENCE Reporting of dividend income to Inland Revenue by third parties only becomes compulsory from 1 April 2020. Based on information provided by parents for the tax year ending 31 March 2019 less than 70 parents (liable and receiving) have some dividend income. The combined dividend income declared by these parents is about $900,000. It is possible in some of these cases the income is being taken into account through an application for a departure 8 (known as an administrative review). Having the income taken into account automatically would remove the requirement to go through the administrative review process which generally takes up to three months. Ignoring losses from prior years in determining income for current year A parent’s income to support a child in a year may be reduced by tax losses that occurred in an earlier year – that is, the losses are “brought forward” to the current year. This is the approach used in calculating income tax obligations. A concern with this approach is that it is at odds with the objective to assess a parents’ relative financial capacity to support their children in a given year. Further, the current approach does not align with the way that these losses are accounted for when working out Working for Families entitlements and student loan obligations. From administrative data fewer than 500 child support parents (liable and receiving) have their child support income reduced by tax losses brought forward. There is an even split between receiving carers and liable parents. For about half of these, parent’s income is being reduced by less than $5,000. About 25 have their income reduced by more than $50,000. Minor and technical amendments to improve fairness, equity, compliance or administration of the scheme Other minor and technical amendments have been identified to address specific issues with the scheme. Combined, they are intended to make the administration of the scheme fairer, simpler and less confusing – for example, by aligning the rules across different social policies. Not all of these proposals are required to be included in this impact assessment; they have been included for transparency and completeness. Most of these minor and technical amendments will impact positively on customers. The exception is a proposal to amend the maximum age of child support which would mean that for a small group of carers (a maximum of about 150 children) child support for the child would end some months sooner than is currently the case. However, this proposal largely aligns child support with Working for Families tax credits which Inland Revenue also administers. An explanation of each proposed amendment is included in the appendix. 8 A person can apply for a “departure” from their child support assessment on certain grounds - for example, the financial capacity of the other parent. If a departure is granted, it means a relevant component used in the formula is adjusted - for example, the income. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 16 IN CONFIDENCE Why does the Counterfactual constitute “a problem”? Relying solely on operational improvements that may be provided through BT is unlikely to lead to significant improvements to child support compliance or engagement with the scheme and we would not expect to see any substantial improvement in parents’ behaviour. If no policy changes are made, the complexities of the existing system would be introduced to the new system. Further, the opportunity to improve child welfare as part of Inland Revenue’s BT programme would be lost. The policy changes could be considered at a later date. However, if the changes are implemented at a later date they would come with significant additional implementation costs, whereas if they are implemented as part of BT the changes will not have additional costs because they can be included in the new systems and processes that are being developed as part of BT. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The focus of BT has been on administrative improvements to the tax and social policy systems. Given this, fundamental changes to the child support scheme such as changes to the child support formula, are out of scope. The Welfare Expert Advisory Group has proposed changes which, if adopted, would impact the child support scheme (such as passing on child support payments from liable parents to parents who are on the sole parent benefit). 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 17 IN CONFIDENCE 2.5 What do stakeholders think? The main stakeholders are parents and carers who are in the child support scheme, and employers who deduct child support payments from wages. The discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy was released in July 2017 which included proposals outlined in this document to: •introduce compulsory employer deductions of child support from salary and wages; •not penalise people who are trying to comply, and better support early intervention to prevent debt; •align the child support definition of income with the definition of income used for other social policy products; and •work with customers in unusual circumstances. An extensive engagement strategy was developed to support the release of the discussion document, including online public consultation which provided a vehicle for the public to comment on the proposals. It included an online forum with views sought on specific questions, short summaries of the key proposals, a simplified online survey and animated videos of the proposals. The summaries, surveys and videos were available in nine languages other than English and the video was also available in New Zealand sign language. Officials also met with key interest groups around New Zealand – for example, the National Beneficiary Advocacy Group. Submitters broadly agreed with the proposals. Submitters’ comments were mixed about making compulsory child support wage deductions for all liable parents with employment income. Some submitters expressed concerns about the compliance costs for employers and there were concerns whether compulsory deductions should apply to fully compliant parents. Submitters supported expanding the income definition used for child support purposes to better align with that used for Working for Families tax credits and student loans. Submitters supported Inland Revenue working proactively with customers to manage debt. Submitters strongly supported the proposal to provide Inland Revenue with additional authority to work with customers who have these unusual circumstances in order to achieve the intended outcome for the specific social policies. In relation to the proposal to introduce a time bar, targeted consultation was undertaken with interest groups. These groups were: •National Beneficiaries Advocacy Consultative Group; •The Federation of Budget Advisors; •Citizens Advice Bureau; and •Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 18 IN CONFIDENCE One group were comfortable with the proposal and thought that the proposed exceptions addressed any possible inequities. Another group supported a time bar when there has been a default assessment 9 and a reassessment would result in a reduction of child support paid by the liable parent and a debt for the receiving carer. However, they do not support the introduction of a time bar when there has been a default assessment and a reassessment would result in an increase in child support being payable by the liable parent and money due to the receiving carer. Their concerns include: •that the proposal undermines the integrity of the child support scheme and may be perceived by the public and those who pay the correct amount of child support as unfair; •it fails to meet the objective of the child support scheme which is to ensure parents fulfil their responsibilities to financially support their children; and •that it fails to ensure that Inland Revenue meets its responsibilities to administer the scheme for those parents who voluntarily choose to receive their child support through Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue considered these concerns and consider that, on balance, the proposal is fairer as it provides parents and carers with more certainty. Any equity concerns can be addressed by the specified exceptions to the time bar. Inland Revenue consulted with the Treasury, the Ministry of Social Development and Oranga Tamariki (as Inland Revenue collects child support for beneficiaries and Oranga Tamariki as the custodian of wards of the State) on the proposals set out in this regulatory impact assessment. The Ministry of Justice and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (child poverty unit) were consulted on relevant proposals. These agencies generally supported the proposals. Officials have consulted with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner on the compulsory deductions proposal. The Privacy Commissioner is pleased to support the compulsory deductions proposal as a measure that is consistent with applying good privacy values. The discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy included information in Te Reo. The proposals will apply to Maori the same as for any customer in the child support scheme. The proposal to include Maori authority income (which is a type of investment income) will affect those with income from Maori authorities in the same way as it affects people with other types of investment income. 9 A default assessment is when a parent has not filed a relevant return and the Commissioner has determined the income on which to base the child support assessment. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 19 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 3 : O p tio n s id en tific a tio n 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? This regulatory impact assessment contains a number of proposals. The recommended options work together in combination to deliver on the key objectives to simplify the rules, make the rules fairer, and encourage engagement and compliance with the scheme. Penalties rules Option 1: Maintain the status quo with some operational improvements including, better education, improved statements and better online content. The option would be unlikely to deliver significant improvements on current state. Option 2: Make some small changes to the existing rules including, increasing the time period between the imposition of the 2% and 8% initial penalties and only charge a 1% incremental penalty each month (rather than a 2% incremental penalty reducing to 1% after a year). This option would slow the escalation of the debt book but is unlikely to have much impact on preventing debt in the first instance and improving compliance behaviours. Option 3: Charge no penalties. This option would slow the escalation of the debt book due to the accumulation of penalty growth but could increase the value of assessment debt. It could mean some liable parents stop paying altogether. Research conducted showed penalties do play a part in incentivising compliance by keeping child support “front of mind”. Charging no penalties may reduce compliance with the scheme. Option 4: Introduce a grace period for new payers (for a three-month period), increase the period between the imposition of the 2% and 8% initial late payment penalties (up to 28 days –that is, closer to the next due date), and remove the $5 minimum penalty rule. The changes would simplify aspects of the scheme, reduce administration and compliance costs and enable Inland Revenue to better work with customers to encourage their ongoing compliance. Penalties would still be charged when a person is non-compliant, however they would be in proportion to the amount outstanding. Parents agree penalties have a place in the scheme but when they are too punitive they cause them to disengage with the scheme and reduce compliance. Increasing the time between charging the 2% and 8% penalty to 28 days would means on average an additional 540 parents would not be charged the second stage (8%) of the penalty each month. With the additional interventions that could be employed in the 28 days before the 8% penalty is charged, it is expected even more parents would benefit from not incurring a penalty (although we cannot say how many more). 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 20 IN CONFIDENCE Compulsory deductions Option 1: Status quo with operational improvements This option could see some improvements in debt collection and compliance due to the better information received by Inland Revenue due to pay day reporting, but it would not prevent people falling into debt. Option 2: Extension of compulsory source deduction payments to liable parents who become liable after the proposals come into effect (rather than just those who have defaulted). The Commissioner would have discretion not to impose deductions in certain cases – for example, for privacy reasons. Liable parents already in the scheme who are compliant would not be subject to compulsory deductions unless they defaulted. This provides more certainty to carers and helps to prevent customers falling into debt in the first place. It aligns the policy with beneficiaries who are liable parents as they have deductions made from their benefit. Time bar Option 1: Status quo. This option does not provide any certainty for carers and parents as adjustments can be made back to 1992, which can result in debt for either parent and can result in reopening cases which have already been closed. Administratively, continuing to make adjustments to child support assessments back as far as 1992 becomes unsustainable, particularly given the move to the new system. Option 2: A time bar with no exceptions. This option improves certainty and reduces administration costs and debt. However, it is open to manipulation and could result in inappropriate outcomes. It would reduce the overall fairness and equity of the scheme. Options 3: A time bar with specific exceptions: •If information provided by a person in the child support assessment is fraudulent or wilfully misleading or omits income of a particular nature; •when a parent or child included in the assessment has died; •when a person should never have been made liable – for example, when a person is subsequently found not to be the father of a child; •when a reassessment is required to avoid a dual liability (for the same child) with an overseas jurisdiction; •if Inland Revenue does not meet the notification requirements; or •if a court order is granted that applied to a time barred period. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 21 IN CONFIDENCE Definition of “income” Option 1: Status quo. This option would not make use of the information that Inland Revenue now receives on a regular basis. The current approach of reducing a person’s income for child support purposes due to tax losses from earlier years means the income used in the assessment does not fully reflect the person’s ability to financially support their children and does not contribute to improving the fairness of the scheme. It does not align with how these losses are accounted for when working out Working for Families entitlements and student loan obligations. Option 2: Full alignment with the income definitions used for Working for Families and student loans purposes – for example to include income not reported for tax purposes such as money given by a family member to help with living costs (over a certain threshold) This option would significantly increase complexity, compliance and administration costs. Due to the increased complexity of the rules, more adjustments would be made to people’s assessments as income that should be, or not be, included in the assessment is identified. This would reduce the certainty of payments. Child support already has provisions which allow for other types of financial resources to be taken into account in assessments – for example, administrative reviews. Option 3: Moving to a net income base and including other reported income (aligning more closely with the definition of income for Working for Families and student loans). Moving to a net income basis ensures that income is no longer reduced due to tax losses from an earlier year and more accurately reflects each parent’s ability to financially support their children. Given that the majority of the parents who have losses that reduce their income are liable parents, the net effect of the proposal overall is to increase liable parents’ obligations toward the support of their children. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? Compliance with the scheme – The proposal should improve compliance with the scheme, particularly for liable parents. This should reduce the number of people in debt. Certainty and complexity – The proposal should result in the right amount being paid and will reduce over or underpayments. It should reduce complexity of the rules. Compliance costs – The proposal should reduce compliance costs for parents and carers. Administration cost – The proposal should reduce administration costs. Equity and fairness – The proposal should be fair and equitable, and not encourage or reward undesirable behaviours. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 22 IN CONFIDENCE 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? An option to not have any employer deductions from salary or wages (or source deduction payments) was ruled out as it would reduce compliance with the scheme and further misalign the rules for non-beneficiary liable parents with those that apply to beneficiary liable parents. A beneficiary liable parent must have their child support deducted from their benefit whether in debt or not. Replacing penalties with interest which would be passed on to the receiving carer is considered to be outside the scope of the BT work. Further it does not fit with the purpose of the scheme which is the transfer of payments between parents as interest is generally applied when the Government is the direct recipient of the money collected. More closely aligning the time bar with the time bar for tax by only considering the time bar once a person has had their relevant income assessment for a child support year finalised. As most parents do not file income tax returns this option would mean that child support reassessments would still be available for many years. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Withheld under section 9(2)(f)(iv) of the Offcial Information Act 1982 Impact Statement T emplate | 23 IN CONFIDENCE Sectio n 4 : Imp ac t An a ly s is Penalty rules Compliance with the child support rules Certainty Compliance costs Administration costs Equity and fairness Status quo and operational improvements 0 0 0 0 0 Increasing period between the imposition of the two phases of the initial penalty and reducing the incremental to 1% + allows for interventions before the 8% penalty is charged 0 + more time before 8% penalty charged, debt growth is slowed + debt growth is slowed 0 No penalties -

Inland Revenue’s preference is to move forward with the following combination of options (as outlined in section 3 Options identification) Penalty rules – option 4 to make changes by introducing a three month grace period for new payers, increase the period between the imposition of the 2% and 8% initial late payment penalties (up to 28 days – that is, closer to the next due date), and remove the $5 minimum penalty rule. This option is recommended as it best meets the assessment criteria that the options were rated against. The changes would simplify aspects of the scheme, reduce administration and compliance costs and enable Inland Revenue to better work with customers to encourage their ongoing compliance. Penalties would still be charged when a person is non-compliant however they would be in proportion to the amount outstanding. Parents agree penalties have a place in the scheme but when are too punitive they cause them to disengage with the scheme and reduce compliance. Compulsory deductions – option 2 which extends compulsory deductions to all new liable parents. This will improve the timeliness of child support and help to prevent newly liable parents getting into debt. Time bar – option 3 which introduces a time bar but with specific exceptions. This will increase certainty for parents and reduce compliance and administration costs. Definition of “income” – option 3 which moves to a net income basis and includes investment income (interest and dividends). These proposals will make the rules fairer and the investment income proposal will reduce compliance and administration costs. Minor and technical proposals – all the minor and technical proposals included in in the appendix (including those applying to customers with unusual circumstances). We consider that the combination of these options would best achieve the desired outcomes of improved ongoing compliance with the scheme and debt prevention. The combination of interventions would improve administration and reduce compliance costs but also make the rules fairer, more equitable, and less complex, thereby improving and incentivising customers, and particularly liable parent compliance. Overall, they should result in a reduction in debt. Non-compliance would still be addressed by penalties but in a more proportional manner. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 27 IN CONFIDENCE 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties Comment: Impact Evidence certainty Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (Liable parents, receiving carers and employers) Liable and receiving parents About 80,000 parents would have their child support income increased by the income definition changes. This could increase or decrease the child support liability depending on whether they were the liable parent or receiving carer respectively. Liable parents The time bar would mean about 1,600 liable parents who would have been reassessed would not receive a reduction to their obligations. Receiving carers The time bar would mean about 1,000 liable parents would not be reassessed so would not see their obligations increased. This means receiving carers would not see their entitlements increased. Employers Additional compliance costs for compulsory deductions for employers if they are not already required to make child support deductions. Additional interest income added to assessments of $11 million Total reduction to obligations is about $16million per year Total reduction in receiving carer entitlements is about $6million per year Unable to quantify but would be low as child support deductions are already made on behalf of many liable parents and compulsory for child support defaulters Medium–low Medium Medium High 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 28 IN CONFIDENCE Regulators (Inland Revenue) The changes to the way penalties are imposed would reduce the penalties charged, which in turn would reduce the amount of penalties collected.

This means receiving carers would not see their entitlements reduced – which causes receiving carer overpayment and debt. The scheme will benefit receiving carers by encouraging liable parents to comply with their obligations and therefore making it more likely that carers receive payments.

The proposals would require amendment to the Child Support Act 1991. It is intended that the preferred option be included in a child support amendment bill which is expected to be introduced into Parliament at the end of 2019. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the operation of these options and they will form part of its business as usual function. Although not the key driver, the preferred options will reduce the implementation risks associated with transferring the child support scheme from the current computer platform to the new systems and processes. The proposed changes will apply to child support from April 2021.This will enable sufficient preparation time for Inland Revenue to implement the changes. Changes for employers to make compulsory deductions are effectively business as usual as they are already required to make deductions for some parents under the current rules. The proposed approach will be included in the commentary on the child support amendment bill. Consideration by Select Committee is expected to provide an opportunity for interested parties to further express their views on these proposed changes. Transitional proposals have been included where identified. Further transitional issues may come to light during the design and build of the new system. They will be considered when they arise. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? There were no issues concerning implementation raised in consultation. There is a risk that employers choose not to be compliant with the new compulsory deduction rules. However, this is unlikely as they already required to make deductions when they are instructed to do so by Inland Revenue. There is a risk that customers may not respond as expected to the penalty measures and that, as a result, compliance reduces. This can be mitigated by use of customer education and existing enforcement provisions, the introduction of compulsory deductions and improved information made available through Inland Revenue’s BT programme. As part of moving to the new systems, Inland Revenue will begin designing and building the new agreed proposals before the legislation is enacted. If there are any delays in making the amendments, there is a risk that the system and the legislation are not aligned. This risk will be mitigated through consultation with the Minister’s office and the 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Withheld under section 9(2)(f)(iv) of the Offcial Information Act 1982 Impact Statement T emplate | 32 IN CONFIDENCE development of a contingency plan. Sec tion 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lu a tio n a n d re v ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue already monitors timeliness of child support payments, obligations paid on time (including for newly liable parents), amounts collected and dispersed (including amounts collected through employers). Inland Revenue is currently building a monitoring and evaluation framework for child support. These tools will be used to monitor and evaluate the proposals when they are implemented. Inland Revenue will monitor the effectiveness of the proposed legislation when implemented. If we identify any evidence that suggests the legislation is not operating as intended, we will consider options for addressing the issues raised. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the Generic Tax Policy Process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. Any necessary changes identified from the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. Inland Revenue is currently building a monitoring and evaluation framework for child support. These tools will be used to monitor and evaluate the proposals when they are implemented. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 33 IN CONFIDENCE Appendix Minor and technical amendments to improve fairness, equity, compliance or administration of the scheme The following proposals are aimed at specific issues that have been identified with the scheme. Combined, they are intended to make the administration of the scheme fairer, simpler and less confusing – for example, by aligning the rules across different social policies. Not all of these proposals are required to be included in this impact assessment; they have been included for transparency and completeness. Most will impact positively on customers. The exception is the proposal to amend the maximum age of child support which would mean that for a small group of carers (a maximum of about 150) child support for the child would end some months sooner than is currently the case. However, this proposal largely aligns child support with Working for Families tax credits which Inland Revenue also administers. Improvements to the income estimation provisions Estimation square ups Child support is based on a past year’s income. An exception is when a person’s income in the current year will decrease by 15% or more when compared to the income in the past year. In such cases the person can “estimate,” and elect to use their current income as the basis of their child support assessment. At the end of the year, any estimate is reconciled with the actual income earned in the period of estimation to assess the final child support payment. If a person estimates more than once during the year, each estimation is reconciled separately at the end of the year. If a person estimates more than once during the year, the current rules mean that when their estimate is reconciled they can be assessed on income that is greater than what they earned in some periods. The proposal is to amend the end of year square up provisions to ensure that a person who estimates more than once during a year is squared up on the income they earned in the period. Estimation timing An estimation is only accepted from the beginning of the month in which the estimate is received. This can mean that a person new to the child support scheme may lose the opportunity to estimate for periods (generally the previous month) because they receive their notice of assessment or entitlement in a later month. The proposal is that when a person joins the child support scheme an estimation can be backdated to the start of the assessment if Inland Revenue receives the estimation on or before the first due date for payment. This would mean that a person has at least 30 days to estimate their income when child support is first assessed and does not miss the opportunity to estimate due to Inland Revenue processing times. Debt offsetting Currently, a person can apply for an administrative review if they want debt owed between themselves and another parent offset. Administrative review is a process where a person’s formula assessment can be changed to better fit a person’s specific situation. The number of times the ground has been used is very low and the provision is difficult to administer as it requires an adjustment to the assessment calculation to achieve the desired result. The proposal is to introduce a provision permitting Inland Revenue to initiate an offset of the amount owed. The offset would net out child support debts two parents owe each other. The person owing the higher amount would be required to pay the difference. Such a provision would be simpler, cheaper, easier for customers to understand and would be more effective at reducing debt, and in some cases would clear the parent’s full debt. Removing this 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 34 IN CONFIDENCE debt burden can reduce financial stress on the parent and may have other flow on effects such improving their credit rating. Repealing a redundant provision for urgent maintenance The Child Support Act contains a provision for a person to apply to the Courts for an urgent maintenance order if they have made an application for child support to Inland Revenue, but the child support application has not been processed. It is believed the provision was included in the Child Support Act to cover the period of transition when child support moved to Inland Revenue in 1992 in case there were any unforeseen circumstances that could mean Inland Revenue is unable to raise an assessment. An order under this provision has never been granted so it is recommended the provision is removed. The Ministry of Justice has been consulted and is comfortable with the provision being repealed. Working with customers with unusual circumstances Changes to temporary exemptions Subject to a person meeting specified income criteria, temporary exemptions from payment of financial support (child support and domestic maintenance) are available to a liable person if they are a long-term (13 weeks or more) prisoner or hospital patient. They are justified on the basis that the person has no capacity to earn an income for the period. The proposal is to extend the ability to grant a prisoner exemption to a person in an overseas prison, and to give Inland Revenue discretion to grant a hospital exemption to a person who is not in hospital but who is suffering from long-term illness or injury (and, for example, is being cared for at home). In both instances, granting the exemption would be subject to the current income criteria being met. The number of people who might qualify for the amended exemptions is not quantifiable. However, it is expected it would be low. The proposals align with the overall policy intent that prisoners and the long-term ill should be given temporary relief from their obligations if they do not have the financial capacity to pay at least the minimum child support amount. Removal of the mixed age expenditure table The child support formula uses expenditure tables to calculate the costs of children. They have been developed based on research that concluded teenagers cost more than younger children and economies of scale apply – i.e. each subsequent child costs less. There are three expenditure tables used for calculating the costs of children for child support. One for children aged 12 and younger, one for children aged 13 and older and a ‘mixed age’ table which is an average of the two other tables. The mixed age table is used when there are at least two children in the same child support calculation and they fall into different age brackets. However, if the children do not live in the same household (for example one child lives with mum and the other with dad), the use of the mixed age able does not allocate costs appropriately to each child (although the total expenditure for all children is correct). Removal of the mixed age table will mean costs are calculated for each child based on their age and would better reflect that costs are higher for older children. It will not change the total expenditure calculations but when children live in different households it would ensure the household with the younger child does not benefit from being allocated some of the expenditure intended for the older child. Discretion to modify expenditure calculations when perverse outcomes are reached Although the child expenditure tables are developed on the basis of economies of scale the child support formula then provides that total expenditure is divided equally by number of children rather than attempting to 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 35 IN CONFIDENCE identify the “marginal costs” of each subsequent child. This can cause perverse outcomes in situations when there are multiple children in a child support calculation that have different care arrangements. For example, a person’s dependent child allowance reducing when additional children come into their care – it is expected that the allowance remain the same or increase. Allowing Inland Revenue, the discretion to modify expenditure calculations would give it the ability to modify the calculation to resolve these complex cases by, for example, identifying the actual marginal costs of children. It is expected the number of cases to consider would be low. Based on 2016 data and the known criteria that could lead to perverse outcomes, less than 40 cases each year could arise that need adjustment. Clarifying that child support should end when a child leaves State care When a child moves from the receiving carer to the liable parent child support can continue and a new application for child support is not required. The exception to this is when the receiving carer is Oranga Tamariki because the child has been placed in their care. In these situations, if the child leaves Oranga Tamariki’s care and is placed with one of the parents the child support is stopped. This practice is followed due to potential safety concerns for the child and their carer as the other parent would be notified of the change in carer. If the parent with the child in their care would like to receive child support, they are able to apply. Parents who choose not to apply for child support due to safety concerns may be eligible for other financial assistance from the state - such as Working for Families tax credits. The proposed amendment explicitly ends child support when a child leaves the care of Oranga Tamariki. It clarifies and reinforces the current practice. Introducing timeframes for parents and carers to provide orders of parentage If a person makes an application for child support and they do not have any proof of who the other parent is, the child support application is declined. If the applicant subsequently provides a court order stating that the person named on the child support application is the parent of the child, the child support application is accepted from the date the original application was received. The proposal is to introduce some time limits to improve fairness. The rules would mean child support would only be back-dated on receipt of a court order declaring parentage if the carer applied for the order either before or within two months of submitting their child support application and, having been granted, the order is given to Inland Revenue within two months. There would be discretion for Inland Revenue to accept orders outside the two-month period if the delay was due to circumstances beyond the carers control – for example, they were seriously ill. These court orders are used as proof of parentage in a small number of cases. Between 1 January 2016 and 28 February 2019, an order was used as proof of parentage in 325 cases. For most (260), the order was received either with the child support application or within two months of the application being received, so the proposal would have had no impact in these cases. For the remaining carers, if the time limits were met, there would have been no impact on the amount of child support they receive. However, the proposal would remove the ability for the carer to ‘hold off’ giving Inland Revenue the order knowing the support can still be backdated. For liable parents it restores some equity as it means an onus is put on carers to be timelier in their decisions to seek child support through Inland Revenue (as opposed to the current state where some cases have taken more than 13 years for the carer to provide the order). Timeframes to advise of circumstances when first assessed When Inland Revenue is satisfied that a relevant change of circumstance has occurred – for example, the birth of a new dependent child or a change in care arrangements, the Child Support Act determines when the change is to be treated as having occurred. If a change is notified within 28 days of it occurring, it is recognised from the date it occurred. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 36 IN CONFIDENCE However, this does not apply when the circumstance existed at the time the child support was assessed for the first time. In these situations, the assessment is considered incorrect and should be corrected effective from the start of the child support assessment. This can cause overpayments to carers (for example, if a liable parent notifies Inland Revenue of a dependent child that reduces their payments) or increases in payments by liable parents (if a receiving carer likewise notifies of a dependent child). Any increase in payments for past periods are due within 30 days. The proposal is that similar notification rules that apply to changes of circumstances during a child support assessment should also apply to the notification of circumstances that existed at the time child support was first assessed. The parent should have 28 days from the date of their notice of assessment to advise of their existing circumstances, otherwise the change would apply from the date of notification. Minimum age at which a child can be considered financially independent When a child is financially independent they no longer qualify for child support. To be financially independent the child must be working full time (considered 30 hours or more per week, or what might be considered full time for the type of work), or in receipt of a benefit or student allowance. Fewer than 60 children under the age of 16 have had child support ceased by virtue of being considered financially independent since the scheme began. If a parent believes the child has significant financial resources that should be taken into account in determining the child support assessment, they can ask for this to be considered by apply for a departure from their assessment (commonly referred to as an administrative review). The proposal is to introduce a minimum age of 16 before a child can be considered financially independent. This would fully align the financially independent definition for child support with that used for Working for Families tax credits. Maximum qualifying age of a child A child ceases to qualify for child support once they turn 18 unless they are still at school. Once a child turns 18 child support ends the earlier of: -when they leave school if they do not finish the school year; -the 31 st of December if they finish the school year and they are not attending school the following year; or -the day before the child turns 19 if the child is still in school until their 19 th birthday. The proposal is to amend the qualifying criteria, so the latest child support could be paid is the 31 st of December of the year in which the child turns 18. The schooling criteria would be retained. This change aligns the child support ‘maximum qualifying age’ of a child with similar tests for Working for Families and main benefit recipients. Administrative data shows that this change would mean child support would end sooner for about 150 children. Residency for child support purposes A parent can apply for child support for a child if the child is a New Zealand citizen or ordinarily resident in New Zealand. Child support is payable by a parent who is a New Zealand citizen or ordinarily resident in New Zealand or in a country with which New Zealand has a reciprocal agreement with. A person is “ordinarily resident in New Zealand” if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand or they are physically 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 37 IN CONFIDENCE present in New Zealand for at least 183 days in a year and are not overseas for more than 325 days in aggregate in any 12 month period. For child support, residency decisions are often based on a person’s intended, rather than actual, movements. This means that child support applications are accepted (or ended) in a timely manner rather than up to 12 months later during which time children may be living without the financial support of both their parents. The proposal is to better reflect the current operational practice that a person’s intention to be ordinarily resident (or not) should be taken into account. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Sensitive - Budget Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Social Wellbeing Committee BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION – AMENDMENTS TO THE CHILD SUPPORT ACT 1991 Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Social Wellbeing Committee’s agreement to amen dments to the Child Support Act 1991, which are focused on improving the administration of the child support scheme by taking advantage of the opportunity offered by the modernisation of Inland Revenue’s systems. These improvements are aimed at improving engagement and compliance with the scheme which would in turn support improvements to the welfare of children. Executive summary 2.Inland Revenue’s multi-year Business Transformation (BT) programme will mode rnise New Zealand’s revenue system. It is currently planned that the child support scheme will move to the new system and processes in April 2021 (BT release 5). This creates opportunities to improve the administration of the scheme and reduce complexity in the new system at the same time. 3.The proposed amendments fall into five categories: 3.1 changes to the child support penalty rules to simplify the rules an d make them fairer and more effective; 3.2 compulsory employer deductions for newly liable parents; 3.3 limiting retrospective reassessments by introducing a time-bar; 3.4 aligning key child support definitions with definitions used in other social policy pr o ducts; and 3.5 technical amendments to assist the administration of the scheme, including to bet ter work with customers with unusual circumstances. 4. I p ropose that the majority of these changes be included in a child support amen dment bill to be introduced in early 2020, to be effective from April 2021. 1 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-01-28 16:18:49 IN CONFIDENCE 8. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) Background 5.Inland Revenue’s multi-year transformation programme will modernise New Zealand’s revenue system. Once complete, customers will spend far less time and effort ensuring they meet their obligations and receive their correct social policy entitlements. 6.Business transformation is enabled by a combination of changes to policy, process, te chnology and the organisational design of Inland Revenue. It is far more than an upgrade of technology and has provided the opportunity to review how the revenue system is administered and consider what changes may be needed. 7.It is currently planned that the child support scheme will move to the new system and pro cesses in April 2021 (BT release 5). This creates opportunities to improve the administration of the scheme and reduce complexity in the new system at the same time. 8.In July 2017 the previous Government released a discussion document Mak ing Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy (the discussion document). The discussion document explored proposals for improving the way social policy entitlements and obligations are administered by Inland Revenue, including child support. Child support is money paid by parents who do not live with their children or who share the care with someone else. The money is to help with the costs of raising the children. 9.The focus of the discussion document was not on changing the fundamental policy settings, but rather improving the administration by taking advantage of the opportunity offered by the modernisation of Inland Revenue’s systems. 10.The proposals in this Cabinet paper have been developed following feedback on the di scussion document. Si mplification of the penaltyrules 11.Currently, if a person does not pay their financial support (child support or domestic maintenance 1 ) on time penalties apply. An initial penalty of 2% is imposed the day after the due date and, if payment is not made, a further 8% penalty is applied seven days later. Incremental penalties are then charged each month the payment is outstanding – 2% each month for the first year which reduces to 1% per month after a year until the amount outstanding is paid. 12.Penalties play an important role in encouraging parents to meet their child support ob ligations. However, excessive penalties can discourage the payment of child support to the detriment of the children concerned. As at February 2019, the child support debt book is $2.2 billion; of which $550 million is child support and $1.7 billion is penalties. Research by Inland Revenue indicates that the current penalty rules are seen as overly harsh. Most penalties can be, and are, written off – for example, because the person has complied with a payment arrangement. The recovery of debt is challenging. Currently, 97 percent of child support penalty debt is written down at initial recognition as it is not expected to be collected. 1 Domestic maintenance is a payment made to an ex-spouse or ex-partner, either ordered by the Court or agreed to by the ex-spouses. 2 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-01-28 16:18:49 IN CONFIDENCE s 9(2)(f)(iv) 13.Research (undertaken by Inland Revenue) suggests that Inland Revenue is too quick to penalise people. 2 People consider that penalties are needed as an incentive to keep child support “top of mind”, but do not understand the rules and therefore do not know how to “fix things” when they go wrong. People feel that the rules need to provide “clarity, flexibility and the perception that Inland Revenue is working with customers”. 14. Child support is due every month. 15.I recommend the following in relation to child support and domestic maintenance debt: 15.1 The imposition of the second phase of the initial penalty is moved to 28 days af ter the due date, which would give Inland Revenue time to contact the customer and explain the consequences of not paying (for example, the imposition of the 8%, the use of charging orders) with the aim of working with the person to get them back on track. 15.2 The rule which provides that the minimum penalty imposed is $5 is repealed, wh ich would ensure that the 2% penalty imposed is in proportion to the amount outstanding. 15.3 1 5.4 A grace period is introduced for customers who are new, newly liable, or ret urning to the child support scheme during which penalties would not be charged but enforcement action (such as deductions from bank accounts) could be taken, which would allow Inland Revenue to work with customers to help them get things right from the start. The grace period would apply to the customer’s first due date and for any due dates that occur within the next 60 days (which would usually cover the next two payments). 16. 2 The research consisted of 27 one-on-one interviews around the country. The interviewees were a mix of liable parents and receiving carers, and a mix of levels of income. 3 3 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-01-28 16:18:49 IN CONFIDENCE s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. Compulsory deductions for newly liable parents 22.Currently, employers must make deductions when a liable parent is in debt or cho oses this payment option. Deductions are also compulsory for liable parents in receipt of a benefit (including a veteran’s pension or NZ Super). Compulsory employer deductions of financial support (child support and domestic maintenance) from source deduction payments (salary, wages and schedular payments 4 ) for newly liable parents were proposed and then descoped from the 2013 child support reforms largely because the monthly PAYE system meant they could not be effectively administered. As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation, payday reporting is mandatory from 1 April 2019. This means PAYE details are provided to Inland Revenue closely following each pay day and that Inland Revenue can now effectively implement compulsory employer deductions for newly liable parents when child support moves to the new system. 23.Compulsory deductions would assist liable parents first entering the scheme by he lping them get their payments right from the start and avoid them going into debt. 4 Schedular payments are certain types of payments that are made to contractors. 4 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-01-28 16:18:49 IN CONFIDENCE s 9(2)(f)(iv) Currently, compliance for new liable parents in the first few months is very low – less than a third pay on time. 24.I recommend that compulsory deductions of financial support be made from source deduction payments made by New Zealand employers. However, in some cases it may not be appropriate for the deduction to be made – for example, if the person has multiple employers or for privacy reasons. Therefore, I recommend that in such cases Inland Revenue should have the discretion to determine the compulsory deduction rules do not apply (and alternative arrangements are made to collect child support). If the person subsequently defaults, compulsory deductions would then be applied. 25.The change would apply to all new child support liable parents. As part of the t ransition to the new compulsory deduction rules, I recommend that compulsory deductions are not made immediately if at the time of transition a person is not having child support deducted and is compliant with their child support obligations. If the person stops complying or decides to opt in, compulsory deductions would then apply. This would smooth the impact of the change on employers, liable parents and Inland Revenue. 26.This would work in conjunction with the grace period which will mean that the grace p eriod will affect self-employed people more. Time bar 27.Unlike tax child support does not have a statutory time bar preventing reassessments for past periods. This means that reassessments must be made as far back as July 1992 if Inland Revenue is given information that is relevant to a past child support year. Reassessments can occur for a number of reasons – for example, changes in income, changes in care arrangements and parents reconciling. This creates uncertainty for parents. It also results in additional administrative costs. In a number of cases there is no actual change in the amount to be paid as a result of the reassessment. 28.I recommend the introduction of a child support time bar which would operate in a si milar way to the tax time bar. Reassessments of child support for past years could only be made within four years from the end of the relevant child support year (subject to a number of exceptions). Four years is consistent with the tax rules and covers the period over which most child support reassessments occur. The time bar would also apply to administrative and Commissioner initiated reviews 5 – that is, there would be a four-year period in which to seek an administrative review. 29.In order to deal with any equity issues that may arise, I recommend that the time bar would not apply: 29.1 if information provided by a person in the child support assessment is f raudulent or wilfully misleading or omits income of a particular nature in a return; 6 5 “Administrative review” is the term used to describe the process when a person makes an application for a departure from the formula under the Child Support Act 1991. 6 Including if the assessment is a default assessment which does not include income of a particular nature. 5 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-01-28 16:18:49 IN CONFIDENCE 29.2 when a person who is part of the child support assessment dies; 29.3 when a person should never have been made liable – for example, when a person is subsequently found not to be the father of a child; 29.4 when an amendment is required for the purposes of avoiding a dual liability (f or the same child) with an overseas jurisdiction; 29.5 if Inland Revenue does not meet the notification requirements; or 29.6 if a Court Order is granted that applies to a time barred period. 30.If an exception applies and a retrospective reassessment is made, objection rights w ould still be available to affected parties and a person would have up to four months to ask for an administrative review for that year. Definition of “income” 31.Income is one of the components used in child support to calculate the financial su pport that should be provided for a child based on the combined incomes of both parents. Currently, for parents whose sole income is from withholding income, only their employment income is included in their child support assessment. That is, interest and dividends subject to resident withholding tax is excluded. This is because, in the past, interest and dividend income was not generally known until the end of the tax year. However, new rules require that from 1 April 2020 interest and dividend income be reported to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis. I recommend that the income definition for this group of parents should be widened to include interest and dividends from the preceding calendar year. This would be easy to administer and would not cause undue compliance burden on parents, given this income is already provided to Inland Revenue for tax purposes. 32.One of the objectives of child support is that the level of financial support that parents p rovide for their children is determined according to their relative capacity to do this. It is at odds with that objective to reduce one parent’s relative capacity to support a child in that year due to tax losses that occurred in an earlier year. 7 I recommend moving from a taxable income to a net income base for child support. This would mean that tax losses would no longer be carried forward to reduce the income used to calculate child support obligations. Similar amendments would need to be made to the estimation provisions to move them from a taxable to a net income base. 33.Inland Revenue’s administrative review process can currently be used to mitigate the i mpact of tax losses on the assessment and the exclusion of interest and dividends, if appropriate. However, it takes time and additional cost to go through the process. 7 These losses would have been taken into account in an earlier child support year. 6 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-01-28 16:18:49 IN CONFIDENCE Technical amendments to assist the administration of the scheme, including working with people with unusual circumstances Improvements to the income estimation provisions Estimation square ups 34.Child support assessments are based on a past year’s income. An exception is when a person’s income in the current year will decrease when compared to the income in the past year. The decrease must be 15% or more. In such cases, the person can “estimate,” and elect to use their current income as the basis of their child support assessment. At the end of the year, any estimate is reconciled with the actual income earned in the period of estimation to assess the final child support payment. If a person estimates more than once during the year, each estimation is reconciled separately at the end of the year. 35.When a person estimates more than once during the year, the current rules mean t hat when their estimate is reconciled they can be assessed on income that is greater than what they earned in some periods. I recommend an amendment to the end-of-year square up provisions to ensure that a person who estimates more than once during a year is squared up on the income they earned in the period. Estimation timing 36.An estimation is only accepted from the beginning of the month in which the estimate is received. This can mean that a person new to the child support scheme may lose the opportunity to estimate for periods (generally the previous month), because they receive their notice of assessment or entitlement in a later month. I recommend that when a person joins the child support scheme an estimation can be backdated to the start of the assessment if Inland Revenue receives the estimation on or before the first due date for payment. 37.This would mean that a person has at least 30 days to estimate their income when ch ild support is first assessed and are not missing the opportunity to estimate due to Inland Revenue processing times. Debt offsetting 38.Currently, a person can apply for an administrative review if they want to offset debt o wed between two parents. Administrative review is a process where a person’s formula assessment can be changed to better fit a person’s specific situation. 39.The number of times the ground has been used is very low and the provision is d ifficult to administer as it requires an adjustment to the assessment calculation to achieve the desired result. I recommend that a provision permitting Inland Revenue to initiate an offset of the amount owed be introduced. The offset would net out child support debts two parents owe each other. The person owing the higher amount would be required to pay the difference. Such a provision would be simpler, cheaper, easier for customers to understand and would be more effective at reducing debt. 7 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-01-28 16:18:49 IN CONFIDENCE Repealing a redundant provision for urgent maintenance 40.The Child Support Act contains a provision for a person to apply to the Courts for an urgent maintenance order if they have made an application for child support to Inland Revenue, but child support has not been assessed. I believe the provision was included in the Child Support Act to cover the period of transition when child support moved to Inland Revenue in 1992 in case there were any unforeseen circumstances that meant Inland Revenue was unable to raise an assessment. An order under this provision has never been granted. I recommend the provision is repealed. Working with customers with unusual circumstances Changes to temporary exemptions 41.Subject to a person meeting specified income criteria, temporary exemptions from p ayment of financial support (child support and domestic maintenance) are available to a liable person if they are a long-term (13 weeks or more) prisoner or hospital patient. They are justified on the basis that the person has no capacity to earn an income for the period. I recommend extending the ability to grant a prisoner exemption to a person in an overseas prison, and to give Inland Revenue discretion to grant a hospital exemption to a person who is not in hospital but who is suffering from long-term illness or injury (and, for example, is in an overseas hospital or is being cared for at home). In both instances, granting the exemption would be subject to the current income criteria and a person overseas would be allowed to receive income analogous to that allowed for a New Zealand based person. Removal of the mixed age expenditure table 42.The child support formula uses expenditure tables to calculate the costs of children. T hey have been developed based on research that concluded teenagers cost more than younger children and economies of scale apply – that is, each subsequent child costs less. 43.There are three expenditure tables used for calculating the costs of children for child support. One for children aged 12 and younger, one for children aged 13 and older and a ‘mixed age’ table which is an average of the two other tables. The mixed age table is used when there are at least two children in the same child support calculation and they fall into different age brackets. However, if the children do not live in the same household (for example, one child lives with mum and the other with dad), the use of the mixed age table does not allocate costs appropriately to each child (although the total expenditure for all children is correct). 44.I recommend removing the mixed age table. This will mean costs are calculated for e ach child based on their age and would better reflect that costs are higher for older children. It will not change the total expenditure calculations but when children live in different households it would ensure the household with the younger child does not benefit from being allocated some of the expenditure intended for the older child. 8 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-01-28 16:18:49 IN CONFIDENCE Discretion to modify expenditure calculations when perverse outcomes are reached 45.More complex situations may not be resolved by the repeal of the mixed age table. For example, when there are multiple children in a child support calculation that have different care arrangements (such as, two children in full care of a parent, and two other children in shared care). Rather than attempting to introduce complex legislative fixes each time a new situation is identified, I recommend the introduction of discretion to allow Inland Revenue to adjust calculations when children from the same family live in different care arrangements and the formula is not achieving the intended outcome. This would allow, for example, some complex cases to be resolved by identifying the actual marginal costs of subsequent children. 46.There is precedent for this type of provision in the Act. The Act is written on the a ssumption that a child has two parents and those parents are living apart. When these assumptions are not correct Inland Revenue must (for the purposes of raising a formula assessment) modify the provisions of the Act to reflect the true position. This provision has been used administratively to alter formula calculations in situations when a child has only one parent, or the child is living in the care of a non- parent carer, say a grandparent, and their parents have not separated. 47.I recommend giving Inland Revenue discretion to modify expenditure calculations to re solve these complex cases by, for example, identifying the actual marginal costs of children. Clarifying that child support should end when a child leaves State care 48.When a child moves from the receiving carer to the liable parent child support can continue and a new application for child support is not required. The exception to this is when the child has been placed in State care. 8 In these situations, if the child leaves State care and is placed with one of the parents the child support is stopped. 9 This practice is followed due to potential safety concerns for the child and their carer as the other parent would be notified of the change in carer. If the parent with the child in their care would like to receive child support, they are able to apply. 49.I recommend a clarification to explicitly end child support when a child leaves State ca re. It would reinforce the current practice. Introducing timeframes for parents and carers to provide orders of parentage 50.If a person applies for child support and they do not have any proof of who the other p arent is, the child support application is declined. If the applicant subsequently provides an order of parentage made by the Court stating that person named on the child support application is the parent of the child, the child support application is accepted from the date the original application was received. These orders are usually a paternity order granted under the Family Proceeding Act 1980 but in rare cases may also be a step parent declaration under section 99 of the Child Support 8 “State care” means the child is in the care of the Chief Executive of Oranga Tamariki or an iwi or social service, a cultural social service or a child and family support service approved under section 396 of the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989. 9 Any payments made in relation to the child (under section 363 of the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989) stop when a child has left State care. Any child support entitlement to Oranga Tamariki or an organisation approved under section 396 of the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989 also ends when these payments cease. 9 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-01-28 16:18:49 IN CONFIDENCE Act or a court declaration that a person is a guardian by virtue of being the father. It may also be an order made in an overseas court or public authority. 51.I recommend introducing some time limits to improve fairness. The rules would mean child support would only be back-dated on receipt of an order if the carer applied for the order either before or within two months of submitting their child support application and, having been granted, the order is given to Inland Revenue within two months. I recommend that Inland Revenue be given discretion to accept the orders outside the two-month periods if the delay was due to circumstances beyond the carer’s control – for example, they were seriously ill. 52.This would remove the ability for the carer to hold off giving Inland Revenue the o rder knowing the support can still be backdated. For liable parents, it restores some equity as it means an onus is put on carers to be timelier in their decisions to seek child support through Inland Revenue. Introducing timeframes to advise of circumstances when child support first a ssessed 53.When Inland Revenue is satisfied that a relevant change of circumstance has occurred – for example, the birth of a new dependent child or a change in care arrangements - the Child Support Act determines when the change is to be treated as having occurred. If a change is notified within 28 days of it occurring, it is recognised from the date it occurred. However, this does not apply when the circumstance existed at the time the child support was assessed for the first time. In these situations, the assessment is considered incorrect and should be corrected effective from the start of the child support assessment. This can cause overpayments to carers (for example, if a liable parent notifies Inland Revenue that they are the carer of a new dependent child that reduces their payments) or increases in payments by liable parents (if a receiving parent likewise notifies that they are the carer of a new dependent child). Any increase in payments for past periods are due within 30 days. 54.I recommend that similar notification rules that apply to changes of circumstances d uring a child support assessment should also apply to the notification of circumstances that existed at the time child support was first assessed. The parent should have 28 days from the date of their notice of assessment to advise of their existing circumstances, otherwise the change would apply from the date of notification. Minimum age at which a child can be considered financially independent 55.When a child is financially independent they no longer qualify for child support. To be f inancially independent, the child must be working full time (considered 30 hours or more per week, or what might be considered full time for the type of work), or in receipt of a benefit or student allowance. 56.I recommend that a child be 16 before they can be considered financially i ndependent. This would fully align the financially independent definition for child support with the rules that apply for Working for Families. If a parent believes the child has significant financial resources that should be taken into account in 10 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-01-28 16:18:49 IN CONFIDENCE determining the child support assessment, they can ask for this to be considered by an administrative review. Maximum qualifying age of a child 57.A child ceases to qualify for child support once they turn 18 unless they are still at school. Once a child turns 18 child support ends upon the earlier of: 57.1 when they leave school if they do not finish the school year; 57.2 the end of the calendar year if they finish the school year and they are not a ttending school the following year; or 57.3 the day before the child turns 19 if the child is still in school until their 19th b irthday. 58.I recommend that the latest child support could be paid is to the end of the calendar year in which the child turns 18. The schooling criteria would be retained. This change aligns the child support maximum qualifying age of a child with similar tests for Working for Families and main benefit recipients. As a transitional arrangement, if a child in school turns 18 before 1 April 2021, the old rules will apply, and child support will continue to apply until they turn 19. Residency for child support purposes to enable a person’s intended movements to b e taken into account 59.A child qualifies for child support if they are a New Zealand citizen or ordinarily resident in New Zealand. Child support may be sought from a person who is a New Zealand citizen, or who is ordinarily resident in New Zealand or in a country with which New Zealand has a reciprocal agreement with. 10 A person is “ordinarily resident in New Zealand” if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand or they are in New Zealand for at least 183 days in a year and are not overseas for more than 325 days. 60.In practice, child support residency decisions are usually based on a person’s i ntended movements. This is because residency for child support purposes needs to be determined in order to accept a child support application or end a child support assessment in a timely manner. If this approach is not taken, a carer could for example, have to wait up to 325 days before Inland Revenue could accept their application for support. This is different to the approach taken for tax purposes. Because income is assessed looking back over a period, the tax residency test looks at a person’s actual movements. 61.I recommend that the legislation be amended so that it allows for a person’s intended mo vements to be taken into account. This would mean a non-New Zealand citizen who moved to New Zealand less than 183 days ago and intends to live here could be made liable for child support for their New Zealand child. This would better reflect the current operational practice. 10 Currently, Australia is the only country that New Zealand has a reciprocal agreement with. 11 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-01-28 16:18:49 IN CONFIDENCE Consultation 62.Most of the proposals in this paper were included in the discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy, which canvassed proposals relating to Working for Families and student loans as well as child support. The consultation generated 37 email submissions, 183 comments on the online forums, 374 responses to the surveys and one response to the foreign language surveys. Inland Revenue officials held 17 face-to-face meetings with stakeholders. 63. T he discussion document contained proposed approaches to social policy debt man agement that included no longer charging penalties and interest in certain situations and supported an early intervention approach aimed at debt prevention. However, it did not canvass the specific penalty proposals put forward here. 64.Submitters generally supported the proposals in the discussion document. Submitters comments were mixed about making compulsory child support wage deductions for all liable parents with employment income. Some submitters expressed concerns about the compliance costs for employers and there were concerns whether compulsory deductions should apply to fully compliant parents. Officials have subsequently consulted with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. The Privacy Commissioner is pleased to support the compulsory deductions proposal as a measure that is consistent with applying good privacy values. 65.Submitters supported expanding the income definition used for child support pu rposes to better align with that used for Working for Families tax credits and student loans. 66.Submitters strongly supported the proposal to provide Inland Revenue with additional au thority to work with customers who have unusual circumstances in order to achieve the intended outcome for the specific social policies. 67.Officials also undertook targeted consultation with interest groups on the proposal to introduce a time bar. One group was comfortable with the proposal and thought that the proposed exceptions addressed any possible inequities. Another group supported a time bar when there has been a default assessment 11 and a reassessment would result in a reduction of child support paid by the liable parent and a debt for the receiving carer. However, they did not support the introduction of a time bar when there has been a default assessment and a reassessment would result in an increase in child support being payable by the liable parent and money due to the receiving carer. Their concerns include: 67.1 that the proposal undermines the integrity of the child support scheme and may be perceived by the public and those who pay the correct amount of child support as unfair; 67.2 it fails to meet the objective of the child support scheme which is to ensure pa rents fulfil their responsibilities to financially support their children; and 11 A default assessment is when a parent has not filed a relevant return and the Commissioner has determined the income on which to base the child support assessment. 12 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-01-28 16:18:49 IN CONFIDENCE s 9(2)(f)(iv) 67.3 that it fails to ensure that Inland Revenue meets its responsibilities to administer the scheme for those parents who voluntarily choose to receive their child support through Inland Revenue. 68.I consider on balance that the proposal is fairer as it provides parents with more cert ainty while still addressing equity concerns through the specified exceptions to the time-bar. 69. Officials have consulted with the Treasury, Ministry of Social Development and Oranga Tamariki (as Inland Revenue collects child support for beneficiaries and wards of the State), and the Ministry of Justice in respect of the proposals to repeal the provision allowing for urgent maintenance and the time limits for the provision of orders of parentage. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (Child Poverty Unit) was consulted on the penalty proposals. These agencies generally agreed with the proposals. Ministry of Justice were informed of the proposed penalty changes. Financial implications 70.The fiscal costs for these proposals relate to repealing the minimum $5 penalty charge and introducing a grace period for people who are newly liable, or returning, to the scheme. The objective of penalties is to encourage customers to comply with their obligations, not to raise revenue. 7 1.Accounting standards require child support debt to be recognised at fair-value. The fa ir value of child support penalty debt is only 3% of the original penalty due to high initial write-down. The annual cost of each proposal is: 71.1 71.2 $30,000 per annum to introduce a grace period; and 71.3 $23,000 per annum to repeal the minimum $5 penalty charge. 72. The costs of introducing the grace period and repealing the $5 minimum penalty cha rge are immaterial and will not impact on annual revenue forecasts. 13 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-01-28 16:18:49 IN CONFIDENCE s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) 73. 74. 7 5. L egislative implications 76.Implementing these proposals requires changes to the Child Support Act 1991. 77.I f approved, I propose including most of the legislative changes resulting from these reco mmendations in a child support amendment bill, scheduled for introduction in early 2020. All of the proposals would apply from 1 April 2021. This aligns with the transition of child support to the new systems and processes as part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation. Impact analysis 78.The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Ch ild support Business Transformation RIA prepared by Inland Revenue, and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the RIA meets the quality assurance criteria. Human rights 79.No inconsistencies with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Ri ghts Act 1993 have been identified. 14 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-01-28 16:18:49 IN CONFIDENCE s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) Gender implications 80.Child support is intended to financially support children. However, the amount of child support paid and the way the payments are administered affects both receiving and liable parents. 81.Data is not collected on the gender breakdown of receiving and liable parents. Ho wever, data from Statistics NZ indicates that most one-parent families are headed by women. 12 Accordingly, it seems reasonable to assume that women are more likely to receive child support and men more likely to be liable for child support. 82.Overall, the proposals should improve fairness and reduce compliance costs for both rece iving and liable parents. To the extent that the proposals should increase the engagement by liable parents with the scheme (by encouraging liable parents to make payments more consistently), this will indirectly have a positive impact of women who are carers of dependent children, by reducing their financial stress. Disability perspective 83.No specific impacts on people with disabilities have been identified. Publicity 84.I will make an announcement on the contents of the bill, including the proposals, wh en the child support amendment bill is introduced. A commentary on the bill will also be released at this time. Inland Revenue will include details of the new legislation in a Tax Information Bulletin after the bill is enacted. Proactive release 85.I propose to delay the proactive release of this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, an d key advice papers until the proposed child support amendment bill containing the legislative amendments to give effect to the recommendations in this paper is introduced.

Following this consultation, and discussion with the Ministry of Social Development, officials recommend that the bill make the eligibility criteria for the proposed exemption clearer and more consistent with the original policy intent. 5.Cabinet has also authorised you to approve minor technical changes related to the proposals (SWC-19-MIN-0110). In the course of preparing drafting instructions, officials have identified several items which we consider fall under this category and recommend that you agree to these items. These are discussed in detail below. 6.A disclosure statement is attached to accompany the Cabinet Paper in accordance with Cabinet guidelines. 7. 8. Background 9.The policy changes in the Bill will improve the administration of the child support scheme, by taking advantage of the opportunity offered by the modernisation of Inland Revenue’s systems as part of its Business Transformation (BT) programme. 10.It is planned that the child support scheme will move to the new system and processes in April 2021 (BT release 5). This bill would therefore need to be passed by the end of 2021 (or very early in 2021) so that the legislative changes align with the operational changes for the new system. The Bill contains the items listed below. The main items were approved by Cabinet in September 2019 (CAB-19-MIN-0447). s 9(2)(f)(iv) Sensitive - Budget IR2020/041: Cabinet paper – Child Support Amendment Bill: Approval for introduction Page 2 of 11 SENSITIVE 11.The key changes in the Bill are: 11.1 Simplification of penalty rules. 11.2 Introduction of compulsory deductions of financial support from source deduction payments made by an employer for newly liable persons. 11.3 Introduction of a four year time bar. 11.4 Amending the definition of “income”, which will: 11.4.1 widen the definition of “income” used for child support purposes to include investment income such as dividends and interest; and 11.4.2 move the definition of “income” used for child support purposes from a “taxable income” to a “net income” base. 11.5 Technical amendments to assist the administration of the scheme, including amendments to allow Inland Revenue to work better with customers with unusual circumstances. Legislation Design and Advisory Committee consultation 12.Officials requested consultation from LDAC on the proposed time bar and proposed discretion to modify expenditure calculations when perverse outcomes are reached. These proposals, LDAC’s comment and officials’ responses are outlined below. Discretion to modify calculations when unintended outcomes are reached 13.C abinet has agreed to a proposal which would grant the Commissioner of Inland Revenue discretion to modify child expenditure calculations in instances when application of the child support formula resulted in perverse outcomes ( SWC-19- MIN-0110 paragraph 36 and CAB-19-MIN-0447). Background 14.In several places, the child support formula uses a child expenditure figure to account for the cost of raising children. Child expenditure is derived from the child expenditure table. The expenditure table is based on economies of scale; each subsequent child increases child expenditure by a progressively smaller amount. Example 1: In the current child support year, a parent earning $61,351.00 per annum caring for dependent child(ren) aged under 12 would be permitted a dependent child allowance of: •$9,816.12 for 1 child; •$14,417.20 for 2 children; and •$16,257.25 for 3 or more children. T he expenditure table does not provide individual child expenditure figures. However, these can be calculated from the difference between total figures: Sensitive - Budget IR2020/041: Cabinet paper – Child Support Amendment Bill: Approval for introduction Page 3 of 11 SENSITIVE 15.Although expenditure calculations serve the majority of cases, in some complex s ituations these calculations can produce unintended outcomes. For example, if a parent has two dependent children in their care full time and a third dependent child enters their care for o nly 50% of the time, while that parent’s dependent chil d a llowance might reasonably be expected to increase or stay the same, it can in fact decrease. 16.This can occur because of how the formula for calculating the dependent child allowance apportions total expenditure amongst the children concerned. The formula divides expenditure equally between each child. Expenditure is granted to the parent as a dependent child allowance in proportion to the amount of time they care for each relevant child. However, because subsequent children increase child expenditure by a progressively smaller amount, the formula deducts the proportion of time from a greater share of total expenditure than the child has contributed. 17.O fficials presented to LDAC two possible solutions: 17.1 A more clearly delineated (and less flexible) power to identify within the total expenditure the actual marginal cost of dependent children for the purposes Example 2: 1.The parent in the example above, providing 100% care for two dependent children, would have a dependent child allowance of $14,417.20. C hild 1 Child 2 Total expenditure 1.If a third child (Child 3) were to enter their care for 50% of the time, it could be reasonably expected that their dependent child allowance would increase by 50% of the expenditure permitted for that child (in this instance, around $920). C hild 1 Child 2 Child 3 Total expenditure 2.H owever, this is not the outcome reached under current rules. Since the formula fo r t he dependent child allowance divides expenditure equally amongst the children, Child 3 is allocated an equal third of total expenditure, of which the parent is permitted only 50% (in this instance, $2,709.54). As such, the parent’s dependent child allowance decreases from $14,417.20 to $13,547.70, even though there is an additional child in their care.

LDAC’s comment 18.LDAC did not object to the proposed broad discretionary power for the Commissioner. LDAC did, however, recommend that the Bill include a test for the exercise of the discretion to modify calculations. 19.LDAC noted that there would be the safeguard of a statutory right to object to the expenditure calculations. However, they further commented that this safeguard would be less effective if there were no criteria for the Commissioner’s proposed discretion to modify expenditure calculations, since objections need to state clearly the grounds of the person’s objection. Therefore, if the process were unclear, a parent might find it difficult to formulate an objection. 20.LDAC noted that a statutory test would further make it easier for the person assessing an objection to determine whether the objection should succeed. Officials’ response 21.Officials generally agree with LDAC’s comments regarding a statutory test, and favour the broader discretion. The draft legislation reflects that the discretion should apply only in exceptional circumstances, and that in applying the test the Commissioner must have regard to whether the formula would result in an unfair or unintended outcome. Time bar 22.Cabinet has agreed to a proposed time bar of four years on the reassessment of child support assessments (SWC-19-MIN-0110 paragraphs 16-23 and CAB-19-MIN- 0447). B ackground 23.Currently, child support does not have a statutory time bar preventin g reassessments for past periods. Consequently, reassessments must be made as far back as July 1992 (being the start of the child support scheme) if Inland Revenue is given information that is relevant to a past child support year. This can lead to uncertainty for parents, who might at any time have their entitlement or liability reassessed. 24.The proposed time bar would limit reassessments of child support to within four years of a child support year ending. F our years is consistent with the tax rules time bar, and currently less than 2% of reassessments occur outside this period. To address equity concerns, the time bar would not apply if: 24.1 information provided by a person in the child support assessment is fraudulent or wilfully misleading or omits income of a particular nature; 24.2 it is found that a person who is part of the child support assessment has died; 24.3 the person should never have been made liable (for example, a person is subsequently found not to be the parent of a child); 24.4 an amendment is required for the purpose of avoiding a dual liability for the same child with an overseas jurisdiction; Sensitive - Budget IR2020/041: Cabinet paper – Child Support Amendment Bill: Approval for introduction Page 5 of 11 SENSITIVE 24.5 Inland Revenue has not met the notification requirements; or 24.6 a Court Order is granted that applies to a time barred period. LDAC’s comment 25.LDAC noted that the current rules raise natural justice issues as it may be difficult for a parent to exercise their right to a fair hearing when objecting to a reassessment after a significant period has passed. As such, LDAC concluded that the proposal seemed an improvement. 26.LDAC expressed concern that the “relatively short length” of the proposal perio d co uld prevent fair outcomes for children, receiving carers and liable parents. LDAC noted that Inland Revenue have addressed some particular fairness concerns. LDAC advised that Inland Revenue might still wish to consider a general exception to cover any other situations where the time bar might be unfair to parties. Officials’ response 27.Officials consider that a general exception on the grounds of unfairness woul d d etract from the proposal’s effectiveness. Since a reassessment invariably result s i n the carer receiving less, or the liable parent paying more, there is broad potential for one party to perceive the reassessment as unfair. If the general exception could be widely applied, it would weaken the certainty of assessment which the proposal aims to achieve. 28.Officials believe that the specific exceptions listed above adequately balance the need that assessments be raised on correct grounds with the concern that parents have certainty that their entitlements and liabilities will not change after a long period of time. Consultation with Disabled Peoples’ Organisations Coalition 29.At Cabinet’s direction, officials consulted with the Disabled Peoples’ Organisations Coalition to determine who would be captured in the extension of the hospital exemption (SWC-19-MIN-0110 and CAB-19-MIN-0447). Under this proposed extension, the exemption for long-term hospital patients from paying child support would be extended to persons unable to work because of a long-term injury or illness, but not cared for in a hospital. 30.We will provide a separate report to you on this consultation (report IR2020/042 refers). You may wish to refer it to the Minister for Disabled Persons for her information. Following this consultation, we recommend that the bill make the eligibility criteria for the proposed exemption clearer and more consistent with the original policy intent, in particular by: 30.1 not allowing the person to earn benefit income analogous to the benefit payable to hospital patients (because there is no such benefit); and 30.2 requiring that the person must be unable to work because of the injury or illness. 31.These recommendations are discussed in more details below, under “Exemption for persons suffering from a long-term period of illness”. Items for approval by Minister of Revenue 32.Cabinet has agreed to grant you delegated authority to approve minor technica l c hanges related to proposals included within the Bill. Officials recommend that you agree to the following minor technical changes. Sensitive - Budget IR2020/041: Cabinet paper – Child Support Amendment Bill: Approval for introduction Page 6 of 11 SENSITIVE Additional exception to proposed time bar for when a new assessment results in reassessment of a time barred assessment 32.1 If a new child support assessment were raised in relation to a qualifying child(ren) for a time barred period (because, for example, an order of parentage was provided), and there was an existing assessment for another qualifying child(ren), the existing assessment would need to be reassessed. This is because the child support formula includes calculations to account for any liability a parent might have under a different assessment. 32.2 32.3 A dditional exception to proposed time bar for the permanent exemption from paying child support for victims of sex offences 32.4 Liable parents who are victims of sex offences can apply for an exemption from paying child support for children conceived as a result of those offences. 32.5 Currently, this exemption can be applied as far back as 26 September 2006, which is when the exemption provisions were first introduced. Officials consider that the time bar should not limit the application of this exemption. L imit of four months to apply for an administrative review in relation to a time barred assessment 32.6 Paragraph 30 of the Cabinet Paper Business Transformation – Amendments to the Child Support Act 1991 notes that a person would have up to four months to request an administrative review 1 for an assessment or reassessment made in relation to a time barred period. However, this was not reflected in the Cabinet paper’s recommendations. 32.7 Officials recommend that a four-month limit in which to apply for an administrative review be imposed on assessments or reassessments made in relation to time barred periods. There is currently no time limit for administrative reviews. However, officials consider that such a limit is needed to ensure the policy intent of the time bar can be achieved. 1 “Administrative review” is the term used to describe the process when a person makes an application for a departure from the child support formula under the Child Support Act 1991. Recommendation Agree that an exception be added to the proposed time bar so that when a new child support assessment should result in the reassessment of a time barred assessment, the time-barred assessment can be reassessed. Agreed/Not agreed Recommendation Agree that an exception to the proposed time bar be added so that this exemption can be applied back to 26 September 2006. Agreed/Not agreed Recommendation Agree to the implementation of a four month limit to apply for an administrative review in relation to a time barred assessment. Agreed/Not agreed Sensitive - Budget IR2020/041: Cabinet paper – Child Support Amendment Bill: Approval for introduction Page 7 of 11 SENSITIVE Offsetting liabilities whether they have become due and payable or not under proposed offsetting provision 32.8 Under current rules, a person can apply to have their liability to another person offset against a liability which that person owes to them (whether these amounts have become due and payable or not). This is provided for under an administrative review ground. In addition, the Child Support Act permits Inland Revenue to offset the liability which two parents owe each other, but only if the amounts have not become due and payable. 32.9 The number of times that the administrative review ground has been used is very low. Furthermore, it is difficult to administer as to achieve the desired result requires an adjustment to the child support formula calculation. 32.10 Cabinet has agreed to replace the offsetting ground with a provision permitting Inland Revenue to offset the amount owed between two parents (SWC-19-MIN-0110 paragraph 29 and CAB-19-MIN-0447). The proposal refers explicitly to offsetting amounts owed (CAB-19-MIN-0447). Alongside the existing provisions, this would allow Inland Revenue to initiate the offsetting of ongoing liability against ongoing liability, and overdue amounts against overdue amounts, but not ongoing liability against overdue amounts. Since the current administrative review ground permits ongoing liability to be offset against owed amounts, officials recommend that the proposal be modified to maintain this capability. B ackdating estimations 32.11 Child support assessments are based on a past year’s income. If a person expects that their income in the current year will decrease from the past year’s income by 15% or more, they can elect to estimate what they think they will earn in the current year. The estimate is used as the basis of their child support assessment. At the end of the child support year, the estimate is reconciled with the person’s actual earnings. 32.12 An estimation can only be accepted from the beginning of the month in which the estimate is received. Cabinet has agreed that when a person joins the child support scheme an estimation can be backdated to the start of the assessment if Inland Revenue receives the estimation on or before the first due date for payment (CAB-19-MIN-0447). 32.13 Both receiving carers and liable parents can elect to estimate their income. However, officials have determined that since only liable parents receive due dates for payment, the change would not apply to receiving carers as intended. Recommendation Agree that the proposal be modified to reflect that the administrative review ground be replaced by a provision which would allow Inland Revenue to offset amounts owed between two parents whether they have become due and payable or not. Agreed/Not agreed Recommendation Agree to modify the proposal so that an estimation can be backdated to the start of the assessment if received within 28 days of notification of the assessment. This limit is consistent with current rules for backdating changes in living circumstances. Agreed/Not agreed Sensitive - Budget IR2020/041: Cabinet paper – Child Support Amendment Bill: Approval for introduction Page 8 of 11 SENSITIVE Exemption for persons suffering from a long-term period of illness 32.14 Under current rules, a liable parent who is a long-term 2 hospital patient can apply for a temporary exemption from paying child support. The rationale for the exemption is that during this period the person is unable to earn an income. Consequently, they must have an income of nil; consisting solely of income from investments, and not exceeding the weekly average of the minimum annual child support liability (currently, $18); or consisting solely of the benefit payable to long-term hospital patients (currently, $45.28 per week). 32.15 Cabinet has agreed to a proposal permitting Inland Revenue discretion to grant a hospital exemption to a person who is not hospitalised but is unable to work due to a long-term illness or injury (CAB-19-MIN-0447). The same income criteria as the exemption for hospital patients would apply, including income analogous to the benefit payable to long-term hospital patients. 32.16 However, after consultation with the Ministry of Social Development, officials have determined that there is no such analogous benefit which a person who suffers from a long-term illness or injury, and is not a hospital patient, could earn while meeting the income criteria. That is, the exemption will only apply to a person who suffers from a long-term illness or injury and is not a hospital patient if the person’s income is nil or consists solely of income from investments, and not exceeding the weekly average of the minimum annual child support liability (currently, $18). 32.17 In addition, the proposal does not specify that the person must be unable to work due to the illness or injury. 33.Your approval is also sought to correct the following drafting errors in the legislation: Tax Administration Act 1994 33.1 As a result of the repeal of certain sections of the Tax Administration Ac t 1 994 and the insertion of new provisions to deal with collection, use and disclosure of revenue information, some cross references need to be updated in the Child Support Act: 33.1.1 The Child Support Act grants the Commissioner of Inland Revenue authority to obtain information from the Ministry of Justice and New Zealand Police when determining if a person is eligible for an exemption from paying child support to the victim of a sex offence. However, it cites now repealed section of the Tax Administration Act in order to do so. 33.1.2 The definition of “relevant payments” in the Child Support Act refers to a now repealed section of the Tax Administration Act for the definition of “earnings related compensation”. 2 13 weeks or more. Recommendation Agree that the proposal be modified to remove reference to analogous benefit income and to clarify that the person must be unable to work due to the illness or injury. Agreed/Not agreed Sensitive - Budget IR2020/041: Cabinet paper – Child Support Amendment Bill: Approval for introduction Page 9 of 11 SENSITIVE De finition of “social security beneficiary” 33.2 The definition of “social security beneficiary” has been repealed from the Child Support Act (subsequent to updates made as a result of the Social Security Act 2018 rewrite). However, it is still referred to as being specifically defined in the Child Support Act in various sections of the C hild Support Act. Living allowance Date at which rate of living allowance is in force 33.3 The living allowance is an amount of a parent’s child support income which is set aside for personal costs, and so is not considered as income available for determining the amount of the child support payable under a formula assessment. There is a standard rate of living allowance for all persons, except for those receiving a supported living payment who are entitled to a higher rate. 33.4 The Child Support Act sets out that the rate of living allowance for a given year be determined according to the rate set out in the Social Security Act 2018 of either the sole parent support benefit, or the supported living payment (for those entitled to the higher rate of living allowance). The living allowance is calculated by increasing the appropriate benefit rate by the total amount of income tax deductions required to make the rate a gross rate. 33.5 Prior to the Child Support Amendment Act 2013, the Child Support Act stipulated that the tax rate at which to gross the benefit rate for each year be in force on 1 January of the preceding year. However, this was inadvertently removed in the amendment of the Act. Ra te of living allowance for beneficiaries receiving a supported living payment 33.6 As mentioned above, beneficiaries receiving a supported living payment are permitted a higher rate of living allowance. The relevant section of the Child Support Act was updated consequentially to the 2018 Social Security Act rewrite. However, the update inadvertently widened who qualifies for the rate of living allowance based on the supported living payment. Before the Recommendation Agree that the above cross references be corrected to cite the right sections of the Tax Administration Act. Agreed/Not agreed Recommendation Agree that references in the Child Support Act to the definition of “social security beneficiary” be removed. Agreed/Not agreed Recommendation Agree t hat the Child Support Act be amended to clarify that the rate at which to gross up the appropriate benefit rate for the coming child support year should be the rate in force on 1 January of the preceding year. Agreed/Not agreed Sensitive - Budget IR2020/041: Cabinet paper – Child Support Amendment Bill: Approval for introduction Page 10 of 11 SENSITIVE amendment, this living allowance was limited to a single beneficiary with at least one dependent child and receiving a supported living payment. It has now been widened so that it is payable to any beneficiary granted a supported living payment. Definition of hospital patient 33.7 The Alcoholism and Drug Addiction Act 1966 was repealed and replaced by the Substance Addiction (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 2017. Prior to this, the Child Support Act had defined “hospital patient” as “a resident of an institution certified under the Alcoholism and Drug Addiction Act 1966”. 33.8 As a consequence of the repeal and replacement of the Alcoholism and Drug Act, the definition of “hospital patient” in the Child Support Act was amended to “a patient within the meaning of the Substance Addiction (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 2017”. That meaning is: a person in respect of whom an approved specialist has signed a compulsory treatment certificate. 33.9 This new definition does not refer specifically to a “patient” as being resident in a certified institution. An individual who is subject to a compulsory treatment certificate would be defined as a “hospital patient” under the Child Support Act, even while not resident in a medical institution. Therefore, the definition has been inadvertently widened beyond the policy intent. Next steps Draft disclosure statement 34.A draft disclosure statement is attached to accompany the Cabinet Paper in accordance with Cabinet guidelines. The draft disclosure statement is referred to Cabinet along with the Cabinet paper. The draft statement is finalised by Inland Revenue with the Parliamentary Counsel Office three days before the introduction of the Bill and is made public when the Bill is introduced. Recommendation Agree that the Child Support Act be amended so that the higher rate of living allowance is limited to a single beneficiary with at least one dependent child as intended. Agreed/Not agreed Recommendation Agree that the definition of “hospital patient” be amended to refer to a person who is “a resident in a treatment centre” under the Substance Addiction (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 2017. This would be the equivalent of the previous definition in the Child Support Act.

The Bill introduces amendments to the Child Support Act 1991. 2.I have requested that this Bill have a category 2 priority on the 2020 Legislative Prog ramme (must be passed in the year). Policy 3.The policy changes in the Bill will improve the administration of the child support scheme, by taking advantage of the opportunity offered by the modernisation of Inland Revenue’s systems as part of its Business Transformation (BT) programme. 4.As part of its five-year Business Transformation (BT) programme, Inland Revenue is modernising its systems and processes to be more flexible and customer- focussed. This includes modernising Inland Revenue’s functions in collecting and di sbursing child support. Almost all areas that are administered by Inland Revenue (including income tax, GST and Working for Families) have already migrated. 5.The administration of child support is the final major area of Inland Revenue that will migrate to the new computer system and processes for the start of the child support year in April 2021 (as BT Release 5). 6.A Bill is necessary because amendments to existing legislation are required to imp lement the proposed policy changes. The policy changes are listed below. Policy items with Cabinet approval (SWC-19-MIN-0110, CAB-19-MIN-0447) 7.Simplification of penalty rules, including to: 7.1 move the imposition of the second phase of the initial penalty to 28 days after th e initial due date; 7.2 repeal the rule which provides that the minimum penalty imposed is $5; and 7.3 introduce a grace period of 60 days from the first due date in which a newly liable person, or person returning to the scheme, will not be charged late payment penalties. 1 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-03-05 12:00:53 SENSITIVE 11. 8.Compulsory deductions of financial support from source deduction payments made by an employer to newly liable persons. 9.A time bar of four years, which will: 9.1 prevent reassessments for periods outside the four year period; 9.2 start four years after the end of the relevant child support year; and 9.3 be subject to specific exceptions to address concerns about fairness (such as i f the information provided by a person is fraudulent or wilfully misleading). 10.Amend the definition of “income”, which will: 10.1 widen the definition of “income” used for child support purposes to include i nvestment income such as dividends and interest; and 10.2 move the definition of “income” used for child support purposes from a “taxable income” to a “net income” base. 11.Technical amendments to assist the administration of the scheme, including to work w ith customers with unusual circumstances, including: 11.1 providing that when a person joins the child support scheme, an estimation ca n be backdated to the start of the assessment if received on or before the first due date of payment; 11.2 updating the end-of-year reconciliation rules for estimates to reflect the income over the period an estimate applies for; 11.3 replacing the offsetting departure ground with a provision permitting Inland R evenue to offset the amount owed between two parents; 11.4 repealing the urgent maintenance order provisions; 11.5 amending the prisoner exemption to allow it to be granted to a liable person in the overseas equivalent of a New Zealand prison; 11.6 amending the hospital exemption to give Inland Revenue discretion to grant t he exemption to a liable person suffering from long-term illness or injury even if they are not in a New Zealand hospital or residential care facility; 11.7 repealing the mixed age expenditure table; 11.8 providing Inland Revenue with a discretion to adjust child expenditure ca lculations in situations when complex care arrangements for children in the same calculation are not adequately accounted for by the usual method; 11.9 clarifying the legislation to state explicitly that a child support assessment sh ould end when a child leaves State care; 2 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-03-05 12:00:53 SENSITIVE 11.10 introducing time constraints of two months for the provision of court orders of parentage for the backdating of child support assessments; 11.11 providing that a person has 28 days from the date they are first notified of an a ssessment to advise Inland Revenue of existing living circumstances, otherwise the circumstances are effective from the date of application; 11.12 providing that a child should not be considered financially independent for ch ild support purposes unless they are aged at least 16; 11.13 providing that child support should cease at the end of the calendar year in w hich a child turns 18, if that child attends school up until the end of the school year; 11.14 amending the definition of “residency” for child support purposes to enable a p erson’s intended movements to be taken into account. Items not requiring Cabinet approval 12.Cabinet has authorised me to approve minor technical changes for inclusion in the Bi ll (SWC-19-MIN-0110, CAB-19-MIN-0447) I ask Cabinet to note that I have approved: 12.1 the addition of an exception to the proposed time bar so that when a new child support assessment should result in the reassessment of an existing assessment that is time-barred, that time-barred assessment can be reassessed; 12.2 the addition of an exception to the proposed time bar so that application of the e xemption from paying child support for victims of sex offences is not limited by the time bar; 12.3 the addition to the proposed time bar of a four month limit to apply for an administrative review 1 in relation to a time barred assessment (the four month limit was discussed in the Cabinet paper Business Transformation – Amendments to the Child Support Act 1991 (SWC-19-SUB-0110), but was not reflected in the paper’s recommendations); 12.4 a change to the proposal to replace the current administrative review ground p ermitting Inland Revenue to offset the amount owed between two parents with a provision, which would clarify that Inland Revenue could offset amounts whether they have become due and payable or not (which is permitted by the current administrative review ground, but not explicitly stated by the proposal); 12.5 a change to the proposal allowing new members of the child support scheme to backdate an estimation 2 to the start of their liability if submitted within 28 1 “Administrative review” is the term used to describe the process when a person makes an application for a departure from the formula under the Child Support Act 1991. 2 Child support assessments are based on a past year’s income; if a person expects that their income in the current year will decrease from the past year’s income by 15% or more, they can elect to estimate what they think they will earn in the current year as the basis of their child support assessment. 3 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-03-05 12:00:53 SENSITIVE days of notification of the assessment, which clarifies that the proposal applies to both liable parents and receiving carers; 12.6 clarifying the eligibility for the proposed exemption from paying child support f or persons suffering from a long-term period of illness or injury, so that: 12.6.1 the exemption would not be available if the person receives any income f rom a benefit (the existing exemption for hospital patients allows liable parents to receive the exemption if the only income that they receive is a very small amount of investment income and a specific benefit that is only payable to long term hospital patients – this benefit is not available to people who are not hospital patients); and 12.6.2 the exemption would be available only if the person is unable to work b ecause of the injury or illness. 13.I have also approved remedial changes to the Child Support Act to: 13.1 update cross references in the Child Support Act which refer to now repealed se ctions of the Tax Administration Act; 13.2 remove references in the Child Support Act to the definition of “social security b eneficiary”, which was removed from the Child Support Act subsequent to updates made as a result of the 2018 Social Security Act rewrite; 13.3 clarify that the net benefit rates used to calculate the rate of living allowance e ach year (used in the child support formula to account for parents’ personal living costs) should be grossed up to account for tax using the applicable tax rate in force on 1 January of the immediately preceding child support year; 13.4 limit the higher rate of living allowance available to a recipient of the supported living payment to a beneficiary with at least one dependent child in their care, as it was before being inadvertently widened in an update following the 2018 Social Security Act rewrite; and 13.5 amend the definition of “hospital patient” in the Child Support Act, which was u nintentionally widened in an update following the repeal of the Alcoholism and Drug Addiction Act 1966, which was replaced by the Substance Addiction (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 2017. Contentious items 14.As noted in the Cabinet paper Bu siness Transformation – Amendments to the Child Support Act 1991 (SWC-19-SUB-0110), in consultation about the proposed changes, concerns were raised about the time bar. Officials undertook consultation with interest groups on this proposal. One group was comfortable with the proposal and thought that the proposed exceptions addressed any possible inequities. Another group supported a time bar when there has been a default assessment 3 and a reassessment would result in a reduction of the child support paid by the liable 3 A default assessment is when a parent has not filed a relevant return and the Commissioner has determined the income on which to base a child support assessment. 4 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-03-05 12:00:53 SENSITIVE 15. 16. 17. 18. parent and a debt for the receiving carer. However, they did not support the i ntroduction of a time bar when there has been a default assessment and a reassessment would result in an increase in child support being payable by the liable parent and money due to the receiving carer. Their concerns include: 14.1 that the proposal undermines the integrity of the child support scheme and ma y be perceived by the public and those who pay the correct amount of child support as unfair; 14.2 it fails to meet the objective of the child support scheme which is to ensure p arents fulfil their responsibilities to financially support their children; and 14.3 that it fails to ensure that Inland Revenue meets its responsibilities to a dminister the scheme for those parents who voluntarily choose to receive their child support through Inland Revenue. To address concerns about fairness, the time bar would not apply if: 15.1 information provided by a person in the child support assessment is fraudulent o r wilfully misleading or omits income of a particular nature in a return; 15.2 it is found that a person who is part of the child support assessment died; 15.3 the person should never have been made liable (for example, a person is su bsequently found not to be the parent of a child); 15.4 an amendment is required for the purpose of avoiding a dual liability (for the sa me child) with an overseas jurisdiction; 15.5 Inland Revenue has not met the notification requirements; 15.6 a Court Order is granted that applies to a time barred period, 15.7 it relates to an application for the exemption from paying child support for v ictims of sex offences, or 15.8 a new child support assessment is raised which should result in the re assessment of an existing assessment that is time-barred; I consider that, on balance, the proposal is fairer as it provides parents with more certainty while still addressing the equity concerns through the specified exceptions to the time bar. Officials consulted with the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee (LDAC) in re spect of the proposed time bar and other drafting issues. LDAC suggested consideration of a general exception to the time bar to cover any other situations where the time bar would be unfair to any of the parties. However, I consider that a general exemption would undermine the certainty of the time bar. I note that currently 98% of reassessments are done within the proposed four year period. In relation to making compulsory child support wage deductions for all newly liable p arents with employment income, some submitters to the 2017 discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy expressed concerns about 5 SENSITIVE 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-03-05 12:00:53 the additional costs for employers and there were concerns whether compulsory deductions should apply to fully compliant parents. 19.I note that making deductions compulsory for new employees will help parents co mply with their obligations right from the start. Additional costs for employers would be relatively minimal, as employers are required to deduct child support payments upon request by Inland Revenue. Impact Analysis 20.A regulatory impact assessment was prepared, where required, for the policy items i n the Bill and submitted at the time that Cabinet Committee approval for the relevant policy items in the Bill was sought. 21.The regulatory impact analysis requirements do not apply to the remaining items in t he Bill, as the proposed changes result in little or no change to the status quo legislative position. A number of the items (particularly those of a remedial nature) involve technical “revisions” or consolidations that substantially re-enact the current law to improve legislative clarity and understanding (including the fixing of errors, the clarification of the existing legislative intent, and the reconciliation of inconsistencies). Other items repeal or remove redundant legislative provisions, or have no or only minor impacts on businesses, individuals or not-for-profit entities. Compliance 22.The Bill complies with: 22.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 22.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 o r the Human Rights Act 1993; 22.3 the disclosure statement requirements; 22.4 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 22.5 relevant international standards and obligations; and 22.6 the L egislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. 6 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-03-05 12:00:53 SENSITIVE Consultation 23.The substantive policy initiatives to which this Bill is intended to give effect were su bject to public and other consultation in accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process. Relevant government departments or other public bodies 24.Officials have consulted with the Treasury, Ministry of Social Development and O ranga Tamariki — Ministry for Children (as Inland Revenue collects child support for beneficiaries and wards of the State) on all proposals; and the Ministry of Justice (in respect of the proposals to repeal the provision allowing for urgent maintenance, the time limits for the provision of orders of parentage and the proposed penalty changes). The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (Child Poverty Unit) was consulted on the penalty proposals. These agencies generally agreed with the proposals. 25.Officials have consulted with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner on the policy p roposal to make compulsory child support wage deductions for newly liable parents. The Privacy Commissioner supports the compulsory deductions proposal as a measure that is consistent with applying good privacy values. 26.Officials consulted with the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee (LDAC) in respect of the proposed time bar and proposed discretion to modify expenditure calculations when perverse outcomes are reached. LDAC’s comments in relation to proposed discretion to modify expenditure calculations when perverse outcomes are reached have been taken into account in drafting the bill. LDAC’s comments in relation to the time bar are discussed above. 27.At Cabinet’s direction, Inland Revenue officials consulted with the Disabled Peoples’ O rganisations Coalition to determine who would be captured in the proposed extension of the hospital exemption (SWC-19-MIN-0110). The current exemption is available only if the person is hospitalised for 13 or more weeks and receives only a very minimal amount of investment or benefit income (which would not include a main benefit). The proposal in the bill would allow a similar exemption for long term injury or illness. 28.Following officials’ consultation, I propose that the bill makes the eligibility criteria for t he proposed exemption clearer and more consistent with the original policy intent, in particular by: 28.1 ensuring that the exemption would not be available if the person receives any i ncome from a benefit; and 28.2 ensuring that the exemption would be available only if the person is unable to work because of the injury or illness. 29.Oranga Tamariki have commented that there should be guidance on how the p roposed exemption for long term injury and illness would work. Inland Revenue officials advise that appropriate evidence would be required, such as a medical certificate. 7 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-03-05 12:00:53 SENSITIVE 30.I note that under existing rules, the receiving carer can apply to the Commissioner to make a determination that an exemption should not apply if the exemption would be inequitable because of the earning capacity, property or financial resources of the liable person. This rule would also apply to the exemption for long term injury or illness. Relevant private sector organisations and public consultation processes 31.Most of the proposals in this paper were included in the discussion document Ma king Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy 2017, which canvassed proposals relating to Working for Families and student loans as well as child support. The consultation generated 37 email submissions, 183 comments on online forums, 374 responses to the surveys and one response to the foreign language surveys. Inland Revenue officials held 17 face-to-face meetings with stakeholders. 32.The discussion document contained proposed approaches to social policy debt ma nagement that supported an early intervention approach aimed at debt prevention. However, it did not canvass the specific penalty proposals put forward here. 33.Submitters generally supported the proposals in the discussion document. Su bmitters were mixed about making compulsory child support wage deductions for all liable parents with employment income. As noted above, some submitters expressed concerns about the compliance cost for employers and there were concerns whether compulsory deductions should apply to fully compliant parents. 34.Submitters supported expanding the “income” definition used for child support p urposes to better align with that used for Working for Families tax credits and student loans. 35.Submitters strongly supported the proposal to provide Inland Revenue with additional a uthority to work with customers who have unusual circumstances in order to achieve the intended outcome for the specific social policies. Binding on the Crown 36.The Child Support Act 1991 is binding on the Crown. The amendments will follow the p osition of the principal Act. Creating New Agencies or Amending Law Relating to Existing Agencies 37.The legislation will not create a new agency. 38.The legislation will not amend the existing coverage of the Ombudsman Act 1975, t he Official Information Act 1982, or the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987. Allocation of Decision Making Powers 39.The draft legislation does not involve the allocation of decision-making powers between the executive, the courts, and tribunals. 8 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-03-05 12:00:53 SENSITIVE Other Instruments 40.The Bill does not include any provision empowering the making of other instruments th at are deemed to be legislative or disallowable instruments. Definition of Minister/Department 41.The Bill does not contain a definition of Minister, department, or chief executive. Commencement of Legislation 42.Each provision of the Bill comes into force on 1 April 2021. There will be appropriate tra nsition provisions. Parliamentary Stages 43.The Bill should be introduced in March 2020, referred to the Social Services and Co mmunity Select Committee and reported back to the House by July 2020. This would be a shortened select committee process. 44.The reason for a shortened select committee process is because these legislative ame ndments need to be enacted by the end of 2020 in order to apply from the child support year starting April 2021. 45.This is because the child support “annual assessment run” (which calculates the in come and other variables that will be used for determining child support amounts payable/receivable for the year beginning 1 April) is done each February. The bill, therefore, needs to be enacted before that process begins in February 2021. 46. 47. 48. 9 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-03-05 12:00:53 SENSITIVE s 9(2)(f)(iv) Publicity 49.I will make an announcement about the proposals in the Bill when it is introduced. A co mmentary on the Bill will also be released at this time. Inland Revenue will include details of the new legislation in a Tax Information Bulletin after the Bill is enacted. Proactive Release 50.I propose that proactive release of this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key a dvice papers occur alongside the introduction of the Bill. The expected introduction date for this Bill is 10 March 2020. Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1.notet hat I have requested that the Child Support Amendment Bill hold a category 2 priority on the 2020 Legislative Programme (must be passed in the year); 2.note t hat the Bill makes substantive, remedial, and technical amendments to the Child Support Act 1991; 3.note t hat the I have approved the following minor or technical changes under delegated Cabinet authority: 3.1 the addition of an exception to the proposed time bar so that when a new child support assessment should result in the reassessment of an existing time barred assessment, the time-barred assessment can be reassessed; 3.2 the addition of an exception to the proposed time bar so that application of the e xemption from paying child support for victims of sex offences is not limited by the time bar; 3.3 the addition to the proposed time bar of a four month limit to apply for an administrative review in relation to a time barred assessment; 3.4 clarifying the eligibility for the proposed exemption from paying child support f or persons suffering from a long-term period of illness or injury, so that: 3.4.1 the exemption would not be available if the person receives any income from a benefit (the existing exemption for hospital patients allows liable parents to receive the exemption if the only income that they receive is a very small amount of investment income and a specific benefit that is only payable to long term hospital patients – this benefit is not available to people who are not hospital patients) ); and 3.4.2 the exemption would be available only if the person is unable to work b ecause of the injury or illness. 4.approve the Child Support Amendment Bill for introduction, subject to the final approval of the Government caucus and sufficient support in the House of Representatives; 10 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-03-05 12:00:53 SENSITIVE 5.agreethat the Child Support Amendment Bill be introduced in March 2020; 6.agreet hat the Government propose that the Bill be: 6.1 referred to the Social Services and Community Select Committee for consideration; 6.2 reported back to the House by July 2020; 6.3 enacted by December 2020.

In Confidence IR2018/742: Update on international child support Page 1 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE 26 November 2018 Minister of Revenue Update on international child support Executive summary 1. This report seeks your agreement that officials should commence work on ratifying the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other forms of Family Maintenance (the Convention) because it: • enables collection of both administrative and court-ordered maintenance between member countries; • includes rules on judicial and administrative co-operation that should improve New Zealand’s ability to assess and collect child support when liable parents are residing in member countries; and • enables Inland Revenue to assess child support for New Zealand children whose parents are not New Zealand citizens or residents. 2. Officials have agreed with their Australian counterparts that New Zealand’s reciprocal agreement for child support with Australia should be retained outside of the Convention, because it contains various features that better enable the efficient transfer and resolution of cases. We have also agreed that it should be updated to reflect the significant child support reforms that have occurred in both countries since it came into effect. In Confidence IR2018/742: Update on international child support Page 2 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE Recommended action 3. We recommend that you: 3.1 note that officials consider it would be beneficial to ratify the Convention; Noted 3.2 agree that officials should commence work on ratifying the Convention; and Agreed/Not agreed 3.3 note that officials are updating New Zealand’s reciprocal agreement with Australia. Noted Melody Guy Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue / /2018 In Confidence IR2018/742: Update on international child support Page 3 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE Background 4. Report IR2018/090 summarised the child support scheme including detail of work underway to improve international child support collection. We indicated we would update you on our work on whether New Zealand should ratify the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other forms of Family Maintenance (the Convention). 5. There are approximately 17,000 liable parents who live overseas, 1 with the majority of them residing in Australia (about 13,000). Officials are currently reliant on voluntary compliance in collecting child support from parents living overseas (outside Australia). 6. New Zealand is currently a party to three international maintenance agreements – a reciprocal agreement with Australia, the Commonwealth Scheme and the United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance 1956 (UNCRAM). 7. The Hague Conference on Private International Law met annually from 2003 to 2007 to develop the Convention. New Zealand participated in the conference but has not ratified the Convention. 8. The Convention came into effect on 1 January 2013, and currently applies to 37 countries worldwide. Most recently, in 2017, it came into effect for the United States of America, Turkey, Montenegro and Brazil. In 2018, it came into effect for Belarus and Honduras. In 2019, it will come into effect for Kazakhstan. 2 9. It is expected that the Convention would replace older agreements like the Commonwealth Scheme and UNCRAM that only cater for court-ordered maintenance, unless these prove to still be of some value in dealing with those jurisdictions that have not ratified the Convention. The Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other forms of Family Maintenance 10. The Convention is a multilateral treaty that broadly provides for the recovery of child support and other forms of maintenance (such as spousal support) when the liable person resides in a different country to where the maintenance payment was raised. It provides for recognition and collection of both administrative and court- ordered maintenance between member countries. 11. It includes rules on judicial and administrative co-operation and should improve New Zealand’s ability to assess and collect child support when liable parents are residing in countries that are (or become) parties to the Convention. Key benefits of the Convention 12. The main benefit of ratifying the Convention is the ability to collect assessments administered under the Child Support Act 1991 from other member countries. This is a key advantage over both UNCRAM and the Commonwealth Scheme, which only allow for the collection of court-ordered maintenance. 3 The process prescribed 1 Parents who are not resident in New Zealand continue to be liable for child support if they are a New Zealand citizen or resident in a country that New Zealand has entered into a child support reciprocal agreement with. 2 The Convention takes effect in a country on the first of the month, following the expiry of three months after a country has ratified the Convention. 3 New Zealand operates an administrative system so can’t use the Commonwealth Scheme or UNCRAM to collect New Zealand formula assessed child support. New Zealand does however collect child support (for about 200 cases) on behalf of other countries under these agreements. In Confidence IR2018/742: Update on international child support Page 4 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE under the treaties to get a court order, often in another country, is difficult and expensive for New Zealand caregivers and so that option is rarely taken. 13. As a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCROC), New Zealand is obligated to recover child support. Article 27 of UNCROC specifically addresses the obligation of states to secure the recovery of child support both domestically and abroad, including by signing up to international agreements. Article 3 states that in all state actions concerning children, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration. By ratifying the Convention, New Zealand will be shown to be supportive of, and meeting, international expectations around the care of children. 14. Approximately 520 liable parents are believed to live in countries that are members of the Convention. Only about 50 of these parents are up to date with their child support payments. If New Zealand were to ratify the Convention, about $9.1 million in child support owed by these parents could be collected for the benefit of New Zealand children. Penalties for these parents total a further $103 million – once the assessment is collected, penalties are generally written off. 15. The Convention would also enable Inland Revenue to carry out a formula assessment of child support for New Zealand children whose parents are not New Zealand citizens or residents, so that more children receive the appropriate support. By doing this under the Convention, Inland Revenue could progress these cases outside of the court system via its more efficient administrative assessment processes. 16. Under the Convention, Inland Revenue may also be able to refer old Ministry of Social Development cases for collection from member countries. These cases date from periods prior to 1992 when the Ministry collected maintenance either ordered by the courts or that was assessed under the liable parent scheme. 17. About 2,500 liable parents are thought to be living overseas but their country of residence is unconfirmed. It is likely a proportion reside in Convention member countries. If residence was confirmed, those cases could become collectible. The Convention would allow us to ask other member countries for assistance in locating these liable parents. The Convention could also be used to help obtain income information, resulting in fairer, more accurate assessments. This may, in turn, encourage liable parents to be more compliant with their child support obligations. Key obligations under the Convention 18. Some of the key functions that must be carried out under the Convention are: • transmitting, receiving, and processing of applications; • helping to locate liable parents and receiving carers; • helping to obtain and provide information in relation to the financial circumstances of liable parents and receiving carers; • collecting and transmitting payments; • provision of free legal assistance to liable parents and receiving carers where necessary; and • assistance with establishing parentage. 19. Most of these functions are already carried out in relation to the current international maintenance agreements New Zealand is party to, particularly under New Zealand’s reciprocal agreement with Australia. However, processes may need to be altered to meet the requirements of the Convention and member countries. Officials are In Confidence IR2018/742: Update on international child support Page 5 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE satisfied any such additional procedural obligations are outweighed by the benefits of ratifying the Convention. Administrative, compliance and fiscal implications 20. The key impacts arise from communicating changes to customers and business processes to support the exchange of information and money transfers with the 37 and growing number of member countries. 21. As mentioned below, officials intend to align the effective date of the Convention with the planned deployment of child support into Inland Revenue’s new START system in April 2021. This will avoid any additional system costs. 22. Some additional one-off costs would arise from the activity required to support implementation across participating countries and ongoing business costs would arise from the additional case management activity: • one-off costs $218,000 – $436,000; and • on-going annual cost $172,000 – $344,000. 23. Inland Revenue has assessed the impact of ratifying the Convention and is confident that the administrative and implementation impacts can be absorbed within existing baselines. 24. There are no compliance or fiscal costs associated with ratification. Technology and systems 25. The international child support changes will be phased in so that system changes are aligned with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation timelines. Business Transformation has already been tasked with ensuring that the system can accommodate international child support cases, given that we have the reciprocal agreement with Australia. 26. The Business Transformation timeline sees child support move to Inland Revenue’s new technology platform (START) on 1 April 2021. Consultation 27. Officials have consulted with the Ministry of Justice, which is the lead agency for UNCRAM and the Commonwealth Scheme. Officials will continue to liaise with the Ministry of Justice, as there would be impacts for it if New Zealand were to ratify the Convention. In particular, the Ministry of Justice could be affected by the requirement to provide free legal assistance under the Convention. 28. Officials have consulted with the Ministry of Social Development and Oranga Tamariki and intend to keep them informed of progress towards ratification, as Inland Revenue collects child support for beneficiaries and for Oranga Tamariki as custodian of wards of the state. 29. Officials will be guided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the ratification process. This will include preparing a National Interest Analysis and obtaining Cabinet approvals. The Convention would be ratified by domestic legislation and consequential changes to existing legislation may also be required. In Confidence IR2018/742: Update on international child support Page 6 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE Reciprocal agreement with Australia 30. About 13,000 of the 17,000 liable parents living overseas reside in Australia. Since 1 July 2000, New Zealand and Australia have operated a reciprocal agreement under which New Zealand collects child support for Australia and vice versa. 31. Australia has indicated that they intend to ratify the Convention. However, Australia and New Zealand have agreed to maintain the reciprocal agreement as a separate agreement outside of the Convention as it is operating well and provides for more efficient and effective collection processes than are allowed for under the Convention. To date, New Zealand has received over $523 million from Australia under the agreement, for the benefit of New Zealand children, and disbursed over $165 million to Australia. 32. The agreement needs updating to reflect the significant child support reforms that have been undertaken by Australia and New Zealand since it first came into effect. Officials are working with Australian counterparts on identifying and agreeing the required changes. 33. We will be guided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade as to the process for amending the agreement. However, early indications are that the full treaty ratification process will not be required. Next steps 34. If you agree, officials will commence work on ratifying the Convention, in consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and will report back with a National Interest Assessment and associated Cabinet paper in the first half of next year. Officials will also continue to work with Australia on updating the reciprocal agreement.

The attached paper seeks the Cabinet Social Wellbeing Committee’s agreement to New Zealand’s signature of, and the steps necessary to ratify and bring into force, the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other Forms of Family Maintenance (“the Convention”). 2. In December 2018, you agreed that officials should start work on ratifying the Convention. Following that approval, officials have prepared the attached Cabinet paper that includes: • the key benefits of ratifying the Convention; • an overview of the process required to ratify the Convention; • the text of the Convention; • the reservations and declarations that officials propose to make under the Convention; and • the required National Interest Analysis. 3. The Cabinet paper seeks approval to: • sign and ratify the Convention; • make the recommended reservations and declarations; and • issue drafting instructions to the Parliamentary Counsel Office in relation to the Order in Council that is needed in advance of ratification, following signature and completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process. 4. The paper also notes that officials will need to obtain an “instrument of full powers” from the Minister of Foreign Affairs so that you may sign the Convention on New Zealand’s behalf. Background 5. Our report of 26 November 2018 (IR2018/742) outlined the key benefits of ratifying the Convention, and the obligations that New Zealand would assume under the Convention. These are also included in the attached Cabinet paper and the paper in cludes more detail about the impact of ratification on New Zealand in the form of a National Interest Analysis. IR2019/316: Signature and ratification of Hague Convention on Child Support Page 2 of 4 IN CONFIDENCE 6. In addition, the Cabinet paper describes the steps that are needed to ratify the Convention, including the necessary Order in Council and the types of reservation and declaration that officials consider New Zealand should make under the Convention. We have summarised these steps in this report. 7. We propose that you proactively release: 7.1 the Cabinet paper (including all Annexes); 7.2 the Cabinet minutes; and 7.3 key advice papers (this cover report and our briefing to you of November 2018); within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Redacted versions of the key advice papers are attached. The ratification process 8. Before the Convention can be ratified, New Zealand needs to have taken the necessary steps to incorporate it into domestic law. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade guides agencies on the ratification process. Essentially, the process is as follows: 8.1 Inland Revenue consults with relevant government agencies. 8.2 Inland Revenue submits a Cabinet paper that includes: • the key benefits of ratifying the Convention; • an overview of the process required to ratify the Convention; • the text of the Convention; • the reservations and declarations that officials propose to make under the Convention; • the required National Interest Analysis describing the costs and benefits of ratifying the Convention in more detail; and • a request for authority to issue drafting instructions to the Parliamentary Counsel Office in relation to the proposed Order in Council that would be needed to implement the Convention. 8.3 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade consults Tokelau on whether the Convention should also apply to Tokelau. 8.4 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade presents the Convention and the National Interest Analysis to Parliament. 8.5 The Convention and the National Interest Analysis are referred to relevant Select Committees (such as the External Relations and Defence Committee, IR2019/316: Signature and ratification of Hague Convention on Child Support Page 3 of 4 IN CONFIDENCE and the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee) for a minimum of 15 sitting days (and officials may be called to speak to the National Interest Analysis). 8.6 The Select Committee(s) report to Parliament with their recommendations in relation to ratification. 8.7 The Government responds to the recommendations within 60 days. 8.8 The Minister of Foreign Affairs or a Minister with an “instrument of full powers” signs the Convention. 8.9 A Bill is introduced seeking any necessary changes to primary legislation and this goes through the normal Select Committee process (we do not anticipate that any change to primary legislation will be needed in this case). 8.10 An Order in Council is prepared, bringing the Convention into effect under the relevant primary legislation (in this case, the Child Support Act 1991) and modifying the application of that Act as needed for the purpose of giving effect to the Convention. 8.11 Ratification documents are prepared in consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 8.12 Ratification documents, including New Zealand’s reservations and declarations under the Convention, are deposited with the Convention depositary in the Hague. 8.13 The Convention takes effect three months later. Proposed timeframes 9. We do not envisage that any changes to primary legislation will be needed. Rather, we can rely on the Order in Council to modify the application of the Child Support Act 1991 for the purposes of the Convention. 10. We are hoping to align the making of the Order in Council with the other upcoming legislative changes that are proposed for child support, so that all changes can be implemented operationally from April 2021 (when child support is transferred into Inland Revenue’s new systems as part of Business Transformation, Release 5). Next steps 11. Subject to Cabinet’s agreement, officials will work further with the Parliamentary Counsel Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade to progress ratification.

Executive summary 3The Convention is a multilateral treaty that provides for the recovery of child support and other forms of maintenance (such as spousal support) when the liable person resides in a different country to where the maintenance payment was raised. It: 3.1enables the recognition and collection of both administrative and court- ordered maintenance between member countries; 3.2includes rules on judicial and administrative co-operation that should improve New Zealand’s ability to assess and collect child support when liable parents are residing in member countries; and 3.3enables Inland Revenue to assess child support for New Zealand children whose liable parent is not a New Zealand citizen or resident and who lives in a member country. 4As at 30 April 2019, there were approximately 16,720 parents with New Zealand- assessed child support liabilities who live overseas, with the majority of them residing in Australia (about 12,500). Inland Revenue is currently reliant on voluntary compliance in collecting child support from parents living overseas outside of Australia (those in Australia are covered by our reciprocal agreement) and voluntary compliance is very low. The Convention can be implemented with minimal administrative cost to Inland Revenue and would currently enable the recovery of up to $7.7 million in outstanding child support payments from liable parents living outside of Australia. 1 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:24 3. IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE 5This paper seeks Cabinet approval for New Zealand to sign the Convention. As the Convention is subject to ratification, it must be presented to the House of Representatives for Parliamentary treaty examination in accordance with Standing Order 397. This paper also seeks Cabinet approval of the text of an extended National Interest Analysis (“NIA”) for submission to Parliament. The extended NIA is attached as Appendix B. 6This paper also seeks agreement that Cabinet authorises the steps necessary to give effect to the provisions of the Convention under New Zealand law and, after those steps have been successfully completed, authorise officials to ratify the Convention by depositing an instrument of ratification, along with New Zealand’s list of confirmed declarations and reservations, with the Convention depositary (the Treaties Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands). Background 7The Hague Conference on Private International Law met annually from 2003 to 2007 to develop the Convention. New Zealand participated in the conference but has not yet ratified the Convention. The text of the Convention was finalised on 23 November 2007 and is not subject to negotiation by ratifying parties. New Zealand has not yet signed and ratified the Convention as it wanted to ensure that the Convention would be widely adopted by other States. 8As a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCROC), New Zealand is obligated to recover child support. Article 27 of UNCROC specifically addresses the obligation of States to secure the recovery of child support both domestically and abroad, including by signing up to international agreements. Article 3 states that in all State actions concerning children, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration. By ratifying the Convention, New Zealand will be shown to be supportive of, and meeting, international expectations around the care of children. 9New Zealand is currently a party to three international maintenance agreements – a reciprocal agreement with Australia, the Commonwealth Scheme, and the United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance 1956 (UNCRAM). The Ministry of Justice is currently New Zealand’s central authority in respect of UNCRAM and the Commonwealth Scheme. It has been agreed that Inland Revenue is the lead agency (and would be the central authority) for the Hague Convention, given that it enables the recognition and enforcement of Inland Revenue-assessed child support obligations as well as court-based assessments, without the need for any further court intervention. 10Officials have agreed with their Australian counterparts that New Zealand’s reciprocal agreement for child support with Australia should be retained outside of the Convention, because it contains various features that better enable the efficient transfer and resolution of cases. We think this is prudent given the large number of cases and Article 51 of the Convention enables the continuation of this type of pre- existing arrangement. We have also agreed that the agreement should be updated to reflect the significant child support reforms that have occurred in both countries since it came into effect in 2000. 2 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:24 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE 11The Convention would replace the Commonwealth Scheme and UNCRAM when dealing with other countries that are party to the Convention, in relation to matters within scope of the Convention. However, where a country is not party to the Convention or the matters are outside of the Convention’s scope, the Commonwealth Scheme and UNCRAM would continue to apply. 1 Benefits of ratifying the Convention 12The main benefit of ratifying the Convention is the ability to refer assessments administered under the Child Support Act 1991 (and other forms of maintenance, such as spousal support) to other member countries for collection. This is a key advantage over both UNCRAM and the Commonwealth Scheme, which only allow for the collection of court-ordered maintenance. 2 13Officials currently have no way of enforcing parents’ obligations to pay child support when they live overseas (outside of Australia) if they do not pay voluntarily. The process to get a court order, often in another country, is difficult and expensive for New Zealand caregivers and so that option is rarely taken. 14Based on the information that Inland Revenue holds, approximately 470 liable parents are believed to live in countries that are members of the Convention. Only about 35 of these parents are up to date with their child support payments. If New Zealand were to ratify the Convention, about $7.7 million in child support owed by these parents could be collected for the benefit of New Zealand children. Penalties for these parents total a further $101 million. Once the assessment is collected, penalties are generally written off. 15The Convention would also enable Inland Revenue to carry out a formula assessment of child support for New Zealand children whose liable parent is not a New Zealand citizen or resident, so that more children receive the appropriate support. By doing this under the Convention, Inland Revenue could progress these cases outside of the court system via its more efficient administrative assessment processes. 16Under the Convention, Inland Revenue would also be able to refer older Ministry of Social Development cases for collection from member countries. These cases date from periods prior to 1992 when the Ministry collected maintenance that was either ordered by the courts or that was assessed under the liable parent scheme. 17There are approximately 3,210 liable parents who are thought to be living overseas but their country of residence is unconfirmed. It is likely a proportion reside in Convention member countries. 3 The Convention would allow us to ask other member countries for assistance in locating these liable parents. The Convention could also be used to help obtain income information, resulting in fairer, more 1 Current parties to the Convention are: Albania, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, European Union, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guyana, Honduras, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Montenegro, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, UK, USA. 2 New Zealand operates an administrative system so can’t use the Commonwealth Scheme or UNCRAM to collect New Zealand formula assessed child support. New Zealand does however collect child support (for about 200 cases) on behalf of other countries under these agreements. In 2018, there were 16 cases of court-ordered maintenance that New Zealand was seeking collect from Commonwealth or UNCRAM countries. 3 There are approximately a further 540 liable parents that are confirmed as living in countries that are not members of the Convention. 3 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:24 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE accurate assessments. This may, in turn, encourage liable parents to be more compliant with their child support obligations. Obligations under the Convention 18Some of the key functions that must be carried out under the Convention are: 18.1transmitting, receiving, and processing of applications; 18.2helping to locate liable parents and receiving carers; 18.3helping to obtain and provide information in relation to the financial circumstances of liable parents and receiving carers; 18.4collecting and transmitting payments; 18.5provision of free legal assistance to liable parents and receiving carers where necessary; 4 and 18.6assistance with establishing parentage. 19Most of these functions are already carried out in relation to the current international maintenance agreements New Zealand is party to, particularly under New Zealand’s reciprocal agreement with Australia. However, processes may need to be altered to meet the requirements of the Convention and member countries. Officials are satisfied that the burdens of any such additional procedural obligations are outweighed by the benefits of ratifying the Convention. Next steps 20Subject to Cabinet’s approval, I propose that the Minister of Revenue sign the Convention on New Zealand’s behalf. An Instrument of Full Powers (“Instrument”) will need to be obtained from the Minister of Foreign Affairs to enable the Minister of Revenue to sign the Convention. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade will prepare this Instrument and arrange for its signature. 21Standing Order 397 provides that the Government will present any international treaty that is the subject of ratification by New Zealand to the House of Representatives for Parliamentary treaty examination by Select Committee. Accordingly, after signature, it is proposed that the Convention be submitted to the House of Representatives for Parliamentary treaty examination. For this purpose, an extended National Interest Analysis (“NIA”) has been drafted and is attached as Appendix B. This paper seeks Cabinet approval of the extended NIA so that it can be submitted to Parliament as part of the Parliamentary treaty examination process. 22An Order in Council will be needed to give effect to the Convention, as detailed below. This would be drafted and finalised following the Parliamentary treaty examination process. 4 However, Article 14(3) states that the requested State shall not be obliged to provide such free legal assistance if and to the extent that the procedures of that State enable the applicant to make the case without the need for such assistance, and the Central Authority provides such services as are necessary free of charge. Officials anticipate that, in most cases, the Central Authority will be able to provide the necessary services free of charge. 4 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:24 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE 23Article 60 of the Convention provides that it will enter into force for New Zealand on the first day of the month following the expiration of three months after New Zealand has deposited its instrument of ratification. New Zealand will be in a position to deposit its instrument of ratification following the completion of all domestic procedures for entry into force. Subject to the successful promulgation of an Order in Council, this paper seeks Cabinet approval for officials to ratify the Convention by depositing New Zealand’s instrument of ratification with the Convention depositary. New Zealand will also need to confirm its final declarations and reservations at this point in time. Consultation 24Officials have consulted with the Ministry of Justice, which is the central authority for the UNCRAM and the Commonwealth Scheme, as well as with the Ministry of Social Development and Oranga Tamariki (as Inland Revenue collects child support for beneficiaries and for Oranga Tamariki as custodian of wards of the state), and Te Puni Kōkiri. 25Officials have been guided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the ratification process. Tokelau is a non-self-governing Territory of New Zealand and is “part of New Zealand” under the Tokelau Act 1948. While substantially self- governing in practice, it does not have its own international legal personality. Any treaty-making with respect to Tokelau is carried out by the New Zealand Government, in consultation with the Government of Tokelau. In accordance with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s recommendations, if it is determined that New Zealand should proceed with ratifying the Convention the Government will consult with Tokelau on whether the Convention should also extend to Tokelau. Financial implications 26There will be costs associated with implementing and administering the Convention. However, these are expected to be relatively small and can be absorbed within existing baselines. There are no compliance or fiscal costs associated with ratification. Human rights 27No inconsistencies with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993 have been identified. Legislative implications 28The Convention must be given effect by Order in Council, pursuant to section 215 of the Child Support Act 1991. The Order in Council may modify the application of that Act for the purpose of giving effect to the Convention. Officials have identified various minor modifications to the application of the Act that they consider are desirable to accommodate Convention cases. 5 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:24 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE 29Accordingly, this paper seeks approval for an Order in Council to be drafted and submitted to Cabinet following the signing of the Convention and the completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process. Child impact assessment 30Officials consider that ratification of the Convention will have a positive effect on the wellbeing of New Zealand children and will help to ensure that they receive the benefit of child support payments that their carer is entitled to, regardless of where their parents live in the world. Regulatory impact analysis 31As this proposal has regulatory implications (it requires an Order in Council), the Regulatory Impact Analysis (“RIA”) requirements apply. However, as this paper relates to an international treaty, an extended National Interest Analysis (“NIA”) has been prepared (see Appendix B) rather than a separate Regulatory Impact Statement, in accordance with the RIA requirements. 32The extended NIA was prepared by Inland Revenue. The extended NIA was circulated with this paper to the Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade for departmental consultation. 33The extended NIA substitutes for a Regulatory Impact Assessment (“RIA”). Inland Revenue’s internal RIA panel has reviewed the extended NIA and associated supporting material and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the extended NIA meet the quality assurance criteria. 34The extended NIA compares the benefits and costs of signing the Convention relative to taking no action and provides sufficient analysis to support the proposals. Publicity 35The text of the Convention and New Zealand’s declarations and reservations will be publicly available on Inland Revenue’s Tax Policy website. The extended NIA will be publicly available on the Parliamentary website following Parliamentary treaty examination. 36It is expected that the Convention depositary will make all signatories’ declarations and reservations publicly available following the signing. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade also publishes such information on the New Zealand Treaties Online website at www.treaties.mfat.govt.nz.

Where a decision is made in a Contracting State where the creditor is habitually resident, proceedings to modify the decision or to make a new decision cannot be brought by the debtor in any other Contracting State as long as the creditor remains habitually resident in the State where the decision was made. 2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply – a) where, except in disputes relating to maintenance obligations in respect of children, there is agreement in writing between the parties to the jurisdiction of that other Contracting State; b) where the creditor submits to the jurisdiction of that other Contracting State either expressly or by defending on the merits of the case without objecting to the jurisdiction at the first available opportunity; c) where the competent authority in the State of origin cannot, or refuses to, exercise jurisdiction to modify the decision or make a new decision; or d) where the decision made in the State of origin cannot be recognised or declared enforceable in the Contracting State where proceedings to modify the decision or make a new decision are contemplated. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:32 IN CONFIDENCE CHAPTER V RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT Article 19 Scope of the Chapter 1. This Chapter shall apply to a decision rendered by a judicial or administrative authority in respect of a maintenance obligation. The term “decision” also includes a settlement or agreement concluded before or approved by such an authority. A decision may include automatic adjustment by indexation and a requirement to pay arrears, retroactive maintenance or interest and a determination of costs or expenses. 2. If a decision does not relate solely to a maintenance obligation, the effect of this Chapter is limited to the parts of the decision which concern maintenance obligations. 3. For the purpose of paragraph 1, “administrative authority” means a public body whose decisions, under the law of the State where it is established – a) may be made the subject of an appeal to or review by a judicial authority; and b) have a similar force and effect to a decision of a judicial authority on the same matter. 4. This Chapter also applies to maintenance arrangements in accordance with Article 30. 5. The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to a request for recognition and enforcement made directly to a competent authority of the State addressed in accordance with Article 37. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:32 IN CONFIDENCE Article 20 Bases for recognition and enforcement 1. A decision made in one Contracting State (“the State of origin”) shall be recognised and enforced in other Contracting States if – a) the respondent was habitually resident in the State of origin at the time proceedings were instituted; b) the respondent has submitted to the jurisdiction either expressly or by defending on the merits of the case without objecting to the jurisdiction at the first available opportunity; c) the creditor was habitually resident in the State of origin at the time proceedings were instituted; d) the child for whom maintenance was ordered was habitually resident in the State of origin at the time proceedings were instituted, provided that the respondent has lived with the child in that State or has resided in that State and provided support for the child there; e) except in disputes relating to maintenance obligations in respect of children, there has been agreement to the jurisdiction in writing by the parties; or f) the decision was made by an authority exercising jurisdiction on a matter of personal status or parental responsibility, unless that jurisdiction was based solely on the nationality of one of the parties. 2. A Contracting State may make a reservation, in accordance with Article 62, in respect of paragraph 1 c), e) or f). 3. A Contracting State making a reservation under paragraph 2 shall recognise and enforce a decision if its law would in similar factual circumstances confer or would have conferred jurisdiction on its authorities to make such a decision. 4. A Contracting State shall, if recognition of a decision is not possible as a result of a reservation under paragraph 2, and if the debtor is habitually resident in that State, take all appropriate measures to establish a decision for the benefit of the creditor. The preceding 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:32 IN CONFIDENCE sentence shall not apply to direct requests for recognition and enforcement under Article 19(5) or to claims for support referred to in Article 2(1) b). 5. A decision in favour of a child under the age of 18 years which cannot be recognised by virtue only of a reservation in respect of paragraph 1 c), e) or f) shall be accepted as establishing the eligibility of that child for maintenance in the State addressed. 6. A decision shall be recognised only if it has effect in the State of origin, and shall be enforced only if it is enforceable in the State of origin. Article 21 Severability and partial recognition and enforcement 1. If the State addressed is unable to recognise or enforce the whole of the decision, it shall recognise or enforce any severable part of the decision which can be so recognised or enforced. 2. Partial recognition or enforcement of a decision can always be applied for. Article 22 Grounds for refusing recognition and enforcement Recognition and enforcement of a decision may be refused if – a) recognition and enforcement of the decision is manifestly incompatible with the public policy ("ordre public") of the State addressed; b) the decision was obtained by fraud in connection with a matter of procedure; c) proceedings between the same parties and having the same purpose are pending before an authority of the State addressed and those proceedings were the first to be instituted; 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:32 IN CONFIDENCE d) the decision is incompatible with a decision rendered between the same parties and having the same purpose, either in the State addressed or in another State, provided that this latter decision fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition and enforcement in the State addressed; e) in a case where the respondent has neither appeared nor was represented in proceedings in the State of origin – i) when the law of the State of origin provides for notice of proceedings, the respondent did not have proper notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard; or ii) when the law of the State of origin does not provide for notice of the proceedings, the respondent did not have proper notice of the decision and an opportunity to challenge or appeal it on fact and law; or f) the decision was made in violation of Article 18. Article 23 Procedure on an application for recognition and enforcement 1. Subject to the provisions of the Convention, the procedures for recognition and enforcement shall be governed by the law of the State addressed. 2.

A declaration or registration may be refused only on the ground set out in Article 22 a). At this stage neither the applicant nor the respondent is entitled to make any submissions. 5. The applicant and the respondent shall be promptly notified of the declaration or registration, made under paragraphs 2 and 3, or the refusal thereof in accordance with paragraph 4, and may bring a challenge or appeal on fact and on a point of law. 6. A challenge or an appeal is to be lodged within 30 days of notification under paragraph 5. If the contesting party is not resident in the Contracting State in which the declaration or registration was made or refused, the challenge or appeal shall be lodged within 60 days of notification. 7. A challenge or appeal may be founded only on the following – a) the grounds for refusing recognition and enforcement set out in Article 22; b) the bases for recognition and enforcement under Article 20; c) the authenticity or integrity of any document transmitted in accordance with Article 25(1) a), b) or d) or (3) b). 8. A challenge or an appeal by a respondent may also be founded on the fulfilment of the debt to the extent that the recognition and enforcement relates to payments that fell due in the past. 9. The applicant and the respondent shall be promptly notified of the decision following the challenge or the appeal. 10. A further appeal, if permitted by the law of the State addressed, shall not have the effect of staying the enforcement of the decision unless there are exceptional circumstances. 11. In taking any decision on recognition and enforcement, including any appeal, the competent authority shall act expeditiously. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:32 IN CONFIDENCE Article 24 Alternative procedure on an application for recognition and enforcement 1. Notwithstanding Article 23(2) to (11), a State may declare, in accordance with Article 63, that it will apply the procedure for recognition and enforcement set out in this Article. 2. Where an application for recognition and enforcement of a decision has been made through Central Authorities in accordance with Chapter III, the requested Central Authority shall promptly either – a) refer the application to the competent authority which shall decide on the application for recognition and enforcement; or b) if it is the competent authority, take such a decision itself. 3. A decision on recognition and enforcement shall be given by the competent authority after the respondent has been duly and promptly notified of the proceedings and both parties have been given an adequate opportunity to be heard. 4. The competent authority may review the grounds for refusing recognition and enforcement set out in Article 22 a), c) and d) of its own motion. It may review any grounds listed in Articles 20, 22 and 23(7) c) if raised by the respondent or if concerns relating to those grounds arise from the face of the documents submitted in accordance with Article 25. 5. A refusal of recognition and enforcement may also be founded on the fulfilment of the debt to the extent that the recognition and enforcement relates to payments that fell due in the past. 6.

It subsequently came into effect for the first signatories on 1 January 2013. 2 New Zealand has not yet signed and ratified the Convention and the purpose of this National Interest Analysis is to consider whether it should do so. This has not been done earlier as New Zealand wanted to ensure that the Convention would be widely adopted by other States. 3 The Convention is a multilateral international treaty that enables member countries to recover child support and other forms of maintenance (such as spousal support) from liable persons residing in another Contracting State. It provides for the establishment, recognition and enforcement of both administrative and court-ordered maintenance. 4 The Convention may be given effect to under New Zealand domestic law by Order in Council made under section 215 of the Child Support Act 1991. 5 Key obligations under the Convention include: • transmitting, receiving and processing applications; helping to locate liable parents and receiving carers; • helping to obtain and provide information in relation to the financial circumstances of liable parents and receiving carers; • collecting and transmitting payments; • providing free legal assistance to liable parents and receiving carers where necessary; and • establishing maintenance decisions and assisting with establishing parentage. 6 Ratifying the Convention is in New Zealand’s interests as it will enable the collection of New Zealand’s administratively-assessed maintenance. This is a key advantage over both the United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance 1956 (UNCRAM) and the Commonwealth Scheme, which only allow for the collection of court-ordered maintenance. These other agreements will continue to apply to countries that have not ratified the Convention or matters that are not within scope of the Convention. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:40 3 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE 7 By ratifying the Convention, New Zealand will also be shown to be supportive of, and meeting, international expectations around the care of children. As a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCROC), New Zealand is obligated to recover child support, including by signing up to international agreements. 8 There will be costs associated with implementing and administering the Convention. However, these are expected to be relatively small and can be absorbed within Inland Revenue’s existing baselines. There are no compliance or fiscal costs associated with ratification. Nature and timing of the proposed treaty action Nature of the Convention 9 The Convention is a multilateral international treaty. The text of the Convention has been finalised and is not subject to negotiation by ratifying parties (although certain reservations and declarations may be made). A copy of the English version of the Convention is annexed to the relevant Cabinet paper seeking approval to sign and ratify. 10 The proposed treaty action is to ratify the Convention following signature. Ratification occurs by depositing New Zealand’s instrument of ratification with the Convention depositary, after the necessary domestic procedures have been completed. Signature, entry into force and when obligations take effect 11 The Convention is open for signature by the States which were members of the Hague Conference on Private International Law at the time of its twenty-first session in November 2007 and by the other States which participated in that session (including New Zealand). 12 To become a party to the Convention, States must ratify, accept or approve it, and the instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval must be deposited with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which is the depository of the Convention. Ratification is the method relevant to New Zealand. 13 Before ratification can occur, New Zealand must have taken the necessary steps to be able to implement it under domestic law. We will need to obtain an Order in Council to recognise and implement the Convention under New Zealand law. 14 Officials estimate that this would need to be done by the end of 2020. The Convention would apply to New Zealand three months after ratification, in around April 2021, aligning with the transfer of child support into Inland Revenue’s new systems as part of Business Transformation. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:40 4 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE Application to Tokelau 15 Tokelau is a non-self-governing Territory of New Zealand and is “part of New Zealand” under the Tokelau Act 1948. While substantially self-governing in practice, it does not have its own international legal personality. Any treaty-making with respect to Tokelau is carried out by the New Zealand Government, in consultation with the Government of Tokelau. In accordance with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s recommendations, if it is determined that New Zealand should proceed with ratifying the Convention the Government will consult with Tokelau on whether the Convention should also extend to Tokelau. Reasons for New Zealand becoming party to the treaty Background to the Convention 16 The Hague Conference on Private International Law met annually from 2003 to 2007 to develop the Convention. New Zealand participated in the conference but has not yet signed or ratified the Convention. 17 The object of the Convention is to ensure the effective international recovery of child support and other forms of family maintenance, in particular by: • establishing a comprehensive system of co-operation between the authorities of the contracting States; • making available applications for the establishment of maintenance decisions; • providing for the recognition and enforcement of maintenance decisions; and • requiring effective measures for the prompt enforcement of maintenance decisions. The Hague website summarises this as seeking to “establish a modern, efficient and accessible international system for the cross-border recovery of child support and other forms of family maintenance.” Meeting international expectations 18 Ratifying the Convention would assist New Zealand in meeting its obligations as a signatory to UNCROC. Article 27 of UNCROC requires state signatories to secure the recovery of child support both domestically and abroad, including by signing up to international agreements. Article 3 states that in all State actions concerning children, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration. Ratification would demonstrate that New Zealand is supportive of, and meeting, international expectations around the care of children. 19 Ratifying the Convention would also align New Zealand with many of its major trading partners. The Convention currently applies to 39 countries worldwide. In 2017, it came into effect for the United States of America, Turkey, Montenegro and Brazil. In 2018, it came into effect for Belarus and Honduras. In 2019, it will come into effect for 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:40 5 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE Kazakhstan and the United Kingdom. In 2020, it will come into effect for Guyana and Nicaragua. Australian officials have indicated that Australia intends to ratify the Convention in the near future (although we agree that, even when this occurs, the reciprocal agreement for child support between Australia and New Zealand will remain in place). Recovering significant amounts of additional maintenance 20 There are approximately 16,720 parents with New Zealand-assessed child support liabilities who live overseas, with the majority of them (about 12,500) residing in Australia. Officials are currently reliant on voluntary compliance in collecting administratively assessed child support from parents living overseas outside of Australia (those in Australia are covered by our reciprocal agreement). The Convention can be implemented with minimal administrative cost to Inland Revenue and would currently enable us to seek enforcement of up to $7.7 million in outstanding child support payments from liable parents living outside of Australia. 21 Domestic law allows Inland Revenue to assess parents to pay child support when they live overseas, but officials have no way of enforcing their obligation if they do not pay voluntarily. Under the Convention, New Zealand will be able to transmit administratively assessed (as opposed to court-ordered) maintenance cases to member countries for enforcement. This is a key advantage for New Zealand caregivers and their children, as it is difficult and expensive for them to obtain a court order in a foreign jurisdiction. Now that a large number of countries have ratified the Convention, the value in being a member has increased. 22 An alternative to ratifying the Convention would be to try to secure multiple bilateral agreements in addition to the agreement that we have with Australia. However, this would be time consuming and would likely result in many slightly differing processes which could cause confusion and additional cost. In addition, most countries would be unlikely to agree to a reciprocal agreement with New Zealand as this would not be warranted given the low number of cases. 23 Another alternative would be to do nothing, in which case New Zealand children would be missing out on child support and we would be missing an opportunity to better meet the objectives of the child support scheme. By ratifying the Convention, the Government aims to ensure that those who owe child support to New Zealand children comply with their obligations even if they are living abroad. Ratification is a simple step that will contribute to the wellbeing of New Zealand children and their caregivers. Modernising international procedures 24 New Zealand is currently a party to three international child support maintenance arrangements – a reciprocal agreement with Australia, the Commonwealth Scheme (which is not formally documented but applies to Commonwealth countries) and the United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance 1956 (UNCRAM). 25 Officials have agreed with their Australian counterparts that New Zealand’s reciprocal agreement for child support with Australia should be retained and updated outside of the Convention, even though Australian officials have indicated that Australia intends 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:40 6 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE to become a party to the Convention in future. The reciprocal agreement contains various features that better enable the efficient transfer and resolution of cases. Article 51 of the Convention enables the continuation of this type of pre-existing arrangement. 26 By virtue of Article 49, the Convention would replace UNCRAM when dealing with countries that are party to the Convention in relation to matters within scope of the Convention. However, UNCRAM would continue to apply when dealing with countries that are not party to the Convention or matters that are outside the scope of the Convention. Officials consider that the Commonwealth Scheme would continue to operate in a similar way. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force and not entering into force for New Zealand Advantages of entering into force 27 Key advantages of ratifying the Convention are: • obtaining support for those carers and children who otherwise wouldn’t have been able to receive it; • obtaining information from member countries such as income details to enable Inland Revenue to assess child support more accurately; • obtaining assistance from member countries in locating a liable parent or receiving carer and in establishing parentage, where necessary; • recovering the costs associated with the Government paying benefits for children whose carer is in receipt of a sole parent benefit; • complying with our international obligations, maintaining our international reputation and joining an international community of countries who are collectively striving to protect children’s interests; • assisting to create linkages and efficiencies in the systems that are used to collect child support internationally; and • ensuring that our child support assessments take into account any overseas- based children, thereby increasing the appropriateness of the assessment for the liable parent. 28 It is also advantageous that there are no compliance or fiscal costs associated with ratification. Disadvantages of entering into force 29 Key disadvantages of ratifying the Convention are: 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:40 7 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE • Inland Revenue would incur some administrative costs in complying with the Convention (although these are expected to be minimal and able to be absorbed within existing baselines). Some one-off costs would arise from the activity required to support implementation across participating countries (approximately $218,000 - $436,000) and ongoing business costs would arise from the additional case management activity (approximately $172,000 - $344,000); • Inland Revenue may experience some difficulties in collecting its assessments in countries with ‘weaker’ currencies. There may also be challenges with over and under payments because of exchange rate fluctuations; • some liable parents may feel that it is unfair for them to be subject to New Zealand child support assessments when they are residing in another jurisdiction; • there may continue to be jurisdictional issues that arise such as potential dual liabilities that need to be resolved, other conflicts or jurisdiction gaps; and • if a case is referred from another jurisdiction, we will need to take any overseas- based children into account as part of our assessment and, therefore, the payment for New Zealand-based children would be reduced. Advantages of not entering into force 30 There are few advantages in not ratifying the Convention, other than avoidance of the work and cost required to implement it. It is possible that New Zealand could negotiate more advantageous terms with other jurisdictions on a bilateral basis. However, as more and more countries become parties to the Convention, New Zealand may be unlikely to find any willing partners. Disadvantages of not entering into force 31 New Zealand would have to continue to rely on voluntary compliance with its administrative assessments. We would not see change or improvement in our ability to collect child support liabilities from New Zealand-assessed parents living overseas (outside Australia) and parents with overseas liabilities who live in New Zealand. We would have to negotiate bilateral arrangements with individual countries in order to obtain these improvements. This would be time consuming and resource-intensive, and likely to be unsuccessful as other jurisdictions are favouring the Convention. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:40 8 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE Legal obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position in respect of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms Legal obligations 32 Key obligations under the Convention include: • transmitting, receiving and processing various applications; • helping to locate debtors and creditors (what we would call liable parents and receiving carers); • helping to obtain and provide information in relation to the financial circumstances of debtors and creditors; • collecting and transmitting payments; • providing free legal assistance to liable parents and receiving carers where necessary; and • assisting with establishing parentage. 33 Most of these functions are already carried out in relation to the current international maintenance agreements New Zealand is party to, particularly under New Zealand’s reciprocal agreement with Australia. However, processes may need to be altered to meet the requirements of the Convention and member countries. Officials are satisfied any such additional procedural obligations are outweighed by the benefits of ratifying the Convention. Reservations and declarations 34 Any permitted reservations or declarations under the Convention must be made at the time of ratification. The reservations and declarations that may be made, and the proposed approach to these, are set out at Annex A and B. Settlement of disputes 35 The Convention does not include a disputes resolution procedure for resolving disputes between contracting States. Instead, Article 22 sets out when an application can be refused, and Article 5 relies on mutual co-operation in resolving difficulties. Measures which the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including specific reference to implementing legislation 36 Officials consider that an Order in Council will need to be made under section 215 of the Child Support Act 1991 before New Zealand can ratify the Convention. The Order in Council is to give the Convention the force of law in New Zealand and can modify the application of the Child Support Act 1991 to give effect to the Convention. Officials 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:40 9 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE have identified various minor changes to the application of that Act that they consider are needed to accommodate cases that will be covered by the Convention. 37 Officials will discuss these legislative measures further with the Parliamentary Counsel Office and will continue to review current operational arrangements to ensure that they can accommodate Convention cases. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action Economic costs and effects 38 The Convention will not impose any additional economic costs on New Zealand, other than the minor administrative costs referred to above. The economic effect will be that more child support payments will flow into the country for the benefit of New Zealand children, or to recover the costs associated with the Government paying benefits for those children (ie where the receiving carer is in receipt of a sole parent benefit, or potentially is Oranga Tamariki, as custodian of the child). There will also be an increase in child support payments going offshore, where the liable parent resides in New Zealand but their child is overseas. Social costs and effects 39 The Convention will help to avoid the social costs associated with carers not receiving child support that is owed to them. The social effect will be to help ensure that all children receive the support that they are entitled to, even if they have one or both parents residing overseas. Conversely, it will help to ensure that parents residing in New Zealand pay child support for overseas children. This may have a financial impact on their families in New Zealand. Cultural costs and effects 40 Ratifying the Convention is expected to have a positive effect on New Zealand culture, rather than any adverse cost or effect. It aligns with New Zealand and Māori cultural values of supporting each other and, in particular, ensuring the wellbeing of family members. It will also reinforce the importance of paying child support, regardless of where you are located. Environmental costs and effects 41 Given the subject matter, there are no environmental costs or effects expected as a result of ratifying the Convention. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 42 Article 8 clarifies that each central authority shall bear its own costs in applying the Convention. Central authorities may not impose any charge on an applicant for the provision of their services, other than in exceptional circumstances. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:40 10 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE 43 As noted above, there are certain relatively minor administrative costs associated with ratifying the Convention. These cover the training and allocation of staff, adaptation of systems and processes, and provision of a limited level of legal assistance. These costs can be absorbed within existing baselines and officials consider that they are outweighed by the financial gains that can be made for New Zealand carers as a result of ratifying the Convention. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 44 As lead agency (and central authority) for the purposes of the Convention, Inland Revenue has consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Treasury, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Social Development, Te Puni Kokiri and Oranga Tamariki in relation to the proposed ratification of the Convention. 45 The Ministry of Social Development has an interest in ratification as Inland Revenue collects child support for beneficiaries and may be able to use the Convention to collect outstanding debts under the liable parent scheme. Oranga Tamariki has an interest in ratification as Inland Revenue collects child support for it as custodian of wards of the state. 46 As noted above, in accordance with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s recommendations, if it is determined that New Zealand should proceed with ratifying the Convention, the Government will consult with Tokelau on whether the Convention should also extend to Tokelau. Subsequent protocols and/or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 47 There is a protocol to the Convention entitled “Hague Protocol of 23 November 2007 on the Law Applicable to Maintenance Obligations.” This is intended to supplement the Convention by developing general rules on applicable law. Officials consider that it is not necessary for New Zealand to ratify this Protocol as New Zealand already has sufficiently well-developed rules on applicable law. We understand that Australia does not intend to ratify the Protocol for this reason. 48 Contracting States may withdraw reservations or declarations at any time. As mentioned below, the transmittal and acknowledgement forms that are annexed to the Convention may be amended in future by a Special Commission of the Hague Conference on Private International Law. However, there would be an opportunity to make a reservation in respect of any such amendment. 49 There is provision at Article 54 for regular review of the practical operation of the Convention, to encourage the development of good practices, however, no express provision for amendment of the Convention itself. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:40 11 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 50 Article 64 of the Convention enables withdrawal from the Convention by “denunciation” in writing addressed to the Convention depository. Denunciation takes effect 12 months after notification is received, unless the notice specifies a longer period. Agency Disclosure Statement 51 Inland Revenue has prepared this extended National Interest Analysis (NIA). Inland Revenue has analysed the issue of implementing the Convention, and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. 52 As part of that process, Inland Revenue considered the option of not ratifying the Convention and instead retaining the status quo or entering into bilateral negotiations with other jurisdictions. 53 Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. This policy aligns with the Government Statement on Regulation. 54 The reservations and declarations that Inland Revenue proposes to make at the time of ratification are those that are needed for ease of implementation in New Zealand. 55 The revenue effect for New Zealand as a result of changes under the Convention is expected to be neutral. 56 An Order in Council will be required to give the Convention effect in New Zealand law. This will be made under section 215 of the Child Support Act 1991. 57 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Treasury, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Social Development, Te Puni Kokiri and Oranga Tamariki have been consulted about the content of this extended NIA. Mike Nutsford Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 19 June 2019 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:40 12 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE Annex A: Reservations Reservations may be made under Article 62 in respect of the following Articles: • 2(2): Any Contracting State may reserve the right to limit the application of the Convention to persons who have not attained the age of 18 years. Officials consider that New Zealand should not make this reservation as we currently consider child support applications, both domestically and internationally, in respect of children who are over the age of 18 but still at school, for example. • 20(2): A Contracting State may make a reservation in respect of paragraph 1(c), (e) or (f). These paragraphs provide that a decision made in one Contracting State ("the state of origin") shall be recognised and enforced in other Contracting States if: (c) the creditor was habitually resident in the state of origin at the time proceedings were instituted; (e) except in disputes relating to maintenance obligations in respect of children, there has been agreement to the jurisdiction in writing by the parties; or (f) the decision was made by an authority exercising jurisdiction on a matter of personal status or parental responsibility, unless that jurisdiction was based solely on the nationality of one of the parties. Officials consider that there is no need for New Zealand to make a reservation in respect of any of these paragraphs as New Zealand can recognise and enforce decisions made in all of these circumstances. • 30(8): A Contracting State may reserve the right not to recognise and enforce a maintenance arrangement. A maintenance arrangement is defined at Article 3(e) as an agreement in writing relating to the payment of maintenance which (i) has been formally drawn up or registered as an authentic instrument by a competent authority; or (ii) has been authenticated by, or concluded, registered or filed with a competent authority, and (in both cases) may be the subject of review and modification by a competent authority. Officials consider that New Zealand should not make a reservation under this provision and should recognise and enforce maintenance arrangements (which, as defined in the Convention, are similar to “voluntary agreements” in New Zealand). • 44(3): Unless otherwise agreed by the Central Authorities, any other communications between such authorities shall be in an official language of the requested state or in either English or French. However, a Contracting State may, by making a reservation, object to the use of either English or French. Officials consider that New Zealand should make a reservation that objects to the use of French, except by countries who have objected to the use of English, to avoid translation costs. • 55(3): During the period provided for in paragraph 2 any Contracting State may by notification in writing to the depositary make a reservation with respect to the amendment. The State making such reservation shall, until the reservation is withdrawn, 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:40 13 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE be treated as a state not party to the present Convention with respect to that amendment. Paragraph 2 relates to the amendment of forms that are annexed to the Convention. It is not necessary for New Zealand to make any reservation under this Article at this time, as it only applies to future amendments to the forms. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:40 14 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE Annex B: Declarations Declarations may be made under Article 63 in respect of the following Articles: • 2(3): Any Contracting State may declare that it will extend the application of the whole or any part of the Convention to any maintenance obligation arising from a family relationship, parentage, marriage or affinity, including in particular obligations in respect of vulnerable persons. Any such declaration shall give rise to obligations between two Contracting States only in so far as their declarations cover the same maintenance obligations and parts of the Convention. Officials consider that New Zealand should declare that it will extend the application of the whole of the Convention to spousal support obligations, regardless of whether or not they exist alongside maintenance obligations arising from a parent-child relationship, as provided for at Article 2(1). Inland Revenue currently enforces spousal support obligations independently of child support obligations domestically and under its other international agreements. • 11(1)(g): All applications (for recognition and enforcement of a child support decision etc) under Article 10 shall as a minimum include, save in an application under Article 10(1)(a) and (2)(a), any information or document specified by declaration by the requested state. Officials consider that there is no need for New Zealand to make a declaration under this Article as there is no particular information that New Zealand needs to process an application that is not already provided for in Article 11 and the transmittal form at Annex 1. • 16(1): Notwithstanding Article 15(1), a State may declare that it will provide free legal assistance in respect of applications other than under Article 10(1)(a) and (b) and the cases covered by Article 20(4), subject to a test based on an assessment of the means of the child. Officials consider that New Zealand should not make a declaration under this provision as we can provide free legal assistance (at the level that it would be provided domestically) regardless of the means of child. • 24(1): Notwithstanding Article 23(2) to (11), a State may declare that it will apply the procedure for recognition and enforcement set out in this Article. Officials consider that New Zealand should make a declaration under this provision that New Zealand will use the Article 24 procedure rather than the Article 23 procedure on receipt of applications for recognition and enforcement. The Article 24 procedure is preferable because it enables Inland Revenue to process applications more expeditiously and aligns with how it processes other domestic and international applications. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:40 15 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE • 30(7): A State may declare that applications for recognition and enforcement of a maintenance arrangement shall only be made through central authorities. Officials consider that New Zealand should make this declaration to ensure that Inland Revenue, which will be designated as New Zealand’s central authority in accordance with Article 4, is aware of all applications. Inland Revenue will consult with other agencies such as the Ministry of Social Development, Oranga Tamariki, and the Ministry of Justice, as necessary in relation to an application. Inland Revenue will also use court processes where needed. • 44(1): Any application and related documents shall be in the original language, and shall be accompanied by a translation into an official language of the requested State or another language which the requested state has indicated, by way of declaration, it will accept, unless the competent authority of that state dispenses with translation. Officials consider that there is no need for New Zealand to make a declaration under this provision, as translations into an official language of New Zealand (including English and te reo Māori) will be acceptable. • 44(2): A Contracting State which has more than one official language and cannot, for reasons of internal law, accept for the whole of its territory documents in one of those languages shall, by declaration, specify the language in which such documents or translations thereof shall be drawn up for submission in the specified parts of its territory. Officials consider that there is no need for New Zealand to make this declaration as English can be used throughout New Zealand’s territories. • 59(3): At the time of signature, acceptance, approval or accession, a regional economic integration organisation may declare that it exercises competence over all the matters governed by this Convention and that the member States which have transferred competence to the regional economic integration organisation in respect of the matter in question shall be bound by this Convention by virtue of the signature, acceptance, approval or accession of the organisation. Officials do not consider that there is any such regional organisation in respect of which a declaration would need to be made under this provision. • 61(1): If a state has two or more territorial units in which different systems of law are applicable in relation to matters dealt with in the Convention, it may at the time of signature, ratification, acceptance, approval or accession declare that this Convention shall extend to all its territorial units or only to one or more of them and may modify this declaration by submitting another declaration at any time. Subject to further consultation with Tokelau, officials consider that New Zealand should not make a declaration under this provision that the Convention shall extend to Tokelau, as similar Conventions that New Zealand has ratified do not apply to that territory. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 15:45:40 I N C O N F I D E N C E SWC-19-MIN-0111 Cabinet Social Wellbeing Committee Minute of Decision This document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.
