Enter any other income related to the rental property, such as insurance receipts or rates refunds in Box 2. If you sell or dispose of any of your assets you may be required to account for the loss or gain in Box 3. Add up Boxes 1, 2 and 3 to calculate your total income. If Box 3 is a loss, subtract it from the sum of Boxes 1 and 2. Enter the total income in Box 4. Note 3 Expenses Claim ongoing expenses such as rates, insurance, interest and depreciation in proportion to the number of months the property was available for renting out, for example if the property was available for 10 months, you can claim 10 / 12 of these expenses. Expense for a holiday home or bach used both privately and to earn income may be subject to the mixed-use asset rules. See the Rental income - IR264 booklet for more information. Note 4 Interest From 1 October 2021, interest is not deductible for residential property acquired on or after 27 March 2021 unless an exclusion or exemption applies. For properties acquired before 27 March 2021, the ability to deduct interest is being phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025. Enter the total interest incurred for residential property in Box 7A. Do not include this amount in total expenses at Box 14. Enter interest expenses claimed in Box 7B. Include this amount in total expenses at Box 14. If you have claimed an interest expense in Box 7B, at Box 7C tick the reason(s) for the interest expense claimed. See the Rental income – IR264 booklet for more information. Note 5 Repairs, maintenance and other expenses Please fully explain any claims for repairs, maintenance and other expenses. You may claim repairs and maintenance but not additions or improvements to property or plant. Improvements to property or plant can be depreciated. If there is not enough space, please attach a separate note. Note 6 Depreciation on buildings From the 2011-2012 income year, depreciation on buildings has reduced to 0% where buildings have an economic life of more than 50 years. For more information refer to Depreciation – a guide for businesses - IR260 Note 7 Depreciation on assets You may depreciate each item individually or pool some or all of the assets to calculate depreciation. Assets which can be pooled are those which: - are not used privately, and - cost $5,000 or less, or - have been depreciated so their adjusted tax value is $5,000 or less. Pool depreciation is calculated on the average pool value at a single rate using the DV method. The rate you must use for the pool is the lowest rate for an asset in the pool. Once you have included an asset in a pool you can segregate it only if you use the asset for private use. If you switch from the DV to the SL method for assets not pooled, calculate depreciation on the opening adjusted tax value instead of the original cost. To find the correct rate of depreciation for an asset, please see our depreciation rate finder at ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators Note 8 Residential rental properties From the start of the 2019-2020 income year, deductions for residential rental properties are subject to residential property deduction rules. The new rules limit the amount of deductions you can claim if your residential rental property makes a loss in an income year. You can use the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to help you complete your return. Note 9 Record keeping Keep your receipts and invoices with your records in case we request them. You must keep all your records for seven years. Note 10 More information Our booklets Rental income - IR264, Depreciation - IR260 and Depreciation rates - IR265 may help you.

A CTR account is a memorandum account used to track conduit relief until it is distributed. Because relief is given on behalf of non-resident shareholders, it is necessary to ensure this relief is passed on to those shareholders. Conduit tax relief reduces the tax payable by a New Zealand resident company in proportion to its non-resident shareholders. It only applies to income derived as: – attributed foreign income from controlled foreign companies (CFCs) – foreign investment fund (FIF) income calculated under the accounting profits and branch equivalent methods, and – dividend withholding payment liabilities on foreign-sourced dividends.

Fringe benefit tax guide A guide to working with FBT IR409 October 2024 1 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Introduction This guide tells employers how fringe benefit tax (FBT) works and how to manage the FBT obligations. Introducing ‘Audis on Anglesey’ Throughout this guide we’ll be following 1 company, giving examples of options for working out FBT. Audis on Anglesey Ltd has been operating for 15 years and has 2 shareholders, Allan and Karyn. The principal activity of the company is selling and servicing new and used Audi cars. There are 15 employees. Here’s a list of some of the employees’ responsibilities within the company: • Michael and Zac are the 2 new motor vehicle salespersons. • Bailey is the used motor vehicle salesperson at a subsidiary yard owned by the company. • Nicole is the administrative manager responsible for all tasks in the office. • George is the service manager and is responsible for Mark, James and Flynn (mechanics), and Sarah (car groomer). Changes to note There are changes to the alternate rate calculations for FBT returns: • Quarter 4 FBT returns (IR420) • Income year FBT returns (IR421) • Annual year FBT returns (IR422). The calculation changes also apply to final quarterly returns if you stop employing staff or stop providing fringe benefits in any of quarters 2, 3 or 4. For more information on the calculation changes, go to Completing quarter 4, income or annual year full alternate rate calculations on page 34. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. 2 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Contents Introduction 1 Part 1 - Fringe benefits overview 3 Registering for FBT 3 Fringe benefits 3 Cash benefits 3 FBT terms you'll need to know 3 Part 2 - Returning FBT 6 FBT return forms 6 Change in status 7 Part 3 - Motor vehicles 8 Exemptions from FBT on work-related vehicles 8 Emergency calls 9 Business travel 9 Other days not liable 10 Election of the commencement of a 24-hour period 10 3-month test period 10 Motor vehicle valuation methods 11 Motor vehicle cost price or tax book value? 11 Determining the value of pooled motor vehicles 11 Calculating the taxable value of private use of a motor vehicle 12 Employee contributions 13 FBT taxable value calculation sheet - quarterly - IR427 14 Record keeping 15 Goods 16 Services 16 Part 4 - Free, subsidised or discounted goods and services 16 Exemptions for goods and services 17 Public transport 17 Goods and services - attributed and non-attributed benefits 18 Subsidised transport 18 Specific common issues 18 FBT taxable value calculation sheet - quarterly - IR427 19 Record keeping 20 Part 5 - Low-interest loans 21 Prescribed rate of interest 21 Market rate 21 FBT on interest 21 FBT not payable for certain loans 21 Company provides low-interest loans 22 Taxable value of the fringe benefit 23 Income and annual year returns 23 Record keeping 24 FBT taxable value calculation sheet - quarterly - IR427 24 Life insurance contributions 25 Discounted life insurance for agents 25 Taxable value of fringe benefit 25 Attributed and non-attributed benefits 25 Part 6 - Employer contributions to funds, insurance and superannuation schemes 25 Record keeping 26 FBT taxable value calculation sheet - quarterly - IR427 26 Completing FBT quarterly return - IR420 for quarters 1 to 3 27 Part 7 - Completing FBT returns 27 Completing FBT return for quarter 4 30 Shareholder-employee remuneration or attributed income not known in quarter 4 30 Attributed and non-attributed benefits 31 Completing quarter 4, income or annual year full alternate rate calculations 34 Completing calculations – shareholder-employees or persons receiving attributed income 37 Remuneration adjustment worksheet for XYZ Ltd 38 Completing a quarter 4 short form alternate rate calculation 40 Completing a quarter 4 pooled alternate rate calculation 40 FBT to pay 42 How to make payments 42 Late payment 42 Nil return 42 Correcting errors in your fringe benefit tax return 42 Record keeping 42 Part 8 - GST and income tax 43 GST 43 Income tax 43 Part 9 - Services you may need 44 Need to speak with us? 44 Supporting businesses in our community 44 Privacy 44 If you have a complaint about our service 44 3 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Benefits provided instead of a cash allowance Employers can pay cash allowances to employees for work-related costs. FBT is not payable on any non-cash benefits provided by an employer in place of that allowance. Example Audis on Anglesey Ltd provides James and Flynn with tools for use at work rather than an equivalent cash allowance for the tools. If James and Flynn had purchased the tools, any cash reimbursement from Audis on Anglesey Ltd would not be taxable. So, the value of the tools is not subject to income tax or FBT. If you're unsure whether an equivalent cash allowance is tax free, call us on 0800 377 772. FBT terms you'll need to know A fringe benefit is a non-cash benefit provided to an employee or an associate of an employee. Most benefits given to employees other than their salary or wages are fringe benefits. Associated person For FBT purposes an associated person is someone associated with the employer or the employee: • within 2 degrees of blood relationship or 1 person is within 2 degrees of blood relationship to the other person's spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner\* • by marriage, civil union, or de facto relationship • in a business partnership • by a shareholding interest. The association rules are complex. It's important you seek professional advice if you think there's any possibility of an association applying to you. \* For example, 1 degree is your parent or child, and 2 degrees is your grandparent, grandchild, or sibling. Note Fringe benefits provided to an associate of an employee are to be taxed as though they were given to the employee, rather than the associate. Attributed fringe benefits See page 31 for information on attributed benefits. Registering for FBT You need to register for fringe benefit tax (FBT) when you start providing a fringe benefit. You can do this when you first register as an employer in myIR, or later when you start providing a fringe benefit to an employee. If you’re already providing fringe benefits but have not registered yet, you’ll need to back date your registration to when you first started to provide a fringe benefit. You may need to file returns for earlier periods and pay any outstanding FBT. You can register in myIR. You can file your FBT returns online in myIR or send us paper returns. If you file in myIR: • your personal details are already complete and other information is tailored to your situation, so you only complete sections relevant to you • myIR will do most of the calculations for you, making it easier and more accurate • you get a confirmation receipt as soon as you submit your return • you can amend the return in myIR if you’ve made a mistake. Fringe benefits Most benefits given to employees other than their salary or wages are fringe benefits. There are 4 main groups of taxable fringe benefits: • motor vehicles available for private use • free, subsidised, or discounted goods and services • low-interest loans • employer contributions to sickness, accident or death benefit funds, superannuation schemes and specified insurance policies. If these benefits are enjoyed or received by employees because of their employment, the benefits are liable for FBT. Employers pay tax on benefits provided to employees or shareholder-employees. You'll have to file an FBT return either quarterly or annually, depending on the election made, and make any payments due. Cash benefits Cash benefits are treated as normal salary and wages, taxable in the employee's hands, and are not liable for FBT. Usually, you must deduct some form of tax (for example, PAYE) from any cash benefits. Any personal expenditure incurred by an employee but paid for by the employer is also a cash benefit. If an employee pays for an employer's expenditure and is reimbursed the same amount, there's no FBT liability. Part 1 - Fringe benefits overview 4 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE For FBT purposes it excludes an employer who only pays or is liable to pay: • ACC payments • payments to a working partner or owner • a main benefit • veteran’s pension or NZ Superannuation • Education and Training Act grant • parental leave or preterm baby payment • non-resident contractor, personal service rehabilitation or voluntary schedular payments. Employees Anyone who receives or is entitled to receive salary, wages, lump sums or schedular payments. For FBT purposes, the definition also includes: • most shareholder-employees • associated persons (such as an employee's husband, wife or child) • past earners • future earners. This means you may have to pay FBT for any benefits provided to these groups. For FBT purposes, employee excludes: • shareholders who are only formally occupying a role as non-executive directors or company secretaries • partners who receive a salary from their partnership • an employee who only receives or is entitled to receive: –ACC payments –payments to a working partner or owner –a main benefit –veteran’s pension or NZ Superannuation –education and Training Act grant –parental leave or preterm baby payment –non-resident contractor, personal service rehabilitation or voluntary schedular payments. Non-resident employee If remuneration is paid to a non-resident employee, the calculation of the amount of tax payable on the remuneration includes any tax credits as if the employee was a resident for FBT purposes. Fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration (FBICR) This is the cash remuneration, less the tax calculated on it, plus the taxable value of all fringe benefits attributed to an employee in the year. Example Employee’s income $78,333.00 Less tax on employee’s income $16,072.40 Net income $62,260.60 Plus total fringe benefits provided $ 4,993.00 Equals FBICR $67,253.60 Attributed income Attributed income is income for services provided by a person, paid to an associated entity such as a trust or company. Although it is paid to the associated entity, under the attribution rule the net income (income after expenses) of the entity is treated as gross income of the person who provided the services. The definition of cash remuneration for FBT purposes includes any amount of income attributed under the attribution rule. The rule applies only in limited circumstances. For FBT purposes, when applying the alternate rate calculations to attributed benefits received from this entity, the cash remuneration includes the amount of any attributed income. The rule for attributed income does not apply to income year filers (shareholder-employees) as the due date for this return is aligned with the end-of-year tax date of the employer, so all necessary income information is known by this date. Cash remuneration For FBT purposes, cash remuneration is: • salary or wages • lump sum bonuses • schedular payments • income attributed under the attribution rules • payments to a specified office holder. These include amounts from a related employer such as a division or branch. Some special conditions apply if you're a major shareholder. Non-major shareholder-employee Cash remuneration does not include cash allowances for work-related costs initially paid for by the employee and reimbursed by the employer. For example, tax-free allowances. Major shareholders Interest and dividends received from the employer or related employer are included as cash remuneration. Employers and employees The definitions of employers and employees are wider than usual for FBT purposes. Employers Anyone who pays or is liable to pay salaries, wages, lump sums or schedular payments. The definition also includes some people who are connected with employers: • all partners in a partnership that has employees • the manager or principal officer of an unincorporated group • trustees in an estate or trust • anyone who has control of property, such as the Official Assignee, a company liquidator or the trustee of a deceased estate. 5 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Quarterly FBT return filers All employers who file quarterly FBT returns have 2 options when paying FBT in quarters 1 to 3: • 63.93% single rate, or • 49.25% alternate rate. If you elected and paid FBT using the alternate rate in any of quarters 1 to 3, you must complete the alternate rate calculation process in quarter 4. If you elected and paid FBT using the single rate in quarters 1 to 3, you have the option of using either the single rate or the alternate rate calculation in quarter 4. Annual and income year filers Employers who file annual or income year FBT returns have the option to pay FBT using either: • the flat rate of 63.93%, or • the alternate rate calculation. Alternate rate calculation process There are 2 options available when calculating FBT using the alternate rate. 1. Full alternate rate If you use this option, you'll need separate calculations for each employee receiving attributed benefits. Non-attributed benefits are pooled and taxed at 49.25% (or 63.93% in the case of benefits provided to major shareholder-employees) 2. Short form alternate rate Under this option, a flat rate of 63.93% is applied to all attributed benefits. Non-attributed benefits are pooled and taxed at 49.25% (or 63.93% in the case of benefits provided to major shareholder- employees). When deciding what rate to use you should consider your situation - see page 27. Pooled alternate rate If you use this option, benefits will be classified as either attributed or non-attributed. Attributed benefits are subject to a flat rate of either 49.25% or 63.93%, depending on the employee’s pay and the value of benefits attributed to them. If an employee has received: • $129,680 or less in net cash pay plus attributed benefits (all-inclusive pay) for the year, the rate of 49.25% applies. • more than $129,680 the rate of 63.93% would apply. If attributed benefits are taxed at the 49.25% rate for some employees and at the 63.93% rate for others, 2 pools for attributed benefits may be necessary. The safe-harbour rule allows employers to pay FBT at the rate of 49.25% on attributed benefits for employees receiving cash pay of $160,000 or less if the benefits attributed to those employees are less than $13,400 annually per employee. Completing quarter 4 pooled alternate rate calculation (page 34) has more information You should consider your situation when deciding what rate to use - see page 27. Major shareholder A major shareholder is a person who owns, has the power or control over, or has the right to acquire, 10% or more of the ordinary shares or voting rights of a close company. A close company has 5 or fewer natural persons who hold 50% or more of the total voting or market value interest in the company. If you think this may affect you and you want more information, call us on 0800 377 772. Non-attributed fringe benefits Certain benefits do not have to be attributed to the particular employees who receive them. These benefits are: • subsidised transport of a taxable value of less than $1,000 per employee per year. There's a special rule for this - see page 18 • employer contributions to superannuation, where ESCT (employer superannuation contribution tax) does not apply, and insurance funds of less than $1,000 per employee per year • benefits from loans on life insurance policies. A special rule applies - see page 22 • benefits that cannot be attributed to particular employees (for example, pooled vehicles) • benefits provided to ex-employees • contributions to a sickness, accident or death fund of less than $1,000 per employee per year • any other benefit with a taxable value of less than $2,000 per employee per year. Pooled benefits A pooled benefit is a non-attributed benefit no 1 employee has principally used or enjoyed during the quarter or relevant period of the income year. Shareholder-employees A shareholder-employee is a shareholder and an employee of a company with no more than 25 shareholders. Any benefit they receive as an employee is a fringe benefit and FBT is payable. If you employ shareholder-employees, you may not have all the cash remuneration details for these employees to calculate the fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration. For example, the shareholder-employee's salary and wages, where PAYE has not been deducted, may not be available because this information is aligned with the income tax filing process. 6 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Part 2 - Returning FBT All employers and businesses who provide fringe benefits must file regular FBT returns. FBT return forms There are 3 types of FBT returns: quarterly (IR420), income year (IR421) and annual (IR422). You can file your FBT return in myIR or file paper returns. If you choose paper filing, we’ll automatically send you a return before the due date for filing. You are required to file FBT returns quarterly unless you meet the criteria to file yearly returns (an election to file annual or income year returns is required). Fringe benefit tax quarterly return - IR420 The return periods and due dates for quarterly returns and payments are: QuartersReturn periodDue date 11 April to 30 June20 July 21 July to 30 September20 October 31 October to 31 December20 January 41 January to 31 March31 May Fringe benefit tax income year return - IR421 This return is for companies with shareholder-employees. It covers the same period as the company's accounting year. The due date for filing the return is the same as that for paying end-of-year income tax. You can file an income year return if: • you are a close company and your annual gross PAYE and ESCT deductions for the previous year are no more than $1,000,000, or • you only provide motor vehicles for private use to shareholder- employees and the benefit is limited to 2 vehicles, or • you were not an employer in the previous year. Fringe benefit tax annual return - IR422 This return is for employers who have elected to file annual returns for the year to 31 March. The return is due on 31 May. You can file an annual return if your annual gross PAYE and ESCT deductions for the previous year were no more than $1,000,000 or you did not employ any employees in the previous year. Note You can change your filing frequency in myIR or by calling us on 0800 377 772. Due dates for elections There are set dates you must meet to elect to file yearly returns. The dates depend on the type of return you want to file, and whether you're a current or new employer. Your election must be made by the due date as we do not accept late elections. If your election is late, we'll notify you. You'll have to continue filing quarterly returns until the following financial or income year. Annual returns If you're a current employer, you must make your election by 30 June in the year it applies to. For example, if you want to file your 1st annual return for the year ended 31 March 2025, you must make an election by 30 June 2024. New employers must elect by the last day of the 1st quarter after starting to employ. For example, if you start employing on 31 October 2024, you have to make an election by 31 December 2024 to file your 1st annual return to 31 March 2025. Income year returns Existing companies with shareholder-employees can elect to file income year returns by the last day of the 1st FBT quarter in the income year it applies to. For example, a company with a 30 September balance date would have to elect by 31 December 2024 to file a return for the year ending 30 September 2025. A new employer company must elect by the last day of the 1st quarter they started employing in, within the income year the election applies to. For example, a company with a 30 June balance date starts employing on 31 July 2024. The company must make an election by 30 September 2024 to file the 1st income year return for the year ending 30 June 2025. 7 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Change in status If your situation changes in any of the following ways, you need to let us know. You start providing fringe benefits If you have started or are starting to provide fringe benefits and have not registered for FBT. You can register in myIR. From your myIR homepage, in the 'I want to ...' section under 'Registration, application and enrolment', select 'Register for new tax accounts'. You stop providing fringe benefits but continue to employ staff If you file quarterly returns and provided fringe benefits in quarters 1, 2 or 3, you're required to continue filing quarterly returns up to, and including, the quarter 4. When you've completed your quarter 4 return you can: • Paper returns - write ‘final return’ next to the circles where you're asked to indicate if the return is for quarter 4 on the IR420, or • in myIR, or • call us on 0800 377 772 and let us know you’re no longer provide fringe benefits. You stop employing staff and providing fringe benefits You'll need to file a final FBT return to cover the period up to the date you stopped employing - see page 30. You might stop employing but still provide benefits to past employees or shareholder-employees. In this case, you must file FBT returns until you stop providing benefits. The same rules apply if you cease business but still provide benefits - you must file FBT returns until you stop providing benefits. For low-interest loans you must file returns until the total loan is repaid. Note The fringe benefit tax election will tell us: • the filing frequency you want to start using, or • you are changing the benefits you provide employees and do not need to file fringe benefit tax returns any more. Deregistering a charity A deregistered charity is no longer eligible for the FBT exemption. FBT rules apply from the date of deregistration. A charity voluntarily wound-up loses their FBT exemption from the date it's removed from the charities register and FBT is applicable for the return period from this date. A charity failing to comply with their constitution loses their FBT exemption from the date of non-compliance and FBT is applicable for the return period from this date. 8 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Part 3 - Motor vehicles In this part we explain when motor vehicle fringe benefits arise. We also show how to complete the FBT taxable value calculation sheet that comes with your FBT return and tell you what records to keep for motor vehicles. You have to pay fringe benefit tax (FBT) if your business makes a vehicle available for employees, their associated persons and shareholder- employees to use privately – even if they do not actually use it. For a fringe benefit to arise the person who makes the vehicle available to the employee does not have to be the employer. The person can be someone who: • owns the vehicle • leases or rents the vehicle • has the right to use the vehicle under an agreement or arrangement with the employee, or a person associated with the employee. Sole traders and partners in a partnership do not pay FBT on business vehicles they use privately. Instead, they make income tax and GST adjustments for private use. As a sole trader or partner in a partnership you must use a logbook to keep track of your business use of the vehicle. If a vehicle belonging to... is available to...it may affect... any businessan employeeFBT and GST a sole traderthe sole traderincome tax and GST a partnershipa partnerincome tax and GST a companya shareholder-employeeFBT and GST From the 2018 income year onwards, a close company can make an election to apply the rules for determining motor vehicle expenditure rather than FBT. To qualify, a close company must: • have only 1 or 2 motor vehicles made available for the private use of shareholder-employees, and • provide no other fringe benefits to any employees. To find out more about the rules for motor vehicle expenditure and how to make adjustments for private use go to ird.govt.nz/fbt You can make an election by including a note the company is opting out of the FBT rules with your income tax return for the year the motor vehicle is: • acquired, or • 1st used for business use. An election is only valid if it is provided by the due date for filing the income tax return. Once the election is made you cannot return to using the FBT rules for that vehicle unless the vehicle is disposed of, or the close company stops using the vehicle for business use. Generally, as long as you have made a vehicle available for an employee to use privately, you'll have to pay FBT whether or not your employee actually uses the vehicle privately. Exemptions from FBT on work- related vehicles An FBT liability does not apply for any day a vehicle provided to an employee is classified as a work-related vehicle. Note - not all business vehicles are work-related vehicles for FBT purposes. To qualify for the work-related vehicles exemption from FBT all of the following requirements must be met. 1. The vehicle must be drawn or propelled by mechanical power, including a trailer, and have a gross laden weight less than 3,500kg. Note If a vehicle above the gross laden weight is provided to an employee for private use this may need to be treated as an unclassified benefit. You should regularly check logbooks, petrol receipts etc to make sure employees are using the vehicle appropriately. You should also keep a record of these checks. 2. Business identification regularly used by the employer (or owner, if vehicle is rented) must be permanently and prominently displayed on the exterior of the vehicle. This may include a name, logo acronym or other business identification. Magnetic or removable signs are not enough, and neither is signwriting on a removable part of a vehicle (such as a pick-up's removable canopy or a spare wheel cover). 3. The exclusive design of the vehicle must be to carry goods, or goods and passengers equally. If the vehicle is designed mainly to carry passengers, it will not meet this requirement. Vehicles that may qualify: • Utes (including extra cabs and double cabs). • Light pick-up trucks. • Vehicles with rear doors that are permanently without rear seats such as vans, station-wagons, hatchbacks, panel vans and 4-wheel drives. This also applies if the rear seats have been welded down or made unusable because of a permanent fixture, such as shelving, covering the entire rear seat area. • Taxis, including sedans and station-wagons (the rear seat requirement stated above does not apply to taxis). 4. You must notify employees in writing the vehicle is not available for private use, except for: • travel between home and work necessary in (and a condition of) their employment • travel incidental to business travel (for example, passing by the bank on the way home from work). Note You must give employees a separate letter explaining this restriction rather than mentioning it in their employment contract (example letter page 9). 9 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Example James, the chief mechanic, is given an Audi A4 station-wagon as a work-related vehicle. The A4 has permanent signs, the rear seats have been removed and cabinetry built to carry essential tools if he’s called out. His employer gave James a letter (see below) advising him the Audi is not available for private use. 1 January 20XX Audis on Anglesey Ltd 563 Goodyear Street WELLINGTON Vehicle private use restriction Dear James The Audi A4 station-wagon, registration number CFK917, has been provided to you as required in your role with us. This vehicle is for business use and is not available for private use during the week or the weekend, unless you: - are travelling between home and work, or - have any incidental travel while using the station-wagon on Audis on Anglesey Ltd business. This for fringe benefit tax reasons. We’ll also regularly check to make sure you’re following this restriction. Thank you for your co-operation. Allan Partial exemption If a vehicle meets the 4 conditions listed, it is a work-related vehicle. However, if you decide to allow some private use on certain days, such as Saturdays, Sundays and statutory holidays, you can have a partial exemption. This means the vehicle is not a work-related vehicle on those days and you pay FBT on those days in each quarter. This is useful for employees who are on call and need their vehicles with them for emergency callouts. Emergency calls If an employee uses a vehicle to attend an emergency call, FBT does not apply for the whole day when the employee travels from their home, and in the course of their employment provides: • essential services relating to the operation of your plant or machinery, or the plant or machinery of your client or customer • essential services relating to the maintenance of services provided by a local authority or a public authority • essential services relating to the carrying on of a business for the supply of energy or fuel to the public • emergency services relating to the health or safety of any person • the services must be requested by a member of the public, the employer, their client or customer. The visit must take place between 6pm and 6am during the work week, or at any time on a Saturday, Sunday or statutory public holiday. There are no time restrictions in the case of health or safety of a person. Business travel An exemption from FBT may apply when an employee is required to travel on a regular basis with a vehicle, and the following conditions are met: • The length of the trip is more than 24 hours. • Use of the vehicle is required for the employee to perform their duties. • The employee must be absent from home with the vehicle for the exemption to apply. Example Mark has an Audi A4 station-wagon available for unlimited private use. Mark regularly travels outside of Wellington to perform specialist repairs on clients’ vehicles. He is often away from home overnight when visiting multiple clients or making difficult repairs. Days where Mark is absent from home with the vehicle for more than 24 hours while working, qualify for a business travel exemption. Vehicles parked at airport carparks If an employee parks a vehicle at an airport while they fly to another destination, the business travel exemption does not apply, as the employee is not with the vehicle. Whether FBT is payable depends on if you have made the vehicle available for private use. FBT may apply to the day of departure and the day of return unless the employee has been restricted from using the vehicle for private travel. Any days between the employee’s departure and return are exempt from FBT, as you have removed the employee’s access to the vehicle by requiring them to fly on business. Records You must keep adequate records to support the exemptions claimed. 10 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Other days not liable Sometimes vehicles may be unavailable to the employee. For example, if the vehicle has broken down or is being repaired. The vehicle must be unavailable to the employee, or any of their associates, for at least 1 complete 24-hour period before you can claim an exemption. These days qualify for an exemption provided there's a valid reason recorded for the vehicle's unavailability. Election of the commencement of a 24-hour period You can elect the start time for an FBT day to reflect your business needs. This removes the anomaly where 2 days' FBT could be incurred when a vehicle was taken home overnight. If you elect a start time other than midnight you must apply it to all vehicles owned or leased. The election normally lasts 2 years. To make an election, choose a start point and notify us of the election start time and date in writing. The election becomes effective from the start of the quarter, income year, or tax year we receive the notification in. This provision benefits you if you occasionally allow employees to take vehicles home overnight. You may apply to amend the start time of the 24-hour period if your circumstances have changed in a way that: • is more than minor, and • the starting time is no longer relevant to the business. The election applies for a minimum period of 2 income years. You may apply to amend this in writing. 3-month test period Using a 3-month test period means that instead of recording every exemption a vehicle qualifies for over its whole life, you can keep these full records for just 3 months. You can then use the result of the test to calculate your FBT for that vehicle for a 3-year application period, after which you'll have to run another test period. The records you must keep are outlined on page 15. Remember, you have to pay FBT as long as the vehicle is available for private use, whether or not it's actually used. The table below shows when you must run your test period, and when the 3-year application starts.. FilerTest covers3-year period starts quarterly1 full quarter1st day of that quarter annual1 full quarter1 April of the year the test is in income yearany 3 consecutive months in the income year 1st day of the income year the test is in The test period must fairly represent when you expect the vehicle will be available for private use by your employee over the 3-year period. If the actual number of exempt days in any quarter, year or income year is 20% higher than the test period result, the application period ends on the last day of that quarter, year or income year. If we consider the test period result is not representative of the exempt days, we may reject it. You'll then have to run another test period. Example Flynn can use an Audis on Anglesey Ltd’s vehicle for private use on Saturdays, Sundays and statutory holidays. The vehicle qualifies for the work-related vehicle exemption on other days. Audis on Anglesey decided to run a test period in the September quarter. In the quarter Flynn had 6 callouts that qualified for the emergency call exemption. Flynn also had to spend a weekend out of town for a conference (leaving on Friday and returning on Monday). This travel qualified for the business travel exemption. These are Audis on Anglesey’s records. Number of days in the quarter 92 Number of liable days (Saturdays, Sundays etc) 26 Number of callouts on liable days that qualified for the emergency call exemption 6 Number of callouts on weeknights 3 Business travel qualifying for the business travel exemption 2 The number of FBT days the vehicle was made available for private use in this test period was 18 (26 - 6 - 2). In this case, 18 days can be used in each quarter in the 3-year application period. As the vehicle qualifies for the exemption for work-related vehicles on weekdays, the 3 weeknight callouts were disregarded as those days were already exempt. Only 2 days were counted as out-of-town travel days, as the Friday and Monday involved were already covered by the work-related vehicle exemption. Exemption days The number of days in each quarter varies when deducting exempt days from the total of liable days. You must deduct the number of exempt days from the actual number of days in the quarter. The actual number of days in each quarter are: June quarter (Apr, May, Jun) 91 September quarter (Jul, Aug, Sep) 92 December quarter (Oct, Nov, Dec) 92 March quarter (Jan, Feb, Mar) 90 There are 91 days in the March quarter in leap years. 11 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Motor vehicle valuation methods You have 2 options for valuing motor vehicles. FBT can be calculated on either the cost price or the tax book value. Both FBT valuation methods may be calculated on a GST-inclusive or GST- exclusive basis. Cost price The cost price of a motor vehicle includes any initial costs of getting the vehicle on the road. In addition to the purchase price of the vehicle, the cost price includes: • initial registration costs and licence plate fees • any extras fitted, such as a towbar • any initial transportation costs for the vehicle, such as freight and customs duty. • Credit received from the Clean Car Rebate However, this does not include items such as financing the purchase of the vehicle, or annual re-licencing fees. The cost price is also not reduced if the State Sector Decarbonisation Fund applies. Any trade-in value should not be subtracted from the cost price. The table below shows the FBT valuation rates when using cost price. Return filingGST-inclusive cost price GST-exclusive cost price Annual or income year20%23% Quarterly5%5.75% Tax book value The motor vehicle's tax book value is: • the original cost price less the total accumulated depreciation of the vehicle as at the start of the FBT period, or • the cost of the vehicle if acquired after the beginning of the tax year. The table below shows the FBT valuation rates when using the tax book value Return filingGST-inclusive tax book value GST-exclusive book value Annual or income year36%41.40% Quarterly9%10.35% A minimum tax book value of $8,333 applies to this option. This means once the tax book value of the vehicle falls below $8,333, the taxable value of the vehicle must be calculated on $8,333. This is to reflect the on-going benefit the employee receives by the vehicle being made available for private use, even when the vehicle has significantly depreciated. If you have chosen between the cost price and tax book value options in the 1st FBT return for the vehicle, you must continue to use this option until at least the earliest of the following: • the date the vehicle is sold • the date you stop leasing the vehicle, or • the date when 5 years has elapsed from the start of the period of the 1st return. Motor vehicle cost price or tax book value? If you provide motor vehicles for private use, choose the option (cost price or book value) that benefits you most. The tax book value method costs more in the initial years when compared to the FBT payable under the cost price option. However, the tax book value method is of benefit if you intend to retain your motor vehicles for longer than 5 years. Leased vehicles If you lease a vehicle from any person, whether associated or not, you can calculate FBT on either the cost price or tax book value. If you're unsure of the cost price or tax book value you'll need to ask the lessor, who is required to disclose the relevant values to you. If you lease a vehicle previously leased to another person, the vehicle cost price is the market value if: • the leased vehicle was not previously leased by an associated person, and • you're not associated with the lessor or owner of the vehicle, and • your employee is not the lessor or owner of the vehicle, and • your employee is not associated with the lessor or owner of the vehicle. Vehicle acquired at no cost or less than market value If you received a vehicle at no cost, or for less than market value, or at a cost that cannot be determined from an associated person, the value of the vehicle is the higher of: • the original purchase price the associated person paid, or • the current market value. Market value is the price that would normally be paid for the motor vehicle in the open market at the time the employee receives the fringe benefit. You must have records to support the market value used. Determining the value of pooled motor vehicles If there's a pool of vehicles available for an employee to use, work out the value of each vehicle from the table below. If the... use the... employee uses mainly 1 vehiclevalue of that vehicle employee does not mainly use the same vehicle, and the employer’s business is not selling cars highest value of any of the vehicles in the pool employee does not mainly use the same vehicle, the employer's business is selling cars, and the vehicles in the pool are trading stock average value of all the vehicles in the pool 12 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Note The number of days cannot be more than 90. If the quarter has more than 90 days, such as the 92 days of the September quarter, the most Y can be is still 90. Example Cost price option Audis on Anglesey Ltd has a pool of 4 vehicles (trading stock) valued at $17,800, $18,900, $25,600 and $32,500. The average pool value is $23,700. Audis on Anglesey Ltd use the average value as they are in the business of selling cars and the vehicles in the pool are trading stock. In the June quarter there are 91 days. They use 90 days as the pool vehicles are available for employees to use 100% of the time. If the days available were less than 90, they would use the available days. The taxable value is: Number of cars × Average cost price × Available days\* × 5% Days in quarter 4 × $23,700 × 90 × 5%=$4,740 90 \*The lessor of 90 days or actual use days Note If there are exempt days for any of the vehicles, complete an individual calculation for each one to work out the taxable value for the pooled vehicles. Example Book value option Audis on Anglesey Ltd own the vehicles (no longer trading stock) and no employees use a particular vehicle. However, all employees used the highest value vehicle at least once during the year. They calculate FBT using the book value option based on the book values of $9,000, $13,000, $18,000 and $26,000: Number of cars × Highest book value of all pool vehicles × Available days\* × 9% Days in quarter 4 × $26,000 × 90 × 9% = $9,360 90 \*The lessor of 90 days or actual use days Calculating the taxable value of private use of a motor vehicle For quarterly FBT returns, the value of fringe benefit (the private use or enjoyment) of the vehicle or the availability of use is: Y × Z 90 Y is the lesser of: • the number of days the vehicle is available for private use\* or • 90 days Z is either: • 5% of the GST-inclusive cost price of the vehicle (owned or leased by the employer), or • 9% of the GST-inclusive, or 10.35% of the GST-exclusive tax book value of the vehicle. \*Calculation of Y When calculating the number of days a vehicle is available for private use, you must deduct the number of exempt days from the actual number of days in the quarter.

Example The table below shows the variances in the taxable values used for calculating an employer’s fringe benefit liability using either the cost price or the book value options.

Book value has been calculated using depreciation at 36% for a 12-month period. 13 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Annual and income year returns If you file annual returns, calculate the value of the benefit for the year by adding the sum of the amounts calculated using the quarterly formula for each of the 4 quarters in the applicable year. If you file income year returns, calculate the value of the benefit for the year as follows: Y × Z = taxable value 365 Y is the lesser of: • the number of days during the year the vehicle is available for private use, or • 365. Z is either: • 20% of the GST-inclusive, or 23% of the GST-exclusive cost price of the motor vehicle, or • 36% of the GST-inclusive, or 41.40% of the GST-exclusive tax book value of the motor vehicle. Example Cost price Audis on Anglesey Ltd completed its income year return and Allan had unlimited availability of the company’s Audi A6 that cost $132,900. During the year Allan had 75 exempt days when the vehicle was not available for private use. There are 365 days in the year (except in a leap year): 365 days − 75 days = 290 (Y) Cost price $132,900 × 20% = $26,580 (Z) The taxable value of the fringe benefit is: 290 (Y) × $26,580 (Z) = $21,118 365 Example Book value Using the previous example where the book value of the Audi A6 is $85,056 the calculation would be: 365 days − 75 days = 290 (Y) Book value $85,056 × 36% = $30,620 (Z) The taxable value of the fringe benefit is: 290 (Y) × $30,620 (Z) = $24,328 365 Employee contributions If an employee makes any payments in return for having a fringe benefit, the payment is deducted when working out the taxable value of the benefit. If an employee makes a full contribution, there is no taxable fringe benefit value and no FBT liability, but the employer still needs to include the nil fringe benefit value in the FBT return. Employees paying for fuel If an employee pays for some of the fuel, they must give you a receipt for each contribution. The receipt or an invoice must meet the normal receipt requirements and include the vehicle's registration number. You cannot claim the GST paid or the amount as an expense against income. The contributions should be deducted when working out the taxable value. If the employee pays for expenses and is reimbursed by you, the value of the fringe benefit remains unchanged. Example Michael has unlimited use of his Audi A4 and decides to visit his relatives in Taupo. His petrol costs $170 and he pays for this personally. The calculation for FBT on the cost price option would be: $89,900 × 90 × 5% − $170 = $4,325 90 Direct payment to the employer A direct payment to the employer by an employee must be recorded by the employer as income for both GST and income tax purposes. The employee’s contribution is deducted when working out the taxable value. A shareholder-employee makes a contribution by a current account adjustment You can do this if the appropriate journal entries are made and are effective on or before the last day of the FBT period (the last day of each quarter, or the last day of the annual or income year period). The employee part-owns the vehicle In this situation, 2.5% of the employee's contribution to the cost price can be deducted from the value of the benefit in each quarter. For income year returns, 10% of the employee's contribution is deducted. If the period covered by the return is less than a normal income year, calculate the amount as: number of days covered by the return × 10% 365 days Note Only the amount paid for the use of the vehicle itself can be deducted here, and only if there’s an actual cost to the employee. Any indirect costs, such as garaging or costs for which there has been no payment, such as the employee doing some servicing of the vehicle at home, cannot be deducted. 14 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Motor vehicles List your employees' names in the same order for all your calculation sheets. Column 1 Employee name receiving the benefit of the car or pooled vehicles.

Work-related vehicles You'll need to keep these records for any work-related vehicle: • a description of the vehicle to show it qualifies for the exemption • a copy of the private use restriction (letter or notice) • records of the quarterly checks required to ensure the vehicle is not used for unauthorised private use. The types of records show the requirements that must be met for a vehicle to qualify for the work-related vehicle exemption. Work-related vehicle partially available for private use For work-related vehicles partially available for private use, a copy of the written restriction stating this must be held by you. Remember the actual days the motor vehicle is available must be stated, for example, Saturdays, Sundays or statutory holidays. They cannot, for example, be any 2 days per week, as this means the vehicle is available on any day, and full FBT would apply. Emergency call exemption For emergency call exemption claims, keep a record of: • the purpose of the call • the details of the services provided • when the service was performed, for example, duration, time employee left and returned home, why the services had to be performed at that time • the customer/client details • the details of the employee and vehicle. Business travel exemption For any business travel claims, keep a record of: • the purpose of the travel • proof the travel was for longer than 24 hours • the number of days that qualified for the exemption • the details of the employee and the vehicle. 16 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Private use and the availability for private use of employer-owned or leased business tools are exempt from FBT if the tools are mainly provided for business purposes. The cost of each tool must not be more than $5,000. Example Nicole has been given a laptop costing $2,900 (GST-inclusive). She uses it mostly for work but has also used it for completing assignments and research. As the laptop is mostly for business use, there is no fringe benefit for the personal use. If the value of the laptop is more than $5,000, the exemption does not apply. Benefits from undertaking hazard management initiatives such as protective clothing or health checks will not incur an FBT liability for any benefits that arise out of that management, irrespective of where the benefit is provided. To qualify, the measures must be aimed at addressing hazard management in the workplace as outlined in the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015. It does not extend to items such as gym subscriptions or employer-paid health insurance premiums. Example Flu injections were provided on site to all employees of Audis on Anglesey Ltd, but Nicole, James and George were not available on the arranged day. Each went to their own doctor to receive the vaccination and the company paid the fees. As the company was complying with its health and safety obligations the vaccinations are not a fringe benefit. Note There is no FBT for discounted goods or services provided to employees by a 3rd party under an arrangement with the employer, if: • the discount is no more than offered to comparably sized groups, and • the discount is undertaken on an arm's-length basis. Services FBT on services If services are provided to an employee at less than the normal cost to the public, this is a fringe benefit. These include gifting schemes, such as long-service awards, incentive vouchers or gifts, club memberships, accompanying travel by the employee's spouse or family, and other such benefits. If you pay for an employee's partner and/or family to visit them at their temporary workplace, it may be exempt from FBT. To qualify for the exemption, the value of the travel must not exceed the amount that would have been provided as a tax-free allowance to the employee if they travelled home instead. Part 4 - Free, subsidised or discounted goods and services This part explains how to deal with free, subsidised or discounted goods and services. It also explains how entertainment expenses fit in with the FBT rules. The 3 main types of fringe benefits in this category are goods, services and subsidised transport. Benefits provided to shareholder-employees A company providing any of the benefits in part 4 to shareholder- employees may pay FBT on them or choose to treat them as dividends. You must let us know in writing if you choose this option. You can do this by sending a message in myIR including the return period it relates to or if you file paper returns, note this on your FBT return. If you do not tell us, the benefit will be treated as a fringe benefit. GST and the value of the fringe benefit You must use the GST-inclusive cost of free, subsidised or discounted goods and services. Goods FBT on goods If goods are provided for an employee at less than the cost to you, this is a fringe benefit. The cost to you is usually the price paid to purchase those goods. However, if you manufactured, produced or processed the goods, the cost is the lowest price identical goods are sold by you to other customers (wholesale or retail). Example If a soft drink producer provides free soft drink for employees to take home, FBT would be charged. Goods not subject to FBT If the sale price of the goods to the employee is more than the cost to the employer, FBT is not payable. If an item usually retails for $200 or less, is on special to the public and sold at discount to an employee at the normal staff discount rate, it is not considered a fringe benefit. This only applies if the price paid by the employee is more than: • 95% of the cost price to the employer, or • 95% of the selling price to the public, if a reasonable quantity of identical goods are available on special to the public The fringe benefit is the lesser of these amounts. There's another exemption for goods not on special, sold to employees at less than cost price. This applies when: • the goods are sold as part of the employer's normal business, and • the normal retail price of the goods is $200 or less, and • the discount is the usual staff discount, and the staff discount is not more than 5% of the sale price to the public. If these conditions are met, there is no FBT payable on the goods. 17 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Example Audis on Anglesey Ltd sends Zac to Auckland for a 3-week training course. Zac goes home the 1st weekend – return flights cost of $610. The 2nd weekend Zac’s wife comes to Auckland instead. Her flights cost $580. No FBT is payable as the flights cost less than Zac’s. If his wife’s flights were more than $610, FBT would be payable on the whole amount of her flights. Taxable value of the services The taxable value of the fringe benefit is the normal market price (including GST) of the service provided, less any employee contribution not reimbursed by the employer. If someone else provides the service on behalf of the employer, the value of the benefit is the amount paid by the employer to that supplier. If the employer and the supplier are associated, the fringe benefit value is the value of those services to the general public. Note Income tax may apply to some entertainment goods and services that may be considered fringe benefits - see Part 8. Exemptions for goods and services Free (gifts and prizes), subsidised or discounted goods and services If you provide free (gifts and prizes), subsidised or discounted goods and services, FBT is not payable if you meet the requirements of the general employee exemption and maximum employer exemption. General exemption There's a $300 exemption per employee per quarter from paying FBT if you provide free (gifts and prizes), subsidised or discounted goods and services. However, if the value of the benefits for an employee is more than $300 in a quarter, the FBT applies to the full value of the benefits – the exemption is not deducted first. Example Quarterly returnEmployee BenefitsNicoleBailey Prize - mystery weekend$170$200 Tyre balance$ 25 Audi jacket$300 Total$195$500 Exemption available$195$ - There’s no exemption for Bailey as the total value of benefits is over the $300 maximum per quarter. The total exemption of $195 only applies to Nicole as the fringe benefit is less than $300. Maximum exemption The maximum exemption you can claim is $22,500 per annum. If the total value of benefits for all employees is more than $22,500 for the current and 3 preceding quarters, you must pay FBT on the total value of the goods and services benefits in the current quarter. Charitable organisation exemption Generally, charities are exempt from paying FBT on benefits provided to employees while they are carrying out their charitable activities - see our Charitable and donee organisations - IR255 guide. This exemption does not apply to any short-term charge facilities (including vouchers) provided to employees, if the value of the facility is more than the lesser of • 5% of the employee's salary or wages in a tax year, or • the general exemption. A short-term charge facility is an arrangement for an employee to get goods and services that have no connection to the charitable organisation or its operations, where the organisation is liable for part or all the payment for those goods and services. Annual and income year returns Employers who file income or annual year returns have a yearly exemption of $1,200 for each employee, with the maximum employer exemption for all employees of $22,500 per year. If the period covered by the return is less than or more than a normal income year, an adjustment per employee is needed as follows: days covered by return × $1,200 365 Public transport Certain public transport benefits you provide to your employees may be exempt. They need to be mainly for the purpose of the employee travelling between work and home and be 1 of the exempt transport options. Transport fares The exemption covers fares for the following transport options: • bus • train • ferry • cable car. Transport fares provided mainly for the purpose of the employee travelling between work and home and partly funded by the Total Mobility Scheme are also included. Employer provided transport The exemption applies if you provide: • bicycles • electric bikes • scooters • electric scooters • other low-powered vehicles declared by NZ Transport Agency Waka Kotahi as mobility devices or not motor vehicles. This exemption also applies if you help pay for certain vehicle share services for any of these transport modes. 18 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Transport not covered These exemptions do not apply to transport options such as: • air transport • taxi • shuttle Goods and services - attributed and non-attributed benefits Free, subsidised or discounted goods and services If the annual taxable value of all free, subsidised or discounted goods or services is less than $2,000 per employee, the benefits do not have to be attributed to the individual employee receiving them. If you attribute any fringe benefits within the threshold, all benefits in that category must be attributed. Note Non-attributed benefits are taxed at 49.25% or 63.93% depending on the circumstances. If you choose the alternate rate option and attributing benefits, you should identify the benefits that are attributed and non-attributed on a quarterly basis. This will save you time at the end of the year when you complete your final or quarter 4 return. For non-attributed benefits in this category, you'll also have to make sure at the end of the year the total annual benefits provided to each employee are less than $2,000. If an employee's total benefits exceed the threshold, the benefits must be attributed to them. Subsidised transport Attributed and non-attributed benefits This only applies to employers who are in the business of, or in a group of companies in the business of, supplying transport to the public. For example, air, road, rail and sea passenger services. A fringe benefit exists when employees receive the same service offered to the public at a cost less than 25% of the highest fare charged to the public. This also applies when the subsidised transport is provided by a 3rd party, if both the employer and the 3rd party are in the public transport business. Example A company provides air services to the general public. Employees can travel on these services by paying 10% of the highest price applying at the time of travel. Mike, an employee, bought overseas travel costing $1,000. The highest cost for this class of travel was $10,000 so the fringe benefit is $1,500: $10,000 × 25% = $2,500 less $1,000 employee contribution. Subsidised transport is a separate category of fringe benefit. It does not have to be attributed to individual employees if all employees have the same or similar entitlement. However, if this is not the case, the annual taxable value of subsidised transport provided to an employee of $1,000 or more must be attributed. Note If 1 benefit in this category is attributed, all benefits must be attributed. If you choose the alternate rate option and attributing benefits, you should identify the benefits attributed and non-attributed on a quarterly basis. This will save you time at the end of the year when you complete your final or quarter 4 return. For non-attributed benefits in this category, at the end of the year you'll have to make sure the total annual benefits provided for each employee are less than $1,000. If an employee's total benefits exceed the threshold, the benefits must be attributed to them. Specific common issues Distinctive work clothing If you provide distinctive work clothing there is no FBT. Clothing includes any single item of clothing forming part of a uniform identifiable with the employer because of logos, pattern, colour scheme or style. Carparks If you provide employees with carparks there is no FBT if the carpark is on your premises. This exemption extends to leasing carparks for your employees, provided they have an exclusive right to occupy the property. Frequent flyer and membership reward schemes Benefits do not have FBT if your employees join the scheme for their own use. FBT may apply if you enter an arrangement with the promoter of the scheme to benefit employees. 19 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Box 1 Total the value of benefits provided.

Record keeping You need to keep separate records for different types of fringe benefits: • gifts and prizes • subsidised or discounted goods, services or transport. This is because you must list them all separately in your FBT taxable value calculation sheet. The records must show the: • date of transaction • name of employee receiving the benefit • description of the benefit provided • cost to employee • cost to employer for goods • normal market price for services • highest price charged to the general public for subsidised transport. Where appropriate, you should also keep invoices. 0 00 21 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE FBT not payable for certain loans If normal commercial credit is available to the general public, and you give the same credit to an employee, FBT is not payable. Example Audis on Anglesey Ltd offers their customers interest-free finance to buy new cars. Their employee Sarah buys a new car and takes advantage of the interest-free finance being offered. Even though there is no interest payable and it is lower than the prescribed rate, no FBT is payable as the finance is available to the general public. Charitable organisations are not required to pay FBT where a benefit is made available to an employee by way of short-term credit, and the benefit does not exceed 5% of the employee's salary and wages. If the total value of the benefits is more than the 5% threshold the charitable organisation will need to include FBT on the short-term credit available to the employee. Wage advances Loans provided by employers as an advance against future salary or wages do not have FBT, provided the combined amount outstanding for an employee is not more than $2,000. The loan provided to the employee must not form part of an employment package. This exemption does not apply to loans secured against real property, such as a mortgage. Employee share loans For an employee share loan to be exempt from FBT it must meet the following criteria: • The sole purpose and use of the loan, for the period the loan is outstanding, is to enable the employee to acquire shares, rights or options in your company or in a company associated with you. • The shares, rights or options must be beneficially owned by the employee at all times for the period of the loan. • A condition of the loan agreement is it must be repaid in full if the employee ceases to be the beneficial owner of any of the shares, rights or options. • Your company issuing the shares, rights or options is not a qualifying company. • You and your employee are not associated persons. • Your company issuing the shares, rights or options maintains a dividend paying policy for the period of the loan. Part 5 - Low-interest loans FBT is payable on low-interest loans made to employees. A loan includes all advances (such as salary advances), deposits, money lent in any other way, and any credit given (including delaying the recovery of a debt). A debit balance in the current account of a shareholder-employee of a close company is also a loan. FBT is not payable on the actual loan provided by an employer to an employee. FBT is calculated on loans by comparing the interest on the loan with the interest calculated, using the prescribed rate. Prescribed rate of interest The prescribed rate of interest is a standard rate set by regulation under the Income Tax Act 2007 and is reviewed quarterly. If there's a change to the rate of interest it is made: • at least 1 month before the start of the quarter the new rate first applies to, if the rate is increased, or • at least 1 month before the end of the quarter the new rate first applies to, if the rate is reduced. For the current prescribed interest rates go to ird.govt.nz/fbt-pir Market rate Banks, financial institutions or employers in a group of companies with a member in the business of lending money to the public, may choose to calculate the interest on a loan based on the market rate. All other employers must calculate interest using the prescribed rate. Market interest is calculated at the rate applying to an employee belonging to a group when either: • the group is assessed as having a comparable credit as the employee’s employer, and • is not associated to the employer, and • is big enough to conduct the transaction on an arms-length basis. Or alternatively the rate is the lowest rate given around the same time by the employer, in the ordinary course of business, to customers with a similar profile to the employee during the quarter the loan is provided, or during the preceding quarter if the rate for the loan quarter cannot be calculated. Example A bank provides loans to their employees on terms identical to those they offer to a group of government employees, but not to the general public. The market interest rate is the one offered to the group of government employees. FBT on interest If the interest on the loan is less than the interest calculated using the prescribed rate or market rate on the daily balance of the loan, FBT applies on the difference. If a loan is provided by another person on behalf of the employer, FBT may also apply. For example, you must pay FBT on any low-interest loan provided to an employee by an associated company in a group of companies. 22 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Share purchase scheme loans FBT is not payable on a loan provided to an employee under a share purchase scheme. You’re allowed a deduction for interest in relation to a loan made to an employee under a share purchase scheme, provided you have our approval. To be approved you must meet the following criteria: • The shares must be available for no more than their market value at the date of purchase or subscription and an employee can only spend $2,340 in a 3-year period on buying shares under the scheme or any similar scheme. • Directors and any person owning at least 10% of the company are prohibited from participation. • Employees must be eligible to participate equally in the scheme. • The minimum period of employment or service before employees are eligible to participate is no more than 3 years' full-time work for full-time employees, and for other employees an accumulated period equivalent to 3 years' full-time work. • A loan to an employee to buy shares: –is to be free of interest and other charges, and –be of a minimum amount of $624 or less. • Employees must be able to repay the loan: –by regular equal instalments of 1 month or less, and –over a period of between 3 and 5 years from the date of the loan, and –be able to choose to repay some or all of the loan before the due date for repayment. • The trustee of the scheme must hold the shares in trust for the employee until the loan is repaid and pay any dividends direct to the employee (must be treated as having been received by the employee). • The trustee is prohibited from applying the amount of any dividend to the repayment of a sum owing to the company or to the trustee and the employee is prohibited from charging or disposing of their rights or interests in the shares. • A trustee may vary the terms of the repayment of a loan under the scheme or allow the employee, if they agree, to withdraw from the scheme as if they had ended their employment. The trustee must be satisfied the employee's continued participation in the scheme has resulted or would result in serious hardship. • An employee can withdraw from the scheme by giving 3 months' notice to the trustee. The employee is to be treated, for the purposes of the scheme, as if they ended their employment with the company on the date the notice takes effect Company provides low-interest loans Current account - debit balances FBT is payable on the difference between the prescribed rate of interest calculated on a daily basis on the amount overdrawn, and the actual interest charged and debited to the account. Where a shareholder-employee is allocated further income after the end of the income year, that income is deemed to have been credited to the current account. This is done on the later of • the 1st day of that income year, or • the day the balance of the current account first became overdrawn during that income year. If your company files income year returns, you will have to work out the interest on the current account and pay any FBT by the due date. However, if your company has already filed quarterly returns, you must work out the correct interest and FBT payable on the current accounts for each quarter in the year. You may have to amend filed returns. Late payment penalties, interest or shortfall penalties may be imposed on any extra FBT owing. Expense accounts If you provide employees with interest-free expense accounts that can be used to purchase goods and services for private use, FBT is payable on interest calculated on a daily basis at the prescribed rate on the account's debit balance. FBT is not payable if the employer charges interest to the expense account on a daily basis at the prescribed rate. Loans to life insurance policy holders Where the holder of a life insurance policy in New Zealand receives a loan from the life insurer, FBT is payable as though the life insurer was the employer of the policy holder, and the loan was an employment-related loan. This also applies if the loan is offered to an associated person of the policy holder. FBT is payable on any difference between the interest rate charged to the policy holder (or associated person) and the prescribed rate of interest. However, if the rate of interest on the loan given to the policy holder is exactly the same as that on loans available to the general public, no FBT is payable. Note Under the alternate rate option, loans by life insurers to life insurance policy holders are classified as pooled fringe benefits and are taxed at 49.25%. 23 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Loans with non-reviewable interest rates These are loans made before 1 April 1985, with a non-reviewable interest rate when granted. The taxable value of the fringe benefit is the difference between the interest calculated on the daily balance of the loan for the quarter or income year using the non-concessionary rate of interest. This applies for the year the loan agreement was signed in, and the interest actually charged on that loan for the quarter or income year. Loans owing to life insurers - non-attributed benefits Under the alternate rate option employment related loans provided by life insurers to their policy holding employees, do not need to be attributed. Income and annual year returns If you complete income or annual year returns you must calculate the interest for each quarter and add the 4 taxable values together to get the total for the year. If you file income year returns, the standard quarters may not match your own financial year. You must still calculate the interest on the daily balance of the loan, using the prescribed rate applying on each day. This means that some income years will span 5 different standard quarters, and some prescribed rates will only apply to 1 or 2 months of the income year. Taxable value of the fringe benefit Loans with reviewable interest rates and all loans made on or after 1 April 1985 The taxable value of the fringe benefit is • the difference between the interest calculated on the daily balance of the loan for the quarter or income year, using the prescribed rate for that period, and • the interest actually charged on that loan for the quarter or income year. Example Taxable value of the fringe benefit Sarah received a $12,000 loan from Audis on Anglesey Ltd to buy a used boat. Calculation of interest at prescribed rate (quarter ended 30 September 2024) Loan balance at beginning of quarter $ 12,000.00 Repayment at mid-point of quarter $ 400.00 Balance at end of quarter $ 11,600.00 Prescribed rate of interest (46 days x 8.41%) x ($12,000 ÷ 365) $ 127.19 (46 days × 8.41%) × ($11,600 ÷ 365) $ 122.95 Total interest at prescribed rate $ 250.13 (enter this in column 8 of the IR427) Calculation of actual interest charged The loan agreement between Sarah and Audis on Anglesey Ltd states that interest is charged at a rate of 2%. Loan balance at beginning of quarter $ 12,000.00 Repayment made on day 46 of quarter $ 400.00 Balance at end of quarter $ 11,600.00 Loan agreement interest rate (46 × 2%) × ($12,000 ÷ 365) $ 30.25 (46 × 2%) × ($11,600 ÷ 365) $ 29.24 Total prescribed rate of interest $ 59.49 (enter this in column 9 of the IR427) 24 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Quarter 4 Low interest loans List your employees' names in the same order for all your calculation sheets.

Record keeping In most cases, your existing records will provide enough information to work out the value of the fringe benefit for loans. Check the following notes to see if you need to keep any extra records. Accrued interest If you do not calculate the accrued interest each quarter, you must change your accounting procedures, so interest is recorded quarterly for F B T. Daily balance of the loan You must work out the interest on the daily balance of the loan using the prescribed rate of interest. To work out the daily balance you need: • the loan balance at the beginning of the quarter • all repayments or reductions to the loan and the dates • interest and other charges incurred and the dates. Non-reviewable interest rates If a loan is subject to a non-reviewable rate of interest, you must retain a copy of the original loan agreement. This should show: • the interest rate payable • a clause stating the rate is not reviewable • the date the agreement was signed.

If you choose to attribute any fringe benefits in a category, even if the total amount of the benefits is less than $1,000 per employee, all these benefits must be attributed. Note Non-attributed benefits are taxed at 49.25% or 63.93% depending on the circumstances. If you're choosing the alternate rate option and attributing benefits, keep records to identify the benefits attributed and non-attributed on a quarterly basis. This will save you time at the end of the year when you complete your final or quarter 4 return. At the end of the year make sure the total annual non-attributed benefits in this category for each employee is less than $1,000. If an employee's total benefits are more than $1,000 you must attribute the benefits to them. Part 6 - Employer contributions to funds, insurance and superannuation schemes FBT is payable on any contributions you make for your employees to any of the following: • sickness, accident or death benefit funds • funeral trusts • insurance fund of a friendly society, life, pension, personal accident or sickness policies • superannuation schemes where ESCT (employer superannuation contribution tax) does not apply. ESCT must be deducted from any specified superannuation contribution to a superannuation fund you make for the employee's benefit. If an employee asks you to make deductions from their wages and pay them to a superannuation scheme, these are not specified superannuation contributions. If you're not sure if ESCT applies to your superannuation scheme, call your scheme provider, or call us on 0800 377 772. Life insurance contributions If an employee or a family member takes out an insurance policy and the premiums are paid by the employer, the payments are taxable income in the hands of the employee. You do not pay FBT on these contributions. If you take out an insurance policy for an employee and pay the premiums, you will have to pay FBT on those premiums. However, if you, not the employee, benefits from the policy, for example, key person insurance, no FBT is payable as there is no employee benefit and the payments are not taxable in the hands of the employee Discounted life insurance for agents When life insurance agents receive discounted premiums on their own or family policies, the discounted premiums are fringe benefits. As the employer, the life insurer is liable for the FBT. For FBT purposes the self- employed commission agent is an employee as the commissions paid to them are schedular payments. Taxable value of fringe benefit The taxable value of the fringe benefit is the total premium you contributed or paid. These are calculated on a GST-inclusive basis, unless the goods and services being provided are exempt from GST. 26 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Contributions to schemes List your employees' names in the same order for all your calculation sheets. Column 1 The employee's name, or non-attributed. Column 2 The name and a description of the fund. Include the number of employees who received the non-attributed benefit. Column 3 The total amount you contributed over the period. Box E Add up the amounts in column 3 and enter the total in box E. This is your total taxable value for contributions to funds, insurance, health insurance and superannuation schemes. Copy the total from box E on page 4 to box E on page 1 of the calculation sheet. Record keeping For contributions to superannuation schemes, you need to keep: • a copy of your approval letter received from the Financial Markets Authority stating the type of superannuation scheme and the date of approval • a list of the employees in the scheme • a list of the amounts contributed for each employee. For sickness, accident or death benefit funds, your records must include: • approval from Inland Revenue • the names of the employees in the fund • amounts contributed for each employee. You must keep the following records for each life, pension, funeral, personal accident and sickness insurance policy: • the type of policy and the date it was taken out • a list of the employees covered by the policy • the premium amount paid for each employee. FBT taxable value calculation sheet - quarterly - IR427 Quarter 4 Non-attributed Audis on Anglesey Ltd - staff accident fund - 10 employees - half-yearly premiums 4,500 00 4,500 00 27 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Part 7 - Completing FBT returns The following information uses the current FBT rates. In this part we'll explain how to complete your: • quarters 1 to 3 returns • quarter 4, annual and income year returns. The alternate rate calculation lets you choose the way you calculate FBT payable, based on the earnings paid by you to your individual employees. In quarters 1 to 3 you'll need to choose whether you'll pay FBT at the alternate rate of 49.25% or at the single rate of 63.93%. If you choose the alternate rate in any of quarters 1 to 3 you must complete your quarter 4 return using 1 of the following: • full alternate rate calculation • short form option, or • pooled option. The short form option applies the flat rate of 63.93% to all attributed benefits and 49.25% (or 63.93% for major shareholder- employees) to all non-attributed benefits. The pooled option applies a flat rate of either 49.25% or 63.93% to attributed benefits (depending on the employee’s pay and the value of benefits attributed to them during the year) and 49.25% (or 63.93% for major shareholder-employees) to all non-attributed benefits. If you choose the single rate in the 1st 3 quarters, you can either complete the alternate rate calculation in quarter 4 or pay FBT at 63.93% Choosing a rate You need to consider your situation when deciding the rate you're going to apply to the fringe benefits you provided. In deciding the rates to use, consider: • the additional time and possible set-up costs to complete the alternate rate calculations • the impact of non-attributed benefits (if your company provides several non-attributed benefits you should consider using the alternate rate calculation process) • the amount your employees earn annually (consider using the single rate or the short form alternate rate for employees who earn over $180,000; or the full alternate rate calculation for employees who earn less than $180,000). Completing FBT quarterly return - IR420 for quarters 1 to 3 The return periods for quarters 1 to 3 are: Quarter 1 June 1 April to 30 June Quarter 2 September 1 July to 30 September Quarter 3 December 1 October to 31 December Taxable benefits - section A Copy the total from the FBT taxable value calculation sheet to your return. If you have not provided any fringe benefits, enter 0.00 in box 3. Rate of FBT - section B In box 4 on the return tick your choice of tax rate. There are 2 options: 1. Pay FBT at 63.93% of the taxable value of the benefits provided. If you choose this rate in all 4 quarters, you do not need to do a quarter 4 alternate rate calculation. You can still choose to do an alternate rate calculation in quarter 4. 2. Pay FBT at 49.25% of the taxable value of the benefits provided. In quarter 4 you'll need to do an alternate rate calculation or the short form option. Note The alternate rate calculation is only an option for a final FBT return if you have stopped employing staff or stopped providing fringe benefits or in quarter 4. Calculate FBT, GST and tax to pay - section D Calculate the FBT to pay using your chosen FBT rate. Enter the amount in box 6. Steps to calculate the GST on fringe benefits: 1. Take the total from box 3. 2. Subtract the value of any benefits exempt or zero-rated supplies for GST. The most common examples are: • low-interest loans • other financial services • international travel • contributions to employee superannuation and life insurance policies. The result is fringe benefits liable for GST. 3. Multiply the result from step 2 by 3 and divide by 23. This is the GST amount to include in box 7. Add box 6 and 7 and enter the tax to pay in box 8 on the return form.

If you chose the single rate in each of the 3 previous quarters you can either: • pay FBT at 63.93%, or • complete the alternate rate calculations in the quarter 4 using either the full or short form calculation. If you chose the alternate rate in any of the 3 previous quarters, you must complete the alternate rate calculations in quarter 4 using either the full or short form calculation.. Annual and income year returns If you're completing annual or income year returns you may choose from the following options: 1. Pay FBT at 63.93% of the taxable value of the benefits provided. 2. Complete the alternate rate calculations using either the full or short form calculation. If you permanently stop employing staff If you've permanently stopped paying wages, call us on 0800 377 772 to let us know, even if your business is still going. Your final FBT return when you stop employing staff, and providing fringe benefits If this is your final FBT return, and you do not intend to employ any more staff in the same income year, complete sections A, C and D in the quarter you stopped employing (quarterly filers only). Where you’re asked to indicate if the return is for quarter 4 on the IR420 there’s no need to tick either box. You can cancel your FBT registration in myIR. Go to the FBT account, select ‘more’ then ‘cancel account’ or you can send us a message from myIR. If you are filing paper returns please write ‘final return’ next to the boxes. Note If you’re still providing fringe benefits to former employees, you must continue to pay FBT on these benefits. Options for completing your final return You can complete your final return using 1 of the following options: • the single rate of 63.93% - available only if you've used the single rate in all other quarterly returns from 1 April • the full alternate rate calculation process • pooled alternate rate calculation • the short form alternate rate calculation process. Note Where the alternate rate option is elected outside of quarter 4, we may contact you to confirm this is your final FBT return. Extended due date for final return If you're filing your final FBT return in quarters 1, 2 or 3, your due date is extended to the end of 2 months immediately following the end of the quarter you stop employing. If you file paper returns, the due date will show the original return due date.

If you are not intending to provide fringe benefits in the future, you need to let us know, call us on 0800 377 772 or send us a message in myIR, during quarter 4. The change takes effect from the beginning of the next tax year (1 April). Shareholder-employee remuneration or attributed income not known in quarter 4 You can apply either the 49.25% or 63.93% FBT rate to the value of the attributed benefits in your quarter 4 return. If you use the 49.25% rate, you must complete the alternate rate calculation in next year's return. If you use 63.93%, you do not need to do any further calculations in the next year. To calculate FBT payable for shareholder-employees or persons receiving attributed income, where the remuneration details are not known, the fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration (FBICR) is the annual amount of the attributed fringe benefit provided. The 49.25% or 63.93% FBT rate is applied to this amount. If you use the 49.25%, keep the following information for your next year's FBT calculation payable for each shareholder-employee and person receiving attributed income: • total attributed benefits provided for the year • the amount of FBT payable for the year on the taxable value of those attributed benefits. 31 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Remuneration adjustment Our remuneration adjustment worksheet (see page 38) may help when you need to make a remuneration adjustment. This adjustment is required when: • full remuneration or attributed income details for the shareholder- employees (or those receiving attributed income) were not known at the time of completing last year's quarter 4 or annual return, and • you elected the 49.25% rate. Attributed and non-attributed benefits Attributing fringe benefits You must attribute the fringe benefits to individual employees receiving them if you have chosen the alternate rate calculation. This table shows the rules applying to the different categories of benefits. Benefit categoryThresholdAttributedNon-attributed Motor vehicles-AttributedPooled vehicles - if the motor vehicle has been made available to more than 1 employee, and you cannot determine the main employee receiving the benefit, treat it as a non-attributed benefit. Low-interest loans-AttributedLoans by life insurers to life insurance policy holders are classified as pooled fringe benefits and are treated as a non-attributed benefit. Subsidised transport$1,000Attributed when the annual taxable value is $1,000 or more per employee. Non-attributed if the annual taxable value is less than $1,000 per employee.\* Exception: May be pooled (non-attributed) if all employees have the same or similar entitlement to the benefit. Employer contributions to sickness, accident, death funds or funeral trusts $1,000Attributed if the annual taxable value is $1,000 or more per employee. Non-attributed if the annual taxable value is less than $1,000 per employee.\* Employer contributions life insurance, pension insurance, personal accident or sickness insurance policy or insurance funds of friendly societies $1,000Attributed if the annual taxable value is $1,000 or more per employee. Non-attributed if the annual taxable value is less than $1,000 per employee.\* Employer contributions to any superannuation scheme where Employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) does not apply $1,000Attributed if the annual taxable value is $1,000 or more per employee. Non-attributed if the annual taxable value is less than $1,000 per employee.\* Any other benefit of any kind (such as gifts, prizes and discounted goods and services) $2,000Attributed if the annual taxable value is $2,000 or more per employee.† Non-attributed if the annual taxable value is less than $2,000 per employee.\* \* Employers can choose to attribute all benefits within a category regardless of the category thresholds. † This is the total value of all types of benefits provided to an employee within this category. You can choose to attribute benefits when the total value of a benefit, within a category for an employee is below the stated threshold. However, if you choose to do this for 1 employee within a category, you must attribute all benefits in that category to all employees receiving them. Non-attributed benefits The rate of 49.25% applies to pooled or shared fringe benefits not attributed to an individual employee (such as a motor vehicle where no 1 employee has principal use of that vehicle). The 63.93% rate applies if a major shareholder-employee, or their associated person (where the fringe benefit is not received as an employee), is 1 of the recipients of the non-attributed benefit. A major shareholder-employee is a person who owns or controls or has the right to acquire 10% or more of the ordinary shares, voting rights or control of a close company and is also an employee of that company. You may create 2 pools and allocate non-attributed benefits to each pool according to whether a recipient of the benefit is a major shareholder- employee or their associated person. 32 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Treatment of non-attributed benefits Non-attributed benefits provided to employees, including major shareholder-employees who can be individually identified are taxed at: • 49.25% for non-attributed benefits provided to ordinary employees • 63.93% for non-attributed benefits provided to major shareholder-employees. Example DSC Ltd pays the annual gym membership of $750 each for 5 specified employees and 1 major shareholder-employee. DSC Ltd pays FBT as follows: 5 × $750 = $3,750 @ 49.25% 1 × $750 = $750 @ 63.93% If a major shareholder-employee is 1 of the recipients of non-attributed benefits that cannot be assigned, all non-attributed benefits provided against this category are taxed at a rate of 63.93%. Note In quarter 4, check the non-attributed benefits to make sure the annual taxable value of employee benefits in a category is less than the thresholds (see the table for attributing fringe benefits) on page 31. The following table has 3 examples showing how to apply the rules when attributing and non-attributing benefits. Key: (A) attributed benefit (N) non-attributed benefit Benefit categoryThreshold Example 1 Employer 1 chooses to attribute only those benefits more than the category thresholds Example 2 Employer 2 chooses to attribute all benefits Example 3 Employer 3 chooses to attribute all benefits except any other benefit of any other kind † Motor vehicles-Employee A $4,000 (A)\* Employee B - Employee C - Employee A $4,000 (A)\* Employee B - Employee C $6,200 (A)\* Employee A - Employee B $4,500 (A)\* Employee C $8,600 (A)\* Low-interest loans-Employee A - Employee B - Employee C - Employee A - Employee B - Employee C - Employee A $3,000 (A) Employee B - Employee C $5,000 (A) Subsidised transport$1,000Employee A - Employee B - Employee C - Employee A - Employee B - Employee C - Employee A - Employee B - Employee C - Employer contributions to sickness, accident, death funds or funeral trusts $1,000Employee A $1,800 (A)\*\* Employee B $500 (N) Employee C $500 (N) Employee A - Employee B - Employee C - Employee A $1,500 (A) Employee B $600 (A) Employee C $950 (A) Employer contributions to specified insurance funds of friendly societies $1,000Employee A - Employee B - Employee C - Employee A $750 (A) Employee B $750 (A) Employee C $750 (A) Employee A - Employee B - Employee C - Employer contributions to any superannuation scheme (where ESCT does not apply) $1,000Employee A - Employee B - Employee C - Employee A - Employee B - Employee C - Employee A $1,100 (A) Employee B $2,000 (A) Employee C $850 (A) Any other benefit of any kind (such as gifts, prizes and discounted goods and services) $2,000Employee A $1,000 (N) Employee B $550 (N) Employee C $700 (N) Employee A $300 (A) Employee B $1,500 (A) Employee C $2,500 (A) Employee A $2,500 (A) Employee B $150 (N) Employee C $120 (N) Employer has chosen not to attribute benefits under the threshold † If you choose to attribute 1 employee’s benefit in a category and it’s under the threshold, every other benefit in that category must be attributed to the employee who received it. Example 2 ‘Any other benefit of any kind’, shows the $300 benefit has been attributed, so all the benefits in this category must be attributed. Example 3 is an example where the employer has chosen to voluntarily attribute all benefits within all the categories except for ‘Any other benefit of any kind’. In this category only those benefits received by ‘Employee A’ are required to be attributed as they exceed $2,000 in value. \* Principal usage \*\* More than the threshold of $1,000 33 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE ird.govt.nz FBT alternate rate calculation sheet – quarterly returns IR417 July 2024 \* FBT rate for pooled vehicles and non-attributed benefits •49.25% from 2021 income year •42.86% for all years before 2021 income year.

If you stopped providing fringe benefits in quarter 1 use the rates in table 2. The following examples use the FBT rate for the year ending 31 March 2025. • FBT alternate rate calculation sheet - quarterly returns - IR417 • FBT alternate rate calculation sheet - income year return - IR418 • FBT alternate rate calculation sheet - annual return - IR419 Column 1 - Employee's name or non-attributed benefits Note The alternate rate calculator works out your FBT and you can print or save the result schedule to keep with your FBT records. If you use our alternate rate calculator you do not need to complete the alternate rate calculation sheet. Go to ird.govt.nz/alternate-rate-calculator In column 1, enter the names of all employees you attributed benefits to during the year. If you supply several benefits to your employees, you only need to enter the employee’s name once. This information is on the FBT taxable value calculation sheets for each of the 4 quarters. If you have not already identified attributed benefits this will be your 1st step in completing the alternate rate calculation. If the benefits provided were any pooled vehicles or non-attributed benefits, enter this as a separate heading after all the employees who received attributed benefits in column 1. Use a separate line for non-attributed benefits to major shareholder- employees. If you provide benefits to shareholder-employees make sure you tick the box on the quarterly IR417 beside the shareholder- employee’s name. Note You do not need to complete columns 2 to 4 for non-attributed benefits as they are taxed at flat FBT rates. Column 2 - Employee's income (cash remuneration) In column 2, enter the total cash remuneration paid to each employee for the year ended 31 March. For major shareholder-employees, also include all interest and dividend payments received from you for the year. Show this amount as whole dollars. This will be zero for non-attributed benefits. Column 3 - Tax on employee’s income Income thresholds have changed from 31 July 2024. Use the amounts and rates in Tax on income threshold table 1 if you are filing your: • quarter 4 return • income or annual year return • a final return for quarters 2, 3 or 4 If you’re filing a final quarter 1 return use the rates in table 2. Tax on income threshold table 1 Income thresholds Accumulative income tax brackets Income tax rate $0 - $14,000 $1,470.0010.50% $14,001 - $15,600 $1,675.1212.82% $15,601 - $48,000 $7,345.1217.50% $48,001 - $53,500 $8,535.3221.64% $53,501 - $70,000 $13,485.3230.00% $70,001 - $78,100 $15,995.5130.99% $78,101 - $180,000 $49,622.5133.00% $180,001 upwards 39.00% Example Employee's gross salary or wages income is $78,333 $78,333 - $78100 = $233 Tax on $78,100 $15,995.51 Plus tax on $233 x 33% $ 76.89 Tax on employee's income $16,072.40 Tax on income threshold table 2 Income thresholds Accumulative income tax brackets Income tax rate $0 - $14,000 $1,470.0010.50% $14,001 - $48,000 $7,420.0017.50% $48,001 - $70,000 $14,020.0030.00% $70,001 - $180,000 $50,320.0033.00% $180,001 upwards39.00% 35 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Column 4 - Net income For each employee, subtract the tax on employee’s income (amount in column 3) from the employee’s income amount in column 2. This is the employee’s net income. Enter this total in column 4. Example Based on table 1 Employee's income $78,333.00 Less tax on employee's income $16,072.40 Net income $62,260.60 Column 5 - Fringe benefit total taxable value Note The fringe benefit total taxable value is the amount of benefit provided to your employee, not the amount of FBT you have paid from your quarterly FBT returns during the year. Quarterly filers Complete each quarter in column 5 for the employee, shareholder- employee or person receiving attributed income. Add the amounts from the 4 quarters. This is the total benefit. Example Employee's fringe benefit amounts for each quarter Quarter 1 $1,272.00 Quarter 2 $1,272.00 Quarter 3 $1,177.00 Quarter 4 $1,272.00 Total benefit $4,993.00 For non-attributed benefits, refer to the IR427 FBT taxable value calculation sheets. Enter non-attributed benefits and pooled benefits (such as motor vehicles) in column 5 for each quarter. Income and annual year filers For income year filers, transfer the amount from box E of your IR428 (FBT taxable value calculation sheet – income year). For annual year filers, transfer the amount from box E of your IR429 (FBT taxable value calculation sheet – annual year). The combined total from all employees should be the same as the taxable value shown on box 3 of your IR421 (income year) or IR422 (annual year) FBT return. Note You do not need to attribute certain benefits if they are under the threshold for their category. Column 6 - Fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration (FBICR) For each employee add the total fringe benefit to the net income from column 4 and enter the amount in whole dollars in column 6. For employees this is the FBICR. Example Total benefit amount $ 4,993.00 Employee's net income $62,260.60 FBICR $67,253.60 For shareholder-employees or persons receiving attributed income, where all their remuneration is not known at the time of completing this return, the FBICR is the annual total of attributed benefits provided to the individual shareholder-employee or person receiving attributed income. Column 7 – Tax on FBICR Use the fringe benefits tax rates in table 3 to work out the amount of tax on the employee’s fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration. Fringe benefit tax rates table 3 Fringe benefit inclusive cash remuneration Accumulative FBT brackets FBT tax rate $0 - $12,530  $1,469.76 11.73% $12,531 - $40,580  $7,419.16 21.21% $40,581 - $55,980  $14,019.60 42.86% $55,981 - $129,680  $50,316.85 49.25% $129,681 upwards63.93% Example Employee's FBICR amount $67,253 (whole dollars) $67,253 - $55,980 = $11,273 Tax on $55,980 $14,019.60 Plus tax on $11,273 x 49.25% $ 5,551.95 Tax on FBICR $$19,571.55 Column 8 - FBT on net income Calculate the tax on employee’s net income from column 4 using FBICR rates in table 3.

The rate of 63.93% applies to major shareholder- employees. Employers providing non-attributed benefits can have 2 pools for benefits provided for: • major shareholder-employees or associates • ordinary employees Column 7 and 8 - remuneration not known This step does not have to be completed for shareholder-employees or persons receiving attributed income, where their remuneration is not known at the time of completing this return. In this column enter the rate of FBT being applied to these benefits, either 49.25% or 63.93% Column 9 - FBT payable for the year Column 9 is the annual amount of FBT payable for attributed and non- attributed benefits. Attributed benefits To calculate the amount of FBT payable in a year for each employee on their attributed benefits, take the total from column 6 (tax on FBICR) and subtract the total in column 8 tax on net income (see above example). The FBT rate applies to the combined total of all attributed fringe benefits provided to a shareholder-employee or a person receiving attributed income. Income not known at time of filing Where the income for a shareholder-employee or person receiving attributed income is not known at the time of completing the FBT return, you can use either 49.25% or 63.25%. Multiply the total fringe benefit amount (column 5) by chosen rate and enter the value in column 9. Make a note of the rate you used. Non-attributed benefits The rate of 49.25% applies to pooled fringe benefits not attributed to an individual employee. The 63.93% rate applies to non-attributed benefits where 1 or more of the recipients is a major shareholder-employee or an associate of a major shareholder-employee. Calculate the FBT payable for the year by multiplying your total in column 5 by the applicable rate and enter the amount in column 9. Make a note of the rate used. Box A - Total FBT to pay Add up column 9 and enter the total in box A. • If you’re a quarterly filer, box A is your FBT payable for the year. Continue to box B. • If you file income or annual year returns, box A is your FBT payable. Copy this amount to box 5 of your return (IR421 income year or IR422 annual year). Note If full remuneration or attributed income details for shareholder- employees were not know at the time of completing last year’s annual or quarter 4 return and you used the 49.25% rate, copy this amount to the remuneration adjustment worksheet on page 39. See the example on page 38. Box B - FBT assessed in quarters 1 to 3 (quarterly filers only) In box B, enter the total amount of FBT assessed in quarters 1 to 3 (June, September, December - box 8 of your IR420 FBT return, tax to pay or refund). Box C - Total FBT to pay or refund due (quarterly filers only) In box C, enter the difference between box A and box B. This amount is the quarter 4 FBT payable or refundable. Tick whether a payment or refund is due. This is the amount to copy to box 6 on your quarter 4 FBT return. If full remuneration or attributed income details for shareholder-employees were not known at the time of completing last year’s income year or quarter 4 return and you used the 49.25% rate, copy this amount to the remuneration adjustment sheet (page 39). Putting it all together Example For quarter 4 - 1 January 2025 to 31 March 2025 Mary the office manager from Audis on Anglessey Ltd has chosen the full alternate rate option for quarter 4. Each employee is added to the IR417 FBT alternate rate calculation sheet. This is the calculation for Zac. Mary looks up Zac’s annual wage income from her wage records and enters this in column 2 and calculates the amount of tax payable for the year: 2 Zac’s employee income $178,500.00 Calculate tax on employee’s income (using table 1) $178,500 - $78,100 = $100,400 (amount over threshold) Tax on $78,100 $15,995.51 Tax on $100,400 x 33.00% $33,132.00 3 Tax on employee’s income $ 49,127.51 4 Net income (step 2 minus step 3) $129,372.49 5 Add total fringe benefits for the year $ 14,980.00 6 FBICR (step 4 plus step 5) $144,352.49 Calculate tax on FBICR (step 6 using FBT rates in table 3) $144,352 - $129,680 = $14,672.49 (amount over threshold) Tax on $129,680 $50,316.85 Tax on $14,672 x 63.93% $ 9,379.80 7 Tax on FBICR $59,696.65 Calculate tax on net income (step 4 using FBT rates in table 3) $129,372 - $55,980 = $73,392 (amount over threshold) Tax on $55,980 $14,019.60 Tax on $73,392 x 49.25% $36,145.56 8 Tax on net income $50,165.16 FBT payable (step 7 minus step 8) 9 $59,696.65 - $50,165.16 = $9,531.49 37 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Completing calculations – shareholder-employees or persons receiving attributed income If you have the remuneration details for shareholder-employees and/ or other persons receiving attributed income, you can complete your calculations for your quarter 4 return. If remuneration details are not known, complete the return using either the 63.93% or 49.25% FBT rate. Using the flat rate of 63.93% If you choose this option, you pay FBT of 63.93% on all benefits provided during the year, for employees, shareholder-employees and any other person receiving attributed income. The 63.93% rate is a full and final calculation, this means you cannot make any adjustment later Example Sue is a shareholder employee of DSC Limited. Sue’s remuneration details are not known when the company completes their quarter 4 return. DSC Limited uses the flat rate of 63.93%, as Sue’s cash remuneration for the year is likely to be more than $180,000. The taxable value of Sue’s attributed benefits is $6,989. $6,989 x 63.93% = $4,468.06 DSC Limited enters $4,468.06 in column 9 of the FBT alternate rate calculation sheet. They do not need to make any adjustment in next year’s FBT return. Using the flat rate of 49.25% You can use 49.25% rate for employees, shareholder-employees and any other person receiving attributed income in the year, where the remuneration details are not known. If you choose this option, you will need to adjust the FBT payable on the actual remuneration received when this is confirmed. The adjustment is made when you complete the next year’s quarter 4, income or annual year return. Example John is a shareholder employee of XYZ Limited. John’s remuneration details were not known when XYZ Limited completed their quarter 4 return. XYZ Ltd used the flat rate of 49.25% to calculate the FBT to pay. The taxable value of John’s attributed benefits for the year was $14,980.00 Quarter 4 for last year: $14,980 x 49.25% $7,377.65 Less FBT paid in quarters 1, 2 and 3 $4,064.92 FBT to pay in quarter 4 $3,312.73 Example The next year XYZ Limited completes the alternate rate calculation to adjust the FBT payable on John’s actual remuneration for last year. FBT adjustment in next year’s quarter 4 return John’s total cash remuneration for last year $178,500.00 FBT on attributed benefits from last year\* $9,531.49 Less FBT payable in last year $7,377.65 FBT adjustment required for quarter 4 $2,153.84 XYZ Limited adds $2,153.84 to the total amount payable for the quarter 4 return to adjust for the FBT last year \* See example page 38 for actual calculations.

Attributed benefits For benefits attributed to an employee use the flat rate of either 49.25% or 63.93%, depending on your employee’s pay and the value of benefits attributed to them. • For benefits attributed to employees who earn up to $160,000 in gross equivalent pay, and up to $13,400 each in attributed benefits for the year, use 49.25% flat rate. • Benefits attributed to employees earning more than $160,000 gross equivalent pay or more than $13,400 each in attributed benefits for the year, use the 63.93% rate. • If you have an employee receiving more than $13,400 in attributed benefits but their all-inclusive pay is less than $129,681, you can use the 49.25% rate for those employees. If you have some employees with all-inclusive pay below $129,681 and some whose pay is $129,681 or more, 2 pools for attributed benefits may be required for 49.25% and 63.93% rates to be used. 41 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Non-attributed benefits All non-attributed benefits use either the flat rate of 49.25% or 63.93% if you have 1 or more major shareholder-employee recipients. You can use 2 pools for non-attributed benefits if you use 63.93% for just your major shareholder employees and want to use 49.25% for everyone else. Completing your alternate rate calculation for pooled benefits If you have both attributed and non-attributed pooled benefits, complete your alternate rate calculations as follows: Column 1 – enter a separate line for each pool you need to use: • Attributed benefits pool - 49.25% • Attributed benefits pool - 63.93% • Non-attributed benefits pool - 49.25% • Non-attributed benefits pool - 63.93% • Pooled vehicles - 49.25% Note Tick the box if you provide attributed or non-attributed benefits to any shareholder-employees in the 63.93% pools. Columns 2 to 9 and box A, B and C Follow the instructions from column 2, listed on page 34, to complete the rest of your calculations. Note If full remuneration or attributed income details for shareholder- employees were not known at the time of completing last year’s annual or quarter 4 return and you used the 49.25% rate, copy this amount to the remuneration adjustment worksheet on page 39. See the example on page 38. Example SLS Limited files quarterly FBT returns using the pooled method for attributed benefits. • SLS Limited provide a subsidised transport fringe benefit totalling $5,000 each quarter to all their employees ($20,000 for the year). • No employee receives more than $1,000 in attributed benefits. • There are no non-attributed benefits provided • There are no shareholder-employees. SLS Limited used the pooled alternate rate option of 49.25% for all employees during the first 3 quarters of the year as they expected all their employees’ salaries to be below the $160,000. In the last quarter 1 of their employee’s (Ben) got a $15,000 bonus, increasing his total salary to $175,000. Because Ben’s salary is more than $160,000 for the year, his attributed benefit must be taxed using 63.93%. SLS Limited must do an alternate rate calculation for quarter 4. Example SLS Limited chose to use 49.25% for quarters 1, 2 and 3 for all their employees. They have already included $15,000 of attributed benefits using 49.25% ($5,000 each quarter) and paid FBT totalling $7,387.50. Because Ben’s salary is over $160,000 they calculate the FBT payable in quarter 4 as follows: Column 1 Attributed benefit pool – 49.25% Attributed benefit pool – 63.25% Column 5 – Fringe benefit total taxable value 49.25% 63.93% Quarter 1 $5,000 0 Quarter 2 $5,000 0 Quarter 3 $5,000 0 Quarter 4 $4,000 $1,000 Total fringe benefit $19,000 $1,000 Column 7 - Tax on FBICR Enter the rate used for each pool line (49.25% or 63.93%) Column 9 – FBT payable $19,000 x 49.25% $9,357.50 $1,000 x 63.93% $639.30 Box A $9,357.50 + $639.30 = $9,996.80 Box B – FBT already paid in quarters 1 to 3 $7,387.50 Box C – FBT to pay for quarter 4 $2,609.30 SLS Limited transfer $2,609.30 to box 6 of their quarter 4 FBT return and pay the amount due. 42 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE FBT to pay File your FBT returns in myIR by the due date, or if you’re filing paper returns send your return and payment to us by the date shown on the return. If this is a weekend or public holiday, you have until the next working day to pay. How to make payments You can make payments by: • direct debit in myIR • credit or debit card at ird.govt.nz/pay • internet banking. Most New Zealand banks have a pay tax option. When making a payment, include: • your IRD number • the account type you are paying • the period the payment relates to. For all our payment options, go to ird.govt.nz/pay Late payment If you do not pay a bill on time, you may have to pay penalties and interest. Contact us if you are not able to pay on time. We'll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement. Find out more at ird.govt.nz/penalties For more help See our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. Nil return You must still send your return to us, even if it works out to be nil - no FBT to pay. Correcting errors in your fringe benefit tax return You can correct fringe benefit errors in myIR if: • you made 1 or more errors, and • the difference in the total fringe benefit tax to pay is $1,000 or less. You will need to ask us to amend your FBT return if any of the following apply: • the difference in the total FBT to pay is above $1,000 • we told you that you could not deduct the expense in the earlier period • we’re investigating the return. You can send us a message in myIR with the following details: • the return period you made the mistake in • the FBT amount to be changed and the correct figures • the type of mistake and why the change is needed. Record keeping You must record these details in your FBT paperwork and make the information available to us if we ask for it: • what FBT return period the error occurred in • the FBT amount changed and corrected amount • the type of error • the FBT return period you made the correction in 43 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Box 5 - GST return If an employee makes a payment direct to the employer towards a fringe benefit, this is a separate supply and is subject to GST. Include this payment as income in Box 5 of the GST return. The time of supply is the same as for any other sale by the business. The payment is also taxable income for income tax purposes. No adjustment is required when the employee's contributions consist of their paying for an expense item, such as petrol. The employer cannot claim the GST paid on the expense and must keep the invoice or receipt on the FBT file. Example An employee has paid $100 in cash direct to the employer. The $100 should be added to the sales in Box 5 of the GST return. The GST to pay on the $100 is $13.04. Income tax Some employee payments and provisions may seem to be fringe benefits, but they are not. Entertainment The following are specified types of entertainment for income tax purposes when provided by an employer to employees: • corporate boxes and similar exclusive areas at sporting and recreational events • holiday accommodation • pleasure craft • food and beverage These items qualify as fringe benefits only if: • the employee can choose when to enjoy the benefit, or • they are enjoyed or consumed outside of New Zealand, and • they are not consumed or enjoyed in the course of, or as a necessary consequence of, employment. Remuneration This includes normal salaries and wages and items such as travel allowances, free board and lodgings and non-taxable allowances. GST If you're registered for both GST and FBT you may have to make an adjustment for GST in your FBT returns for any fringe benefits you have provided. For example, a company might provide an employee with a motor vehicle for private use. This fringe benefit is a supply for GST purposes. Calculation Step 1: Take the total taxable value of all fringe benefits from Box 3 of your FBT return. This is the amount of the benefits, not the FBT itself. Step 2: Subtract the value of any benefits that are exempt or zero-rated supplies for GST. The most common examples are: • low-interest loans • other financial services • international travel • contributions to employee superannuation and life insurance policies. Step 3: Multiply the result from step 2 by 3 and divide by 23, including the cents. This is the GST to include in Box 7 of your FBT return or Box 6 if you're an annual or income year filer. Example Details from the 31 March quarterly FBT taxable value calculation sheet for Audis on Anglesey Ltd Motor vehicles $ 25,421.16 Low-interest loans $ 118.95 Accident insurance $ 4,500.00 Goods and services $ 500.00 Total benefits $ 30,540.11 Less low-interest loans $ 118.95 $ 30,421.16 Low interest loans are deducted as they are an exempt supply for GST. The GST to include in box 7 (or box 6 for income or annual return filers) is $30,421.16 x 3 ÷ 23 = $3,967.97. Part 8 - GST and income tax 44 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX GUIDE Need to speak with us?

You can complete the alternate rate calculations using either: • the Fringe benefit tax alternate rate calculator. This calculates FBT for one employee at a time, or • the Fringe benefit tax alternate rate calculation sheet. This calculates FBT for up to 10 employees at once. FRINGE BENEFIT TAX RETURN GUIDE 4 Options to consider Quarterly filers - fringe benefit options If you filed Fringe benefit tax quarterly - IR420 returns and paid FBT at the single rate of 63.93% in all of the last 3 quarters (periods ended 30 June, 30 September and 31 December), you have 3 choices in the fourth quarter (period ended 31 March). These are: • paying FBT at the 63.93% single rate. Record the benefits and complete your return as you've done in the 3 previous quarters. If you choose this option you must use this rate for all benefits provided during the year, • using the full alternate rate calculation, • using the short-form alternate rate calculation, or • using the pooled alternate rate option. If you paid FBT at the alternate rate of 49.25% in any of the first 3 quarters, you must use one of the alternate rate calculations in the fourth quarter. The following factors may help you when deciding which option best suits your business's circumstances: • If your employees receive fringe benefits and earn: - over $180,000 annually, you should consider using either the single rate or the short-form alternate rate calculation, or - under $180,000 annually, you should consider using the full alternate rate calculation. If your employees earn under $160,000 and each receive up to $13,400 in attributed benefits annually, you may also want to consider the pooled alternate rate calculation as an alternative. • The amount of non-attributed benefits provided. Under the alternate rate options, non-attributed benefits are taxed at 49.25% (or 63.93% in the case of major shareholder-employees). • The alternate rate process may require more extensive record keeping and calculations. 5 You can only use one option. You cannot use a combination of the single FBT rate and the alternate rate calculation options. Note Annual and income year filers If you complete an IR421 income year return, or an IR422 annual return, you can either pay FBT at the 63.93% rate or apply 1 of the alternate rate calculation options to the benefits you provided during the year. FRINGE BENEFIT TAX RETURN GUIDE 6 Completing your fourth quarter or yearly return Quarterly returns using the single FBT rate If you've chosen the single rate of 63.93%, complete this return as you normally would and indicate which option you've chosen. Please note, when you choose this option you're not required to attribute benefits to the individual employees receiving the benefits. Annual and income year filers using the 63.93% FBT rate If you've chosen the rate of 63.93%, show this option in Box 4 of your return. Using the alternate rate calculations To complete the alternate rate calculation process, you’ll need quarters 1 to 3 FBT returns (for quarterly filers only). You will also need your completed: • FBT taxable value calculation sheets for quarterly filers (quarters 1 to 4) IR427 • IR428 for income year filers, or • IR429 for annual filers. These show the amount of taxable value for motor vehicles, free subsidised or discounted goods and services, low interest loans and contributions to funds, insurance and superannuation schemes. You can complete these calculations online. If you're using the full alternate rate calculation, you'll also need cash remuneration details for each employee where the fringe benefits they've received have been attributed to them. Benefits will need to be identified as attributed or non-attributed benefits on your calculation sheets - see "Attributed and non-attributed benefits" on page 9. Note 7 Attributed income The definition of cash remuneration for FBT purposes includes any amount of income attributed under the attribution rule. The attribution rule applies where a person providing services puts an entity (trust or company) between themselves and the person who receives those services (the recipient). The person providing the services and the trust or company must be associated persons. The company or trust receives the payment for the services performed by the service provider. The attribution rule ensures the net income (income after expenses) of the entity is treated as the gross income of the service provider. The rule applies only in limited circumstances. For FBT purposes, when applying the alternate rate calculations to attributed benefits received from this entity, the cash remuneration includes the amount of any attributed income. Sandy is employed by GHI Ltd and receives an annual salary of $120,000 as well as annual attributed benefits of $10,000. Sandy has formed a company that now receives the income for the services she provides to GHI Ltd. Sandy draws an income of $60,000 from her company. For the purposes of FBT, Sandy's company shows cash remuneration of $120,000 and attributed benefits of $10,000 on its alternate rate calculation sheet. Example FRINGE BENEFIT TAX RETURN GUIDE 8 If you elect the alternate rate calculation option when determining the rate to apply to an employee who has received attributed income under the attribution rules, there are 3 possible scenarios: • If all the remuneration details relating to that employee are known, you must use 1 of the alternate rate calculations - see page 17. • If some of the remuneration details are not available at the time you complete the return, you can use the rate of 49.25% to calculate the FBT payable on the attributed benefits provided to that employee. When you complete the following year's fourth quarter or annual FBT return, align the FBT payable with the actual remuneration received by the employee using the full alternate rate calculation. • If some of the remuneration details are not available at the time you complete your return, you can use the rate of 63.93% to calculate FBT payable on the attributed benefits provided. No further calculations are required the following year when using this option. The options for attributed income do not apply to income year filers (shareholder-employees) as the due date for this return is aligned with the end-of-year tax date of the employer, so all income information would be known by this date. Income year filers can elect the single rate option or one of the alternate rate calculation options. 9 Attributed and non-attributed benefits Attributing fringe benefits If you choose to apply the alternate rate calculations you'll have to attribute the following fringe benefits to the individual employee receiving them. The fringe benefit categories are as follows: • motor vehicles (other than pooled vehicles) • subsidised transport, if the annual taxable value is $1,000 or more per employee - an employer has the option to treat subsidised transport benefits as non-attributed if all employees have the same or similar entitlement to that benefit • low-interest loans (other than low-interest loans provided by life insurance companies) • employer contributions to any life insurance, pension insurance or personal accident or sickness insurance policy, funeral trust or insurance fund of a friendly society, if the annual taxable value of all contributions is $1,000 or more per employee • employer contributions to any superannuation scheme, where ESCT (employer's superannuation contribution tax) does not apply, if the annual taxable value of all contributions is $1,000 or more per employee • employer contributions to a sickness, accident, or death fund, if the annual taxable value of all contributions is $1,000 or more per employee, and • benefits of any other kind (such as gifts, prizes and subsidised or discounted goods and services), if the annual taxable value of all those benefits is $2,000 or more per employee. FRINGE BENEFIT TAX RETURN GUIDE 10 You can choose to attribute benefits when the total value of that benefit, within a particular category, for an employee is below the stated threshold. However, if you choose to do this for one employee within a particular category, you must attribute all benefits in that category to all employees receiving them. Non-attributed benefits The rate of 49.25% applies to fringe benefits not attributed to an individual employee that are pooled or shared fringe benefits (such as motor vehicles where no one employee has principal use of that vehicle). The 63.93% rate applies if a major shareholder-employee, or an associated person of the major shareholder-employee (where the fringe benefit is not received as an employee), is one of the recipients of the non-attributed benefit. A major shareholder-employee is a person who owns or controls or has the right to acquire 10% or more of the ordinary shares, voting rights or control of a close company and is also an employee of that company. It may be necessary to create 2 pools and allocate non- attributed benefits to each pool. This will depend on whether a recipient of the benefit is a major shareholder- employee or an associated person of the major shareholder-employee. 11 The following examples show how to apply the rules when attributing or non-attributing benefits.

Any benefit they receive as an employee is a fringe benefit and FBT is payable unless you elect the benefit to be treated as a dividend. If you employ shareholder-employees you may not have all the cash remuneration details for these employees to calculate the fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration. For example, the shareholder-employee's salary and wages, where PAYE has not been deducted, may not be available as this information is aligned with the income tax return filing process. The following options are available, depending on whether you elect 63.93% or the alternate rate calculations: • If you elect the flat rate of 63.93%, you pay 63.93% on all benefits provided during the year, including those provided to shareholder-employees. • If you elect the alternate rate when determining the rate to apply to a shareholder-employee, there are 3 possible scenarios. - If all the remuneration details relating to a shareholder-employee are known, you must use one of the alternate rate calculations - see page 17. - If some of the remuneration details are not available at the time you complete the return, you can use the rate of 49.25% to calculate the FBT payable on the attributed benefits provided to that shareholder- employee. When you complete the following year's fourth quarter or annual FBT return, you align the FBT payable from this year with the actual remuneration received by the shareholder-employee using the full alternate rate calculations. - If some of the remuneration details are not available at the time you complete your return, you can use the rate of 63.93% to calculate FBT payable on the attributed benefits provided. No further calculations are required the following year when using this option. 15 Shareholder-employees' remuneration or attributed income unknown If, at the time of completing your quarterly or annual return (for the period ended 31 March), you do not know all the remuneration of your shareholder-employees or those receiving attributed income, you can apply either the 49.25% or 63.93% FBT rate to the value of the attributed benefits. If you use the 49.25% rate you'll be required to complete the alternate rate calculations for next year's return (period ended 31 March). If you use 63.93% there are no further calculations to complete next year. To calculate FBT payable for shareholder-employees or persons receiving attributed income, where the remuneration details are unknown, the fringe benefit- inclusive cash remuneration will be the annual amount of the attributed fringe benefit provided. The 49.25% or 63.93% FBT rate will then be applied to this amount. A major shareholder-employee has the following remuneration details at the time of completing the return. Dividends\* $ 6,000 Fringe benefits $ 5,000 Salary and wages (no PAYE deducted) unknown The fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration for this employee is only $5,000. Dividends of $6,000 will be included as part of the cash remuneration for the following year. The employer has chosen to use the 49.25% rate this year and complete the alternate rate calculations next year. The FBT payable this year is $2,143 ($5,000 × 0.4925). \* Dividends are only included as cash remuneration where the recipient is a major shareholder-employee. Example FRINGE BENEFIT TAX RETURN GUIDE 16 If you use the 49.25% FBT rate, it's important to keep the following information for the future years calculation of FBT to pay for each shareholder-employee and person receiving attributed income: • total attributed benefits provided for the year • the amount of FBT payable for the year on the taxable value of those attributed benefits provided. 17 Completing the alternate rate calculation The following forms will help you complete the alternate rate calculation: • FBT alternate rate calculation sheet - quarterly returns - IR417 • FBT alternate rate calculation sheet - income year return - IR418 • FBT alternate rate calculation sheet - annual return - IR419. The alternate rate calculators available at ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators will calculate your FBT and give you a schedule which you can print and keep with your FBT records. If you use our onscreen calculator you will not need to complete the alternate rate calculation sheet. Note Using the short-form alternate rate calculation Under this option you classify benefits as either attributed or non-attributed. All attributed benefits are subject to the flat rate of 63.93%. All non-attributed benefits are subject to the flat rate of 49.25%, or 63.93% where one or more recipients is a major shareholder- employee. Two pools for non-attributed benefits may be necessary in this situation. This option would appeal to employers who predominantly provide attributed benefits to employees who earn more than $180,000 gross equivalent. FRINGE BENEFIT TAX RETURN GUIDE 18 Using the short-form alternate rate option, complete the alternate rate calculation sheet (IR417, IR418 or IR419) as follows Column 1 Write "attributed" and "non-attributed" on separate lines. Column 9 Write the total amount (whole dollars only) of attributed or non-attributed benefits. You may find this easier to do if you first transfer the totals from your FBT taxable value calculation sheets. If you're a quarterly filer show the values used in each quarter of the FBT taxable value calculation sheets in the respective boxes on the alternate rate calculation sheet. These are quarter 1 Box 5, quarter 2 Box 6, quarter 3 Box 7 and quarter 4 Box 8. Add them together and write the total value in Box 9. Column 10 Write the rate you're using to calculate FBT payable (attributed 63.93%, non-attributed 49.25% and non- attributed major shareholder 63.93%). Column 11 Multiply column 9 by column 10 and enter the total. Annual and income year filers - add up column 11 and transfer this amount to Box 5 of your FBT return. Quarterly filers - complete Boxes A, B and C. Transfer the amount from Box C to Box 6 of your return. Where full remuneration or attributed income details were unknown at the time of completing last year's annual or fourth quarter return and you used the 49.25% rate, transfer this amount to the remuneration adjustment sheet. See page 34. Using the pooled alternate rate calculation Under this option you classify benefits as either attributed or non-attributed. Attributed benefits are subject to a flat rate of either 49.25% or 63.93%, depending on the 19 employee’s pay and the value of benefits attributed to them. Benefits attributed to employees who earn within the “safe harbour” thresholds of up to $160,000 in gross equivalent pay and up to $13,400 each in attributed benefits for the year are subject to the 49.25% flat rate. Benefits attributed to employees earning above either of the safe harbour thresholds are subject to the 63.93% rate. However, if you know that an employee earning above the safe harbour thresholds has received less than $129,681 in net cash pay plus attributed benefits (all-inclusive pay) for the year then you may apply the 49.25% rate to benefits attributed to that employee if you wish to. In the situation when attributed benefits are taxed at the 49.25% rate for some employees and at the 63.93% rate for others, two pools for attributed benefits may be necessary. All non-attributed benefits are subject to the flat rate of 49.25%, or 63.93% where one or more recipients is a major shareholder-employee. Two pools for non- attributed benefits may be necessary in this situation. This option may appeal to employers who predominantly provide attributed benefits to employees who earn within the safe harbour thresholds (that is, up to $160,000 in gross equivalent pay and up to $13,400 each in attributed benefits for the year). Using the short-form alternate rate option, complete the alternate rate calculation sheet (IR417, IR418 or IR419) as follows Column 1 Write “Attributed benefits for 49.25% pool” and “Attributed benefits for 63.93% pool” on a separate line. If there are no employees in the 63.93% pool, then you do not need to use a line for recording benefits attributed to that pool. If the benefits provided include any pooled vehicles or non-attributed benefits, write this down as a separate heading after all the employees who received attributed benefits in column 1. FRINGE BENEFIT TAX RETURN GUIDE 20 Use a separate line for non-attributed benefits provided to major shareholder-employees. If you provide benefits to shareholder-employees make sure you’ve ticked the circle in this column. Column 9 Write the total amount (whole dollars only) of attributed or non-attributed benefits. You may find this easier to do if you first transfer the totals from your FBT taxable value calculation sheets. If you’re a quarterly filer show the values used in each quarter of the FBT taxable value calculation sheets in the respective boxes on the alternate rate calculation sheet. These are quarter 1 Box 5, quarter 2 Box 6, quarter 3 Box 7 and quarter 4 Box 8. Add them together and write the total value in Box 9. Column 10 Write the rate you’re using to calculate FBT payable (attributed 49.25% for employees within safe harbour and 63.93% for employees outside the safe harbour, non- attributed 49.25% and non-attributed major shareholder 63.93%). Column 11 Multiply column 9 by column 10 and enter the total. Annual and income year filers - add up column 11 and transfer this amount to Box 5 of your FBT return. Quarterly filers - complete Boxes A, B and C. Transfer the amount from Box C to Box 6 of your return. Where full remuneration or attributed income details were unknown at the time of completing last year’s annual or fourth quarter return and you used the 49.25% rate, transfer this amount to the remuneration adjustment sheet. 21 Using the full alternate rate calculation If you use this option, you'll need to do a separate calculation for each employee who has received attributed benefits. When completing the alternate rate calculation for the year, all attributed benefits are subject to the individual employee's personal tax rate. All non- attributed benefits are subject to the rate of 49.25% or 63.93% in the case of non-attributed benefits provided, where one or more recipients is a major shareholder- employee. Two pools for non-attributed benefits may be necessary in this situation. This option would appeal to employers who predominantly provide benefits to employees who earn less than $180,000 gross equivalent. Using the full alternate rate option - (IR417, IR418 or IR419) complete the alternate rate calculation sheet as follows Column 1 - Employee's name or non-attributed benefits Write the names of the employees who received fringe benefits attributed to them for the year. Enter each employee's name once. You'll find this information on the FBT taxable value calculation sheet. If your employee is a shareholder-employee, tick the circle next to their name. If you have not identified the benefits to be attributed, this will be your first step in completing the alternate rate calculations. If there were any pooled vehicles or non-attributed benefits, write "pooled vehicles" and "non-attributed" on separate lines below the list of employee's names. Use a separate line for non-attributed benefits to major shareholder-employees. FRINGE BENEFIT TAX RETURN GUIDE 22 Columns 2 to 4 are not required for non-attributed benefits and benefits provided to shareholder- employees and persons receiving attributed income, where their income is unknown, because the rates used are flat rates. Note Column 2 - Employee's income (cash remuneration) Write the total cash remuneration paid to each employee using your salary records for the year ended 31 March, using whole dollars beside the name of the employee. See page 44 for a definition of cash remuneration. If an employee only worked part of the year the cash remuneration is the amount you've paid them during that year. Column 3 - Tax on employee's income (tax on employee’s cash remuneration) For each employee, calculate the amount of tax on the cash remuneration in column 2. Write the total in column 3. This is not the amount of PAYE deducted from your employee's income. See the examples on the following pages. The amount of tax you record in column 3 is to the second place after the decimal point. Do not round this amount up or down. Note 23 For each employee you'll need to ask yourself the following questions and complete the appropriate step. Is my employee's cash remuneration: • $14,000 or less? If “yes” go to A below • from $14,001 to $48,000? If “yes” go to B on page 23 • from $48,001 to $70,000? If “yes” go to C on page 24 • from $70,001 to $180,000? If “yes” go to D on page 25 • Over $180,000? If “yes” go to E on page 25. A - Employee's cash remuneration is $14,000 or less If your employee's annual cash remuneration is $14,000 or less, follow these instructions to calculate the amount of tax: • Multiply your employee's cash remuneration, whole dollars, by the tax rate of 0.105 (10.5%). • Transfer this amount to column 3 of your FBT alternate rate calculation sheet. Employee A receives $8,750 for the year. The tax on this amount is: Cash remuneration $8,750.00 Multiplied by tax rate 0.105 Total tax on $8,750 $918.75 Example B - Employee's cash remuneration is from $14,001 to $48,000 If your employee's annual cash remuneration falls in this range, follow these instructions to calculate the amount of tax: • Deduct $14,000 (remuneration threshold) from your employee's cash remuneration. This gives you the balance of the cash remuneration. • Multiply the balance by the tax rate of 0.175 (17.5%). • Add the cumulative tax total on $14,000 ($1,470.00). • Transfer the total tax calculated to column 3 of your FBT alternate rate calculation sheet. FRINGE BENEFIT TAX RETURN GUIDE 24 Employee B receives $21,500 for the year.

This is the employee’s net income (net cash remuneration) and is completed for each employee. Write this total in column 4. Columns 5, 6, 7 and 8 - Total benefits provided to an employee, or non-attributed benefits Complete this step for each employee, shareholder- employee and person receiving attributed income, where the benefit has been attributed, and for non-attributed benefits. Quarterly filers Transfer the information from the FBT taxable value calculation sheets. For each quarter: • total the taxable value of the benefits attributed to each employee, or the taxable value of the non- attributed benefits, and • write the quarterly totals next to each employee's name or in the "non-attributed" row: - Quarter 1 (1 April to 30 June) - write the total in column 5 - Quarter 2 (1 July to 30 September) - write the total in column 6 27 - Quarter 3 (1 October to 31 December) - write the total in column 7 - Quarter 4 (1 January to 31 March) - write the total in column 8. To check all the figures have been correctly transferred, add up the column for each quarter (columns 5, 6, 7 and 8). This total should be the same as the taxable value shown on Box 3 of the IR420. Annual and income year filers For annual and income year filers, the taxable value of the fringe benefits attributed to the individual employees is written in the following columns: • Column 5 - write the total for motor vehicles (A) • Column 6 - write the total for other fringe benefits (B) • Column 7 - write the total for low-interest loans (C) • Column 8 - write the total for insurance and superannuation (D). Write the total amount next to the employee's name, or non-attributed benefit in each of the columns. To check all the figures have been correctly transferred, add up the column for each benefit type (columns 5, 6, 7 and 8). The combined total should be the same as the taxable value shown on Box 3 of the IR421 or IR422 FBT return. You do not have to attribute certain benefits if they fall under the threshold for their category - see page 9. Column 9 - Fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration (FBICR) Add columns 5 to 8 together (whole dollars only), then add the dollar value from column 4 to this figure and write your answer in column 9. This is the FBICR. This total is the annual net income (net cash remuneration) from column 4 and the attributed benefits provided to each employee (columns 5 to 8). For shareholder-employees or persons receiving attributed income, where all their remuneration is unknown at the time of completing this return, the FBICR for this year FRINGE BENEFIT TAX RETURN GUIDE 28 is the annual total of attributed benefits provided to the individual shareholder-employee or person receiving attributed income - see the example on page 15. For non-attributed benefits these are the annual total benefits not attributed to an individual employee. Column 10 - Tax on fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration (FBICR) for attributed benefits For each employee, calculate the amount of tax on the FBICR in column 9. Write the total in column 10 - see the examples on the following pages. The amount you record is to the second place after the decimal point. Do not round this amount up or down. Note This step does not have to be completed for non- attributed benefits, or shareholder-employees and persons receiving attributed income, where their remuneration is unknown at the time of completing this return. In this column write the rate of FBT being applied to these benefits - either 49.25% or 63.93%. Complete the appropriate step for each employee. Is your employee’s FBICR: • $12,530 or less? If “yes” go to A below • from $12,531 to $40,580? If “yes” go to B on page 29 • from $40,581 to $55,980? If “yes” go to C on page 29 • from $55,981 to $129,680?

Attributed benefits To calculate the amount of FBT payable in a year for each employee's attributed benefits, take the total from column 10 (tax on FBICR) and subtract the total in column 3 (tax on employee's income). Shareholder-employees or persons receiving attributed income - remuneration unknown If the 49.25% rate is used, multiply your total in column 9 by 49.25% and write your total in column 11. If 63.93% is used, multiply your total in column 9 by 63.93% and write your total in column 11. See page 15 for more information about unknown remuneration. Non-attributed benefits Calculate the FBT payable for the year by using the 49.25% rate on the combined total of all non-attributed benefits provided during the year. Use the 63.93% rate on the total non-attributed benefits received by a major shareholder-employee. See page 10 for more information about non-attributed benefits. Multiply your total in column 9 by either 49.25% or 63.93%, and write the rate you've used in column 10 and the amount in column 11. Box A - Total FBT to pay Add up column 11 and write the total in Box A. If you file income year returns, Box A is your FBT payable. Transfer this amount to Box 5 of your IR421 return. If you file annual returns, Box A is your FBT payable. Transfer this amount to Box 5 of your IR422 return, or where full remuneration or attributed income details for shareholder-employees were unknown at the time of completing last year's return and you used the 49.25% rate, transfer this amount to the remuneration adjustment worksheet - see page 32. If you're a quarterly filer, Box A is your FBT payable for the year. Continue to Box B. 33 Box B - FBT assessed in quarters 1 to 3 (quarterly filers only) To work out the amount of FBT to pay in this quarter you'll need to total the amount of FBT assessed (excluding any interest or late payment penalties) in the last 3 quarters (ending 30 June, 30 September and 31 December). You'll find these totals in Box 6 of your Fringe benefit tax quarterly return - IR420 Quarter 1, Box 6 Quarter 2, Box 6 Quarter 3, Box 6 If your return has been reassessed by Inland Revenue, use the amount of FBT to pay (GST-exclusive) from the reassessment, not the original return. Note Total assessed in the 3 quarters Copy this total to Box B on your alternate rate calculation sheet. Box C - Total FBT to pay or refund due (quarterly filers only) Box A (FBT payable for the year) less Box B (FBT assessed) will give you the amount of FBT you'll have to pay or be refunded in this quarter. Write this total in Box C. Transfer this amount to Box 6 of your IR420 return. Where full remuneration or attributed income details for shareholder-employees were unknown at the time of completing last year's fourth quarter return and you used the 49.25% rate, transfer this amount to the remuneration adjustment sheet. FRINGE BENEFIT TAX RETURN GUIDE 34 Completing the remuneration adjustment worksheet This worksheet will help you to calculate any adjustment required, where full remuneration or attributed income details for shareholder-employees (or those receiving attributed income) were unknown at the time of completing last year's fourth quarter or annual return. The remuneration adjustment worksheet is available on ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators You'll also find an example in the Fringe benefit tax guide - IR409 If you elected to use the 49.25% rate in your fourth quarter or annual return for the period ended 31 March for shareholder-employees, where all remuneration or attributed income details were unknown, you must make an adjustment using the full alternate rate calculation. You'll need the following information for each of the shareholder-employees: • total attributed benefits provided last year • last year's income • the amount of FBT paid in last year's return. Column 1 - Shareholder-employee's name Write the names of the shareholder-employees whose full remuneration details were unknown last year and you elected the 49.25% rate. Column 2 - Last year's income Show the total cash remuneration paid to each shareholder-employee for the year ended 31 March. Enter this information using whole dollars in column 2, beside the name of the shareholder-employee. 35 Column 3 - Tax on income In column 3, calculate the amount of tax on the cash remuneration paid to the shareholder-employee in column 2. For each shareholder-employee you'll have to identify which income range they are in and decide which tax rate has to apply. Refer to page 23 to help you calculate the tax. Column 4 - Last year's net income Subtract the amount in column 3 (tax on income) from the amount in column 2 (last year's cash remuneration). This is the shareholder-employee's net cash remuneration. Write this total in column 4. Column 5 - Attributed benefits provided last year Show the total amount of attributed benefits provided to the individual shareholder-employee last year. Column 6 - Fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration (FBICR) Add columns 4 and 5 together and write your answer in column 6. This is the FBICR. This total is last year's annual net income (cash remuneration) and attributed benefits provided to each shareholder-employee. Column 7 - Tax on fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration For each shareholder-employee, calculate the amount of tax on the total in column 6. Refer to page 27 to help you calculate the tax. FRINGE BENEFIT TAX RETURN GUIDE 36 Column 8 - FBT payable last year Column 8 is the FBT payable for last year. To calculate the amount of FBT payable for each shareholder-employee, take the total from column 7 (tax on FBICR) and subtract the total in column 3 (tax on cash remuneration). Column 9 - FBT paid for shareholder-employees in last year's return Show the amount for each shareholder-employee from column 11 of last year's alternate rate calculation sheet. This was the amount payable from the information known at the time of completing last year's return. Column 10 - Adjustment required Subtract column 9 from column 8 (where column 9 is larger than column 8, the result is a credit). Show the difference in column 10 (show credits in brackets). Box D - Total of all adjustments Add up column 10, remembering to subtract figures shown in brackets (credits). Where all amounts are in brackets or the total amount in brackets is greater than the debits, the total will be a credit. Box E - Total from your alternate rate calculation sheet Transfer the amount from Box C (quarterly filers) of your FBT alternate rate calculation sheet - quarterly returns - IR417 or Box A (annual or income year filers) of your FBT alternate rate calculation sheet - annual return - IR419 to Box E. Remember to tick FBT to pay or FBT refund. 37 Box F - FBT to pay or refund If Box D is a debit If Box E is a refund, subtract from Box D. If Box E is larger than Box D, the result is an FBT refund. If Box D is larger than Box E, the result is FBT to pay. Write the result in Box F. If Box E is FBT to pay, add Box D. The result is FBT to pay. Write the result in Box F. If Box D is a credit If Box E is FBT to pay, subtract from Box D. If Box E is larger than Box D the result is FBT to pay. If Box D is larger than Box E, the result is an FBT refund. Write the result in Box F. If Box E is an FBT refund, add Box D. The result is an FBT refund. Write the result in Box F. Copy the amount in Box F to Box 6 (IR420 for quarterly returns) or Box 5 (IR421 or IR422 for annual returns) of your FBT return. Remember to tick FBT to pay or FBT refund on your return. FRINGE BENEFIT TAX RETURN GUIDE 38 Further information Due dates Last quarterly return and annual filers The due date for this return and any payment is 31 May. If the due date falls on a non-business day the payment will be due on the following working day. Income year filers This return and any payment are aligned with your balance date and are due at the same time your end of year income tax is payable. When you stop employing permanently Let us know if you stop employing permanently, even if your business is still operating. If you're still providing fringe benefits to former employees you must continue to pay FBT on these benefits. Note 39 Completion of final FBT return where you've ceased to employ staff and provide fringe benefits If you've ceased employing staff and do not intend to employ any more staff in the current tax year, you should complete sections A, C and D of your final return for the quarter you ceased to employ (quarterly filers only). You may choose to pay FBT at the flat rate of 63.93% rather than using one of the alternate rate calculations. However, if you choose this option you must apply the 63.93% rate to all fringe benefits provided from the beginning of the tax year to the date you ceased to employ staff, taking into account FBT already paid during the year. Please note, if you continue to provide fringe benefits to former employees, the above does not apply. It's a good idea to note "final return" next to the circles at the top of the IR420 return. Where you're asked to indicate whether the return is for quarter 4 there's no need to tick either circle. FRINGE BENEFIT TAX RETURN GUIDE 40 Due dates for final return If you're filing your final FBT return in quarters 1, 2 or 3, the due date shown on the return will be the standard quarterly due date (20th of the month following the quarter). The actual due date for filing a final return in quarters 1, 2 or 3 is extended to the end of 2 months immediately following the end of the quarter in which employment stopped.

Find out more about making a complaint, and the disputes process, at ird.govt.nz/disputes FRINGE BENEFIT TAX RETURN GUIDE 44 Terms we use Associated person For FBT purposes an associated person is someone associated with the employer or the employee: • by within 2 degrees of blood relationship or one person is within 2 degrees of blood relationship to the other person's spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner • by marriage, civil union or de facto relationship • by business partnership, or • by shareholding interest. The association rules are complex, therefore it's important you seek professional advice if you think there's any possibility of an association applying to you. Fringe benefits provided to an associate of an employee are to be taxed as though they were given to the employee, rather than the associate. Note Attributed benefit A fringe benefit that an employee has the principal use or enjoyment of during the year. See pages 9 to 13 for rules and thresholds. Cash remuneration The employee’s gross salary or wages, bonuses, overtime and other taxable income from all sources associated with the employer (including its subsidiaries) during the year, before tax is calculated and deducted. For a major shareholder-employee, cash remuneration also includes any interest or dividends received from the employer, or a related employer who pays cash remuneration. 45 Close company A company that has 5 or fewer natural person shareholders. Company A formal and legal entity in its own right, separate from its shareholders (or owners). It is formed when a group of people exchanges money and/or property for shares in an enterprise registered under the Companies Act 1993. Fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration (FBICR) The taxable value of attributed fringe benefits plus the cash remuneration. If you're using the alternate rate calculation process, calculate FBICR for each employee who has fringe benefits attributed to them. Major shareholder-employee A person who owns, controls or has the right to acquire 10% or more of the ordinary shares, voting rights or control of a close company, and is also an employee of that company. Non-attributed benefit Non-attributed benefits are pooled or shared fringe benefits not attributed to an individual employee. Non-resident employee If remuneration is paid to a non-resident employee, the calculation of the amount of tax payable on the remuneration includes any tax credit as if the employee was a resident for FBT purposes. Shareholder-employee A shareholder and employee of a company that has no more than 25 shareholders. Any benefit a shareholder- employee receives as an employee is a fringe benefit and FBT is payable. FRINGE BENEFIT TAX RETURN GUIDE 46 Subsidised transport The subsidised transport exception that allows employers to pool benefits at the rate of 49.25% (if all employees have the same or similar entitlement to the benefit) includes employers who are close companies.

( ) / / Signature Date 3 Notes These notes explain what the tax obligations are immediately after an amalgamation of two or more companies. If, however, you want information about the legal requirements and procedures involved in an amalgamation, contact the Companies Office. The company resulting from an amalgamation may be one of the amalgamating companies or it may be a new company. Information for the resulting company can be found on this page. For information for amalgamating companies that cease to exist after the amalgamation, see page 4. The resulting company must fill in this Declaration of an amalgamation – IR432 form. If you have any questions about amalgamations and your tax obligations, please see our contact details on page 4. The resulting company What you must do Complete the IR432 to tell us about the amalgamation within 63 working days of delivering the amalgamation documents to the Registrar of Companies. If the resulting company is a newly incorporated company, apply online for an IRD number. Income tax The resulting company’s income tax return will: – in the case of a new company, cover the period from the date of amalgamation to 31 March (or an approved alternative balance date), or – be for the 12 months to the company’s balance date, when one of the amalgamating companies becomes the resulting company. The resulting company may use an amalgamating company’s losses that can be carried forward in the final return, provided the commonality and continuity of shareholding tests are met and the amalgamation is a qualifying one. If more than one amalgamating company has losses, these must be offset in the order they arose. If they arose in the same income year, you may elect the order of offset. If you wish to make an election, send us the details when you file the company’s return. A pro rata basis will be used if no election is made. Qualifying company election tax (QCET) If a non-qualifying company amalgamates with a qualifying company and the qualifying company is the company that continues in existence after the election, QCET is payable on the retained earnings of the non-qualifying company. The retained earnings can then be distributed tax-free. Net losses of the non-qualifying company cannot be carried forward to the amalgamated company. Provisional tax Calculate provisional tax instalments payable after the date of amalgamation based on the total of the previous years’ residual income tax of all the amalgamating companies. Goods and services tax (GST) If the resulting company was not registered for GST before amalgamation, it may be required to register or may do so voluntarily. If the combined taxable supplies of the resulting company and the amalgamating companies were over $60,000 in the previous 12 months, the resulting company may have to register for GST. Registration can be completed online via myIR. For more information on registration see our fact sheet GST - quick reference – IR324. If the resulting company was registered for GST before the amalgamation, it may be required to change its accounting basis and/or the taxable period it used before the amalgamation. If a company exceeds certain thresholds, it cannot use the payments basis and its taxable period options are limited. For more information see our GST guide - IR375. The threshold applies to the combined taxable supplies of all the amalgamating companies. If the resulting company is registered for GST immediately after amalgamation, any transfer of goods and services from an amalgamating company is not a taxable supply and therefore not subject to GST. Employer obligations If the resulting company is employing for the first time, it must register as an employer. Registration can be completed online via myIR or by completing the Employer registration – IR334 form. For more information see our Employer’s guide – IR335. If the resulting company now employs staff who were employed by the amalgamating companies, you must: – g et each employee to complete a Tax code declaration – IR330 – li st the employees on the resulting company’s first Employer monthly schedule – IR348 and enter the commencement date for all employees. If the combined gross annual PAYE deductions of the amalgamating companies for the previous year were $500,000 or more, the resulting company becomes a “large” employer and must pay the deductions twice a month. Fringe benefit tax (FBT) If the company registering as an employer does not provide or intend to provide fringe benefits, show us via the online registration process or at Question 12 on the Employer registration – IR334 form. If the company is liable for FBT, when calculating FBT for the first quarter after amalgamation, it must apportion the $300 exemption according to the number of days in the quarter that the resulting company existed. For more information about FBT, see our Fringe benefit tax guide – IR409. If the amalgamating companies’ combined gross tax deductions were $1,000,000 or less for the previous year (exclusive of ACC earners’ levy), the resulting company may file FBT returns yearly via myIR. If the company files yearly, the annual exemption of $1,200 for each employee or $22,500 maximum for all employees must be apportioned according to the number of days that the new resulting company existed. Resident and non-resident withholding tax (RWT and NRWT) The resulting company may have to register for RWT and/or NRWT. If you need information, read Resident withholding tax on interest (RWT) payer’s guide – IR283 and NRWT - payer’s guide – IR291. If the company is already registered, you may have to alter the registration details. For example, before amalgamation it may have accounted for RWT six-monthly, but after amalgamation it may be required to account monthly. After the amalgamation, the company may be eligible for an exemption from RWT. You can apply for a RWT exemption via myIR or by completing the IR451 form. The details of the RWT-exempt status are held on a publicly accessible register. If the company already has a RWT exemption, but the basis on which this was issued no longer applies because of the amalgamation, you must advise the us within five working days of the amalgamation. 4 The amalgamating companies The following information applies to those companies that do not continue but become part of the resulting company. These companies cease to exist from the date of amalgamation so all their tax affairs must be finalised and, where appropriate, reconciled as at the date of amalgamation. The resulting company is responsible for this. Income tax File an income tax return for the period from the beginning of the income year to the date of amalgamation. The due date for the return and tax payment remains the same. If the company’s final return results in a loss, it can be used by the resulting company subject to the commonality and continuity of shareholding tests. The company must file an imputation credit account return for the same period as the income tax return. If applicable, it must also provide a dividend withholding payment report digitally for the same period. These returns are due within two months of the date of amalgamation. Imputation credit account debit balances will be transferred to the resulting company. If the company maintains a shareholder continuity of at least 66%, any credit balances can generally be transferred to the resulting company. Goods and services tax (GST) If the amalgamating company is registered for GST, it must file a final GST return for the taxable period ending on the date of amalgamation. Normal due dates apply for this return and any payment. If the amalgamating company and the resulting company are both registered for GST, the transfer of goods and services is not a taxable supply and not subject to GST. If the amalgamating company is registered for GST but the resulting company will not be, goods and services are treated as though supplied by the amalgamating company. Goods and services acquired by the amalgamating company on or after 1 October 1986 are to be valued at market value. Employer obligations If the amalgamating company was an employer, it must: – complete an Employer monthly schedule - IR348 to the date of amalgamation, showing a finish date for each employee – c omplete a final FBT return using the multi-rate option. Send the return and payment to us by the last day of the second month immediately after the quarter the amalgamation took place. If any employee has child support payments deducted from their wages, the amalgamating company must contact Child Support via a message in myIR or on 0800 221 221 to arrange for these to continue. You will need to provide the IRD number of the resulting company. Resident and non-resident withholding tax (RWT and NRWT) If the amalgamating company holds RWT exempt status advise us within five working days of the amalgamation. Tax arrears If the amalgamating company has tax arrears, the resulting company becomes liable for the debt. We will issue statements of account for the outstanding tax in the name of the resulting company. ird.govt.nz Go to our website for information and to use our services and tools. • Log in or register for myIR – manage your tax and entitlements online. • Calculators and tools – use our calculators, worksheets and tools.

There's a list on page 31 for terms that you may not be familiar with, or that are used differently from their everyday meaning. Only companies that were QCs prior to their income year starting on or after 1 April 2011 are able to continue using the QC rules. New and existing companies cannot elect to be a QC. For legislation specific to QCs refer to subpart HA of the Income Tax Act 2007. Unless otherwise noted all references are to the Income Tax Act 2007. 3QUALIFYING COMPANIES Contents Introduction 2 Part 1 - What are qualifying companies 5 Qualifying company (QC) 5 Advantages of being a QC 5 Disadvantages of being a QC 5 Differences between a QC and a company for tax purposes 6 Part 2 - Who can be a QC 8 Requirements of a QC 8 Shareholder count test 9 Part 3 - How to maintain QC status 13 Re-elections due to changes in shareholding 13 When are re-elections due? 14 How to complete re-elections 14 Shareholder liability 14 Shareholders' effective interest 15 Market value interest 16 Rules to determine effective interest 17 Part 4 - How QC status is revoked 18 Ceasing to be a QC 18 Voluntary revocation 18 Automatic revocation 19 Changes in control during the QC continuity period causing automatic revocation 19 What do I do if QC status is revoked automatically? 21 Revocations and effective interest 21 Liquidating or winding up a QC 22 www.ird.govt.nz4 Part 5 - Distributing dividends as a QC 23 Dividend imputation system 23 Resident and non-resident shareholders 24 Summary of tax treatment for different types of distributions 24 How imputation credits are attached to dividends 24 Amount of dividend that will be taxable 25 Part 6 - Imputation credit account (ICA) 26 ICA rules that apply to qualifying companies 26 Debit balances 27 Part 7 - Taxing a QC 28 Intercompany dividend exemption 28 Subvention payments and loss offsets for a QC 28 FBT (fringe benefit tax) 29 Part 8 - Taxing shareholders of a QC 30 Dividends received from a QC 30 Exempt dividends distributed to beneficiaries 30 Deductible interest on money borrowed to purchase shares 30 Terms we use 31 Services you may need 34 0800 self-service numbers 34 Need to speak with us? 34 Privacy 35 If you have a complaint about our service 35 5QUALIFYING COMPANIES Part 1 - What are qualifying companies Qualifying company (QC) QCs are companies governed by tax provisions that aim to treat the company and its shareholders as one entity as much as possible for income tax purposes. A QC pays income tax on its profits in the same way as other companies (subject to certain rules as outlined in Part 7). However, there are some differences that result in advantages and disadvantages to becoming a QC as outlined below. Advantages of being a QC • There are commercial benefits in maintaining a company structure with the taxation benefits of a partnership (eg, limited liability and the ability to transfer ownership). • Only dividends with imputation credits attached are taxable to the shareholders. • Capital gains (realised and unrealised) can be distributed tax free without winding up the company. Disadvantages of being a QC • Shareholders are liable for any unpaid income tax for the company according to their effective interest. • If a QC is in a profit situation it can only make a subvention payment to another group company if it is also a QC. Also, a QC in a profit situation can also only receive a loss offset from another group company if it is a QC. • Interest shareholders have paid to acquire shares isn't fully deductible. For a more detailed comparison of the differences between a QC and a company for tax purposes, please refer to the following table. www.ird.govt.nz6 Differences between a QC and a company for tax purposes QCCompany Requirements that must be met Investment restrictions Derive a maximum of NZ$10,000 foreign-sourced non-dividend income per year. It mustn't have, at any time, any income interest in a controlled foreign company or an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund that is a direct income interest of 10% or more. None ShareholdingLimited to five (subject to shareholder count test) A shareholder that is a company must be a QC Change in shareholding may require re-elections and could result in a deemed revocation of QC status None Tax liabilityShareholders liable for unpaid income tax None (except section HD 15) Foreign companyCan't be a qualifying companyCan be a New Zealand resident company Distributions DividendsImputation credits fully attached or exempt Taxable Shareholder- employee salaries Deductible to the company and assessable to the shareholder- employees Deductible to the company and assessable to the shareholder-employees 7QUALIFYING COMPANIES QCCompany Capital dividendsExempt from income taxTax free on winding up only Dividends to non-residents NRWT must be deducted and paid on all dividends NRWT must be deducted and paid on all dividends Imputation credits received Credit to imputation credit account (ICA) and offset against tax liability Credit to ICA and offset against tax liability Share repurchasesExcess classed as ordinary dividend to shareholder Excess liable for FBT unless shareholder elects to be assessed Income or losses LossesA QC in profit can only receive a loss offset from another group company if it is also a QC.

General rules apply Fringe benefits To shareholdersNon-deductible and non- assessable Non-deductible and non- assessable To shareholder- employees Deductible by company, non- assessable to shareholder- employees, but subject to FBT Deductible by company, non-assessable to shareholder-employees, but subject to FBT Other Interest paid to acquire shares Apportionment requiredDeductible QCCompany ICA Credits carried forward 66% rule only applicable if qualifying company status is forfeited 66% rule www.ird.govt.nz8 Part 2 - Who can be a QC Requirements of a QC To maintain QC status, all the following requirements must be met for the whole of the income year. • The company must not be a foreign company at any time during the year. However, a company that has non-resident shareholders will not necessarily be excluded from becoming a QC. • The company mustn't have, at any time any income interest in a controlled foreign company or an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund that is a direct income interest of 10% or more. • The company must not be a unit trust. • The company must not receive more than NZ$10,000 in foreign-sourced non-dividend income per year. To determine the $10,000 limit, a deduction is made for the lesser of: - gross foreign non-dividend income (accrual income) - 10% of the company's annual gross income before any deductions. Please note, it is necessary to consider where the income is sourced to determine when the $10,000 limit applies. • Each shareholder must be: a natural person, a QC or a trustee of a specified kind. • If a shareholder in a QC is a trustee: - every beneficiary of the trust which received dividends from a QC must be either a person or a QC. - the trustees must distribute dividend income (including cash and taxable bonus issues) derived from a QC during the income year to beneficiaries as beneficiary income. Normal trust rules apply in that the income must be paid or applied within six months of balance date. These rules are relaxed when the trust pays or vests as much of the dividend income as is allowed under general trust law. • The number of shareholders in the company must not exceed five, unless it is purely a flat-owning company (see page 31). There are special rules for determining the number of shareholders for QC purposes - see "Shareholder count test" on page 9. 9QUALIFYING COMPANIES • Valid elections must be in place for the whole of the income year to maintain QC status. Re-elections must be completed and filed with us within the grace period - see Part 3. • QC status must not be revoked, whether through a voluntary revocation or an automatic revocation see Part 4. • Starting 30 March 2017 there must not be a significant change in the QC's shareholding - see "Change in control during QC continuity period causing automatic revocation" on page 19. Shareholder count test Shareholder count test for individual shareholders The maximum number of shareholders for a QC is five. For some companies, it will be obvious that they meet this requirement without needing the shareholder count test. For example, a company that has three individual shareholders clearly has fewer than five shareholders. However, for companies that have more than five individual shareholders, or that include non-individual shareholders (ie, a company or a trust shareholder) the shareholder count test needs to be considered. The shareholder count test determines the number of shareholders a company has for QC purposes through identifying the relationships between individual shareholders and applying the "look-through" test for non-individual shareholders. Shareholders related by blood relationship, marriage, civil union or de facto relationship, or adoption, are seen as being related within one degree and are counted as a single shareholder for QC purposes. To clarify the degrees of separation in a relationship between individual shareholders, think of a family tree. Count the steps back to a common ancestor and then forward to the other person. Each link is a one-degree relationship. Shareholder relationships with two degrees of separation between them are still counted as two separate shareholders for QC purposes. www.ird.govt.nz10 Parent Son Daughter In the example above, if all three are shareholders in a company, they are counted as a single shareholder because the son and daughter are related to the parent within one degree. But, if the parent was not a shareholder, the brother and sister would count as two shareholders because they are related within two degrees. The relationship between a step-parent and step-child is a second-degree relationship for QC purposes. Shareholder count test for company shareholders Only companies that are also QCs may hold shares in a QC (except when they are acting as a nominee). In determining whether there are five or fewer shareholders, the company is not counted as a single shareholder. Instead, you must "look through" to its individual shareholders and identify the relationships between them to determine the shareholder count (see the company shareholders example below). Shareholder count test for trust shareholders If a trust is a shareholder, it is necessary to "look through" to the beneficiaries of the trust. It is the beneficiaries who are counted to determine the shareholder count for a trust. The number of beneficiaries will be the greater of: • the number of beneficiaries who have received dividends from the trust in that income year where all the dividends were derived from a QC, or • the number of beneficiaries who elected that the company become a QC. In most circumstances, trusts, as shareholders of a QC, are required to pass out dividends to beneficiaries. Note Shareholder count test for nominee shareholders Shares held on behalf of a person are deemed to be held by that person. If a nominee shareholder is a trust or another company rather than a person, this alone will not prevent a company from becoming a QC. 11QUALIFYING COMPANIES Special rules for shareholder count test • Death or dissolution of marriage or civil union of the shareholders doesn't break the one-degree test, provided the company was a QC and the shareholders were considered to be "one" before the event. • Holders of debentures to which section FA 2 applies are treated as shareholders. Examples that meet the shareholder count test Company shareholders Company C Ltd has the following shareholding: 50% Company D Ltd- 34% Luke brothers333% Harry 33% Ben 50% Company E Ltd- 25% Peter husband and wife1 25% Mary 25% Sam husband and wife1 25% Susan In this example, Company C Ltd has five shareholders for the purposes of the shareholder count test. The three brothers of Company D Ltd are related within two degrees so they are counted individually. Since a husband and wife are related within one degree, Company E Ltd has two shareholders. If the shareholders of Company E Ltd were not related to each other, the shareholder count for Company E Ltd would be four. Overall, this would result in a shareholder count of 7 for Company C Ltd and it would not be eligible to become a QC. Trust shareholders Company B Ltd was incorporated on 1 April 2009 with the following shareholding: 10% Jack 90% family trust- trustee- Jack - beneficiaries- Sandra (Jack's wife) - Matt Jack and Sandra's children - Neve - Oliver - Piers www.ird.govt.nz12 Jack signs the shareholder's elections for Company B Ltd as the individual shareholder and as the sole trustee for the trust shareholder. Sandra signs the shareholder's elections for Company B Ltd as the beneficiary who can legally sign the election for the trust. Assuming five beneficiaries have received QC dividends through the trust, the company's shareholding, including Jack, totals six. However, since these shareholders are all related within one degree, the company has only one shareholder for the shareholder count test. Mixed shareholding Company A Ltd was incorporated on 1 April 2009 with the following shareholding: 40% Bob 110% Sue (Bob's wife) 13% Phil (Bob's son, aged 21) 13% Stephen (Sue's brother) 1 13% Jamie (Stephen's son) 6% family trust- trustee - Bob - beneficiaries - Sue - Phil - Jamie 5% Company F Ltd - 99% Bob - 1% Denise (nominee for Bob) In this example, Company A Ltd has two shareholders for the purpose of the shareholder count test: 1. Bob, plus Sue, Phil (one degree from Bob) and Denise (nominee) 2. Stephen, plus Jamie (one degree from each other). You may need to apply the test more than once, starting with different shareholders, to arrive at the least number of shareholders. If it isn't clear whether a company has five or fewer shareholders, supply details of shareholder relationships with the re-elections in order to help us process your request faster. Note 13QUALIFYING COMPANIES Part 3 - How to maintain QC status To be a QC a valid election needed to be made before the income year starting on or after 1 April 2011. For a company to retain its QC status it must continue to meet all of the requirements to be eligible (see Part 2) and have valid elections in place for the whole of the income year. Re-elections due to changes in shareholding When a QC has a shareholding change, the new shareholders must complete and file re-elections with us. The new shareholders must also elect for the company to be a QC and to become liable for any unpaid income tax for the company, according to their effective interest. Some of the most common changes in shareholding are where existing shareholders - who have previously elected - sell all or some of their shares to a new shareholder or where a company issues shares to a new shareholder. In both of these scenarios, the new shareholder must complete re-elections. However, if a shareholding change involves a transfer of shares between existing shareholders only - who have both previously elected - there is no requirement to re-elect because the shareholders' elections still stand as only their effective interest has changed. Please refer to the following table for some examples of shareholding changes and whether re-elections are required to be filed. Types of shareholding changes and action required Shareholding change Are re-elections required to be filed? Ye sNo A shareholder dies ✓ Shares are transferred from an estate to another person ✓ A minority shareholder, who had a majority shareholder previously elect on their behalf, becomes a majority shareholder ✓ A majority shareholder, who previously elected on behalf of a minority shareholder/s, becomes a minority shareholder ✓ A trustee or beneficiary of a trust, or shareholder, who had a volunteer elector sign on their behalf due to being a minor, becomes legally able to sign the election ✓ A trust shareholder has new trustees ✓ A shareholder sells part or all of their shares to a new shareholder ✓ Shares are sold between existing shareholders who have both previously signed valid elections ✓ www.ird.govt.nz14 When are re-elections due? Re-elections are required to be filed with us within 63 days - the grace period - of the shareholding change. An exception to this is where the shareholding change is due to the death of a shareholder; in this case the grace period is extended to 12 months. If re-elections aren't filed with us within this period, a company's QC status is lost - referred to as an automatic revocation - from the beginning of the tax year in which the shareholding change occurred. If the automatic revocation occurred in a tax year starting on or after 1 April 2011 the company will lose its QC status and be unable to elect back into the rules. We have some discretion to consider requests to extend the grace period or defer the date of revocation when re-elections are filed late. Such requests should be in writing and attached to the late re-elections, and need to clarify the following points: • The event and date that made the company and/or tax agent realise the re-elections hadn't been filed within the grace period. • Reasons why the re-elections were filed late. How to complete re-elections Use the Qualifying company re-elections (IR436) form to make the re-election. It is generally only the new shareholders who need to sign if valid elections are still in place for the existing shareholders. There may be exceptions where the original elections involved majority elections or volunteer elections and the shareholding change involves these shareholders. Shareholder liability The shareholders' liability for the QC's income tax is based on the shareholders' effective interest in the company. Shareholders who can legally sign the election are liable for any income tax the company has incurred but failed to pay during the time it is a QC. Shareholders who hold shares jointly (including trustees, beneficiaries who can legally sign the election and volunteer electors) will have joint and several liability to the extent of their joint effective interest. 15QUALIFYING COMPANIES Summary of shareholders' liability MinorityElection made, liability based on effective interest Majority election on minority's behalf, no liability MajorityLiability based on effective interest Shareholders who make majority elections on behalf of minority shareholders are also liable for those shareholders' effective interest Joint majority elections made with other shareholders, joint and several liability for minority's effective interest NomineeSame as for minority TrusteeJointly and severally liable with the elector beneficiaries and/or volunteers, based on the trust's effective interest Liability limited to value of trust's net assets Beneficiaries or volunteers Same as for trustee Shareholders' effective interest A shareholder's effective or voting interest in a company is measured by the percentage of decision-making rights carried by the shares (and options) in a company, in relation to: • dividends or other company distributions • the company's constitution • variation of the company's capital • director appointments or elections. www.ird.govt.nz16 A voting interest calculation A shareholder owns 40% of the shares in a limited company. The shares carry voting rights over distributions made by the company and variation of the capital only. The voting interest is calculated as: Distributions+ constitution+ variation in capital + directors 40 + 0 + 40 + 0 = 80 =20% 100100100100100 Where a shareholder's economic interest in a company isn't accurately reflected by their voting interest because of other specific factors, the shareholder's effective interest is calculated as the average of the shareholder's voting interest and market value interest in the company. Example Market value interest A shareholder's market value interest in a company at any time equals their share of the total market value of shares (and options) held in the company. There are specific factors that require a market value interest to be calculated - these are called market value circumstances. These are the situations where a market value circumstance exists. • The company has debentures on issue to which section FA 2 applies (but not excluded securities or pre-budget securities). • The company has shares on issue where a third party guarantees dividend payment. • There is an option, other than an excluded option, to acquire shares in the company. • An arrangement exists with the purpose of defeating a provision that depends on measuring voting and market value interests. 17QUALIFYING COMPANIES Rules to determine effective interest There are some special rules for calculating the effective interest in a company. • Where the shareholder is another company, there is no "look through" to the ultimate shareholders. • If the voting interest or market value interest varies during the year, the effective interest for the period is determined on a weighted average basis. • When a shareholder's election is revoked, the voting and market value interests are nil from the date the revocation takes effect. • If the shareholder is a trustee, and a beneficiary who can legally sign the election or volunteer elector revokes their election, the trustee's voting and market value interests are nil from the date the revocation takes effect. www.ird.govt.nz18 Part 4 - How QC status is revoked Ceasing to be a QC A company ceases to be a QC in two ways: through a voluntary revocation or through an automatic or deemed revocation. Voluntary revocation A Revocation of qualifying company election (IR437) may be filed with us when a company chooses to revoke their QC status. To be valid, an IR437 has to be completed by all directors (by signing Section 1 - Directors' revocation) or by one shareholder (by signing Section 2 - Shareholders' revocation). Please note that only shareholders can individually revoke QC status. When are voluntary revocations due? When an IR437 is filed with us, the revocation applies from the beginning of the income year in which the form is received unless a later year is specified. We don't have discretion to allow late voluntary revocations to be retrospectively applied. The Big Bad Wolf Limited has a 31 March balance date. It originally became a QC from 1 April 2009. Later, the board of directors changed its mind about the company being a QC. A director filed an IR437 with us after 31 March 2010. The earliest the revocation can take effect from is 1 April 2010 onwards, so The Big Bad Wolf Limited remains a QC for the 2009-10 tax year. In order for The Big Bad Wolf Limited to revoke QC status from 1 April 2009 onwards, effectively as if never a QC, a valid IR437 was required to be filed with us on or by 31 March 2010. Example Please note that once QC status is revoked for a company through a voluntary revocation this can't be reversed, and the company will not be able to elect back into the QC rules. 19QUALIFYING COMPANIES Automatic revocation When a company fails to meet one of the requirements to become a QC in Part 2 it automatically loses its status effective from the start of the income year in which the event occurred. Companies can lose their QC status when there is a shareholding change and valid re-elections aren't filed with us within the grace period (see Part 3). Companies will also lose their QC status if they do not satisfy the shareholder requirements for a QC continuity period (see below). So, it's very important for a company to monitor any shareholding changes once it becomes a QC. A company can also lose its QC status when any of the following events occurs as the company will fail to meet one of the QC rules. • A new company shareholder isn't a QC. • An existing company shareholder loses its QC status. • A trust shareholder doesn't distribute all of the QC dividend income as beneficiary income. • A beneficiary of a trust shareholder isn't a natural person or a QC. • There is a variation in voting and distribution rights attached to shares. • A company has an income interest in a controlled foreign company or an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund that is a direct income interest of 10% or more. • Foreign non-dividend income exceeds NZ$10,000 per income year. Changes in control during the QC continuity period causing automatic revocation Following a law change in March 2017 a change of control for a QC will result in QC status being lost. A change of control is measured using a shareholder continuity test which requires that the QC's shareholders must maintain minimum voting interests (or market value interests, if a market value circumstance exists) of at least 50% for the period beginning on 30 March 2017 and ending on the last day of the relevant income year (known as the "QC continuity period"). www.ird.govt.nz20 Co X is a QC and has four individual shareholders for the 2018 tax year. None of the shareholders are related and there were no changes to the company’s shareholding prior to the 2019 tax year. Shareholder% voting interests 31/3/18 Amber25 Heather20 Joanne30 Stuart25 Total100 During the 2019 tax year, Joanne sells all of her shares to Brian and Stuart sells all of his shares to Harry. Shareholder% voting interests 31/3/18 % voting interests 01/1/19 % lowest voting interests Amber252525 Brian0300 Harry0250 Heather202020 Joanne3000 Stuart2500 Total10010045 Because Co X's shareholders did not maintain minimum voting interests of at least 50% for the QC continuity period it no longer meets the criteria to be a QC. If a QC loses QC status because of breaching this requirement its status is generally lost from the first day of the income year in which the change in shareholding occurred. The transfer of shares between close relatives is ignored for the purposes of this test. A close relative is a person's spouse, civil union or de facto partner, and includes another person who is within the second degree of relationship to the person. If Joanne and Brian were close relatives the transfer of shares would not cause Co X to lose its QC status. Example 21QUALIFYING COMPANIES Changes in shareholding resulting from a property relationship settlement or the death of a shareholder are also ignored for the purposes of this test. Note What do I do if QC status is revoked automatically? If a company loses QC status through a shareholding change and is eligible to re-elect, the re-elections should be filed as soon as possible, and an application can be made to extend the grace period or defer the cessation date if they will be filed outside the grace period (see Part 3). In other cases, companies that don't meet the requirements of being a QC for the entire tax year will lose their status. As elections to be a QC can't be made for income years starting on or after 1 April 2011 the company will not be able to become a QC again. Please note that where an automatic revocation has occurred, a company - or its tax agent - should advise us in writing of the event that caused the revocation and when this event occurred. Revocations and effective interest The date we receive a voluntary revocation, or the date of the event that caused an automatic revocation, is used to determine the effective interest of the person making the revocation unless a later date is specified. When re-elections are made, they are effective from the beginning of the income year in which the revocation occurred. In order to calculate a shareholder's effective interest when re-elections are made, the date on which the person became a shareholder is taken into account even if this is earlier than the date they made an election. www.ird.govt.nz22 An elector shareholder, "A" sells her shares on 30 June 2016. This causes an automatic revocation of the QC status effective from 1 April 2016 (assuming the QC has a 31 March balance date). On 30 July 2016, the new shareholder, "B" re-elects to continue as a QC (within the 63-day grace period). The replacement election is effective as at 1 April 2016. B's effective interest is calculated from 30 June 2016, even though this is earlier than the date on which he made his election. Example Liquidating or winding up a QC Once a company is removed from the Companies Register it is technically no longer a QC. However, the QC won't necessarily lose its status just because the company has ceased. If a company is removed from the Companies Register and is later restored, its QC status is considered to be continuous for that period, providing all other requirements for maintaining QC status are met. Liquidating companies should be aware that: • shareholders will still be liable for their share of the company's income tax liability, based on their effective interest in the company and regardless of the status of the company • the company may be liable for any debit imputation credit account (ICA) balance that may have been deferred. 23QUALIFYING COMPANIES Part 5 - Distributing dividends as a QC Dividend imputation system The dividend imputation system allows companies to pass credits on to their shareholders for the New Zealand income tax paid by the company. This means that shareholders get the benefit of the income tax the company has paid. General concepts of the dividend imputation system are the same for a QC as for other companies' resident in New Zealand, for example: • Requirement to maintain an ICA. • Allocation of imputation credits to shareholders by attaching a certain amount of the credits to the dividend payments (ie, imputing the dividends). • Requirement for New Zealand resident shareholders to include their dividend income and imputation credits in their individual tax returns. • The amount of imputation credits attached to a dividend is capped relative to the amount of the dividend. This is called the maximum imputation ratio, which is currently 28:72, meaning up to $28 of imputation credits can be attached to every $72 of dividends. Or, the gross dividend can include imputation credits up to 38.88% of the dividend's cash value amount. Some aspects of the dividend imputation system that are specific to a QC include: • If a QC attaches imputation credits to a dividend it must attach the maximum imputation credits it has available (fully imputed). Any amount of the dividend over this without imputation credits attached is exempt from tax. • Dividend statements must advise the amounts of the dividend that are taxable and exempt in addition to advising the amounts of the gross dividend and imputation credits attached. The exempt portion of the dividend is not included in the shareholder's income tax return. • As long as a QC attaches the maximum imputation credits it has available to a dividend, there is no further tax, eg, RWT (resident withholding tax) to pay in relation to the dividend. www.ird.govt.nz24 Resident and non-resident shareholders Dividends paid to New Zealand resident shareholders without imputation credits attached (including non-cash dividends and capital gains distributed) are exempt from income tax and do not have RWT deducted. However, dividends (both cash and non-cash) paid to non-resident shareholders are still subject to NRWT (non- resident withholding tax). For more detailed information about imputation please refer to our Imputation (IR274) guide. Summary of tax treatment for different types of distributions • Capital distributions (realised or unrealised) don't have imputation credits attached and are exempt from tax for the company and the shareholders. • Non-cash dividends aren't assessable to the shareholders and the expenditure incurred in providing them is non-deductible to the company. • Cash dividends must have imputation credits attached to the fullest extent possible. Any portion of the dividend without imputation credits attached is exempt from tax. • Exempt dividends received by a trustee shareholder retain their exempt status when passed through to beneficiaries as beneficiary income. • No dividends paid to New Zealand resident shareholders are subject to RWT. • All dividends paid to non-resident shareholders are subject to NRWT. How imputation credits are attached to dividends Imputation credits can only be attached to cash dividends and taxable bonus issues. When a QC pays a dividend, it must attach the maximum imputation credits available and any amount of the dividend that isn't fully imputed is paid tax free. The amount of the imputation credit is determined using the following formula. The lesser of: • maximum imputation credits available under the imputation system, ie, 28/72 or 38.88% • an amount calculated as: a × b c 25QUALIFYING COMPANIES Where: a is the ICA closing balance of the tax year in which the dividend was paid b is the amount of the dividend, excluding imputation credits c is total dividends (excluding imputation credits) paid by the company during the tax year. Closing ICA balance$ 3,000 Cash dividend paid to a shareholder$10,000 Total dividends paid by the qualifying company$20,000 $3,000 × $10,000 = $1,500 maximum imputation credit to be attached to $10,000 dividend $20,000 Example Amount of dividend that will be taxable The amount of a dividend taxable to a shareholder is calculated using the following formula: a b Where: a are the imputation credits attached to the dividends b is the resident company tax rate expressed as a decimal. The balance over this amount will be exempt. In the above example, the shareholder received a $10,000 dividend with an imputation credit of $1,500 (gross dividend of $11,500). Using the formula provided, $6,500 is exempt and $5,000 is taxable with an imputation credit of $1,500, that is: $1,500 = $5,357 0.28 In summary, of the $10,000 cash dividend received, $6,143 is exempt and $3,857 is taxable with $1,500 imputation credits attached. This makes a gross taxable dividend to return of $5,357. www.ird.govt.nz26 Part 6 - Imputation credit account (ICA) ICA rules that apply to qualifying companies • Imputation credits are credited to the ICA. • Imputation credits are attached to a dividend paid and are calculated at the end of the tax year. • For cash dividends and/or bonus issues, dividend statements must be completed by 31 May following the end of the tax year. • Dividend statements must show the amount of the dividend that is gross income and the amount that is exempt. • The shareholder continuity requirement of 66% for maintaining an ICA balance is suspended for QCs. • Where a company ceases to be a qualifying company there will be a debit to the ICA for the lesser of: - the ICA balance at the time the QC status ceases (after attaching the maximum imputation credits to dividends paid during the tax year and up to cessation), or - the greatest debit that would have arisen due to the loss of 66% shareholding continuity under the normal imputation rules. • A QC's income tax refund isn't limited by the credit available in the ICA unless the overpayment is part of a tax avoidance arrangement. • Companies need to record each QCET payment made after 17 May 2007 as a credit entry in the company's ICA. 27QUALIFYING COMPANIES Debit balances Because QCs must retrospectively impute dividends paid during the year to the fullest extent possible, there is also the potential for tax refunds in a subsequent year to result in a debit balance. Ordinarily, the company would be required to pay further income tax, ie, an amount to clear a debit balance. However, QCs are relieved of any liability created by ICA debit balances that are attributable to tax refunds that have arisen during the year. A company declares a dividend of $4,060 in the 2012 tax year and has a credit balance of $2,000 (being provisional tax payments). They're required to impute the dividend to the fullest extent possible and attach $2,000. The 2012 return is assessed, and the company receives a $500 refund, which puts the ICA balance into debit. They're not required to pay further income tax. The debit balance will be carried over until payments are made in later years to offset it. Example www.ird.govt.nz28 Part 7 - Taxing a QC Intercompany dividend exemption The income tax exemption for dividends doesn’t apply to QCs that receive dividends from other companies in the same wholly owned group. Any dividends received from other companies in the same wholly owned group are taxable and the QC receiving the dividend may claim any imputation credits attached. Dividends received from foreign companies in the same wholly owned group will generally remain exempt. The exemption also does not apply to companies that were previously QCs, unless the: • dividend is derived at least seven years after the company ceased to be a QC, or • company never paid an un-imputed dividend while it was a QC. Subvention payments and loss offsets for a QC Loss offsetSubvention payment QC profitA QC with a net profit can only receive a loss offset from another group company if it's a QC. A QC with a net profit can only make a subvention payment to another group company if it's a QC. QC lossA QC with a net loss can make a loss offset to another group company and it doesn't have to be a QC (eg, can be a close company). A QC with a net loss can receive a subvention payment from another group company and it doesn't have to be a QC (eg, can be a close company). 29QUALIFYING COMPANIES FBT (fringe benefit tax) If fringe benefits are provided to shareholder-employees, the expenditure incurred in providing those benefits is fully deductible, provided it meets the normal deductibility criteria and the company is liable for FBT. The benefit is non- assessable to the shareholder-employee. If fringe benefits are provided to shareholders who aren't employees, the expenditure isn't deductible to the company and non-assessable to the shareholders, and the company isn't liable for FBT. Fringe benefits may affect the tax deductibility of interest on money borrowed by the shareholders to purchase shares in the qualifying company (see page 29). www.ird.govt.nz30 Part 8 - Taxing shareholders of a QC Dividends received from a QC When a shareholder receives a dividend from a qualifying company, they'll be advised what portion is taxable and what should be returned in their own income tax return. Exempt dividends distributed to beneficiaries Exempt dividends paid to trusts will retain their exempt status when passed through to beneficiaries. Deductible interest on money borrowed to purchase shares If a shareholder who isn't an employee, or any person associated with the shareholder, has borrowed money to purchase shares in a QC, the interest incurred isn't deductible to the extent of any taxable dividends (other than taxable bonus issues). The amount of interest allowed as a deduction will be reduced by the value of any non-cash dividends (other than taxable bonus issues) the shareholder derives in that income year, eg, low-interest loans or the provision of a car. A shareholder has incurred interest of $10,000 and has been provided with a low-interest loan and use of a car with tax values of $3,000 and $5,000 respectively. The maximum deduction for interest would be $2,000. If a non-cash dividend arises because a shareholder has been provided with property, the dividend is deemed to arise at the end of each quarter of the QC's income year. This matches the timing for receiving the benefit with the deduction for the interest. Example These rules don't apply to shareholder-employees. If a shareholder-employee derives a non-cash benefit from a QC, the benefit will be subject to FBT and as such isn't a dividend. This means any interest deduction should not be reduced by the value of the non-cash benefit. The rules around the deductibility of interest include non-cash dividends received by people associated with the shareholder. 31QUALIFYING COMPANIES Terms we use Controlled foreign company (CFC) A foreign company controlled by five or fewer New Zealand resident shareholders. Effective interest A shareholder's effective interest generally means their voting interest in the company. However, where a market value circumstance exists, the average of market value and voting interest must be taken. Excluded option Any option to acquire or dispose of a share in a company when any of the following points are possible. • The directors don't know, and can't reasonably be expected to know, that the option has been granted. • Neither the grantor nor their associate holds shares at the time the option is granted, unless the grantor is the company. • The option is granted at arm's length. • The option's exercise price equates to the market value of the share. • The option relates to an excluded security. • The option relates to a pre-budget security and the option was granted before 30 July 1991. Excluded security Any fixed-rate share or section FA 2 debenture that doesn't carry any decision- making rights, except to protect the holder. Fixed-rate share A share issued where the dividend is payable at a fixed rate and isn't issued with the purpose of avoiding income tax. Flat-owning company Flat-owning companies are not business companies - they're set up to own residential property. Shareholders in a flat-owning company are entitled to use or occupy the property. www.ird.govt.nz32 Foreign company Any company that: • is not resident in New Zealand, or • is resident in New Zealand but, under a double tax agreement, is treated as not being a resident for tax purposes. Foreign investment fund (FIF) A foreign entity in which a New Zealand resident has an interest that entitles them to derive income from the fund (eg, offshore unit trust or superannuation fund). For more information see A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate (IR461). Grace period Where the elections to have a company treated as a QC have been revoked, the company has a grace period in which to make new elections without losing its QC status. Jointly and severally liable This means each shareholder, beneficiary or trustee separately, and all the shareholders, beneficiaries or trustees jointly, can be held liable for any debt. Look through A test to determine the number of natural person shareholders in a company. If a company has another company as a shareholder, it is necessary in some instances to "look through" the second company to see who really owns the shares. Market value circumstance A market value circumstance exists in relation to QCs in any of the following situations. • The company has debentures on issue to which section FA 2 applies (and that are not excluded securities or pre-budget securities). • The company has any shares on issue where a third party guarantees dividend payment. • There is an option, other than an excluded option, to acquire a share in the company. • An arrangement exists with the purpose of defeating a provision that depends on measuring voting and market value interests. 33QUALIFYING COMPANIES Market value interest A person's market value interest in a company is measured where a market value circumstance exists. At any time, a person's market value interest equals their share of the total market value of shares and options held in the company.

Unit trust Any scheme in which subscribers or contributors to the trust share in the income and gains from the trust's investments. For taxation purposes a unit trust is treated as a company. Voting interest This is intended to reflect a person's economic interest in a company.

An interest in an FIF may include shares in a foreign company, units in a foreign unit trust or an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme or a foreign life insurance policy. The FIF rules may not apply if your foreign interest is held in a company or unit trust resident in Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom or the United States. The FIF rules do not apply if you are a natural person and the total cost of your FIF interests did not exceed NZ$50,000 at all times during the income year. Cost for the purposes of this exemption includes cost whenever incurred (current and prior income years). You can only use the accounting profits method if you meet all of the following conditions: – the FIF is a company, and – the FIF is listed on a recognised stock exchange or interests in it are offered widely to the public for subscription or purchase, and – the net after-tax accounting profits or losses of the FIF are calculated under generally accepted accounting principles and detailed in audited financial statements sent to shareholders for which a standard audit opinion (without qualification) is given, and – the net after-tax accounting profits or losses include all extraordinary items, and – the net after-tax accounting profits or losses are calculated on a consolidated basis if the FIF has any subsidiaries, and – you have no reason to believe that the net after-tax accounting profits or losses of the FIF are not fairly represented, and – the FIF is not a foreign entity listed in Part C of Schedule 4 to the Income Tax Act 1994.

(8 digit numbers start in the second box.) Notes Note 1: Foreign losses The term “foreign loss” is used to describe • attributed foreign losses from a controlled foreign company (CFC), and/or • attributed foreign investment fund (FIF) losses. A CFC is a foreign company controlled by five or fewer New Zealand resident shareholders. An FIF is a foreign entity (for example, an offshore unit trust or a superannuation fund) in which a New Zealand resident has an interest. Note 2: Election to retain foreign losses or revocation of election The shareholders of a loss attributing qualifying company (LAQC) may elect for the company to retain any foreign losses so it can carry them forward to offset against future foreign income. Where an election is not made or the election is revoked, foreign losses received by the LAQC will be included in the losses attributed to shareholders, to be offset against foreign income. The election and revocation must be made by all sui juris shareholders (see Note 3). Where the shareholder is a company, enter below the signature the name and office (for example, company secretary) of the person signing on behalf of the company. Where the shareholder is a trustee, enter the shareholder’s name as “Trustees in the .....................”. A trustee must sign the election or revocation. Enter their name below the signature and put “trustee” in the “office” section. Note 3: Sui juris A legal phrase used to describe people who have the legal capacity to deal with their property, make binding contracts, and to sue or be sued. People who do not have full legal capacity (that is, non sui juris) include minors and people who have an intellectual disability. Note 4: Application date of foreign loss elections An election will apply from the beginning of the income year following the income year we receive it, unless a later date is specified. Elections received by Inland Revenue by 31 March will apply from the beginning of that income year, unless a later year is specified. For a new company, elections will apply from the beginning of the company’s first income year, provided we receive them in time for an income return to be filed. Note 5: Application date of revocations A revocation will apply from the beginning of the income year we receive the notification, unless a later year is specified. Any losses carried forward while the election was in place cannot be attributed to shareholders and will remain with the company to be offset or carried forward.

All superannuation funds registered with the Financial Markets Authority (formerly known as the Government Actuary) must complete an IR44 return. If your scheme is not registered with the Financial Markets Authority and allows beneficiaries to contribute, it will be treated as a company for tax purposes and must complete an IR4. If the scheme does not allow beneficiaries to contribute, it will be treated as a trust and must complete an IR6. Your fund may face penalties or prosecution if you: are required to put in a return but do not give false or misleading information (including not showing correct income details), or do not take reasonable care in preparing the return. All questions in the return must be completed, unless your fund is an investor fund. See the note to Question 9 on page 5. The information on the first page of the return helps us to be sure that any correspondence we send goes to the right place. Return due date If the fund has a 31 March balance date you have until 7 July 2024 to complete the return, unless you have an extension of time. If you have a balance date other than 31 March, this date may be different. Contact us if you are not sure of the due date. If the fund has a tax agent you may have until 31 March 2025 to complete the return. Contact your agent for more information. Financial arrangements A superannuation fund must account for income from financial arrangements on either a cash or accrual basis, provided they meet the criteria to use the cash basis method. Financial arrangements include government stock, futures contracts and deferred property settlements. Changes to the rules for the treatment of financial arrangements have split the rules into 2 sets. Generally, the first set applies to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 and the second applies to financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999. Both sets of rules require the income or expenditure to be spread over the term of the financial arrangement. Sale or maturity of financial arrangements When a financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment, must be made. The calculation ensures the total gains or losses from the financial arrangement are accounted for. If you need any information on when losses can be deducted, or how to calculate a base price adjustment, please contact us. 5REGISTERED SUPERANNUATION FUNDS RETURN GUIDE Questions Question 2 Name of fund If the fund has changed its name since completing the last return please attach evidence of the name change, such as a letter of confirmation from the Financial Markets Authority. Question 3 Postal address If you have a new postal address write the details at Question 3. If your new postal address is a PO Box number, show your box lobby if you have one. If you're unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealand Post. Leave this address panel blank if the fund uses its tax preparer's postal address. The tax preparer will let us know if they change their address. Question 5 Balance date If your fund operates with a balance date other than 31 March, we must give written consent for that date to be used for tax purposes. Send a written application, including full reasons, to the address on page 18 of this guide. Question 7 Final operating return If this is a final return, include a set of final accounts showing the distribution of all assets and liabilities to the date the fund was finalised. If the fund is registered for GST, or as an employer, you'll also need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. Question 9 Investor funds Special provisions apply if all the fund's assets: consist of life insurance policies, or are invested in other superannuation funds. These funds are referred to in this guide as investor funds, and any fund they have invested in will be referred to as a master fund. An investor fund that meets the conditions above will only need to complete: Questions 1 to 11V, and the declaration at Question 22 on page 5 of the return. Question 10 Transferring deductions If a superannuation fund has invested in another superannuation fund, the second fund may claim certain expenses incurred by the first fund. The expenses can only be transferred to the second fund if the conditions of section DV2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are met. The expenses must relate to developing, marketing, selling, promoting or advertising for members to the fund, or management of the fund (but not expenses incurred in acquiring any plant, machinery, equipment, land or buildings, or expenses that are not income in the hands of the recipient). The first fund must make an election to transfer the expenses. If you want to transfer expenses, please show the details of the scheme and the amounts to be transferred in the table at Question 11 in the return. 6REGISTERED SUPERANNUATION FUNDS RETURN GUIDE Question 11 Taxable income Write the fund's income for tax purposes in Box 11, excluding any income from Boxes 11A to 11M. If this is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. If the income is nil, show "0.00". Attach either: a fully completed Financial statements summary - IR10 form, or a set of the fund's financial accounts. Note The IR10 is a short form of the financial statements of a business. Use an IR10 and speed up processing of the return. We do not need a set of accounts if you use an IR10. You still need to complete a set of financial accounts and keep them in case we ask for them later. For help with filling out the IR10, please see our IR10 guide - IR10G, available from our website at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Foreign investment fund (FIF) and controlled foreign company (CFC) income If at any time during the 2024 income year, the fund held rights such as shares, units, or an entitlement to benefit, in any foreign company, unit trust, superannuation scheme or life insurance policy, the fund may be required to calculate income from interests in a foreign company or a FIF. The main exclusions from an interest in a FIF are: investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand, and a 10% or greater interest in a CFC. The previous exemption for interests in grey list countries has been removed for interests of less than 10%. More information on the exclusions, FIF or CFC rules is available at ird.govt.nz and in the Tax Information Bulletins (TIB). What to show in your tax return At Question 11 include any income from an interest in a CFC or a FIF, including any taxable dividends. At Box 18B include any tax credits from a CFC or FIF. Convert all overseas income and tax credits to New Zealand dollars. You can do this in 1 of the following ways:  use the rates table available on our website ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators  contact the overseas section of a trading bank and ask for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Australian dividends The Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 has made it possible for Australian companies to pass on credit for tax paid in New Zealand to their shareholders. If you hold shares in an Australian company which has elected to maintain a New Zealand imputation account, you may see a New Zealand imputation credit on your dividend statement. It's possible for dividends to be paid with these credits attached from 1 October 2003. Show any Australian dividend income at Question 11. Claim the New Zealand imputation credits in the dividend imputation credits box at Question 18D and include overseas tax credits at Question 18B. Note this does not mean Australian imputed or franking credits can now be claimed. Dividends received from companies qualifying for the Australian resident listed company exemption are not covered by the FIF rules. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/fif Foreign-sourced dividends Under the FIF rules, dividends received from overseas companies are not taxed separately in most instances. Generally, funds would use the default FIF income calculation method (fair dividend rate). However, the foreign tax deducted from the dividend can be claimed as a credit against the tax payable on the calculated FIF income. For more information about the FIF rules go to ird.govt.nz/fif 7REGISTERED SUPERANNUATION FUNDS RETURN GUIDE Investor funds Read the note to Question 9 on page 5 about investor funds and master funds. Where an investor fund's income has been included in the master fund's income tax return under income, the investor fund's income at Question 11 will be "0.00". In this situation the answer to Question 13 will be No. Question 11A to 11I Income and expenses from residential property This question applies to funds that own residential property, including overseas property, that have: income subject to the residential property deduction rules net income from a bright-line sale income in relation to a loan in a foreign currency depreciation recovery income from disposed assets net income from the taxable disposal of a residential property outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. Residential property deduction rules Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). The rules generally limit the amount of residential deductions you can claim in the year to the total amount of residential income earned in that year. If the deductions are more than the income, the difference must be carried forward to the next year income is earned from the residential property, including income from properties held on revenue account. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the rules if the property is: subject to the mixed-use asset rules (for example, a holiday home rented out part-time and not used for at least 62 days in the income year, or 62 working days in the income year if it's usually only used on working days) owned by companies other than close companies owned by government enterprises, or certain employee accommodation. For these types of property, any rental income or loss is shown at Box 11 and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in Box 11M. Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the rules if it is for: property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land, or other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at Box 11 and taxable disposal net loss shown at Box 11M. The residential property deduction rules also apply to any fund that has borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities with significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity - and has interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land directly or indirectly. They come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 31, No 8 (September 2019). Read our Rental income - IR264 guide for more information on: when the rules apply how to calculate your income the amount of deductions you can claim this year, and the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. What to show in your return Tick the method you have used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. You can use 1 of the following methods: Portfolio basis - combine income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio. Individual, property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option. Combination of the individual basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on an individual basis. 8REGISTERED SUPERANNUATION FUNDS RETURN GUIDE The Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 can be used to calculate the information required to be shown in your return. Calculate and identify the amounts for Boxes 11A to 11I using your chosen method/s. Write the gross residential rental income from the portfolio and/or individual property in Box 11A. Do not include rental income or losses from properties excluded from the residential property deduction rules. Enter those amounts in Question 11 instead. Question 11B Net bright-line profit The bright-line property rule needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules at Question 11M apply to the disposal of the property. This rule for residential property looks at the length of time a property is owned. If you sell or dispose of a residential property (including an overseas property) within a certain timeframe and no exclusion applies, then your profit on the sale will be taxable. This applies no matter what your reason was for buying or selling the property or what kind of buyer you are. The bright-line property rule applies if you sell or dispose of a residential property you have owned for less than: 5 years for properties acquired between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021. 5 years for properties acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. 5 years for properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 that qualify as a ‘new build’. 10 years for all other properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021. For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some standard conditions like getting finance or a building report still need to be met). This date will determine which bright-line period (5 or 10 years) applies for your property. For more information on when a property is acquired, see our Question we’ve been asked (QB) 17/02: Date of acquisition of land, and start date for 2-year bright-line test at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz There are other dates that are relevant for figuring out whether your property sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule. Generally, your bright-line period starts when the legal title is transferred to you and ends when you enter into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell the property. Where land is acquired or disposed of in a way that does not follow the standard land sale process, for example if you purchase “off the plan”, there are some different rules that apply to the bright-line period start and end dates. You can use the property tax decision tool on our website to work out if you need to pay tax on the sale of your property. Go to ird. govt.nz/brightline If you sell or dispose of a residential property and the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule, the amount of any previously denied interest under the interest limitation rules is treated as if it were part of the cost of the property in the year of disposal. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss is limited under the current rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright- line property. If the disposal is not taxable, the interest previously denied a deduction remains non-deductible. For more information about the bright-line property rule, go to ird.govt.nz/brightline or our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Completing your return Income and losses for property subject to the bright-line property rule are treated differently in the tax return. After a taxable bright- line sale: If you have net income from the sale of the property (a profit), the net income is included in Box 11B. Unless the property is part of a portfolio, expenses from other properties cannot be offset against the net income from the disposal. If you have made a net loss when the property is sold, the loss must be carried forward to a later income year when it can be used to offset net income from the land sale provisions, including from future disposals subject to the bright-line rule. A bright-line loss is not recorded in the tax return. Please keep your own record of any bright-line losses you have made. Complete a Bright-line residential property sale information - IR833 form for each bright-line property sold or disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate the resulting profit or loss. Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts, unless the income will be included in your return as part of your business income as a property speculator, property dealer, developer or builder. 9REGISTERED SUPERANNUATION FUNDS RETURN GUIDE Question 11C Other residential income Write the total other residential income in Box 11C. This includes the total from the following amounts: income in relation to a loan denominated in a foreign currency from the portfolio and/or individual property all depreciation recovery income from assets disposed of from the portfolio and/or individual property net income from the taxable disposal of a residential property outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. Write any net tax losses from disposals of rental properties that are excluded from the residential property deduction rules in Box 11M. Question 11D Total combined residential income The amount in Box 11D is the total amount of Box 11A, Box 11B and Box 11C. Question 11E to 11I in your return Write the total eligible deductions for the year for all ring-fenced residential rental properties in Residential rental deductions Box 11E. Note Do not include the amount of interest expense denied under the interest limitation rules in Box 11E. Write the total excess deductions brought forward from last year in Box 11F. Write the total residential rental deductions claimed this year in Box 11G. This amount cannot exceed the lesser of the following: Total combined residential income Box 11D. Residential rental deduction Box 11E plus Excess residential rental deductions brought forward Box 11F. The amount cannot exceed the above unless you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio and the sale was taxable. The amount in Box 11H should equal Total combined residential income Box 11D minus Residential rental deductions claimed this year Box 11G. Any losses are counted as zero unless the loss is the result of either: excess deductions released from either a taxable disposal of a property held on the individual property basis, or a taxable disposal of all properties or the last property held in a portfolio, or claimable interest paid on your investment in a residential land-rich entity. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. Write the amount of all excess deductions for the year to be carried forward to next year in Box 11I. Note 1 If you sell or dispose of an individual property and the sale is not taxable, or you sell or dispose of the last property in a portfolio and at least 1 of the sales in the portfolio was not taxable, any excess deductions will transfer to another property or portfolio and be carried forward to a future year in which you earn income from a residential rental property (including properties on revenue account). Note 2 If you sell or dispose of an individual property and the sale is taxable, or you sell or dispose of the last rental property in a portfolio and the sale of all your rental properties in a portfolio were taxable, any remaining loss/excess deductions are released and can be offset against other income. However, this does not include any excess deductions transferred to the portfolio/property. Note 3 If you want to claim that a property is held on revenue account where the sale may be taxable, you need to notify us of the details of the property. You will be stating the sale will be a taxable sale when the property is disposed of. You must be able to separately identify the deductions relating to the property. For more information read the Rental income - IR264 guide. 10REGISTERED SUPERANNUATION FUNDS RETURN GUIDE Residential land-rich entities If the fund has an investment in a land rich entity, include: interest relating to the residential rental activity that is deductible under the interest limitation rules in Box 11E interest relating to the residential rental activity you can claim this year under the residential property deduction rules in Box 11G and any remaining amount carried forward in Box 11I a note attached to your income tax return advising the above amounts relate to an investment in a land rich entity, to ensure quick processing of your return the amount of interest paid that does not relate to the residential rental property in Box 11. Questions 11J to 11L Interest incurred from residential property Questions 11J - 11L apply to owners of residential property subject to the interest limitation rules. You do not need to complete these for the following types of property: farmland hospitals, hospices, convalescent homes, nursing homes rest homes and retirement villages hotels, motels, inns, camping grounds, hostels. For interest to be deductible, the general deductibility rules must be met. The interest will also not be deductible to the extent it is of a private or domestic nature. Since 1 October 2021, interest is not deductible for residential property in New Zealand acquired on or after 27 March 2021, unless an exclusion or exemption applies (see below). For property acquired before 27 March 2021, the ability to deduct interest on existing loans is limited to a percentage of the interest incurred. For the 2024 tax year, you can claim 50% of the interest incurred from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. Interest on any new loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 is not deductible. Special rules also apply for refinanced loans and for interest on revolving credit and overdraft facilities. Any interest on borrowings above the closing balance on 26 March 2021 is not deductible. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/property-interest-rules There are interposed entity rules to deny interest deductions for a customer who borrows to indirectly fund residential property through an interposed entity.

If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7B Boxes. Note If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look-through company that has incurred interest on residential property at Question 19 in the IR7, include your share of that here in proportion to your share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC. If you have claimed an interest expense in Box 11K, at Box 11L tick the reason(s) for the interest expense claimed: A Māori exempt company or not a residential land company - The interest limitation rules do not apply to non-close companies or groups if less than 50% of its total assets consist of residential property (excluding development property but including shares in other companies that exceed this 50% test) at all times during the income year. A close company that is a Māori authority, eligible to be a Māori authority, or wholly-owned by an entity that is a Māori authority or eligible to be one is an exempt Māori company if it passes this 50% test. 11REGISTERED SUPERANNUATION FUNDS RETURN GUIDE Certain schedule 15 exclusions or property not in NZ - The interest limitation rules apply to land in New Zealand only. Schedule 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 also allows you to claim interest for the following: main home – if a portion is used to earn income such as a flatting situation business premises (for example, a villa now used as a dental clinic) except if the business premises is used for providing accommodation and it’s not a person’s main home certain Māori land, papakāinga and kaumātua housing, and land transferred as part of settlement under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/ Treaty of Waitangi employee accommodation student accommodation. Loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 - When an exclusion or exemption does not apply, you can claim 50% of the interest incurred for the following situations: loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 property acquired before 27 March 2021 but the loan for the settlement of the property was not drawn down until on or after 27 March 2021 loans that relate to the purchase of a property acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. In other situations where the property is acquired on or after 27 March 2021, interest cannot be claimed. Emergency, transitional, social or council housing - You can claim interest for loans if your property is used for emergency, transitional or social housing when leased or contracted (directly or indirectly) to the Crown, for example to Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or Kāinga Ora, or to a registered community housing provider. New build exemption - A ‘new build’ is a self-contained residence that is issued a Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) under the Building Act 2004, confirming the residence was added to the land on or after 27 March 2020. The exemption generally applies for 20 years. For more information about what qualifies as a new build go to ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential- property or our guide Rental income - IR264. Development or land business exemption - The development exemption does not require you to have a ‘land business’ and applies to land that you develop, subdivide, or build on to create a new build. The development may be a one-off. The land business exemption applies to land held as part of a developing, subdividing, or land-dealing business, or a business of erecting buildings on land. Approved build-to-rent exclusion - This applies to land that meets the criteria of build-to-rent land and is approved by Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

Profits from land sales are taxable if you bought a property (including an overseas property) for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. The profits may also be taxable if the fund: is a builder and improved a property before selling it developed or subdivided land and sold sections, or had a change of zoning on the property and sold it within ten years of buying it.

Question 11Y Tax payable 2024 tax rates Fund typeTa x r a t e Widely held funds and KiwiSaver scheme28% Multi-rate PIEs will generally use their investors' prescribed investor rateMaximum 28% All other registered superannuation funds33% Note Funds that are multi-rate (PIEs) will need to ensure their tax is not recalculated to 1 of the other rates shown in the table. Question 13 Foreign rights disclosure If at any time during the 2024 income year, the fund calculated CFC or FIF income at Question 11 you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. If the fund is not widely held or a PIE, additional disclosure is not required if the investments are in countries which New Zealand has a double tax agreement with, as at 31 March 2024, and have used the fair dividend rate or comparative value method. If the fund is widely held or a PIE you are required to complete an additional disclosure. If you need assistance making a CFC or FIF disclosure, please call 0800 377 774. For full details of the disclosure requirements go to ird.govt.nz/fif Question 14 Investment gains and losses Superannuation funds are subject to income tax on realised investment gains if: they are considered to be in the business of dealing in these investments the disposals were made in the ordinary course of business, or the investments were purchased with the dominant purpose of resale. Realised investment losses will be allowed to the same extent. The legislative changes that introduced the fair dividend rate FIF calculation method and the new PIE, mean these gains are no longer subject to income tax. More information is available in the Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 19, No 3 and No 6. 13REGISTERED SUPERANNUATION FUNDS RETURN GUIDE Question 18B Overseas tax credit Include in Box 18B any credit for tax paid overseas, including tax credits from a CFC or FIF. Credit for tax paid overseas is limited to the lesser of: the New Zealand tax payable on the overseas income, or the actual overseas tax paid. Work out the New Zealand tax payable as follows: overseas income (NZ$) ×total tax payable (Box 18A)=New Zealand tax payable on overseas income taxable income (Box 11U) Write the lesser of this amount or the actual overseas tax paid in Box 18B. Claiming overseas tax paid on offshore dividends You can claim the tax credits up to the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on the FIF income associated with the attributing interest that has paid the dividend. If you've used the fair dividend rate method then the tax credits would offset the tax payable on the fair dividend rate income associated with that attributing interest. Where there is no FIF income or a FIF loss Tax paid overseas can only be used to cover your liability for income tax payable on your FIF income. If there is no New Zealand income tax payable on your FIF investment, no claim can be made for the overseas tax paid on any dividends received from that FIF. You cannot get a refund of overseas tax paid, or reduce tax payable on any other income. For more information read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461. Note Franking credits on Australian dividends and tax shown on United Kingdom dividends cannot be claimed. Unused foreign tax credits These are generally forfeited (lost). Carrying forward any excess or unused foreign tax credits You cannot carry forward unused foreign tax credits where you have used the fair dividend rate, comparative value, deemed rate of return or cost methods to calculate FIF income or loss. New Zealand tax credits (imputation or RWT) deducted from overseas dividends Because they are New Zealand tax credits they can be claimed as follows: If the credits are RWT (resident withholding tax) they are used to offset tax payable with any excess refundable. If they are imputation credits they are used to reduce tax payable with any excess converted to a loss to carry forward to next year. The full amount of these New Zealand tax credits can be entered in the return even where the FIF income is reduced to zero or there is an FIF loss. These credits will only be attached to an Australian company or unit trust dividends. Investments in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) Certain PIEs attribute the net income/loss and tax credits they derive across their investors. Investors that are funds include the attributed income or loss and tax credits in their tax return. Each year the PIE is required to provide an investor statement setting out the details of the income/loss attributed to the investor for the year. The statement also shows the various types of tax credits associated with the income attributed. These tax credits are subject to the tax credit limits calculated in relation to the tax on the attributed PIE income. The PIE income/loss is included in the fund's return for the period including the end of the PIE's income year. Generally, PIEs will have a 31 March balance date. The amount of income derived by the fund as a distribution by a PIE, is excluded income of the fund other than fully imputed dividends from a PIE that is a listed company. If the fund is a PIE it will need to comply with the requirements under subpart HM of the Income Tax Act 2007. 14REGISTERED SUPERANNUATION FUNDS RETURN GUIDE Question 18D Imputation credits If the fund received imputation credits, it may have a net loss to carry forward. This will happen if the imputation credits are greater than the total tax payable amount at Box 18C. To calculate the net loss to carry forward, subtract the total tax payable (Box 18C) from the total imputation credits (Box 18D). Divide the answer by the relevant tax rate, for example 0.33 (33%) or 0.28 (28%). Carry the net loss forward to the 2025 return. We'll send you a notice confirming the amount to carry forward to the fund's 2025 tax return. Question 18FA Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If the fund is an "offshore RLWT person" and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The fund should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The fund can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the fund and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than 1 amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the fund and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Question 19 Refunds and/or transfers If you're entitled to a refund you can: transfer it to arrears that are being paid off transfer all or part of it to your 2025 provisional tax, or have any balance direct credited to your fund's bank account or other deposit account, for example a building society account, include the fund's bank account details at Question 19E. If you've made payments towards your 2025 provisional tax and, after completing this return, find you have less or no provisional tax to pay, the overpayment can be included in the amount we refund or transfer. Attach a separate note to your return to request this. Refunds of less than $5 If your refund is less than $5 it will be carried forward to your next tax assessment. We'll offset it against any amount you may owe us or add it to any refund. If you do not want it carried forward, please call us on 0800 443 773. Transfers If you'd like your refund transferred to another account or to arrears you're paying off by an instalment arrangement, you'll need to tell us what date you'd like it transferred. The date you choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. If the transfer is to arrears being paid off through an instalment arrangement, you'll need to include a note with your return, authorising the transfer. Please state clearly: that the transfer is to arrears currently under an instalment arrangement the name and IRD number of the taxpayer the transfer should be made to whether the taxpayer is an associated taxpayer the tax type and period, and the date you'd like the transfer to take place. Associated taxpayers When transferring overpaid tax, associated taxpayers are: a company you're a shareholder-employee in a partner in the same partnership a relative (for example child, parent, spouse, or partner), or a trustee of a family trust you're a beneficiary of. You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it's not before the relevant date shown below. 15REGISTERED SUPERANNUATION FUNDS RETURN GUIDE Transfer date For credit transferred to your account or an associated person's account: If the credit is from excess tax deducted (for example PAYE deducted) it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax it's the day you overpaid it. For credit transferred to a non-associated person's account, it's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you complete your return. Future transfer dates If you'd like your credit transferred at a date in the future, attach a note to the front of your return with details of: the amount you want transferred the account you want it transferred to, and if it's the account of an associated person, and the date you'd like it transferred. If you do not tell us the date you'd like your credit transferred, we'll transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date and tell us if this transfer is to cover a debt. Requesting transfers on the return Fill out the boxes on page 5 of your return if you'd like to transfer a credit to another account. Question 20 Initial provisional tax liability A fund has an initial provisional tax liability for a tax year if: it started to derive income from a taxable activity in the tax year it had not derived gross income from a taxable activity within the preceding 4 years, and it has residual income tax of $60,000 or more in the current year. However, there is no obligation to pay provisional tax in the year that the fund has an initial provisional tax liability if the residual income tax for the current and/or previous year was $5,000 or less. Some new businesses make voluntary payments to mitigate interest liabilities. For more information read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Print the date the fund started to derive income from the taxable activity in Box 20. Interest rules for initial provisional tax liability If you have an initial provisional tax liability, you may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date. The instalment date interest applies from is determined by the business start date. More information about an initial provisional tax liability and the dates that interest applies from is available in our IR289 Provisional tax guide. There are special rules about how interest is calculated when a fund has an initial provisional tax liability and has changed its balance date. For more information please refer to our Tax Information Bulletins (TIB). Question 21 2025 provisional tax 2025 provisional tax is charged for income the fund will earn in the 2025 income year. It's payable in 2, 3 or 6 instalments. There are 3 options for calculating your provisional tax - standard, estimation and ratio. If the fund's 2024 residual income tax (RIT) is: $5,000 or less it does not have to pay provisional tax, but it can make voluntary payments more than $5,000 but expected to be $5,000 or less, it may estimate 2025 provisional tax at nil, or more than $5,000 and expected to be more than $5,000 for 2025, it must pay 2025 provisional tax using 1 of the payment options. Residual income tax (Box 18G) is the amount remaining after deducting all credits except provisional tax payments. Standard option 2025 provisional tax is the 2024 RIT amount plus 5%. If you use this option, write S in Box 21 of the return and the amount of 2025 provisional tax in Box 21A. 16REGISTERED SUPERANNUATION FUNDS RETURN GUIDE Estimation option Your fund can estimate its 2025 provisional tax any number of times up to and including its final instalment due date. If its 2025 RIT is expected to be less than the 2024 tax, estimating may prevent the fund from paying more than it has to. If you estimate its provisional tax, write E in Box 21 and the amount of 2025 provisional tax in Box 21A. The instalments should be one- third of your estimation. If you're using the ratio option and select E at Box 21 this means you're electing to stop using the ratio option. Ratio option If you're GST registered, you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 21 if you've already elected to use the ratio option. You must apply to use the ratio option by phone or in writing before the beginning of the income year you wish to use it in. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 21. More information about the ratio option is available in our IR289 - Provisional tax guide. Interest If the fund has paid too much provisional tax we may pay interest, or if it has not paid enough provisional tax we may charge interest. Interest the fund pays is tax deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. Note Interest will continue to accrue until the tax has been paid. You can stop any more interest accruing on the fund's account by paying the total tax assessed for the period the interest was charged. If the fund has been charged interest, it should be paid by the due date for payment of tax. Election to be a provisional tax payer A fund is a provisional tax payer for the 2024 year if its RIT for that year is more than $5,000. If the 2024 RIT is $5,000 or less but the fund paid provisional tax for the year, the fund may elect to be a provisional tax payer for that year, which may affect the interest the fund is entitled to. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2024 year, attach a note to the front of the 2024 return. Penalty for not taking reasonable care When you estimate the fund's 2025 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2025 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, you may be liable for a penalty which is 20% of the underpaid provisional tax. For more information: on interest and penalties, read our guide Penalties and interest - IR240 on provisional tax, read our IR289 guide. Tax pooling Tax pooling allows taxpayers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool, and reducing their possible exposure to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest. The pooling arrangement is made through a commercial intermediary, who arranges for participating taxpayers to be charged or compensated for the offset. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to ird.govt.nz/tax-pooling Payment dates 2025 provisional tax Generally, a fund with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: First instalment 28 August 2024 Second instalment 15 January 2025 Third instalment 7 May 2025 A fund with a balance date other than 31 March generally pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. 17REGISTERED SUPERANNUATION FUNDS RETURN GUIDE There are 2 exceptions: Payments that would otherwise be due on 28 December are payable on 15 January. Payments that would otherwise be due on 28 April are payable on 7 May.

They are primarily located in subparts CQ, DN and EX of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act). This can be found at legislation.govt.nz The rules apply to New Zealand tax residents who are not transitional residents if they have attributing interests in certain types of investments overseas, such as foreign shares. If the FIF regime does not apply, other rules may be relevant and tax income on the investments. Some investments need to be disclosed regardless of whether any FIF income is derived. There are penalties for not declaring FIF income and for not making a disclosure when required to do so. We can make default assessments in certain circumstances. We exchange financial account information with many countries annually and check this against returns of income. We encourage taxpayers who discover that they have not met their obligations to make a voluntary disclosure. If one is made before we begin an audit, shortfall penalties may be reduced by up to 100%. The guide explains: • when the FIF rules apply • how to calculate FIF income and • when a person needs to make a disclosure. FIF income includes a reference to FIF losses, where applicable. Go to the glossary on page 22 for definitions. Section YA 1 of the Act is the main source of technical definitions. What is a FIF? A FIF is: • a foreign company, including a foreign unit trust • a foreign superannuation scheme • an insurer under a life insurance policy (if it is not offered or entered into in New Zealand). A FIF does not include: • debt instruments such as bank accounts, term deposits and loans as these are dealt with by the financial arrangements rules • ownership of a rental property overseas • being a beneficiary of a foreign trust • an income interest of 10% or more in a controlled foreign company • income from foreign employment. 5 When does FIF income arise? A person may have FIF income if they hold rights in FIFs which are not exempt. These are called attributing interests. There are 3 categories of rights: • a direct income interest in a foreign company, including a foreign unit trust • a right to benefit from a FIF superannuation interest, either as a beneficiary or a member, and • a right to benefit from a life insurance policy where a FIF is the insurer and the policy was not offered or entered into in New Zealand. The second and third categories include contingent or discretionary rights. Individuals and eligible trustees (type A) do not need to apply the FIF rules if the total cost of their attributing interests is below $50,000 throughout the year. Other rules may tax income on the investments. What is a direct income interest? It is the highest percentage a person holds in any of the following categories: • shares in the foreign company • shareholder decision-making rights in the foreign company • a right to receive or apply any income of the foreign company, or • a right to receive or apply the value of the net assets of the foreign company. What is a FIF superannuation interest? Generally, it means rights in a foreign superannuation scheme as a beneficiary or member, which were acquired when the person was: • resident in New Zealand, or treated as a New Zealand tax resident under a double tax agreement, or • not a New Zealand tax resident, if the rights were held before 1 April 2014 and treated as an attributing interest in a tax return filed before 20 May 2013 and then in subsequent returns. If the right to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme is not a FIF superannuation interest, the foreign superannuation scheme rules apply. Under these rules, tax is generally payable when a lump sum is received or when the interest is transferred to a New Zealand or Australian superannuation scheme. A withdrawal may be exempt if certain conditions are met. The foreign superannuation scheme rules also apply to a low-value FIF superannuation interest. This is where the total cost of attributing interests in all FIFs is below the $50,000 threshold and the person does not elect to apply the FIF rules. It applies to natural persons and eligible trustees (type A). GUIDE TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS 6 Exemptions The table below summarises exemptions from the FIF rules if a person holds rights in one of the 3 categories. If an exemption applies, the right is not an attributing interest for that investment but other tax rules may apply. SectionForeign companyFIF superannuation interestForeign life insurance policy EX 31Certain shares in an ASX- listed Australian company EX 32Direct income interests in an Australian unit trust with adequate turnover or distributions EX 33Natural persons who have rights in certain Australian regulated superannuation schemes EX 34The FIF is not a CFC, the income interest is 10% or more and the person is not a portfolio investment entity EX 35The FIF is resident in Australia and the income interest is 10% or more EX 36A direct income interest for 10 years in a New Zealand venture capital company which emigrates to a grey list country EX 37A direct income interest for 10 years in a grey list company which owns a New Zealand venture capital company EX 37BA share or option in a grey list company acquired under a venture investment agreement EX 38Certain employee share schemes EX 40Foreign exchange controls prevent a natural person from disposing or converting rights into New Zealand dollars Foreign exchange controls prevent a natural person from disposing or converting rights into New Zealand dollars Foreign exchange controls prevent a natural person from disposing or converting rights into New Zealand dollars 7 SectionForeign companyFIF superannuation interestForeign life insurance policy EX 41A natural person acquires the rights when a non-resident or transitional resident and they are a non-resident or transitional resident A natural person acquires the rights when a non-resident or transitional resident and they are a non-resident or transitional resident EX 42BA right to benefit from a foreign superannuation which is not a FIF superannuation interest EX 43A natural person’s right to benefit from a pension or annuity which was acquired during a period of non-residence and which has restricted rights of assignment or cashing in CQ 5(1) (c)(xv) A non-attributing active FIF ASX-listed Australian share exemption This is a common exemption from the FIF rules. The exemption applies when a person holds shares in a company that: • is listed on the official list of ASX Limited • is an Australian resident (and not treated as resident in another country under an agreement between Australia and that other country) • maintains a franking account, and • is not stapled stock. If the person is an individual, no FIF income arises from this investment but they will usually need to account for dividends in their tax return and may need to pay tax on capital gains if shares are sold which were held on revenue account. We have developed a tool to help you determine if this exemption applies to a share. Go to ird.govt.nz/fif-australia-tool GUIDE TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS 8 Exemption for income interests in Australian-resident FIFs There is also an exemption for a person who has an income interest of 10% or more in a FIF resident in Australia. The FIF must be subject to tax in Australia. There are several other conditions specified in s EX 35. Income interests are calculated under the controlled foreign company rules. These look at direct and indirect income interests as shown in the example below. James Stock is a New Zealand resident who is not a transitional resident. James owns shares in 2 foreign companies, which have the following shareholders. ShareholdersJapan CoAustralia Co James Stock5%8% Non-residents95%42% Japan Co50% To t a l s100%100% James has a direct income interest of 5% in Japan Co. No exemptions apply so James has an attributing interest in a FIF and will need to calculate FIF income. James also has a direct income interest of 8% in Australia Co and an indirect interest of 2.5% (5% x 50%). James’ income interest in Australia Co is therefore 10.5% (8% + 2.5%). As this is more than 10% and assuming the other conditions in s EX 35 are met, James will not have an attributing interest in Australia Co and will not need to calculate FIF income. He will apply general tax rules to the investment. This means he will report dividends in his IR3 return and pay tax on capital gains if he sells the shares and he held them on revenue account. He will also need to make a disclosure. Example 9 The $50,000 threshold exemption If ...and the ...then ... you are a natural person or a trustee of an eligible trust (type A) with an attributing interest in a FIF total cost of attributing interests does not exceed the $50,000 threshold at any time in the year • you will pay tax only on dividends received and gains from the disposal of shares (if the interests are held on revenue account) and will not be required to calculate income under the FIF rules. • you will pay tax on any withdrawals or transfers from your low-value FIF superannuation interest under the foreign superannuation scheme rules applicable since 1 April 2014. total cost of attributing interests does not exceed the $50,000 threshold at any time in the year but you choose to include FIF income or loss in a return all attributing interests are subject to the FIF rules from the year in which you opt out of the threshold, and for each subsequent year until you have less than $50,000 of interests in FIFs in the current year, and for each of the 4 previous tax years you had: • no attributing interests in FIFs; and/or • more than $50,000 in attributing interests in FIFs (note that for these years you would have been required to apply the FIF rules). total cost of attributing interests exceeds the $50,000 threshold on any day in the year. all your attributing interests are subject to the FIF rules - the first $50,000 is not exempt. Joint ownership and the $50,000 exemption If ...then ... you and your spouse/partner jointly hold attributing interests which cost $100,000 or less neither of you would be subject to the FIF rules because the $50,000 threshold would not be exceeded individually. you or spouse/partner holds attributing interests individually in addition to the jointly-held interests which cost $100,000 the person holding only the jointly-held interests would not be subject to the FIF rules but the other person would be as the threshold would be exceeded. The cost of an attributing interest is generally the amount paid but refer to “cost of attributing interests for the $50,000 threshold” in the glossary for some special situations.

If a person has an attributing interest in a FIF and the $50,000 threshold exemption does not apply, they must choose from the following 5 methods to calculate FIF income: • fair dividend rate (FDR) • comparative value (CV) • cost method (CM) • deemed rate of return (DRR), or • attributable FIF income method. There are restrictions on which methods can be chosen. If a person calculates their FIF income under the first 4 methods above, dividends and other gains are not usually taxed separately. Use the following questions to check if you are required to calculate FIF income. QuestionsI f Ye sIf No 1.Were you a New Zealand tax resident who was not a transitional resident at any point during the income year? Go to question 2.You are not affected by the FIF rules but you may have other tax obligations. 2.Did you hold rights in any of the following at any time during the income year: • a direct income interest in a foreign company • a FIF superannuation interest, or • a foreign life insurance policy? Go to question 3.You are not affected by the FIF rules but you may have other tax obligations. 3.Were your rights exempt from being attributing interests? See the table on exemptions on page 6. You are not affected by the FIF rules for the rights which are exempt but you may have other tax obligations. Go to question 4 in respect of your other rights. Go to question 4. 4.Were you a natural person or an eligible trustee (type A) during the income year and the total cost of your attributing interests was equal to or less than $50,000 at all times in the year? You are not affected by the FIF rules unless you opt into them but you may have other tax obligations. You are affected by the FIF rules and you will need to calculate FIF income. 11 Calculating FIF income A person must choose from the 5 methods below to calculate their FIF income and file a return accordingly. There may be some constraints on which methods can be chosen as shown in the table below. A person is also generally required to use the same method each year for an attributing interest unless a change of method is permitted. If a person does not declare their FIF income or files their return late, they need to use a default calculation method when they correct their tax affairs. This is usually the fair dividend rate method. We have developed a tool to help you with the calculations for the main methods. Go to ird.govt.nz/calculate-my-fif-income MethodDescription of calculationMain constraints Fair dividend rate (FDR) – annual method (0.05 multiplied by opening market value) plus quick sale adjustment The opening market value is the total of the market values of the attributing interests in FIFs held at the beginning of the income year. The quick sale adjustment is an extra amount calculated when a person buys and sells an attributing interest in the same FIF in the same income year and makes a gain. FDR cannot be used if the attributing interest is a non-ordinary share, or if the person uses CV for another attributing interest that is a share in a foreign company if FDR would be allowed. If it is not possible to determine the opening market value except by an independent valuation, the person may use the cost method. Comparative value (CV) (Closing market value plus gains) minus (opening market value plus costs) Gains are amounts received from holding (includes dividends) or disposing of the attributing interest and foreign withholding tax or other credits. Costs include expenditure on buying attributing interests plus foreign income tax a person is liable to pay in another country. If the attributing interest is a share in a foreign company, its use is limited to natural persons, eligible trustees (type B), non-ordinary shares and share users under a returning share transfer. It must be used if the attributing interest is a non-ordinary share unless it is not practical to determine the market value at the end of the year. Deemed rate of return (DRR) Opening book value multiplied by deemed rate The opening book value is the book value of the attributing interest at the end of the previous income year. The deemed rate is set by the Governor- General by order in council for the relevant income year. There is another formula that applies in the event that an attributing interest changes during the income year. A person using this method may also need to calculate “top-up” FIF income in certain situations. It can only be used in the case of a non-ordinary share if the CV method is not practical. GUIDE TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS 12 MethodDescription of calculationMain constraints Cost method (CM) (0.05 multiplied by opening value) plus quick sale adjustment There are different methods that can be used to arrive at the opening value depending on the circumstances – see the glossary. The formula for the quick sale adjustment is the one used for calculating the peak holding method amount for FDR. If the attributing interest is a share in a foreign company, it can only be used if FDR is allowed but not practical because it is not possible to determine the market value at the start of the year except by an independent valuation. Attributable FIF income method Net attributable FIF income or loss multiplied by income interest. A person using this method may also have additional items of income described on page 17. In general, the FIF must be a company, the income interest of a person must be 10% or more and sufficient information must be available to do calculations under modified CFC rules. A person also has FIF income in certain situations if they have an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC which has an income interest in a FIF. This applies if FIF income or loss is not taken into account in calculating the net attributable CFC income or loss of the CFC for that person. The DRR and attributable FIF income methods cannot be used to calculate FIF income for FIF superannuation schemes and foreign life insurance policies. FIF income does not arise to the extent that income arises solely from receiving a death benefit under a life insurance policy. This applies when: • the person or deceased entered the policy at a time they were non-resident and had not been a resident for at least the previous 10 years, or • the policy was entered into before 2 July 1992. In both cases, the benefit must not have been increased by a voluntary action taken after the person became resident on or after 2 July 1992. Market value Market value is generally the share price on a recognised exchange. Other information that is verifiable and may be used includes published unit prices or the net asset values at which units can be redeemed. Exit values that incorporate a penalty for early withdrawal or redemption are not acceptable. The market value of rights, in the case of a superannuation scheme, is equal to the total costs of acquiring the rights if it is not reasonably practical to calculate the actual value and no material gains have been derived. In the case of a life insurance policy, market value equals surrender value but only for the purpose of calculating the cost of a person’s rights when they enter the rules due to a change of residence or an exemption no longer applying. 13 Currency conversion There are rules relating to currency conversions when calculating FIF income. If a person calculates FIF income other than by using the attributable FIF income method, one of the following ways to convert income must be chosen and applied consistently to all attributing interests: • the actual rate for the day for each amount derived or incurred or when determining market value • the rolling 12-month average rate for a 12-month accounting period or income year, or • the rolling average for accounting periods or income years greater or lesser than 12 months calculated using the mid-month rate. The rolling 12-month average cannot be used for the attributable FIF income method. Examples of how to convert foreign currency amounts can be found in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 11 (December 2019) at page 2. To view the Tax Information Bulletin, go to taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz For the actual rate, we accept the mid-month rate as equivalent to an actual rate for transactions occurring in that month. The end-of-month, mid-month and rolling average rates for a selection of currencies are available at ird.govt.nz/overseas-currency Note GUIDE TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS 14 Fair dividend rate (FDR) method There are two FDR methods. The annual FDR method is the primary method for calculating FIF income. A person is generally eligible to use this method for attributing interests in foreign companies if: • the attributing interest is an ordinary share, and • they can determine the market value of their investment at the start of the income year. The periodic FDR method is generally used by unit trusts and not described further. General rule If a person uses the annual method, they will generally be taxed on 5% of the opening market value of their attributing interests in foreign companies. Dividends and capital gains are not usually taxed separately. However, this does not apply to fee rebates, which should be returned as additional income. If a person decides to use the FDR method for one investment, then they must use this method for all their FIF investments that year, unless the legislation prevents them from doing so. Option to compare results with CV method for certain persons If you are ...and ...then you ... an individual or trustee of an eligible trust (type B) your return under the CV method is less than the FDR method generally have the option of using your total return under the CV method noting that a loss on the total portfolio is reduced to zero. For all investments where you can choose between the FDR and CV methods, you must use the same calculation method and the total result cannot be less than zero. You cannot claim a FIF loss from these investments. Bill Murphy holds shares in 3 foreign companies and can use the FDR method. No dividends are paid and there is no movement in share numbers. FIF nameOpening market value Closing market value FDR incomeCV income Company A$100,000$102,000$ 5,000$ 2,000 Company B$100,000$110,000$ 5,000$10,000 Company C$100,000$ 80,000$ 5,000−$20,000 Total$15,000−$ 8,000 (reduced to 0) Example In the example, Bill Murphy can either return FIF income of $15,000 under the FDR method or zero income under the CV method. The CV loss cannot be offset against any other income. 15 Quick sale adjustment for the FDR method The FDR method ignores purchases and sales unless shares in an attributing interest are increased and decreased in the same year. In that case, a person is required to calculate a quick sale adjustment and add any income to the amount calculated by multiplying the opening market value by 5%. The quick sale adjustment is the lesser of the peak holding method amount and the actual gain. The peak holding method amount formula is 5% × the peak holding differential × average cost. The peak holding differential is the lesser of: • the difference between the greatest shareholding in the year and the shareholding at the start of the year, and • the difference between the greatest shareholding in the year and the shareholding at the end of the year. The average cost is calculated across all purchases for that share and class in the income year. The actual gain is calculated for each disposal to the extent that it follows acquisitions made earlier in the income year.

The FDR method cannot be used for non-ordinary shares The FDR method cannot be used to calculate FIF income for the following types of investments: • fixed-rate foreign equities • non-participating redeemable shares • investments in foreign entities that have assets of which 80% or more by value at a time in the income year are in fixed-rate shares, or financial arrangements, denominated or hedged in New Zealand dollars • investments in foreign entities that have assets of which 80% or more by value at a time in the income year are in fixed-rate shares, or financial arrangements, denominated or hedged in New Zealand dollars if the non-resident is not listed on a recognised exchange or is listed on a recognised exchange but is a certain type of foreign PIE equivalent • shares that involve an obligation to provide more than the issue price of the share and are non- contingent or subject to a contingency sufficiently remote to be immaterial • an interest in a non-resident that is not a foreign PIE equivalent, where the holding is a part of a structured arrangement and the non-resident is allowed a deduction for a dividend in another country, or • shares determined by the Commissioner for which the FDR method is not available. Copies of determinations are printed in Tax Information Bulletins and are also available at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz For non-ordinary shares, a person is required to use the CV method or the DRR if it is not practical to determine the closing market value of the attributing interest. A person can claim a FIF loss under the CV method for attributing interests that are non-ordinary shares. 17 Cost method If the attributing interest is a share in a foreign company, this method can only be used if the FDR method is allowed but the market value of the attributing interest at the start of the income year cannot be determined (except by independent valuation). See the glossary for how to determine “opening value” in the formula. The quick sale adjustment differs from the FDR method and is simply the result of applying the peak holding method amount formula. Attributable FIF income method Generally, the attributable FIF income method can only be chosen by a person with an income interest of 10% or more in a FIF which is a foreign company if sufficient information can be provided to the Commissioner to check the relevant calculations. The calculations can be complex and are based on the CFC rules with certain modifications. A person who is eligible to use the method can instead use one of the other methods if permitted to do so. No FIF income arises if the company is a non-attributing active FIF but a person may have to report dividends in their tax return and pay tax on capital gains if the attributing interest is held on revenue account. In general, a non-attributing active FIF is one in which passive income is less than 5% of gross income. It is possible to make an election for a non-attributing active FIF to be treated as though it did not qualif y. A person has additional FIF income in certain circumstances if the FIF has an income interest in another foreign company. If this applies, the additional amount is calculated by multiplying the income interest in the FIF by the FIF’s FIF income or loss from the foreign company. If the person uses the method, a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust is excluded from the calculation of net attributable FIF income and loss. It is taxed separately by multiplying the distribution by the person’s income interest and applying a tax rate of 45%. GUIDE TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS 18 Losses under the FIF rules If a person uses the...then ... FDR methodthe formula means no losses can arise. Losses cannot be claimed on the disposal of the attributing interest. Cost methodthe formula means no losses can arise. Losses cannot be claimed on the disposal of the attributing interest. CV methodif a person has a choice between using the FDR or CV because they are a natural person or a trustee of an eligible trust (type B), no losses can be claimed. Losses on disposal of an attributing interest are taken into account in the formula. If the attributing interest is a non-ordinary share, the CV method must usually be used and losses can be claimed. Deemed rate of return method An adjustment for any unrealised gains previously included as income can be claimed in certain circumstances. Attributable FIF income method Losses can usually be claimed but the amount is limited each year to CFC or FIF income derived in the same country. 19 Foreign tax credits (FTCs) New Zealand residents who derive assessable income from overseas may be entitled to a tax credit for foreign tax paid if the tax is covered by a double tax agreement (DTA). The credit cannot exceed the amount allowable in the DTA. Peter has some shares in Switzerland and received dividends with Swiss withholding tax deducted of 30%. The DTA between New Zealand and Switzerland limits Swiss tax to 15%. Peter’s foreign tax credit in New Zealand is limited to 15%. He should approach the Swiss tax authority regarding the balance. Example If there is no treaty, a credit might be allowed if the tax paid is substantially the same in nature as income tax in New Zealand. Australian franking credits and tax paid on dividends from the United Kingdom are not eligible. The amount of the credit in both cases is generally limited to the lesser of the tax paid and New Zealand liability on the segment of foreign income. When methods other than the attributable FIF income method are used, subpart LJ of the Act applies. The credit is based on the segment of foreign income calculated under one of the methods, rather than the amount on which the foreign tax was deducted. No credit is available if the segment has a loss. Unused credits cannot be refunded or carried forward. If a person uses the attributable FIF income method, they calculate tax credits under subpart LK of the Act as though the FIF was a CFC. Unused tax credits situations can be carried forward. For more information about foreign tax credits, go to taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz - IS 21/09 Income tax – foreign tax credits – how to calculate a foreign tax credit. Imputation or resident withholding tax on some Australian dividends Australian companies and unit trusts may attach imputation credits and resident withholding tax to dividends if they are an Australian imputation credit company. The shareholder dividend statement will show “ New Zealand imputation credit”. These amounts are not FTCs and are treated as follows: • Imputation credits are used to reduce tax payable. If the dividend exceeds the FIF income from the attributing interest, the amount of the imputation credit that can be claimed is calculated on the basis of the FIF income. If the FIF income exceeds the dividend, the entire imputation credit attached to the dividend can be claimed. Any excess imputation credit cannot be carried forward to the next year or converted to a loss. • Resident withholding tax is used to offset tax payable with any excess refundable. The full amount of these tax credits can be entered in the return even where the FIF income is reduced to zero or there is a FIF loss. Please put a note explaining this in your return. GUIDE TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS 20 Making a disclosure If a person has an income or control interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF, they may have to make a disclosure in their tax return. Each year we publish a notice called the International Tax Disclosure Exemption. This exempts certain persons from making disclosures. The notice is usually published in the April’s Tax Information Bulletin. The notice does not exempt persons from declaring FIF income if it arises. Disclosures are made as part of filing a tax return in myIR. Usual exemptions The International Tax Disclosure Exemption will usually exempt any person who: • holds an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company that is not an attributing interest • has attributing interests in FIFs if the $50,000 threshold exemption applies • has a direct income interest in a FIF less than 10%, uses the FDR or CV method, and the FIF is incorporated or tax resident in a country which has a double tax agreement with New Zealand and is not one of the following: - a portfolio investment entity - a widely-held company - a widely-held superannuation fund - a widely-held group investment fund • any person who is one of the 4 types of entities above and meets certain requirements. 21 Other notes 1. New Zealand tax residents who are not transitional residents are taxable on their worldwide income even if tax has been paid in another country. In general, the person can claim a credit for tax paid overseas on income which is also taxed here. 2. We have published a package of documents to help individuals with their tax obligations in relation to foreign income. Go to ird.govt.nz/indiv-compliance-focus The package includes: • Offshore Tax Transparency -IR1246 • Foreign Income Guide – IR1247 • Foreign Income Checklist – IR1248 • Transitional Residency Flowchart – IR1249. 3. The exemption for transitional residents ceases if an application is made for Working for Families Tax credits. 4. FIF income can arise under the FIF rules even if there are no receipts during the year. 5. FIF income can arise under the FIF rules even if a person’s shares perform poorly as a result of currency movements. 6. If a person uses FDR and acquires an attributing interest in a foreign share during the year, the opening market value will be zero and there will be no FIF income unless there is a quick sale adjustment. Conversely, in the year of sale, there will be FIF income based on the opening market value even though the share is not held at the end of the year. 7. There are specific anti-avoidance rules if acquisitions and disposals are not at market values. 8. There are various rules not mentioned in this guide dealing with change, such as a non-resident becoming a resident and an exemption ceasing to apply. In general, a change results in a deemed disposal and acquisition at market values. 9. Lump sum withdrawals or transfers from foreign superannuation funds are generally excluded from the FIF rules and are taxed at the time of withdrawal or transfer. For more information, read our Overseas private pensions - IR257 guide. 10. Generally, pension payments are taxable in New Zealand. However, some offshore social security pensions do not need to be returned here. For more information, read our Overseas social security pensions - IR258 guide. 11.

GUIDE TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS 22 Glossary Capital account When a person holds shares to receive income, such as dividends, the holding is on capital account if: • they did not purchase the shares for the purpose of disposing of them, and • they are not a share trader. Company This is a body corporate or entity with a legal existence separate from its members. It includes a unit trust and certain other types of entities. Controlled foreign company In general, this is a company in which a group of 5 or fewer New Zealand residents have more than 50% of the control interests or a single New Zealand resident holds a control interest of 40% or more. Cost of attributing interests for the $50,000 threshold If ...then ... you acquired an interest due to a share split, non-taxable bonus or similar event and the acquisition is not income the cost is an allocation of the original cost based on fair market valuations at the time of the event. you acquired an interest for a non-monetary cost the cost is equal to the market value of the non-monetary item. the attributing interest is a foreign life insurance policy. term life insurance premiums are excluded if they do not increase the surrender value. you acquired an attributing interest before 1 January 2000 you may use either the: • actual cost, or • half of the market value on 1 April 2007. you acquired an attributing interest before 1 January 2005 that was previously exempt due to EX 39 until the beginning of the 2013 income year you may use the market value at the beginning of the 2013 income year. 23 Eligible trustees (type A) Trustees are not subject to the FIF rules if the amount of their attributing interests in FIFs is below the $50,000 threshold and the trust is: • a testamentary trust: - arising on the death of a person and the current income year begins on or before the date that is five years after the person’s death, and/or - where the settlor is required by a court order to settle the proceeds of damages or compensation on the trust for the beneficiaries. • a compensatory trust, where the settlor is: - a relative or legal guardian of a beneficiary of the trust, or a person associated with a relative or legal guardian of a beneficiary of the trust, and - required by a court order to pay damages or compensation to the beneficiary. • settled by the Accident Compensation Corporation. Eligible trustees (type B) Trustees can usually use the CV method and may switch between the FDR and CV methods in different income years if: • the settlor is a natural person or deceased person and • the trust is a complying trust for a distribution and • the trust is mainly for the benefit or natural persons for whom the settlor has or had natural affection or for the benefit of a charity. Foreign company A foreign company is a company that is not resident in New Zealand or is treated under a double tax agreement as not being resident in New Zealand. Foreign superannuation scheme A superannuation scheme created outside New Zealand to provide retirement benefits to natural persons or pay benefits to a superannuation fund. It may be a trust, a unit trust, a company, or a statutory scheme (not being an arrangement under the Social Security Act 2018). GUIDE TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS 24 Foreign unit trust A unit trust is a scheme or arrangement in which funds are pooled and investors participate in the income and gains from the unit trust’s investments based on how many units are held. A foreign unit trust is treated as a foreign company under the FIF rules. Grey list company Generally, this is a company which is resident and liable for tax in the following countries: Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. Natural person A natural person is an individual person, not a company or other entity. New Zealand tax resident An individual is tax resident in New Zealand if they have a permanent place of abode here or have been here for more than 183 days in total in a 12-month period. A company is resident in New Zealand if: • it is incorporated here • it has its head office here • its centre of management is here, or • its directors exercise control here. Opening value Opening value for the cost method is: (a) zero, if the attributing interest was acquired in the year (b) the net asset value of the interest in audited financial statements made available to the general public for the relevant year if (a) does not apply and the investor chooses this method (c) the independent valuation of the market value of the interest at the start of the relevant income year if a person chooses to use this method, certain other conditions are met and neither (a) nor (b) apply (d) the result of the following formula if none of the above apply and the shareholding is the same as the previous year: 1.05 x last year’s opening value. (e) the result of the following formula if none of the above apply and the shareholding has increased: 1.05 x last year’s opening value + (the increase x average cost) (f) the result of the following formula if none of the above apply and the shareholding has decreased: (opening shareholding/previous year’s shareholding) x 1.05 x last year’s opening value. 25 Revenue account When a person buys and sells investments on a regular basis or buys with the intention of making pecuniary profits from the investments, the investments are considered to be held on revenue account. Stapled stock Stapled stock is an investment that can only be disposed of if it is attached to a right in another company. Transitional resident A transitional resident is a natural person who is a New Zealand tax resident and: • has not previously been a transitional resident • has been non-resident for 10 years or more • has not made an application for Working for Families Tax Credits.

They are primarily located in subparts CQ, DN and EX of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act). This can be found at legislation.govt.nz The rules apply to New Zealand tax residents who are not transitional residents if they have attributing interests in certain types of investments overseas, such as foreign shares. If the FIF regime does not apply, other rules may be relevant and tax income on the investments. Some investments need to be disclosed regardless of whether any FIF income is derived. There are penalties for not declaring FIF income and for not making a disclosure when required to do so. We can make default assessments in certain circumstances. We exchange financial account information with many countries annually and check this against returns of income. We encourage taxpayers who discover that they have not met their obligations to make a voluntary disclosure. If one is made before we begin an audit, shortfall penalties may be reduced by up to 100%. The guide explains: • when the FIF rules apply • how to calculate FIF income and • when a person needs to make a disclosure. FIF income includes a reference to FIF losses, where applicable. Go to the glossary on page 22 for definitions. Section YA 1 of the Act is the main source of technical definitions. What is a FIF? A FIF is: • a foreign company, including a foreign unit trust • a foreign superannuation scheme • an insurer under a life insurance policy (if it is not offered or entered into in New Zealand). A FIF does not include: • debt instruments such as bank accounts, term deposits and loans as these are dealt with by the financial arrangements rules • ownership of a rental property overseas • being a beneficiary of a foreign trust • an income interest of 10% or more in a controlled foreign company • income from foreign employment. 5 When does FIF income arise? A person may have FIF income if they hold rights in FIFs which are not exempt. These are called attributing interests. There are 3 categories of rights: • a direct income interest in a foreign company, including a foreign unit trust • a right to benefit from a FIF superannuation interest, either as a beneficiary or a member, and • a right to benefit from a life insurance policy where a FIF is the insurer and the policy was not offered or entered into in New Zealand. The second and third categories include contingent or discretionary rights. Individuals and eligible trustees (type A) do not need to apply the FIF rules if the total cost of their attributing interests is below $50,000 throughout the year. Other rules may tax income on the investments. What is a direct income interest? It is the highest percentage a person holds in any of the following categories: • shares in the foreign company • shareholder decision-making rights in the foreign company • a right to receive or apply any income of the foreign company, or • a right to receive or apply the value of the net assets of the foreign company. What is a FIF superannuation interest? Generally, it means rights in a foreign superannuation scheme as a beneficiary or member, which were acquired when the person was: • resident in New Zealand, or treated as a New Zealand tax resident under a double tax agreement, or • not a New Zealand tax resident, if the rights were held before 1 April 2014 and treated as an attributing interest in a tax return filed before 20 May 2013 and then in subsequent returns. If the right to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme is not a FIF superannuation interest, the foreign superannuation scheme rules apply. Under these rules, tax is generally payable when a lump sum is received or when the interest is transferred to a New Zealand or Australian superannuation scheme. A withdrawal may be exempt if certain conditions are met. The foreign superannuation scheme rules also apply to a low-value FIF superannuation interest. This is where the total cost of attributing interests in all FIFs is below the $50,000 threshold and the person does not elect to apply the FIF rules. It applies to natural persons and eligible trustees (type A). GUIDE TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS 6 Exemptions The table below summarises exemptions from the FIF rules if a person holds rights in one of the 3 categories. If an exemption applies, the right is not an attributing interest for that investment but other tax rules may apply.

The exemption applies when a person holds shares in a company that: • is listed on the official list of ASX Limited • is an Australian resident (and not treated as resident in another country under an agreement between Australia and that other country) • maintains a franking account, and • is not stapled stock. If the person is an individual, no FIF income arises from this investment but they will usually need to account for dividends in their tax return and may need to pay tax on capital gains if shares are sold which were held on revenue account. We have developed a tool to help you determine if this exemption applies to a share. Go to ird.govt.nz/fif-australia-tool GUIDE TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS 8 Exemption for income interests in Australian-resident FIFs There is also an exemption for a person who has an income interest of 10% or more in a FIF resident in Australia. The FIF must be subject to tax in Australia. There are several other conditions specified in s EX 35. Income interests are calculated under the controlled foreign company rules. These look at direct and indirect income interests as shown in the example below. James Stock is a New Zealand resident who is not a transitional resident. James owns shares in 2 foreign companies, which have the following shareholders. ShareholdersJapan CoAustralia Co James Stock5%8% Non-residents95%42% Japan Co50% To t a l s100%100% James has a direct income interest of 5% in Japan Co. No exemptions apply so James has an attributing interest in a FIF and will need to calculate FIF income. James also has a direct income interest of 8% in Australia Co and an indirect interest of 2.5% (5% x 50%). James’ income interest in Australia Co is therefore 10.5% (8% + 2.5%). As this is more than 10% and assuming the other conditions in s EX 35 are met, James will not have an attributing interest in Australia Co and will not need to calculate FIF income. He will apply general tax rules to the investment. This means he will report dividends in his IR3 return and pay tax on capital gains if he sells the shares and he held them on revenue account. He will also need to make a disclosure. Example 9 The $50,000 threshold exemption If ...and the ...then ... you are a natural person or a trustee of an eligible trust (type A) with an attributing interest in a FIF total cost of attributing interests does not exceed the $50,000 threshold at any time in the year • you will pay tax only on dividends received and gains from the disposal of shares (if the interests are held on revenue account) and will not be required to calculate income under the FIF rules. • you will pay tax on any withdrawals or transfers from your low-value FIF superannuation interest under the foreign superannuation scheme rules applicable since 1 April 2014. total cost of attributing interests does not exceed the $50,000 threshold at any time in the year but you choose to include FIF income or loss in a return all attributing interests are subject to the FIF rules from the year in which you opt out of the threshold, and for each subsequent year until you have less than $50,000 of interests in FIFs in the current year, and for each of the 4 previous tax years you had: • no attributing interests in FIFs; and/or • more than $50,000 in attributing interests in FIFs (note that for these years you would have been required to apply the FIF rules). total cost of attributing interests exceeds the $50,000 threshold on any day in the year. all your attributing interests are subject to the FIF rules - the first $50,000 is not exempt. Joint ownership and the $50,000 exemption If ...then ... you and your spouse/partner jointly hold attributing interests which cost $100,000 or less neither of you would be subject to the FIF rules because the $50,000 threshold would not be exceeded individually. you or spouse/partner holds attributing interests individually in addition to the jointly-held interests which cost $100,000 the person holding only the jointly-held interests would not be subject to the FIF rules but the other person would be as the threshold would be exceeded. The cost of an attributing interest is generally the amount paid but refer to “cost of attributing interests for the $50,000 threshold” in the glossary for some special situations. GUIDE TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS 10 How is FIF income calculated? If a person has an attributing interest in a FIF and the $50,000 threshold exemption does not apply, they must choose from the following 5 methods to calculate FIF income: • fair dividend rate (FDR) • comparative value (CV) • cost method (CM) • deemed rate of return (DRR), or • attributable FIF income method. There are restrictions on which methods can be chosen. If a person calculates their FIF income under the first 4 methods above, dividends and other gains are not usually taxed separately. Use the following questions to check if you are required to calculate FIF income. QuestionsI f Ye sIf No 1.Were you a New Zealand tax resident who was not a transitional resident at any point during the income year? Go to question 2.You are not affected by the FIF rules but you may have other tax obligations. 2.Did you hold rights in any of the following at any time during the income year: • a direct income interest in a foreign company • a FIF superannuation interest, or • a foreign life insurance policy? Go to question 3.You are not affected by the FIF rules but you may have other tax obligations. 3.Were your rights exempt from being attributing interests? See the table on exemptions on page 6. You are not affected by the FIF rules for the rights which are exempt but you may have other tax obligations. Go to question 4 in respect of your other rights. Go to question 4. 4.Were you a natural person or an eligible trustee (type A) during the income year and the total cost of your attributing interests was equal to or less than $50,000 at all times in the year? You are not affected by the FIF rules unless you opt into them but you may have other tax obligations. You are affected by the FIF rules and you will need to calculate FIF income. 11 Calculating FIF income A person must choose from the 5 methods below to calculate their FIF income and file a return accordingly. There may be some constraints on which methods can be chosen as shown in the table below. A person is also generally required to use the same method each year for an attributing interest unless a change of method is permitted. We have developed a tool to help you with the calculations for the main methods. Go to ird.govt.nz/calculate-my-fif-income MethodDescription of calculationMain constraints Fair dividend rate (FDR) – annual method (0.05 multiplied by opening market value) plus quick sale adjustment The opening market value is the total of the market values of the attributing interests in FIFs held at the beginning of the income year. The quick sale adjustment is an extra amount calculated when a person buys and sells an attributing interest in the same FIF in the same income year and makes a gain. FDR cannot be used if the attributing interest is a non-ordinary share, or if the person uses CV for another attributing interest that is a share in a foreign company if FDR would be allowed. If it is not possible to determine the opening market value except by an independent valuation, the person may use the cost method. Comparative value (CV) (Closing market value plus gains) minus (opening market value plus costs) Gains are amounts received from holding (includes dividends) or disposing of the attributing interest and foreign withholding tax or other credits. Costs include expenditure on buying attributing interests plus foreign income tax a person is liable to pay in another country. If the attributing interest is a share in a foreign company, its use is limited to natural persons, eligible trustees (type B), non-ordinary shares and share users under a returning share transfer. It must be used if the attributing interest is a non-ordinary share unless it is not practical to determine the market value at the end of the year. Deemed rate of return (DRR) Opening book value multiplied by deemed rate The opening book value is the book value of the attributing interest at the end of the previous income year. The deemed rate is set by the Governor- General by order in council for the relevant income year. There is another formula that applies in the event that an attributing interest changes during the income year. A person using this method may also need to calculate “top-up” FIF income in certain situations. It can only be used in the case of a non-ordinary share if the CV method is not practical. GUIDE TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS 12 MethodDescription of calculationMain constraints Cost method (CM) (0.05 multiplied by opening value) plus quick sale adjustment There are different methods that can be used to arrive at the opening value depending on the circumstances – see the glossary. The formula for the quick sale adjustment is the one used for calculating the peak holding method amount for FDR. If the attributing interest is a share in a foreign company, it can only be used if FDR is allowed but not practical because it is not possible to determine the market value at the start of the year except by an independent valuation. Attributable FIF income method Net attributable FIF income or loss multiplied by income interest. A person using this method may also have additional items of income described on page 17. In general, the FIF must be a company, the income interest of a person must be 10% or more and sufficient information must be available to do calculations under modified CFC rules. A person also has FIF income in certain situations if they have an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC which has an income interest in a FIF. This applies if FIF income or loss is not taken into account in calculating the net attributable CFC income or loss of the CFC for that person. The DRR and attributable FIF income methods cannot be used to calculate FIF income for FIF superannuation schemes and foreign life insurance policies. FIF income does not arise to the extent that income arises solely from receiving a death benefit under a life insurance policy. This applies when: • the person or deceased entered the policy at a time they were non-resident and had not been a resident for at least the previous 10 years, or • the policy was entered into before 2 July 1992. In both cases, the benefit must not have been increased by a voluntary action taken after the person became resident on or after 2 July 1992. Market value Market value is generally the share price on a recognised exchange. Other information that is verifiable and may be used includes published unit prices or the net asset values at which units can be redeemed. Exit values that incorporate a penalty for early withdrawal or redemption are not acceptable. The market value of rights, in the case of a superannuation scheme, is equal to the total costs of acquiring the rights if it is not reasonably practical to calculate the actual value and no material gains have been derived. In the case of a life insurance policy, market value equals surrender value but only for the purpose of calculating the cost of a person’s rights when they enter the rules due to a change of residence or an exemption no longer applying. 13 Currency conversion There are rules relating to currency conversions when calculating FIF income. If a person calculates FIF income other than by using the attributable FIF income method, one of the following ways to convert income must be chosen and applied consistently to all attributing interests: • the actual rate for the day for each amount derived or incurred or when determining market value • the rolling 12-month average rate for a 12-month accounting period or income year, or • the rolling average for accounting periods or income years greater or lesser than 12 months calculated using the mid-month rate. The rolling 12-month average cannot be used for the attributable FIF income method. Examples of how to convert foreign currency amounts can be found in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 11 (December 2019) at page 2. To view the Tax Information Bulletin, go to taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz For the actual rate, we accept the mid-month rate as equivalent to an actual rate for transactions occurring in that month. The end-of-month, mid-month and rolling average rates for a selection of currencies are available at ird.govt.nz/overseas-currency Note GUIDE TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS 14 Fair dividend rate (FDR) method There are two FDR methods. The annual FDR method is the primary method for calculating FIF income. A person is generally eligible to use this method for attributing interests in foreign companies if: • the attributing interest is an ordinary share, and • they can determine the market value of their investment at the start of the income year. The periodic FDR method is generally used by unit trusts and not described further. General rule If a person uses the annual method, they will generally be taxed on 5% of the opening market value of their attributing interests in foreign companies. Dividends and capital gains are not usually taxed separately. However, this does not apply to fee rebates, which should be returned as additional income. If a person decides to use the FDR method for one investment, then they must use this method for all their FIF investments that year, unless the legislation prevents them from doing so. Option to compare results with CV method for certain persons If you are ...and ...then you ... an individual or trustee of an eligible trust (type B) your return under the CV method is less than the FDR method generally have the option of using your total return under the CV method noting that a loss on the total portfolio is reduced to zero. For all investments where you can choose between the FDR and CV methods, you must use the same calculation method and the total result cannot be less than zero. You cannot claim a FIF loss from these investments. Bill Murphy holds shares in 3 foreign companies and can use the FDR method. No dividends are paid and there is no movement in share numbers. FIF nameOpening market value Closing market value FDR incomeCV income Company A$100,000$102,000$ 5,000$ 2,000 Company B$100,000$110,000$ 5,000$10,000 Company C$100,000$ 80,000$ 5,000−$20,000 Total$15,000−$ 8,000 (reduced to 0) Example In the example, Bill Murphy can either return FIF income of $15,000 under the FDR method or zero income under the CV method. The CV loss cannot be offset against any other income. 15 Quick sale adjustment for the FDR method The FDR method ignores purchases and sales unless shares in an attributing interest are increased and decreased in the same year. In that case, a person is required to calculate a quick sale adjustment and add any income to the amount calculated by multiplying the opening market value by 5%. The quick sale adjustment is the lesser of the peak holding method amount and the actual gain. The peak holding method amount formula is 5% × the peak holding differential × average cost. The peak holding differential is the lesser of: • the difference between the greatest shareholding in the year and the shareholding at the start of the year, and • the difference between the greatest shareholding in the year and the shareholding at the end of the year. The average cost is calculated across all purchases for that share and class in the income year. The actual gain is calculated for each disposal to the extent that it follows acquisitions made earlier in the income year.

The FDR method cannot be used for non-ordinary shares The FDR method cannot be used to calculate FIF income for the following types of investments: • fixed-rate foreign equities • non-participating redeemable shares • investments in foreign entities that have assets of which 80% or more by value at a time in the income year are in fixed-rate shares, or financial arrangements, denominated or hedged in New Zealand dollars • investments in foreign entities that have assets of which 80% or more by value at a time in the income year are in fixed-rate shares, or financial arrangements, denominated or hedged in New Zealand dollars if the non-resident is not listed on a recognised exchange or is listed on a recognised exchange but is a certain type of foreign PIE equivalent • shares that involve an obligation to provide more than the issue price of the share and are non- contingent or subject to a contingency sufficiently remote to be immaterial • an interest in a non-resident that is not a foreign PIE equivalent, where the holding is a part of a structured arrangement and the non-resident is allowed a deduction for a dividend in another country, or • shares determined by the Commissioner for which the FDR method is not available. Copies of determinations are printed in Tax Information Bulletins and are also available at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz For non-ordinary shares, a person is required to use the CV method or the DRR if it is not practical to determine the closing market value of the attributing interest. A person can claim a FIF loss under the CV method for attributing interests that are non-ordinary shares. 17 Cost method If the attributing interest is a share in a foreign company, this method can only be used if the FDR method is allowed but the market value of the attributing interest at the start of the income year cannot be determined (except by independent valuation). See the glossary for how to determine “opening value” in the formula. The quick sale adjustment differs from the FDR method and is simply the result of applying the peak holding method amount formula. Attributable FIF income method Generally, the attributable FIF income method can only be chosen by a person with an income interest of 10% or more in a FIF which is a foreign company if sufficient information can be provided to the Commissioner to check the relevant calculations. The calculations can be complex and are based on the CFC rules with certain modifications. A person who is eligible to use the method can instead use one of the other methods if permitted to do so. No FIF income arises if the company is a non-attributing active FIF but a person may have to report dividends in their tax return and pay tax on capital gains if the attributing interest is held on revenue account. In general, a non-attributing active FIF is one in which passive income is less than 5% of gross income. It is possible to make an election for a non-attributing active FIF to be treated as though it did not qualif y. A person has additional FIF income in certain circumstances if the FIF has an income interest in another foreign company. If this applies, the additional amount is calculated by multiplying the income interest in the FIF by the FIF’s FIF income or loss from the foreign company. If the person uses the method, a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust is excluded from the calculation of net attributable FIF income and loss. It is taxed separately by multiplying the distribution by the person’s income interest and applying a tax rate of 45%. GUIDE TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS 18 Losses under the FIF rules If a person uses the...then ... FDR methodthe formula means no losses can arise. Losses cannot be claimed on the disposal of the attributing interest. Cost methodthe formula means no losses can arise. Losses cannot be claimed on the disposal of the attributing interest. CV methodif a person has a choice between using the FDR or CV because they are a natural person or a trustee of an eligible trust (type B), no losses can be claimed. Losses on disposal of an attributing interest are taken into account in the formula. If the attributing interest is a non-ordinary share, the CV method must usually be used and losses can be claimed. Deemed rate of return method An adjustment for any unrealised gains previously included as income can be claimed in certain circumstances. Attributable FIF income method Losses can usually be claimed but the amount is limited each year to CFC or FIF income derived in the same country. 19 Foreign tax credits (FTCs) New Zealand residents who derive assessable income from overseas may be entitled to a tax credit for foreign tax paid if the tax is covered by a double tax agreement (DTA). The credit cannot exceed the amount allowable in the DTA. Peter has some shares in Switzerland and received dividends with Swiss withholding tax deducted of 30%. The DTA between New Zealand and Switzerland limits Swiss tax to 15%. Peter’s foreign tax credit in New Zealand is limited to 15%. He should approach the Swiss tax authority regarding the balance. Example If there is no treaty, a credit might be allowed if the tax paid is substantially the same in nature as income tax in New Zealand. Australian franking credits and tax paid on dividends from the United Kingdom are not eligible. The amount of the credit in both cases is generally limited to the lesser of the tax paid and New Zealand liability on the segment of foreign income. When methods other than the attributable FIF income method are used, subpart LJ of the Act applies. The credit is based on the segment of foreign income calculated under one of the methods, rather than the amount on which the foreign tax was deducted. No credit is available if the segment has a loss. Unused credits cannot be refunded or carried forward. If a person uses the attributable FIF income method, they calculate tax credits under subpart LK of the Act as though the FIF was a CFC. Unused tax credits situations can be carried forward. For more information about foreign tax credits, go to taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz - IS 21/09 Income tax – foreign tax credits – how to calculate a foreign tax credit. Imputation or resident withholding tax on some Australian dividends Australian companies and unit trusts may attach imputation credits and resident withholding tax to dividends if they are an Australian imputation credit company. The shareholder dividend statement will show “ New Zealand imputation credit”. These amounts are not FTCs and are treated as follows: • Imputation credits are used to reduce tax payable. If the dividend exceeds the FIF income from the attributing interest, the amount of the imputation credit that can be claimed is calculated on the basis of the FIF income. If the FIF income exceeds the dividend, the entire imputation credit attached to the dividend can be claimed. Any excess imputation credit cannot be carried forward to the next year or converted to a loss. • Resident withholding tax is used to offset tax payable with any excess refundable. The full amount of these tax credits can be entered in the return even where the FIF income is reduced to zero or there is a FIF loss. Please put a note explaining this in your return. GUIDE TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS 20 Making a disclosure If a person has an income or control interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF, they may have to make a disclosure in their tax return. Each year we publish a notice called the International Tax Disclosure Exemption. This exempts certain persons from making disclosures. The notice is usually published in the April’s Tax Information Bulletin. The notice does not exempt persons from declaring FIF income if it arises. Disclosures are made as part of filing a tax return in myIR. Usual exemptions The International Tax Disclosure Exemption will usually exempt any person who: • holds an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company that is not an attributing interest • has attributing interests in FIFs if the $50,000 threshold exemption applies • has a direct income interest in a FIF less than 10%, uses the FDR or CV method, and the FIF is incorporated or tax resident in a country which has a double tax agreement with New Zealand and is not one of the following: - a portfolio investment entity - a widely-held company - a widely-held superannuation fund - a widely-held group investment fund • any person who is one of the 4 types of entities above and meets certain requirements. 21 Other notes 1. New Zealand tax residents who are not transitional residents are taxable on their worldwide income even if tax has been paid in another country. In general, the person can claim a credit for tax paid overseas on income which is also taxed here. 2.

The exemption for transitional residents ceases if an application is made for Working for Families Tax credits. 4. FIF income can arise under the FIF rules even if there are no receipts during the year. 5. FIF income can arise under the FIF rules even if a person’s shares perform poorly as a result of currency movements. 6. If a person uses FDR and acquires an attributing interest in a foreign share during the year, the opening market value will be zero and there will be no FIF income unless there is a quick sale adjustment. Conversely, in the year of sale, there will be FIF income based on the opening market value even though the share is not held at the end of the year. 7. There are specific anti-avoidance rules if acquisitions and disposals are not at market values. 8. There are various rules not mentioned in this guide dealing with change, such as a non-resident becoming a resident and an exemption ceasing to apply. In general, a change results in a deemed disposal and acquisition at market values. 9. Lump sum withdrawals or transfers from foreign superannuation funds are generally excluded from the FIF rules and are taxed at the time of withdrawal or transfer. For more information, read our Overseas private pensions - IR257 guide. 10. Generally, pension payments are taxable in New Zealand. However, some offshore social security pensions do not need to be returned here. For more information, read our Overseas social security pensions - IR258 guide. 11.

GUIDE TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS 22 Glossary Capital account When a person holds shares to receive income, such as dividends, the holding is on capital account if: • they did not purchase the shares for the purpose of disposing of them, and • they are not a share trader. Company This is a body corporate or entity with a legal existence separate from its members. It includes a unit trust and certain other types of entities. Controlled foreign company In general, this is a company in which a group of 5 or fewer New Zealand residents have more than 50% of the control interests or a single New Zealand resident holds a control interest of 40% or more. Cost of attributing interests for the $50,000 threshold If ...then ... you acquired an interest due to a share split, non-taxable bonus or similar event and the acquisition is not income the cost is an allocation of the original cost based on fair market valuations at the time of the event. you acquired an interest for a non-monetary cost the cost is equal to the market value of the non-monetary item. the attributing interest is a foreign life insurance policy. term life insurance premiums are excluded if they do not increase the surrender value. you acquired an attributing interest before 1 January 2000 you may use either the: • actual cost, or • half of the market value on 1 April 2007. you acquired an attributing interest before 1 January 2005 that was previously exempt due to EX 39 until the beginning of the 2013 income year you may use the market value at the beginning of the 2013 income year. 23 Eligible trustees (type A) Trustees are not subject to the FIF rules if the amount of their attributing interests in FIFs is below the $50,000 threshold and the trust is: • a testamentary trust: - arising on the death of a person and the current income year begins on or before the date that is five years after the person’s death, and/or - where the settlor is required by a court order to settle the proceeds of damages or compensation on the trust for the beneficiaries. • a compensatory trust, where the settlor is: - a relative or legal guardian of a beneficiary of the trust, or a person associated with a relative or legal guardian of a beneficiary of the trust, and - required by a court order to pay damages or compensation to the beneficiary. • settled by the Accident Compensation Corporation. Eligible trustees (type B) Trustees can usually use the CV method and may switch between the FDR and CV methods in different income years if: • the settlor is a natural person or deceased person and • the trust is a complying trust for a distribution and • the trust is mainly for the benefit or natural persons for whom the settlor has or had natural affection or for the benefit of a charity. Foreign company A foreign company is a company that is not resident in New Zealand or is treated under a double tax agreement as not being resident in New Zealand. Foreign superannuation scheme A superannuation scheme created outside New Zealand to provide retirement benefits to natural persons or pay benefits to a superannuation fund. It may be a trust, a unit trust, a company, or a statutory scheme (not being an arrangement under the Social Security Act 2018). GUIDE TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS 24 Foreign unit trust A unit trust is a scheme or arrangement in which funds are pooled and investors participate in the income and gains from the unit trust’s investments based on how many units are held. A foreign unit trust is treated as a foreign company under the FIF rules. Grey list company Generally, this is a company which is resident and liable for tax in the following countries: Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. Natural person A natural person is an individual person, not a company or other entity. New Zealand tax resident An individual is tax resident in New Zealand if they have a permanent place of abode here or have been here for more than 183 days in total in a 12-month period. A company is resident in New Zealand if: • it is incorporated here • it has its head office here • its centre of management is here, or • its directors exercise control here.

Who has to make a disclosure and when The following people must make a disclosure. (i) Anyone who makes a settlement to a trust on or after 17 December 1987 and is resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement, and either: - no trustee was resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement, or - there was a resident trustee at settlement and at any time thereafter the trustee became non-resident. A disclosure in this situation must be made within three months of the date of settlement or of the date on which there is no trustee of the trust resident in New Zealand. (ii) Anyone who makes a settlement to a trust on or after 17 December 1987 and is resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement, and - the settlement is made as a nominee for another person or is of a nominal amount, made at the request of another person, and - no trustee was resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement. In this case, the disclosure is required within three months of the date of settlement. 2. Settlements A settlement is any transaction, action or failure to act that makes a person a settlor. 3. Settlors A settlor is a person who: - makes any disposition, or - makes any property available (including financial assistance), or - provides any service for the benefit of a trust for less than market value. This includes any person who acquires the use of any property or services from the trust for greater than market value. If a settlement is made by a person: - as a nominee for any other person, or - at the request of any other person and is of a nominal amount, the other person is treated as the settlor. 4. Documents to send Attach a copy of the trust deed and any amendments that may alter the nature of the trust and/or the beneficiaries. 5. Details to disclose At Question 5 on the front page, please give full details of the property or services and the transaction (disposal, making available, providing or acquiring) that makes the person a settlor under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Election to change category of trust for tax purposes An election can be made to pay tax on trustee income of a foreign or non-complying trust if this would not otherwise be required. An election can also be made by new residents who have settled a trust before coming to New Zealand. Making an election may enable the trust to become a complying trust. This means that distributions that would otherwise be taxable will not be taxed in the hands of beneficiaries. If you want to know more about making an election, request an Election to pay income tax on trustee income (IR463) form. You can view a copy on our website at www.ird.govt.nz 8. When a trust owes an amount to a beneficiary of the trust, the beneficiary does not become a settlor when either: • the trust pays the beneficiary a market interest rate equal to or greater than the prescribed rate of interest, or • the amount retained in the beneficiary’s current account at the end of the income year is not more than $25,000.

Name of person making this election State whether trustee, settlor or beneficiary Declaration I declare that the information given on this form is true and correct. Signature Date / / Notes about elections Foreign and non-complying trusts A foreign trust is a trust where no settlor of the trust has been resident in New Zealand since: – 17 December 1987, or – the date the trust was first settled, whichever was later. A non-complying trust is a trust that is neither a complying trust or a foreign trust. It is generally a trust: – with a New Zealand resident settlor, that has been established overseas with non-resident trustees, and has not been liable for New Zealand income tax since it was first settled – where its trustee income has been liable to full New Zealand tax but the trustees have not paid the tax. Elections An election can be made to pay tax on trustee income of foreign or non-complying trusts if this requirement would not otherwise exist. New residents who have settled a trust before coming to New Zealand may also make an election. Making an election within the time given in the table below means the trust becomes a complying trust. Some distributions that would have been taxable will not be taxed in the hands of beneficiaries. Any settlor, trustee or beneficiary of the trust can make the election. The person making the election then becomes responsible for paying the tax on the trustee income. Once an election has been made the person will need to indicate that the trust continues to qualify as a complying trust in their tax return each year or, if they are a non-active trust, through their myIR account each year. Election times and effects Type of trust that can electDue date for electionEffects of election Non-complying and foreign trusts first settled during the 1989 or later tax years that are not liable for New Zealand tax on all trustee income derived since being first settled Due date for filing the tax return for the income year of settlement If the election is made to pay tax on trustee income derived since the date of settlement, distributions (other than beneficiary income) will not be taxable to beneficiaries Previously complying trusts that are no longer liable for New Zealand tax on all trustee income Due date for filing the tax return for the income year in which complying status was lost If the election is made to pay tax on trustee income derived since the date the trustee would otherwise have stopped being liable for New Zealand tax, distributions (other than beneficiary income) will not be taxable to beneficiaries Trusts settled by non- resident settlors who became New Zealand residents after 17 December 1987 Within 12 months of the settlor: • becoming a New Zealand resident and they are not a transitional resident, or • ceasing to be a transitional resident and they continue to be a New Zealand resident Note: The period of transitional residence is from the first day of residence to the earliest of: • the day the settlor nominates to cease their transitional residence, or • the day that is 4 years after the last day of the month following the month they became resident A taxable distribution derived before the date of election is taxed to resident beneficiaries at their individual income tax rates. A taxable distribution includes any profit that is considered income, or a capital gain derived by the trustee through any transaction between them and an associated person. After the date of the election, provided the trust remains a complying trust, a distribution to a beneficiary (other than beneficiary income) is not a taxable distribution. Note: The income for the year of election may be apportioned in accordance with the formula in section HC 30(6)(b), or calculated on an actual accounts basis under section HC 30(6)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

A Māori authority acts as a trustee by administering communally owned Māori property on behalf of individual members. See pages 4 to 7 for a list of the organisations that are eligible to become a Māori authority. Māori authority members If the Māori authority is a company, a member is either a person or group of persons who are shareholders. If the Māori authority is a trustee of a trust, members are beneficiaries. Advantages and disadvantages to becoming a Māori authority Advantages to becoming a Māori authority •There is a lower income tax rate of 17.5%. •Credits attached to distributions that are more than a member's liabilities will be refundable, or can be used to cover income tax payable on other income. •Māori authorities can pay resident withholding tax (RWT) at a lower rate than other taxpayers. •Māori authorities can opt out of the Māori authority rules without needing to wind up and establish another entity. Disadvantages to becoming a Māori authority •Māori authorities that are companies can't group losses, amalgamate or consolidate with other companies that aren't Māori authorities. •When a Māori authority doesn't have a member's IRD number, a RWT rate of 33% will apply to any distributions over $200. •A Māori authority that elects out and then re-enters later is treated as having disposed of and then re-acquired all its assets at market value. Each Māori organisation will have to balance the advantages and disadvantages before deciding whether to elect into these rules. Who is eligible to be a Māori authority? The law provides a clear guide for determining what constitutes a Māori authority. Here is a list of eligible organisations. For more information on the various types and structures see pages 4 to 7.

Entities eligible to become a Māori authority (a) A company established by an order made under Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993. Included in this list are: Māori incorporations which are incorporated by an order made under Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 and adopt the Māori Incorporation Constitution Regulations (1994). Some Māori incorporations were established by Order of the Māori Land Court under the Māori Reserved Lands Act 1955. Their status has been preserved under Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993.

To qualify under the terms of this listing an entity must first approach the Māori Land Court to establish a Māori incorporation by order under Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 - see page 12 for a list of approved trusts. Structure of a Māori incorporation Below is a brief introduction to the structure of a Māori incorporation. Māori incorporation A Māori incorporation is a structure similar to a company established to facilitate and promote the use and administration of Māori freehold land on behalf of the owners. Māori incorporations are designed to manage whole blocks of land and are some of the most commercial types of Māori land management structures. Committee of management An interim committee of management is appointed by the Māori Land Court for a period to manage the affairs of the Māori incorporation. The first annual general meeting should be held within 6 months of the end of the financial year of the incorporation. At the first annual general meeting the shareholders must elect and appoint a new committee of management. Shareholders Owners of Māori incorporations are referred to as shareholders. Shareholders can be individuals, trusts or corporate bodies. Dividends are payments made to shareholders from Māori incorporation income, based on their individual shares. 5 BECOMING A MāORI AUTHORITY (b) The trustees of a trust established by an order made under Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993. Included in this list are the following trusts: Ahu whenua; Kai tiaki; putea; whanau and whenua topu trusts. To qualify under the terms of this listing an entity must first approach the Māori Land Court to establish one of the five trusts by order under Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993. Te r m s u s e d Tr u s t The legal definition of a trust is an "equitable obligation" binding a person (the trustee) to deal with property over which they have control (the trust property) for the benefit of certain persons (the beneficiaries). The trust is established by an "order" under the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 and adopts the terms of the trust order setting out aims and objectives of the trust, referred to as "terms of trust". Tr u s t e e A trustee is appointed by a court order to represent the individual "beneficiaries" interest. The trustee is the legal owner whose name appears on the title. Although beneficiaries nominate trustees, it's through the court order that the Māori Land Court appoints the trustees. The court order lists the responsibilities of the trustees in managing the affairs of the trust. Beneficiaries Owners of the trust are referred to as beneficiaries. Beneficiaries can be individuals, trusts or corporate bodies. Dividends are payments made to beneficiaries from the trust income, based on their individual shares. Five trusts approved by order under Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 Ahu whenua trust This trust is designed to promote the use and administration of the land in the interest of the owners. This trust is set up to manage whole blocks of land. The trustees are appointed by a court order to represent the owner's interest. Whenua topu trust This is an iwi or hapu-based trust. It's designed to facilitate the use and administration of the land in the interests of the iwi or hapu. This type of trust is used for receiving Crown land as part of any settlement. Trustees are appointed by a court order to administer the affairs of the trust. Whanau trust This is a whanau-oriented trust. This trust allows the whanau to bring together all their interests (specified shares in Māori land) for the benefit of the whanau and their descendants.

You must also make this application within 2 years of the month your return is assessed.

1 If you have bought an investment apartment with a managed lease, and you are thinking of selling it, you may have to pay GST. Read this leaflet for more information. GST on rental apartments Many people buy apartments with a lease to a management company included in the purchase. This often comes with a guaranteed rental arrangement. These apartments are often also sold as "going concerns" with the GST charged at 0%, or "zero-rated". This type of apartment comes with conditions. You need to know what these are to avoid an unexpected GST bill when you sell your apartment. Zero-rating Going concern - means the apartment is considered an active business. An apartment may be sold as a going concern if the sale includes a lease to a management company. The lease may provide a guaranteed income to the buyer over a set term. These apartments are often marketed with statements like: "If you comply with the conditions of the management agreement and are registered for GST, the purchase price of the apartment will be zero-rated." Zero-rated - means the price is reduced because the GST is charged at 0%. It sounds like a great idea - you do not pay GST on the purchase price and there's no hassle with tenants because the management company takes care of renting the apartment. You might also have a guaranteed source of income. If you sell your zero-rated apartment, or change your rental arrangement or the way the apartment is used, you might have to pay 15% GST and consider other tax issues. Did I buy a zero-rated apartment? An apartment can be zero-rated if both the buyer and seller are GST-registered, the purchaser intends to use the apartment to make taxable supplies in a taxable activity, and it won’t be a principal place of residence. If there is a lease in place to a management company it may be zero-rated as a going concern. When you bought your apartment, did you: • • sign a management agreement about renting it out, or • • sign any papers about tax or GST? If so, you could have been registered for GST and your apartment zero-rated. What does this mean when I sell the apartment? If you sell your zero-rated apartment with the original management agreement in place, to a GST-registered buyer your apartment might still be a going concern. In this case you probably do not have to pay GST on the sale. You may have to pay GST if you sell your apartment and: • • the original agreement has expired and you have not negotiated another lease with the management company, or • • you change the way it’s used, for example, you or a member of your family moved into the apartment or you rent it yourself to tenants for long term rental. IR498 July 2021 Thinking of selling your leased apartment? 2 Example - Bill and Marie In 2012, Bill and Marie bought an apartment as an investment. The apartment was leased to a management company and was zero-rated as a going concern. Bill and Marie signed a lease with the management company which set out conditions of use. They also signed some papers relating to GST. When the lease ended, they decided to sell their apartment rather than negotiate another lease with the management company. Their daughter moved in on a casual basis while the apartment was on the market. They accepted an offer of $455,000. This covered their mortgage, real estate fees and other expenses, and gave them a $40,000 profit. When Bill and Marie told their accountant about the sale, they were shocked to find they had a GST bill of $59,347.83 (the GST component of the sale price, which included GST at 15%). GST is payable because the apartment was no longer a going concern. The lease had ended and there'd been a change in the apartment's use. If Bill and Marie had checked the GST status of their apartment before they sold it, they may have avoided a costly mistake. What you need to do We recommend you check whether your apartment has been zero-rated for GST and talk with a tax professional before you make a decision about selling your investment apartment or changing its use.

IR4D 2017 FDP (foreign dividend payment) account return Income Tax Act 2007 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017 Notes Complete this form only if the company has elected to keep an FDP account. Question 46 - Opening balance This is the same as the closing balance at 31 March 2016. Tick either “Credit” or “Debit” below Box 46. New companies will not have a closing balance to bring forward, so please write “0.00” in Box 46. Question 47A - FDP paid In Box 47A, write the total FDP paid during the year. If the company elected to maintain an FDP account part-way through the year, include only the payments made after the election. Question 47B - FDP credits attached to dividends received If the company received dividends with FDP credits attached, write the total credits in Box 47B. If the company elected to maintain an FDP account part-way through the year, include only the credits received after the election. Note: This is the total FDP credits attached to dividends received. This amount is not limited to the tax payable on your dividends and is not necessarily the same amount as the FDP credits being claimed in Box 14A of your Company income tax return (IR4). Question 48A - FDP credits attached to dividends paid In Box 48A write the total FDP credits attached to dividends the company paid to its shareholders. Question 48B - FDP refunded In Box 48B, write the total amount of FDP refunded to the company during the year. Question 48C - Other debits List any other debits and write the total in Box 48C. Examples of other types of debits include adjustments: • for an FDP ratio change • if there is a change in shareholding of more than 34%. Qualifying companies Any adjustment required because of a change in shareholding of more than 34% is not made until the company ceases to be a qualifying company. Question 50 - Transfer to the imputation credit account (ICA) If the FDP account has a credit balance at the end of the tax year, the company can transfer all or part of that credit to the ICA. Write the amount to be transferred in Box 50 and also include it in Box 41E of the imputation return on page 6 of the IR4 return. Question 51 - Closing balance If the company has a credit closing balance after transfers to the ICA, the credit balance is carried forward to the next tax year to be the opening balance. Alternatively, if the company has a loss, it may apply for a refund of all (or any part) of the credit closing balance of payments made by reducing any income tax loss it incurred. Question 52 - Imputation penalty tax If the closing balance is a debit, it must be paid by 20 June 2017. Imputation penalty tax of 10% of the debit closing balance is also payable by that date. Work out the 10% penalty in Box 52. If the total in Box 52A exceeds $100 and isn’t paid by the due date, late payment penalties and interest may apply. For more details about late payment penalties and instalment arrangements, see page 40 of the IR4 guide. If the company overpays its tax by more than $100, Inland Revenue will pay the company interest. If you need more help, read our guide Imputation (IR274) or call us on 0800 377 774.

Look-through companies (LTC) file an IR7 income tax return each year they're an LTC. For further information about LTCs refer to our Look-through companies (IR879) guide. If yours is an Australian company or part of an imputation group, please see page 7. Non-active companies A non-active company is a company that has: –not received any gross income –no deductions –not disposed of any assets –not been party to any transactions during the tax year that: (i) gave rise to income for any person, or (ii) gave rise to fringe benefits to any employee or any former employee, or (iii) gave rise to a debit in the company's ICA (imputation credit account). These companies may be excused from filing tax returns if they complete a Non-active company declaration (IR433) form. Return due date If the company has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2018 to file the return, unless you have been granted an extension of time. If you have a balance date other than 31 March, this date may be different. Call us on 0800 377 774 if you are not sure of the filing date. If the company has a tax agent, you may have until 31 March 2019 to file the return. If this applies, contact your agent. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 6 Late filing penalties If you have to file a return and you don't send us one, you may be charged a late filing penalty. You should apply for an extension of time if you are unable to file your return on time. The penalty for filing your IR4 late depends on the company's net income. If your income is: –below $100,000, the penalty is $50 –between $100,000 and $1 million (both figures inclusive), the penalty is $250 –above $1 million, the penalty is $500. If you need an extension to your tax return filing date, tell us your reasons before your return is due. If you get a late filing penalty before applying for an extension, the penalty will stand. If you use a tax agent who has an extension of time arrangement with us and the extension is withdrawn, we will notify you that you must now file your return. Tax sparing Any company that has claimed a foreign tax credit for a tax sparing arrangement under a double tax agreement, must also complete a Tax sparing disclosure return (IR486) and send it to: International Revenue Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Group investment funds If the company's income is solely from Category A income, you must file an IR4. If the income is solely from Category B income, you must file an IR6. If the income is a combination of both Category A and Category B income, you must file an IR4 and IR44E. Read the notes in the IR44E for further information. Research and development (R&D) tax losses You may be able to cash out any R&D losses if your company is a loss-making company that is a resident in New Zealand and your expenditure on R&D salary and wages is 20% or more of your total salary and wage expenditure. For more information go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: R&D). www.ird.govt.nz 7 Superannuation schemes A superannuation scheme, not registered with the Financial Markets Authority (FMA), which lets beneficiaries contribute, will be treated as a company for tax purposes and must file IR4 returns. Trans-Tasman imputation and imputation groups Australian companies can elect to maintain a New Zealand imputation account from the 2003-04 tax year. A form of grouping (for imputation purposes only) has also been introduced, which Australian companies may join. Return filing for trans-Tasman imputation Australian companies that make a trans-Tasman imputation election are required to file an Annual imputation return (IR4J) by 31 July, after the end of the tax year. A Companies income tax return (IR4) isn't required, unless the company has a permanent establishment (eg, maintains an office) in New Zealand. Return filing for imputation groups Company tax return (IR4) Company returns must be filed by: –all New Zealand companies that elect to be a member of an imputation group and –Australian companies with New Zealand-sourced income. Annual imputation return (IR4J) The imputation return for an imputation group should be filed by the group representative on a separate IR4J return. Imputation group members should not include any imputation details on page 6 of the IR4. An exception applies for nominated companies of a resident imputation group where there is an ICA debit balance. Foreign dividend payments (FDP) The FDP rules have been fully repealed from 1 April 2017. This means FDP can no longer be included in your annual income tax return. Please do not include FDP credits in Box 14A and also leave 41B and 42B blank. For further details go to www.ird.govt.nz/business-income- tax/imputation/ COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 8 Imputation return Most New Zealand resident companies, unit trusts, producer boards and cooperatives must file an imputation return each year. If you're an Australian company or part of an imputation group, please read page 7. The following bodies don't have to file imputation returns: –non-resident companies –look-through companies –trustee companies (but not group investment funds with Category A income) –any company with a constitution that prevents it distributing all its income or property to any proprietor, member or shareholder –companies whose income is completely exempt from tax –local authorities –Crown research institutes –non-active companies –Māori authorities. If you need to file the company's imputation return before the income tax return is due, to allow a refund to be released, complete an Annual imputation return (IR4J). Note Questions 1 to 8 Company details Fill in Questions 1 to 8 only if the correct information is not printed on the return. Question 2 - Company name If the company has changed its name since the last time a return was filed, please attach a copy of the new certificate of incorporation with the name change details or call us on 0800 377 774 so we can update our records. Question 4 - Postal address If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 4. If your new address is a PO Box number, please show your box lobby if you have one. If you are unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealand Post. www.ird.govt.nz 9 Leave this address panel blank if the company uses its agent's postal address. The agent will let us know of any change of address when they update their client list. Question 6 - Business industry classification (BIC) code If you're involved in a business or a trading activity, please write the BIC code only in Box 6. You don't need to give a description. We're required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to www.businessdescription.co.nz or call ACC on 0508 426 837. It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. Question 7 - Phone number We ask for your daytime phone number so we can contact you if we have any questions about your return. Question 8 - Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, eg, a building society account. If your bank account number isn't preprinted on the return form, please include it at Question 8. If your suffix has only two digits, enter them in the first two squares of the suffix box. Question 9 Non-resident A company is a tax resident of New Zealand if: –it's incorporated in New Zealand, or –its head office or centre of management is in New Zealand, or –its directors control the company in New Zealand. Otherwise, it's a non-resident for tax purposes. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 10 Questions 10 and 10A Imputation Page 6 of the IR4 return is the annual imputation return. If you have made any monetary entries in the annual imputation return, tick "Yes" at Question 10A. If you have filed, or will file, a separate Annual imputation return (IR4J), tick "No" at Question 10. Note Question 11 Has the company ceased? If this is a final return, include a set of accounts up to the date the company ceased trading and include details of any distribution of assets and liabilities. If the company is registered for GST or as an employer, you will need to complete a Business cessation (IR315) form to finalise your records. Depending on the company's circumstances, a number of other issues may need to be finalised, for example: –outstanding returns –arrears –FBT or ACC –imputation account balances (for qualifying companies) –specified superannuation contributions –RWT on dividends –10-year bonus issues. Find out how to finalise the company's tax accounts or deregister for GST at www.ird.govt.nz A company is still a legal entity until it is taken off the Companies Register. A company can stop trading (become non-active) but still have tax obligations such as filing returns. Non-active companies can be excused from filing - see page 5. Note www.ird.govt.nz 11 Company tax return Question 12 Income from schedular payments If the company has received any schedular payments, we will send you a summary of earnings (SOE). Add up the total tax withheld and all the gross payments shown on the SOE and write the totals in Boxes 12A and 12B. The Summary of earnings (IR544) form may not contain all the company's earnings information. If any details are missing, please include them at Question 12. If the company received a payment with no tax deducted, include the gross amount in Box 12B. Mineral mining tax credit Include in Box 12A the amount of refundable tax credit being claimed where a tax loss is incurred on disposal of land or by claiming rehabilitation expenditure. Question 13 New Zealand interest Interest from all New Zealand sources must be shown in the return. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 13A. If the company has had NRWT deducted from New Zealand interest, include this in Box 13A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 13B. Interest on broken term deposits If you have broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for "negative interest". This is interest repaid on the term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare on the tax return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business- related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest amount shown on the RWT withholding certificate (IR15 or equivalent statement). COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 12 Deduct the allowable negative interest part, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Question 13 of the tax return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later tax return when the term deposit matures. Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you have paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Box 13B of your tax return. 3 Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we pay interest, include the interest in Box 13B for the income year the company received the interest. If the company paid us interest, include it as a deduction in the return for the income year the interest is paid. If expenses are deductible against the interest income, claim them at Box 19B. Note Don't send in the certificates or IR15 forms with the return, but keep them in case we ask for them. Income from financial arrangements If the company was a party to a financial arrangement, such as government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts or deferred property settlements, the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement may have to be calculated using a spreading method, rather than on a cash basis. If the financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation known as a base price adjustment must be made. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Show the RWT deducted and any income from the financial arrangement in Boxes 13A and 13B. www.ird.govt.nz 13 Question 14 New Zealand dividends Generally, dividends are taxable. However, there is an exemption for dividends paid between members of a wholly owned group. To work out the total gross dividends, add up all net dividends received, any imputation credits, and any RWT deductions. Write the total of all dividends in Box 14B. The FDP rules have been fully repealed from 1 April 2017. Don’t include any FDP credits in box 14A. Note Dividend tax credits The total tax credits for dividends (i.e. imputation credits) you can claim is limited to the income tax payable (28%) on each dividend the company receives. This is to ensure that surplus tax credits are not used to shelter tax on other income. Work out whether you need to apply this limitation to the dividend tax credits you will claim. Copy your total gross dividends (calculated for each dividend that had an imputation credit) from Box 14B to Box 1. 1 Multiply Box 1 by 0.28 (28%), and write the result in Box 2. 2 Write your total dividend tax credits (calculated for that dividend) in Box 3. 3 For each dividend, claim a dividend tax credit for the lower amount shown in Box 2 or Box 3. Write the total dividend imputation credits you are allowed to claim in Box 14. In Box 14A write the sum of your total dividend RWT credits you are allowed to claim. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 14 If expenses are deductible against the dividend income, claim them at Box 19B. Note Unit trusts Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable. The statement you receive from the unit trust should show the amounts to include in the return. For unit trusts that are also portfolio investment entities (PIEs) see page 19. Transfer of deductible expenses between member and master funds From the 2002-03 income year a member fund may, in certain circumstances, elect to transfer deductible expenses to a master fund. The master fund must invest, in whole or in part, in the member fund. The master fund can then deduct the transferred expenses. A member fund can include a group investment fund that derives Category A income, a public unit trust or a superannuation fund. A master fund can include a group investment fund that derives Category A income or a public unit trust. A public unit trust includes: –retail unit trusts, whose units are offered to the public and which have 100 or more unit holders –wholesale unit trusts, whose units are held by widely held investment vehicles such as other unit trusts or superannuation funds. Member or master funds wanting to take advantage of this provision should include details of the adjustment in a tax reconciliation statement accompanying the return. The information should accompany the returns of both funds involved in the transfer. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). www.ird.govt.nz 15 Qualifying companies Generally, if a qualifying company is a shareholder in a company that isn't a qualifying company, all dividends the qualifying company derives from the other company are taxable. Dividends derived by a company (that has been a qualifying company at any time before deriving the dividends) are taxable. If a qualifying company is a shareholder in another qualifying company, only dividends with imputation credits attached and a return of a 10-year bonus issue before the 10-year period expires, are taxable. Dividends with no imputation credits attached, or a return of a 10-year bonus issue 10 years from the payment date, are exempt income. A distribution of a 10-year bonus issue before the 10-year period has expired, made when the company winds up, isn't taxable. If you need more help, read our guide Qualifying companies (IR435). Don't send in the dividend statements with the return, but keep them in case we ask for them. Question 15 Ma ̄ori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 15 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Māori authority credit and is part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, so the distributions are not taxed twice. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 16 What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: –the distribution made to you, including the taxable portion and the non-taxable portion –Māori authority credit. These amounts, not including any non-taxable distribution, will need to be transferred to the relevant boxes at Question 15. A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. It pays tax on this profit of $1,750 (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distributes the entire profit to its 10 members. Each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority liable to file an IR4 return would show the following information at Question 15: Box 15B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) Box 15A - $175 Example Question 16 Partnership, estate or trust income If the company received any income from a partnership, estate or trust, write any tax credits in Box 16A and the income totals in Box 16B. Don't include any: –overseas income - show this at Question 18 along with any credits attached –dividend imputation credits attached to dividends (include these in Box 14, RWT withheld in Box 14A and the gross dividend in Box 14B). Add up any other tax credits from partnerships, estates or trusts and write the total in Box 16A. Add up all the other income from partnerships, estates or trusts and write the total in Box 16B. www.ird.govt.nz 17 Losses from limited partnerships If the company is claiming a loss from a limited partnership and you need help working out the amount you can claim, please go to www.ird.govt.nz Estate or trust income If you received a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust, please attach a note with your return giving details of the amount and any associated tax credits. We separate taxable distributions from a non-complying trust because they are taxed at a different rate. We need these details to work out your tax liability correctly. Question 18 Overseas income If your company received income from or while based overseas, between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018, show it in New Zealand dollars at Box 18B. If the company is a New Zealand resident for tax purposes, you must include any foreign contract or service income in Box 18B. Foreign investment fund (FIF) If the company held rights, such as shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, unit trust, superannuation scheme or life insurance policy, at any time during the 2018 income year, you may be required to calculate FIF income or loss. If the company has an interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC), they must calculate any attributed income or loss from that interest. Generally, the company will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The main exclusions from an interest in an FIF are: –investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts –interest in certain Australian unit trusts COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 18 –limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand) –a 10% or greater interest in a CFC. CFC income and losses New rules were introduced in 2009 for calculating income or losses from a CFC. If the company has an interest in a CFC, they must calculate any attributed income or loss from that interest. Losses from a CFC can't be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses carried forward to the next tax year. Generally, these losses can only offset income or future income from CFCs resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. When CFC income or losses are calculated under the new rules, transitional rules apply to the use of carried forward losses incurred under the old rules. You can find more information on the rules at www.ird.govt.nz and in our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 21, No 8 (October/November 2009). What to show in your return You can convert all overseas income and tax credits to New Zealand dollars by: • using the rates table available on our website (search keywords: overseas currencies) • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. If the income was received from a financial arrangement, refer to Determination G9A or G9C under section 90 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Write the total of the allowable overseas tax paid in Box 18A. Include in Box 18B income before the deduction of any tax. www.ird.govt.nz 19 Credit for tax paid overseas will be limited to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on that income. Please note that Australian franking credits or tax credits on dividends from the United Kingdom can't be claimed. Staple proof of tax paid overseas to the top of page 3 of the return. Foreign tax credits attached to dividends that are not required to be returned under the FIF rules can be claimed up to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on the FIF interest. Some foreign dividends have New Zealand imputation credits attached or New Zealand RWT deducted. These credits are not subject to the foreign tax credit limitation rule. Investments in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) Certain PIEs attribute their net income/loss and tax credits to the investors. Companies that are investors include the attributed income or loss in their tax return. Each year, the PIE is required to provide an investor statement setting out the details of the income/loss attributed to the investor for the year. The statement also shows the various types of tax credits associated with the income that has been attributed. These tax credits are subject to the tax credit limits calculated in relation to the tax on the attributed PIE income. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the company's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. Generally, PIEs have a 31 March balance date. The amount of income the company derives as a distribution by a PIE is excluded income unless it is fully imputed dividends from a listed PIE. Dividends from these PIEs are not liable for RWT. For more information, go to www.ird.govt.nz or read our guides, Information for companies that invest in PIEs (IR857) and Portfolio investment entity: a guide for PIEs (IR860). COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 20 Question 19 Business or rental income Write the net profit or loss in Box 19B. This is the amount of income or loss after the deduction of all allowable business expenditure, including shareholders' salaries paid or credited. Also include any net rental income or loss in Box 19B. Don't include any income already shown at Questions 12 to 16, losses from CFCs (see the notes to Question 34 on page 37) or claim donations here (see the notes to Question 23 on page 25). If expenses are deductible against income declared in Questions 12 to 14, claim them here. Note Attach either: –a fully completed Financial statements summary (IR10) form, or –the company's financial accounts. The IR10 is a statistics form that sets out a general summary of information from the financial accounts. If you complete an IR10 you don't need to send the financial accounts as well. You still need to complete them (unless the company is very small) and keep them in case we ask for them. Very small companies are not required to prepare financial accounts if these conditions apply during the income year. The company: • is not part of a group • has not derived income over $30,000 • has not incurred expenditure over $30,000. Companies that don't prepare financial accounts must fill in an IR10 using information from their trial balance or financial records. For more information about who has to prepare financial accounts and minimum financial reporting requirements, go to our website at www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: financial reporting). www.ird.govt.nz 21 The attribution rule Under the attribution rule, anyone whose actions cause an "associated person" (company, trust or partnership) to earn income, can be personally liable for tax on that income. If this rule applies to persons associated to your organisation, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. To find out how to apply this rule, please refer to our Ta x Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000) and Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). Question 20 Insurance premiums paid to an overseas insurer Special rules apply to any company paying a premium, including a reinsurance premium, to a non-resident insurer. If you're paying a premium to a non-resident insurer you need to get a separate IRD number to account for the tax on the premium income. This is because you're considered to be the insurer's agent. You will need to file an IR4 return under this separate IRD number and declare premiums paid as the only income received. Only 10% of the total gross premiums paid to overseas insurers is subject to the company tax rate of 28%. This equals 2.8% of the total premiums paid. Any premiums paid to insurers in Switzerland aren't subject to tax in New Zealand and should be deducted from the total gross premiums paid. Agency obligations also extend to other New Zealand residents, eg, brokers, who may initially collect premiums for payment to the non-resident insurer. If there is any default, the insured person is responsible for the tax. Print the gross amount of premiums paid to a non-resident insurer in Box 20. Print the gross amount of premiums paid to Switzerland in Box 20A. Deduct the figure in Box 20A from Box 20 and multiply the net amount by 0.1 (10%). Print your answer in Box 20B and copy this amount to Box 28. No other income should be returned as an agent for an overseas insurer. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 22 The company still needs to declare other income under its original IRD number. If you have any enquiries, contact: Large Enterprises Services Investigations and Advice Private Bag 39984 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 Phone 0800 443 773 Question 21 Other income Show any other income received by the company at Question 21. For example, the sale of: –land and/or buildings –shares or other property –securities –income from an undertaking or scheme. The following notes explain what you need to do if the company received any of the types of income listed above. Income from sale of land and/or buildings The profits are taxable if the company bought a property for the purpose of reselling it or is in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. If the company purchased a residential property on or after 1 October 2015 and sold/disposed of it within two years, any profit will be taxable, whether the intention at the time of purchase was for resale or not. The profits may be taxable if the company: –is a building company and improved a property before selling it –developed or subdivided land and sold sections –had a change of zoning on company property and sold it within 10 years of buying it. www.ird.govt.nz 23 If the company is a New Zealand tax resident it will need to pay tax on its worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales worldwide whether caught under the bright-line test for residential property sales or the other property rules. Complete a Property sale information (IR833) form for each property sold/disposed of and include it with the return. The form explains how to calculate and correctly return the resulting profit or loss. The form can be downloaded from our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: IR833). Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary (IR10) or set of accounts. Print the total profit in Box 21B. If you're not sure if the income from the sale of land or buildings is taxable, please call us. Income from sale of non-FIF shares or other property Profits from the sale of shares and other property are taxable if the company: –buys and sells shares or other property as a business, or –buys shares or other property for the purpose of resale. This does not apply if shares are FIFs. List the details of income and expenses from these sales on a sheet of paper and staple it to the top of page 3 of the return. Include the total profit in Box 21B. Losses from sale of land, buildings, non-FIF shares or other property If the company has made a loss from the sale of an asset that was not an FIF and you can show that if it had made a profit it would have been taxable, you may be able to claim the loss as a deduction. If the property was purchased on or after 1 October 2015 with no intention to sell and it was sold/ disposed of within two years, any excess deductions can't be claimed unless they can be offset against net income from other property sales. The Property sale information (IR833) form has more information on this. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 24 For more information on property sales see our guide Buying and selling residential property (IR313). Show the loss at Box 21B. Financial arrangements A company must account for income from financial arrangements on an accrual basis. Financial arrangements include government stock, futures contracts and deferred property settlements, excluding short-term agreements for sale and purchase of property. Changes to the rules for the treatment of financial arrangements have split the rules into two sets. Generally, the first set applies to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 and the second applies to financial arrangements entered into on or after that date. Both sets of rules require the income or expenditure to be spread over the term of the financial arrangement. This applies in every case - the company doesn't have to be in the business of buying or selling financial arrangements, or be intending to sell, as it would with shares. The company may, in certain cases, deduct any losses. Sale or maturity of financial arrangements When a financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment, must be made. The calculation ensures that the total gains or losses from the financial arrangement are accounted for. If you need any information on when losses can be deducted or how to calculate a base price adjustment, please call us on 0800 443 773. Income from an undertaking or scheme Profits from any undertaking or scheme entered into for the purpose of making a profit are taxable. Describe the undertaking or scheme and list the details of income and expenses from them. Staple this information to the top of page 3 of the return and include the total profit in Box 21B. www.ird.govt.nz 25 Question 21BA Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If the company is an “offshore RLWT person” and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The company should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The company can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than one amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Question 23 Donations A company (including an unlisted company with five or fewer shareholders) can claim a deduction for donations it makes to any society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund that has donee organisation status. You can view the list of these organisations at www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: donee). State-funded tertiary education institutions, state schools and state-integrated schools don't have to be approved to have donee organisation status. Note The deduction for donations can't be more than the company's net income after expenses (before the donation deduction is taken into account). Use the following steps to calculate the company's donation deduction. • If the amount in Box 22 is a loss, print nil in Box 23B. • If the donations made by the company exceed the amount in Box 22, copy the amount in Box 22 to Box 23B. • If the donations made by the company don't exceed the amount in Box 22, print the amount of the donations in Box 23B. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 26 Question 25 Net losses brought forward Losses from CFCs are not included in Box 25 - see Question 36 on page 38. Before a company is allowed to carry forward net losses, 49% continuity of minimum voting interest or market value interest must be maintained by a group of persons at all times, from the beginning of the year of net loss to the end of the year of carrying it forward (the continuity period). To check whether the shareholder continuity requirements have been met, use the lowest percentage of economic interest held by each shareholder during the continuity period. To calculate the total lowest economic interest see Question 38 on page 39. There are two types of net losses - specified activity net losses and other net losses. Specified activity net losses These are net losses incurred before the 1991 income year, limited to $10,000. If the company made a profit from a specified activity, it can offset it without limitation against net losses brought forward from this activity. If the net losses exceed the profit, it can offset up to $10,000 against other income in the return. Other net losses Other net losses are all those incurred from the 1991 income year onwards (including any net loss arising from excess imputation credits) and any net losses that were not limited before 1991. Write the total of all specified activity net losses and other net losses the company can bring forward to 2018 in Box 25A, and the amount the company has offset against 2018 income in Box 25B. If the company can't offset any net losses in the 2018 income year, write "0.00" in Box 25B. www.ird.govt.nz 27 You should be able to find the amount of net loss the company has to bring forward on the loss notice sent to you with the company's 2017 income tax assessment. If you don't have a loss notice, enter the details from your own records. Note Question 26 Total income after net losses brought forward If Box 24 is a net loss, add Box 24 and Box 25A (amount brought forward), and print your answer in Box 26. If Box 24 is a profit and is less than the amount in Box 25A, print the difference between Boxes 24 and 25A in Box 26. This is the total available net loss before net losses and/or subvention payments to or from other companies. Question 27 Net losses and subvention payments To offset net losses there must be a common shareholding of at least 66%, and 66% continuity of minimum voting interest must also be maintained (or 66% market value interest if a market value circumstance exists). To calculate voting or market value interest see Question 38 on page 39. To offset a net loss incurred during a current income year, the loss company and the profit company must be members of the same group at all times for that income year. To offset a net loss brought forward, the loss company and the profit company must be members of the same group of companies for the entire period, beginning with the income year the net loss is incurred in and ending with the year of offset. The amount of loss offset cannot exceed the taxable income of the profit company and neither may the amount of loss to be offset exceed the net loss of the loss company. Record individual details of the losses claimed or transferred and subvention payments received or made at Questions 39E or 39F. The total of these must equal Boxes 27 or 27A respectively. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 28 Part-year grouping The general part-year grouping rule is that only the part of the net loss incurred in the same period as the profit is derived may be offset, if, during the period: –the loss company maintains continuity of shareholding, and –commonality of shareholding between loss and profit companies has been maintained. Net loss and profit amounts allowed to be offset are based on periods where continuity and commonality requirements are met for all companies taking part in a part-year grouping arrangement. If the company received net losses from another company or made a subvention payment to another company, put a minus sign in the relevant last box. Attach a schedule setting out the names and IRD numbers of the companies and the amount of the payment or loss. Qualifying companies Net losses are restricted for grouping and subvention payment purposes. A qualifying company loss can be offset against any group company profit (including non-qualifying company profits). Question 29E Foreign investor tax credit The foreign investor tax credit rules reduce the combined income tax and NRWT imposed on foreign investors with interests in a New Zealand company. See Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008) for details about the change of company tax rate. A company is entitled to a foreign investor tax credit when it pays a supplementary dividend of the same amount to its non-resident shareholders. The foreign investor tax credit can then be offset against the company's income tax liability. The foreign investor tax credit arises in the income year the supplementary dividend is paid and is to be offset in the following order: 1. Against the company's income tax payable for the year the supplementary dividend is paid. Enter this amount in Box 29E. www.ird.govt.nz 29 2. At the company's election, either: - against the company's income tax liability for any of the previous four income years, or - against the income tax liability for another company in the same wholly owned group of companies for the year the supplementary dividend is paid in or any of the previous four income years. 3. Carried forward to subsequent years for offset against the tax liability of the company or another company in the same wholly owned group of companies. If the company has a foreign investor tax credit that can't be fully offset against its own income tax liability in the income year the supplementary dividend is paid, attach a note to the front of the return giving details of how to treat any excess credit. Question 29G Imputation credits If the company has imputation credits, it may have a net loss to carry forward. This will happen if the company's total imputation credits are greater than the tax payable at Box 29F. To calculate the net loss to carry forward, subtract the amount at Box 29F from the total imputation credits (Box 29G) and divide the answer by 0.28 (28%). If the deemed net loss is to be offset to other companies within the same group (rather than carried forward), reduce the amount of net loss shown at Box 27 by the amount offset. Question 30 Refunds and/or transfers If you want your refund transferred to another account or to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement, please tell us the date you would like this done. The date you can choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 30 If the transfer is to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement, you'll need to include a note with your return authorising the transfer and giving the following information: –that the transfer is to arrears currently under an instalment arrangement –the name and IRD number of the taxpayer the transfer should be made to –whether the taxpayer is an "associated taxpayer" –the tax type and period –the date you want the transfer to take place. Note Question 30B Associated taxpayers For companies, the following persons are associated taxpayers for the purposes of transferring overpaid tax: –another company in the same group of companies –a shareholder-employee of the company –a partner in the same partnership. If you want your refund transferred to another person, you will need to show if they are an associated taxpayer. Transfer date You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it is not before the relevant dates set out as follows. For credit transferred: to your account/an associated taxpayer's account If the credit is from excess tax deducted (eg, RWT deducted on interest) it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax it's the day you overpaid it. Please note that special rules apply if tax pooling funds have been transferred in. www.ird.govt.nz 31 to a non-associated taxpayer's account It's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you file your return. Future transfer dates If you want your credit transferred at a future date, attach a note to the front of your return with the details of the amount you want transferred, the account you want it transferred to (if it's to another person and they are associated) and the date you want it transferred. If you don't tell us the date you want your credit transferred, we will transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. If you want the credit transferred at a different date, you can ask us to change it (even if we have transferred your credit to cover a debt). Requesting transfers on your return You can ask us to transfer a refund to another account by filling out page 4 of the return. If you ask us to, we will transfer the refund to: • the company's own account or an account of someone associated to the company on the later of: –the day after the balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March) –the due date in the destination account. • an account of someone not associated to the company on the day after the return was filed. If you want the company's refund transferred at a different date from those listed earlier, you can attach a note to the return, including the details of the account you want the refund transferred to and the transfer date you want. If the transfer is going to another person, tell us if they are associated to the company. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 32 Question 31 Initial provisional tax liability A company has an initial provisional tax liability if it: –starts to derive income from a taxable activity in the tax year, and –had not derived gross income from a taxable activity within the preceding four years, and –has residual income tax (RIT) of $60,000 or more in the current year. New businesses don't pay provisional tax in their first year of operation because there is no RIT from the previous year to base the calculation on. However, companies that have an initial provisional tax liability may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date. The instalment date interest applies from is determined by the business start date. Some new businesses make voluntary payments to reduce liability for interest. More information about the dates interest applies from is available in our guide Provisional tax (IR289). There are special rules about how interest is calculated when a company has an initial provisional tax liability and has changed its balance date. For further information, see our Provisional tax (IR289) guide. Print the date the company started to derive income from the taxable activity in Box 31. Question 32 2019 provisional tax 2019 provisional tax is charged for income the company will earn in the 2019 income year. It is payable in two, three or six instalments. There are three options for calculating your provisional tax - standard, estimation and ratio. www.ird.govt.nz 33 If the company's 2018 RIT is: –$2,500 or less it does not have to pay provisional tax, but it can make voluntary payments –more than $2,500 but expected to be $2,500 or less for 2019 it may estimate 2019 provisional tax at nil –more than $2,500 and expected to be more than $2,500 for 2019 it must pay 2019 provisional tax using one of the payment options. Standard option (S) Under this option, your 2019 provisional tax is your 2018 RIT (where it is more than $2,500) plus 5%. If you think your income for 2019 will be more than your 2018 income, you can make voluntary payments over and above the amount you have to pay under the standard option. Note Estimation option (E) Companies can estimate their 2019 provisional tax. They can re-estimate any number of times up to and including their final instalment due date. If the company's 2019 RIT is expected to be less than its 2018 RIT, estimating may prevent the company from paying more than it has to. An estimate must be fair and reasonable at each instalment it applies to. If you use the estimation option, see "Not taking reasonable care penalty" and "Interest" on page 34. Note If the company estimates its provisional tax, write E in Box 32A and the amount of 2019 provisional tax in Box 32B. If you estimate your provisional tax your instalments should be one-third of your estimation. If you're using the ratio option and select E at Box 32A this will mean you are electing to stop using the ratio option. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 34 Ratio option (R) If you're GST registered, you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 32A if you have already elected to use the ratio option. Your application to use the ratio option must be made by phone or in writing before the beginning of the income year you want to use it. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 32A. There is more information about the ratio option in our guide Provisional tax (IR289). Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the company's 2019 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2019 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, you may be liable for a not taking reasonable care penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax. Interest If the company has paid too much provisional tax, we may pay interest. If it has not paid enough provisional tax, we may charge interest. Interest the company pays is tax deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. Election to be a provisional tax payer A company is a provisional tax payer for the 2018 year if its RIT for that year is more than $2,500. If the 2018 RIT is $2,500 or less but the company paid provisional tax for the year, the company may elect to be a provisional tax payer for that year. This may affect the interest the company may be entitled to for that year. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2018 year, attach a note to the front of the 2018 return. www.ird.govt.nz 35 Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in the balance date. For more information, read our guides Penalties and interest (IR240) and Provisional tax (IR289). Tax pooling Tax pooling allows taxpayers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool. This reduces their possible exposure to late payment penalties and interest. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: tax pooling). Payment dates 2019 provisional tax Generally, a company with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: First instalment 28 August 2018 Second instalment 15 January 2019 Third instalment 7 May 2019 A company with a balance date other than 31 March generally pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. There are two exceptions: • If it would be due on 28 December it is due on 15 January. • If it would be due on 28 April it is due on 7 May. These dates will alter if the company is registered for GST, and • the GST filing frequency is six-monthly, or • provisional tax is paid through the ratio option. If either of these situations apply to you, read our guide Provisional tax (IR289). COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 36 2018 end-of-year income tax Companies that have an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2019 to pay their tax. If you think this applies to your company, contact your agent. A company with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax (Box 29L) and any interest by 7 February 2019. A company with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the 7th day of the month before the following year's balance date. How to make payments You can make payments: • electronically • by credit or debit card • by posting a cheque. We recommend making electronic payments because it's the most accurate and reliable method. These electronic options are available through your bank: • online banking • automatic payment • direct credit. When making electronic payments, include: • your IRD number • a tax type code • the period the payment relates to. Go to www.ird.govt.nz/pay for full details of our payment options. www.ird.govt.nz 37 Late payment We may charge you a late payment penalty if you miss a payment or it's late. We'll also charge you interest if you don't make your tax payment by the due date. If you can't pay your tax by the due date, please call us. We'll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement, depending on your circumstances. Go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: managing penalties) for more information. Question 34 Foreign rights If you calculated CFC or FIF income at Question 18 you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. For all interests of 10% or more in a foreign company, the additional disclosure is required. For other investments, the requirement for an additional disclosure depends on the company you are preparing the Companies income tax return (IR4) for. • If the company isn't widely held or a PIE, additional disclosure isn't required if the investments are in countries New Zealand holds a double tax agreement with (as at 31 March 2018) and the fair dividend rate or comparative value has been used. • If the company is widely held or a PIE you are required to file an additional disclosure. The disclosure forms are available at www.ird.govt.nz Please call 0800 377 774 if you need help to find the appropriate disclosure form. For information on foreign exchange rates, go to our website (search keywords: overseas currencies). COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 38 Question 35 Share repurchases When amounts distributed to shareholders on cancellation or repurchase of shares fall below specified thresholds, the amounts are taxable in full to shareholders as dividends. When distributions on repurchases exceed those thresholds, or occur through the stock exchange, the distributions will be deducted from available subscribed capital of the company and will be tax-free to the shareholders. However, this is only to the extent that the distributions are not in lieu of dividends. If the subscribed capital of the company has been depleted, the distributions will be taxable. Specific rules also govern the repurchase and subsequent sale of Treasury stock. The total value entered on the return should be the aggregate value of all distributions made by the company during the year for company shares repurchased, redeemed, cancelled or purchased as Treasury stock. Question 36 Foreign-sourced dividends Generally, funds would use the default FIF income calculation method (the fair dividend rate) which does not tax dividends separately. However, the foreign tax deducted from the dividend can be claimed as a credit against the tax payable on the calculated FIF income. A credit for any tax paid by the foreign company (on its earnings) may be allowed in calculating the amount payable by the New Zealand company. Any NRWT deducted from the foreign dividend paid to the New Zealand company may also be allowed as a credit. Information about exempt foreign dividends Although most foreign dividends received by companies are exempt from tax, you should still answer ''Yes'' to this question if the company receives an exempt foreign dividend. www.ird.govt.nz 39 Foreign dividends from some investments are taxable. These should be included in the tax return as income from overseas. Dividends on foreign investments are taxable in three situations: • When the investment gives the company a direct income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, but the investment is one of certain investments that are excluded from the normal FIF rules (see Question 18 on page 17 for the most common exclusions). • When the dividend relates to an investment in fixed-rate shares ("fixed-rate foreign equity"). • When the dividend paid is tax-deductible in a foreign country by a foreign company (a "deductible foreign equity distribution"). Question 37 Company controlled or owned by non-residents We need to know whether the company is owned or controlled by non-residents because we may need to apply subpart FE or sections CH 9, GC 6-14 and GB 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Question 38 Lowest economic interests of shareholders The ownership tests measure a shareholder's voting and market value interests in a company. They apply to the net loss carry forward and grouping provisions, imputation credit carry forward provisions and the qualifying company rules. A shareholding individual's economic interest in a company will generally be measured by referring to the percentage of voting power they hold in that company. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 40 A company has two shareholders, Barbara and Maria. The company has two classes of shares: • Class A shares carry a right to vote on matters other than the payment of dividends and appointment of directors. • Class B shares carry unrestricted voting rights. Barbara holds all 100 of the A shares in the company while Maria holds all 100 of the B shares. Barbara's percentage of voting interest in the company is measured as follows: DistributionsConstitution Variation in capital Directors 0 + 50 + 50 + 0 = 100 =25% 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 = 400 Maria's percentage of voting interest is 75%, calculated as follows: DistributionsConstitution Variation in capital Directors 100 + 50 + 50 + 100 = 300 =75% 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 = 400 Example The percentage of voting interest is the total percentage of rights a person has, by reason of their holding of shares (and options), to vote on: –the dividends or other distributions to be made by the company –the constitution of the company –any variation in the capital of the company –the appointment or election of directors. The continuity thresholds will be satisfied by taking into account the lowest economic percentage of rights attached to shares held by each shareholder of a company. If Barbara and Maria hold these proportions of shares for the entire income year, the "total lowest economic interest of shareholders" or the minimum continuity is 100%, because Barbara's 25% plus Maria's 75% equals 100%. www.ird.govt.nz 41 If the proportion of shares held does not change during the entire income year, the total lowest economic interest of shareholders will always be 100%, as shown in the example below: On 1 September 2017 Barbara and Maria swapped shares and held these proportions to 31 March 2018, the company's balance date. 1 April 2017 1 Sep 2017 31 Mar 2018 Lowest Barbara 25% 75% 75% 25% Maria 75% 25% 25% 25% The lowest percentage of rights held by each shareholder during the income year is 25%. So, the total lowest economic interest of shareholders, or the minimum continuity, is 50%. Example In certain circumstances the shareholders' economic interests in a company will also be determined by the market value interests in the company. This is where the voting interests don't reflect the true economic interests held in a company. A shareholder's market value interest in a company equals their percentage share of the total market value of shares (and options) held in that company. The specific factors that require a market value interest to be calculated are called market value circumstances. A market value circumstance exists where: –the company has on issue debentures to which sections FA 2 and FZ 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply –the company has on issue shares where payment of dividends is guaranteed by a third party –there's an option to acquire shares in the company –an arrangement exists with the purpose of defeating a provision that depends on measurement of voting and market value interests. Add together the lowest economic interest of each shareholder and print the total in Box 38. Write percentages in the following format, for example, show 50% as 50.00, and 100% as 100.00. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 42 Effect on the imputation credit account (ICA) If you keep an ICA and have had a change of shareholding of more than 34% you may need to make an adjustment on your annual imputation return at Box 42D ("Other debits") - see page 45. Question 39 Shareholder details - see also the IR4S Complete Question 39 if shareholders, directors and relatives of shareholders received remuneration or a loan. Remuneration is liable for ACC levies. Shareholders' salaries Write all remuneration with no PAYE deducted that the company paid to that person in Box 39B. For the company to claim a deduction for shareholder remuneration it must be paid either: –during the income year, or –within the time allowed for the company to file its return. If the remuneration isn't paid in time, the deduction can't be claimed until the following year. Loss offsets and subvention payments Record details of any losses claimed or transferred from or to each group member at Box 39E.

Question 41D Imputation credits attached to dividends received If the company received dividends with imputation credits attached between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018, print the total credits in Box 41D. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 44 This is the total imputation credits attached to dividends received. This amount is not limited to the tax payable on your dividends and is not necessarily the same amount as the imputation credits being claimed in Box 14. Note Question 41E Other credits List any other credits made to the ICA from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018. Use a separate sheet of paper if necessary.

Supplementary available subscribed capital account (SASCA) If you're a public unit trust or a group investment fund that maintains a SASCA and you're eligible to transfer credits from that account to the ICA, record the credits being transferred to the ICA in Box 41E (other credits). All public unit trusts or group investment funds maintaining a SASCA should, by the due date for filing the 2018 IR4 or IR4J, send a copy of that memorandum account together with any written queries to: Investment Desk Large Enterprises Inland Revenue PO Box 2871 Christchurch 8140 For more information on negative dividends and the SASCA rules, see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002). www.ird.govt.nz 45 Qualifying company election tax (QCET) payments Include any QCET payments made after 17 May 2007 as a credit in the ICA when working out the balance.

See our Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs) Vol 11, No 5 (May/June 1999) and Vol 20, No 3, page 127 (April 2008).

Question 42D Other debits List any other debits in the ICA and print the total in Box 42D. Examples of other types of debits are: –any provisional tax allocated by the company to a company in the same wholly owned group that has underpaid its provisional tax –an adjustment for a change of shareholding of more than 34% during the period 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018, regardless of your accounting year –an adjustment for a change in an imputation ratio –tax payable by a company on any part of a distribution not sourced from the subscribed capital of the company, where that company repurchases a share on-market. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 46 Qualifying companies The 66% continuity of shareholding requirement does not apply to qualifying companies. There is no need to make an adjustment where there has been a change of shareholding, except in the year the company ceases to be a qualifying company. Question 43A Adjustments to debit balance If a qualifying company received an income tax refund after 1 April 1995 that created a debit balance in the ICA, no further income tax is required to the extent of any refunds received. If the qualifying company has a debit balance as a result of income tax refunded from 1 April 2017, please subtract the amount refunded at Box 43A. If the closing balance is a credit, there is no tax to pay. If the closing balance at Box 43B is a debit, it must be paid by 20 June 2018. There are two types of relief from payment of debit ICA balances. These are: –the offsetting income tax payments –same debit ICA balances reflected in successive years. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 16, No 1 (February 2004). Note Question 44 Imputation penalty tax Imputation penalty tax of 10% of the debit closing balance is also payable by 20 June 2018. Work out the 10% penalty in Box 44. If the total in Box 44A exceeds $100 and is not paid by the due date, late payment penalties and interest will apply - see page 37. www.ird.govt.nz 47 Limitations on tax refunds We may hold all or part of a refund if: –the company is expecting an income tax refund, and –the credit balance in the ICA at 31 March 2018 is less than the refund. If there have been additional credits to the ICA since 31 March 2018, the company may file an interim 2019 IR4J return in anticipation of an IR4 annual return being filed at a later date. We may then be able to release the refund. We can apply non-refundable overpaid income tax to a company's previous years' income tax liabilities, where these debits exist, rather than transferring the credit forward to the next year's provisional tax. This avoids further payments having to be made to meet back-year debts. Self-assessment by taxpayers Taxpayers have to assess their own liability as part of their return filing obligations. We may amend your assessment if a correction is required. If you dispute our assessment please read our factsheet If you disagree with an assessment (IR778). The four-month period for you to issue a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) to your self-assessment will start on the date Inland Revenue receives your return. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 48 Accident Compensation Act 2001 Under the Accident Compensation Act 2001, Inland Revenue is required to provide the earnings information at Box 39B from this return to the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). The information is used by ACC to invoice all ACC levies. ACC invoicing for close companies (including earners' levy for shareholder-employee earnings with no PAYE deducted) starts from September each year. Maximum earnings from multiple companies The maximum amount of earners' levy that can be collected from a shareholder-employee is $1,755.37. A shareholder- employee may be due for a refund from ACC if the shareholder-employee's combined total remuneration from two or more companies is over $126,286. Please call ACC on 0800 222 776 to find out about the refund process. ACC earners' levy Shareholder-employees' salaries or directors' fees without PAYE deducted are liable for ACC earners' levy. The company will be invoiced by ACC for this levy.

Look-through companies (LTC) file an IR7 income tax return each year they're an LTC. For further information about LTCs refer to our Look-through companies (IR879) guide. If yours is an Australian company or part of an imputation group, please see page 7. Non-active companies A non-active company is a company that has: –not received any gross income –no deductions –not disposed of any assets –not been party to any transactions during the tax year that: (i) gave rise to income for any person, or (ii) gave rise to fringe benefits to any employee or any former employee, or (iii) gave rise to a debit in the company's ICA (imputation credit account). These companies may be excused from filing tax returns if they complete a Non-active company declaration (IR433) form. Return due date If the company has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2019 to file the return, unless you have been granted an extension of time. If you have a balance date other than 31 March, this date may be different. Call us on 0800 377 774 if you are not sure of the filing date. If the company has a tax agent, you may have until 31 March 2020 to file the return. If this applies, contact your agent. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 6 Late filing penalties If you have to file a return and you don't send us one, you may be charged a late filing penalty. You should apply for an extension of time if you are unable to file your return on time. The penalty for filing your IR4 late depends on the company's net income. If your income is: –below $100,000, the penalty is $50 –between $100,000 and $1 million (both figures inclusive), the penalty is $250 –above $1 million, the penalty is $500. If you need an extension to your tax return filing date, tell us your reasons before your return is due. If you get a late filing penalty before applying for an extension, the penalty will stand. If you use a tax agent who has an extension of time arrangement with us and the extension is withdrawn, we will notify you that you must now file your return. Tax sparing Any company that has claimed a foreign tax credit for a tax sparing arrangement under a double tax agreement, must also complete a Tax sparing disclosure return (IR486) and send it to: International Revenue Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Group investment funds If the company's income is solely from Category A income, you must file an IR4. If the income is solely from Category B income, you must file an IR6. If the income is a combination of both Category A and Category B income, you must file an IR4 and IR44E. Read the notes in the IR44E for further information. Research and development (R&D) tax losses You may be able to cash out any R&D losses if your company is a loss-making company that is a resident in New Zealand and your expenditure on R&D salary and wages is 20% or more of your total salary and wage expenditure. For more information go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: R&D). www.ird.govt.nz 7 Superannuation schemes A superannuation scheme, not registered with the Financial Markets Authority (FMA), which lets beneficiaries contribute, will be treated as a company for tax purposes and must file IR4 returns. Trans-Tasman imputation and imputation groups Australian companies can elect to maintain a New Zealand imputation account from the 2003-04 tax year. A form of grouping (for imputation purposes only) has also been introduced, which Australian companies may join. Return filing for trans-Tasman imputation Australian companies that make a trans-Tasman imputation election are required to file an Annual imputation return (IR4J) by 31 July, after the end of the tax year. A Companies income tax return (IR4) isn't required, unless the company has a permanent establishment (eg, maintains an office) in New Zealand. Return filing for imputation groups Company tax return (IR4) Company returns must be filed by: –all New Zealand companies that elect to be a member of an imputation group and –Australian companies with New Zealand-sourced income. Annual imputation return (IR4J) The imputation return for an imputation group should be filed by the group representative on a separate IR4J return. Imputation group members should not include any imputation details on page 6 of the IR4. An exception applies for nominated companies of a resident imputation group where there is an ICA debit balance. Foreign dividend payments (FDP) The FDP rules have been fully repealed from 1 April 2017. This means FDP can no longer be included in your annual income tax return. Please do not include FDP credits in Box 14A and also leave 41B and 42B blank. For further details go to www.ird.govt.nz/business-income- tax/imputation/ COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 8 Imputation return Most New Zealand resident companies, unit trusts, producer boards and cooperatives must file an imputation return each year. If you're an Australian company or part of an imputation group, please read page 7. The following bodies don't have to file imputation returns: –non-resident companies –look-through companies –trustee companies (but not group investment funds with Category A income) –any company with a constitution that prevents it distributing all its income or property to any proprietor, member or shareholder –companies whose income is completely exempt from tax –local authorities –Crown research institutes –non-active companies –Māori authorities. If you need to file the company's imputation return before the income tax return is due, to allow a refund to be released, complete an Annual imputation return (IR4J). Note Questions 1 to 8 Company details Fill in Questions 1 to 8 only if the correct information is not printed on the return. Question 2 - Company name If the company has changed its name since the last time a return was filed, please attach a copy of the new certificate of incorporation with the name change details or call us on 0800 377 774 so we can update our records. Question 4 - Postal address If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 4. If your new address is a PO Box number, please show your box lobby if you have one. If you are unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealand Post. www.ird.govt.nz 9 Leave this address panel blank if the company uses its agent's postal address. The agent will let us know of any change of address when they update their client list. Question 6 - Business industry classification (BIC) code If you're involved in a business or a trading activity, please write the BIC code only in Box 6. You don't need to give a description. We're required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to www.businessdescription.co.nz or call ACC on 0508 426 837. It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. Question 7 - Phone number We ask for your daytime phone number so we can contact you if we have any questions about your return. Question 8 - Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, eg, a building society account. If your bank account number isn't preprinted on the return form, please include it at Question 8. If your suffix has only two digits, enter them in the first two squares of the suffix box. Question 9 Non-resident A company is a tax resident of New Zealand if: –it's incorporated in New Zealand, or –its head office or centre of management is in New Zealand, or –its directors control the company in New Zealand. Otherwise, it's a non-resident for tax purposes. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 10 Questions 10 and 10A Imputation Page 6 of the IR4 return is the annual imputation return. If you have made any monetary entries in the annual imputation return, tick "Yes" at Question 10A. If you have filed, or will file, a separate Annual imputation return (IR4J), tick "No" at Question 10. Note Question 11 Has the company ceased? If this is a final return, include a set of accounts up to the date the company ceased trading and include details of any distribution of assets and liabilities. If the company is registered for GST or as an employer, you will need to complete a Business cessation (IR315) form to finalise your records. Depending on the company's circumstances, a number of other issues may need to be finalised, for example: –outstanding returns –arrears –FBT or ACC –imputation account balances (for qualifying companies) –specified superannuation contributions –RWT on dividends –10-year bonus issues. Find out how to finalise the company's tax accounts or deregister for GST at www.ird.govt.nz A company is still a legal entity until it is taken off the Companies Register. A company can stop trading (become non-active) but still have tax obligations such as filing returns. Non-active companies can be excused from filing - see page 5. Note www.ird.govt.nz 11 Company tax return Question 12 Income from schedular payments If the company has received any schedular payments, we will send you a summary of income (previously known as a summary of earnings). Add up the total tax withheld and all the gross payments shown on the summary of income and write the totals in Boxes 12A and 12B. The summary of income form may not contain all the company's earnings information. If any details are missing, please include them at Question 12. If the company received a payment with no tax deducted, include the gross amount in Box 12B. Mineral mining tax credit Include in Box 12A the amount of refundable tax credit being claimed where a tax loss is incurred on disposal of land or by claiming rehabilitation expenditure. Transferring tax deductions Tax deducted from schedular payments made to close companies can be transferred directly to the company’s shareholder-employee(s) in some circumstances. You’ll need to reduce the amount claimed in Box 12A by the amount of tax deducted from schedular payments which has been transferred direct to a shareholder-employee of the company. You will still need to include the total schedular payments made to the company in Box 12B. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 12 LLC received schedular payments of $10,000 with total tax deducted of $2,000 during the year. The $10,000 is attributable to the company’s shareholder- employee through the attribution rule. LLC can transfer up to $2,000 of the tax deducted from the schedular payments it received to the company’s shareholder-employee(s). LLC transfers the full $2,000 of tax to the company’s sole shareholder-employee. As the full amount of tax has been transferred from LLC the amount in Box 12A should be $0. Example If the company is transferring tax deducted to shareholder- employee(s) it should attach details of the transfer to the return. The amount of tax transferred from the company to its shareholder-employee(s) will also need to be recorded as a debit entry in the company’s imputation credit account - see Question 42D on page 46. Question 13 New Zealand interest Interest from all New Zealand sources must be shown in the return. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 13A. If the company has had NRWT deducted from New Zealand interest, include this in Box 13A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 13B. Interest on broken term deposits If you have broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for "negative interest". This is interest repaid on the term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare on the tax return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business- related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest amount shown on the RWT withholding certificate (IR15 or equivalent statement). www.ird.govt.nz 13 Deduct the allowable negative interest part, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Question 13 of the tax return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later tax return when the term deposit matures. Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you have paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Box 13B of your tax return. 3 Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we pay interest, include the interest in Box 13B for the income year the company received the interest. If the company paid us interest, include it as a deduction in the return for the income year the interest is paid. If expenses are deductible against the interest income, claim them at Box 19B. Note Don't send in the certificates or IR15 forms with the return, but keep them in case we ask for them. Income from financial arrangements If the company was a party to a financial arrangement, such as government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts or deferred property settlements, the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement may have to be calculated using a spreading method, rather than on a cash basis. If the financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation known as a base price adjustment must be made. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Show the RWT deducted and any income from the financial arrangement in Boxes 13A and 13B. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 14 Question 14 New Zealand dividends Generally, dividends are taxable. However, there is an exemption for dividends paid between members of a wholly owned group. To work out the total gross dividends, add up all net dividends received, any imputation credits, and any RWT deductions. Write the total of all dividends in Box 14B. The FDP rules have been fully repealed from 1 April 2017. Don’t include any FDP credits in box 14A. Note Dividend tax credits The total tax credits for dividends (i.e. imputation credits) you can claim is limited to the income tax payable (28%) on each dividend the company receives. This is to ensure that surplus tax credits are not used to shelter tax on other income. Work out whether you need to apply this limitation to the dividend tax credits you will claim. Copy your total gross dividends (calculated for each dividend that had an imputation credit) from Box 14B to Box 1. 1 Multiply Box 1 by 0.28 (28%), and write the result in Box 2. 2 Write your total dividend tax credits (calculated for that dividend) in Box 3. 3 For each dividend, claim a dividend tax credit for the lower amount shown in Box 2 or Box 3. Write the total dividend imputation credits you are allowed to claim in Box 14. In Box 14A write the sum of your total dividend RWT credits you are allowed to claim. www.ird.govt.nz 15 If expenses are deductible against the dividend income, claim them at Box 19B. Note Unit trusts Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable. The statement you receive from the unit trust should show the amounts to include in the return. For unit trusts that are also portfolio investment entities (PIEs) see page 20. Transfer of deductible expenses between member and master funds From the 2002-03 income year a member fund may, in certain circumstances, elect to transfer deductible expenses to a master fund. The master fund must invest, in whole or in part, in the member fund. The master fund can then deduct the transferred expenses. A member fund can include a group investment fund that derives Category A income, a public unit trust or a superannuation fund. A master fund can include a group investment fund that derives Category A income or a public unit trust. A public unit trust includes: –retail unit trusts, whose units are offered to the public and which have 100 or more unit holders –wholesale unit trusts, whose units are held by widely held investment vehicles such as other unit trusts or superannuation funds. Member or master funds wanting to take advantage of this provision should include details of the adjustment in a tax reconciliation statement accompanying the return. The information should accompany the returns of both funds involved in the transfer. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 16 Qualifying companies Generally, if a qualifying company is a shareholder in a company that isn't a qualifying company, all dividends the qualifying company derives from the other company are taxable. Dividends derived by a company (that has been a qualifying company at any time before deriving the dividends) are taxable. If a qualifying company is a shareholder in another qualifying company, only dividends with imputation credits attached and a return of a 10-year bonus issue before the 10-year period expires, are taxable. Dividends with no imputation credits attached, or a return of a 10-year bonus issue 10 years from the payment date, are exempt income. A distribution of a 10-year bonus issue before the 10-year period has expired, made when the company winds up, isn't taxable. If you need more help, read our guide Qualifying companies (IR435). Don't send in the dividend statements with the return, but keep them in case we ask for them. Question 15 Ma ̄ori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 15 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Māori authority credit and is part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, so the distributions are not taxed twice. www.ird.govt.nz 17 What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: –the distribution made to you, including the taxable portion and the non-taxable portion –Māori authority credit. These amounts, not including any non-taxable distribution, will need to be transferred to the relevant boxes at Question 15. A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. It pays tax on this profit of $1,750 (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distributes the entire profit to its 10 members. Each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority liable to file an IR4 return would show the following information at Question 15: Box 15B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) Box 15A - $175 Example Question 16 Partnership, estate or trust income If the company received any income from a partnership, estate or trust, write any tax credits in Box 16A and the income totals in Box 16B. Don't include any: –overseas income - show this at Question 18 along with any credits attached –dividend imputation credits attached to dividends (include these in Box 14, RWT withheld in Box 14A and the gross dividend in Box 14B). Add up any other tax credits from partnerships, estates or trusts and write the total in Box 16A. Add up all the other income from partnerships, estates or trusts and write the total in Box 16B. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 18 Losses from limited partnerships If the company is claiming a loss from a limited partnership and you need help working out the amount you can claim, please go to www.ird.govt.nz Estate or trust income If you received a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust, please attach a note with your return giving details of the amount and any associated tax credits. We separate taxable distributions from a non-complying trust because they are taxed at a different rate. We need these details to work out your tax liability correctly. Question 18 Overseas income If your company received income from or while based overseas, between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, show it in New Zealand dollars at Box 18B. If the company is a New Zealand resident for tax purposes, you must include any foreign contract or service income in Box 18B. Foreign investment fund (FIF) If the company held rights, such as shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, unit trust, superannuation scheme or life insurance policy, at any time during the 2019 income year, you may be required to calculate FIF income or loss. If the company has an interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC), they must calculate any attributed income or loss from that interest. Generally, the company will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The main exclusions from an interest in an FIF are: –investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts –interest in certain Australian unit trusts –limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand) www.ird.govt.nz 19 –a 10% or greater interest in a CFC. CFC income and losses New rules were introduced in 2009 for calculating income or losses from a CFC. If the company has an interest in a CFC, they must calculate any attributed income or loss from that interest. Losses from a CFC can't be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses carried forward to the next tax year. Generally, these losses can only offset income or future income from CFCs resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. When CFC income or losses are calculated under the new rules, transitional rules apply to the use of carried forward losses incurred under the old rules. You can find more information on the rules at www.ird.govt.nz and in our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 21, No 8 (October/November 2009). What to show in your return You can convert all overseas income and tax credits to New Zealand dollars by: • using the rates table available on our website (search keywords: overseas currencies) • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. If the income was received from a financial arrangement, refer to Determination G9A or G9C under section 90 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Write the total of the allowable overseas tax paid in Box 18A. Include in Box 18B income before the deduction of any tax. Credit for tax paid overseas will be limited to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on that income. Please note that Australian franking credits or tax credits on dividends from the United Kingdom can't be claimed. Staple proof of tax paid overseas to the top of page 3 of the return. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 20 Foreign tax credits attached to dividends that are not required to be returned under the FIF rules can be claimed up to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on the FIF interest. Some foreign dividends have New Zealand imputation credits attached or New Zealand RWT deducted. These credits are not subject to the foreign tax credit limitation rule. Investments in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) Certain PIEs attribute their net income/loss and tax credits to the investors. Companies that are investors include the attributed income or loss in their tax return. Each year, the PIE is required to provide an investor statement setting out the details of the income/loss attributed to the investor for the year. The statement also shows the various types of tax credits associated with the income that has been attributed. These tax credits are subject to the tax credit limits calculated in relation to the tax on the attributed PIE income. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the company's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. Generally, PIEs have a 31 March balance date. The amount of income the company derives as a distribution by a PIE is excluded income unless it is fully imputed dividends from a listed PIE. Dividends from these PIEs are not liable for RWT. For more information, go to www.ird.govt.nz or read our guides, Information for companies that invest in PIEs (IR857) and Portfolio investment entity: a guide for PIEs (IR860). Question 19 Business or rental income Write the net profit or loss in Box 19B. This is the amount of income or loss after the deduction of all allowable business expenditure, including shareholders' salaries paid or credited. Also include any net rental income or loss in Box 19B. Don't include any income already shown at Questions 12 to 16, losses from CFCs (see the notes to Question 34 on page 38) or claim donations here (see the notes to Question 23 on page 26). www.ird.govt.nz 21 If expenses are deductible against income declared in Questions 12 to 14, claim them here. Note Attach either: –a fully completed Financial statements summary (IR10) form, or –the company's financial accounts. The IR10 is a statistics form that sets out a general summary of information from the financial accounts. If you complete an IR10 you don't need to send the financial accounts as well. You still need to complete them (unless the company is very small) and keep them in case we ask for them. Very small companies are not required to prepare financial accounts if these conditions apply during the income year. The company: • is not part of a group • has not derived income over $30,000 • has not incurred expenditure over $30,000. Companies that don't prepare financial accounts must fill in an IR10 using information from their trial balance or financial records. For more information about who has to prepare financial accounts and minimum financial reporting requirements, go to our website at www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: financial reporting). The attribution rule Under the attribution rule, anyone whose actions cause an "associated person" (company, trust or partnership) to earn income, can be personally liable for tax on that income. If this rule applies to persons associated to your organisation, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. To find out how to apply this rule, please refer to our Ta x Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000) and Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 22 Question 20 Insurance premiums paid to an overseas insurer Special rules apply to any company paying a premium, including a reinsurance premium, to a non-resident insurer. If you're paying a premium to a non-resident insurer you need to get a separate IRD number to account for the tax on the premium income. This is because you're considered to be the insurer's agent. You will need to file an IR4 return under this separate IRD number and declare premiums paid as the only income received. Only 10% of the total gross premiums paid to overseas insurers is subject to the company tax rate of 28%. This equals 2.8% of the total premiums paid. Any premiums paid to insurers in Switzerland aren't subject to tax in New Zealand and should be deducted from the total gross premiums paid. Agency obligations also extend to other New Zealand residents, eg, brokers, who may initially collect premiums for payment to the non-resident insurer. If there is any default, the insured person is responsible for the tax. Print the gross amount of premiums paid to a non-resident insurer in Box 20. Print the gross amount of premiums paid to Switzerland in Box 20A. Deduct the figure in Box 20A from Box 20 and multiply the net amount by 0.1 (10%). Print your answer in Box 20B and copy this amount to Box 28. No other income should be returned as an agent for an overseas insurer. The company still needs to declare other income under its original IRD number. If you have any enquiries, contact: Large Enterprises Services Investigations and Advice Private Bag 39984 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 Phone 0800 443 773 www.ird.govt.nz 23 Question 21 Other income Show any other income received by the company at Question 21. For example, the sale of: –land and/or buildings –shares or other property –securities –income from an undertaking or scheme. The following notes explain what you need to do if the company received any of the types of income listed above. Income from sale of land and/or buildings The profits are taxable if the company bought a property for the purpose of reselling it or is in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. If the company purchased a residential property on or after 1 October 2015 and sold/disposed of it within the bright-line period, any profit will be taxable, whether the intention at the time of purchase was for resale or not. The bright-line period for: • properties purchased/acquired on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive, is two years, • properties purchased/acquired on or after 29 March 2018 is five years. The profits may be taxable if the company: –is a building company and improved a property before selling it –developed or subdivided land and sold sections –had a change of zoning on company property and sold it within 10 years of buying it. If the company is a New Zealand tax resident it will need to pay tax on its worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales worldwide whether caught under the bright-line test for residential property sales or the other property rules. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 24 Complete a Property sale information (IR833) form for each property sold/disposed of and include it with the return. The form explains how to calculate and correctly return the resulting profit or loss. The form can be downloaded from our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: IR833). Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary (IR10) or set of accounts. Print the total profit in Box 21B. If you're not sure if the income from the sale of land or buildings is taxable, please call us. Income from sale of non-FIF shares or other property Profits from the sale of shares and other property are taxable if the company: –buys and sells shares or other property as a business, or –buys shares or other property for the purpose of resale. This does not apply if shares are FIFs. List the details of income and expenses from these sales on a sheet of paper and staple it to the top of page 3 of the return. Include the total profit in Box 21B. Losses from sale of land, buildings, non-FIF shares or other property If the company has made a loss from the sale of an asset that was not an FIF and you can show that if it had made a profit it would have been taxable, you may be able to claim the loss as a deduction. If the property was purchased on or after 1 October 2015 with no intention to sell and it was sold/ disposed of within two years, any excess deductions can't be claimed unless they can be offset against net income from other property sales. The Property sale information (IR833) form has more information on this. For more information on property sales see our guide Buying and selling residential property (IR313). Show the loss at Box 21B. www.ird.govt.nz 25 Financial arrangements A company must account for income from financial arrangements on an accrual basis. Financial arrangements include government stock, futures contracts and deferred property settlements, excluding short-term agreements for sale and purchase of property. Changes to the rules for the treatment of financial arrangements have split the rules into two sets. Generally, the first set applies to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 and the second applies to financial arrangements entered into on or after that date. Both sets of rules require the income or expenditure to be spread over the term of the financial arrangement. This applies in every case - the company doesn't have to be in the business of buying or selling financial arrangements, or be intending to sell, as it would with shares. The company may, in certain cases, deduct any losses. Sale or maturity of financial arrangements When a financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment, must be made. The calculation ensures that the total gains or losses from the financial arrangement are accounted for. If you need any information on when losses can be deducted or how to calculate a base price adjustment, please call us on 0800 443 773. Income from an undertaking or scheme Profits from any undertaking or scheme entered into for the purpose of making a profit are taxable. Describe the undertaking or scheme and list the details of income and expenses from them. Staple this information to the top of page 3 of the return and include the total profit in Box 21B. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 26 Question 21BA Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If the company is an “offshore RLWT person” and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The company should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The company can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than one amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Question 23 Donations A company (including an unlisted company with five or fewer shareholders) can claim a deduction for donations it makes to any society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund that has donee organisation status. You can view the list of these organisations at www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: donee). State-funded tertiary education institutions, state schools and state-integrated schools don't have to be approved to have donee organisation status. Note The deduction for donations can't be more than the company's net income after expenses (before the donation deduction is taken into account). Use the following steps to calculate the company's donation deduction. • If the amount in Box 22 is a loss, print nil in Box 23B. • If the donations made by the company exceed the amount in Box 22, copy the amount in Box 22 to Box 23B. • If the donations made by the company don't exceed the amount in Box 22, print the amount of the donations in Box 23B. www.ird.govt.nz 27 Question 25 Net losses brought forward Losses from CFCs are not included in Box 25 - see Question 36 on page 39. Before a company is allowed to carry forward net losses, 49% continuity of minimum voting interest or market value interest must be maintained by a group of persons at all times, from the beginning of the year of net loss to the end of the year of carrying it forward (the continuity period). To check whether the shareholder continuity requirements have been met, use the lowest percentage of economic interest held by each shareholder during the continuity period. To calculate the total lowest economic interest see Question 38 on page 40. There are two types of net losses - specified activity net losses and other net losses. Specified activity net losses These are net losses from specified activities incurred before the 1991 income year. Any loss balance in relation to a specified activity that remained at the end of the 2018 income year must be offset against net income for the 2019 income year before taking into account other losses. The amount of this offset cannot exceed the net income. If the loss balance from specified activities incurred before the 1991 income year exceeds the net income for the 2019 income year, that excess amount is added to the tax loss for the year. The tax loss may be grouped with another company, subject to satisfying the commonality and continuity rules (see Question 27 on page 28). Other net losses Other net losses are all those incurred from the 1991 income year onwards (including any net loss arising from excess imputation credits) and any net losses that were not limited before 1991. Write the total of all specified activity net losses and other net losses the company can bring forward to 2019 in Box 25A, and the amount the company has offset against 2019 income in Box 25B. If the company can't offset any net losses in the 2019 income year, write "0.00" in Box 25B. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 28 You should be able to find the amount of net loss the company has to bring forward on the loss notice sent to you with the company's 2018 income tax assessment. If you don't have a loss notice, enter the details from your own records. Note Question 26 Total income after net losses brought forward If Box 24 is a net loss, add Box 24 and Box 25A (amount brought forward), and print your answer in Box 26. If Box 24 is a profit and is less than the amount in Box 25A, print the difference between Boxes 24 and 25A in Box 26. This is the total available net loss before net losses and/or subvention payments to or from other companies. Question 27 Net losses and subvention payments To offset net losses there must be a common shareholding of at least 66%, and 66% continuity of minimum voting interest must also be maintained (or 66% market value interest if a market value circumstance exists). To calculate voting or market value interest see Question 38 on page 40. To offset a net loss incurred during a current income year, the loss company and the profit company must be members of the same group at all times for that income year. To offset a net loss brought forward, the loss company and the profit company must be members of the same group of companies for the entire period, beginning with the income year the net loss is incurred in and ending with the year of offset. The amount of loss offset cannot exceed the taxable income of the profit company and neither may the amount of loss to be offset exceed the net loss of the loss company. Record individual details of the losses claimed or transferred and subvention payments received or made at Questions 39E or 39F. The total of these must equal Boxes 27 or 27A respectively. www.ird.govt.nz 29 Part-year grouping The general part-year grouping rule is that only the part of the net loss incurred in the same period as the profit is derived may be offset, if, during the period: –the loss company maintains continuity of shareholding, and –commonality of shareholding between loss and profit companies has been maintained. Net loss and profit amounts allowed to be offset are based on periods where continuity and commonality requirements are met for all companies taking part in a part-year grouping arrangement. If the company received net losses from another company or made a subvention payment to another company, put a minus sign in the relevant last box. Attach a schedule setting out the names and IRD numbers of the companies and the amount of the payment or loss. Qualifying companies Net losses are restricted for grouping and subvention payment purposes. A qualifying company loss can be offset against any group company profit (including non-qualifying company profits). Question 29E Foreign investor tax credit The foreign investor tax credit rules reduce the combined income tax and NRWT imposed on foreign investors with interests in a New Zealand company. See Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008) for details about the change of company tax rate. A company is entitled to a foreign investor tax credit when it pays a supplementary dividend of the same amount to its non-resident shareholders. The foreign investor tax credit can then be offset against the company's income tax liability. The foreign investor tax credit arises in the income year the supplementary dividend is paid and is to be offset in the following order: 1. Against the company's income tax payable for the year the supplementary dividend is paid. Enter this amount in Box 29E. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 30 2. At the company's election, either: - against the company's income tax liability for any of the previous four income years, or - against the income tax liability for another company in the same wholly owned group of companies for the year the supplementary dividend is paid in or any of the previous four income years. 3. Carried forward to subsequent years for offset against the tax liability of the company or another company in the same wholly owned group of companies. If the company has a foreign investor tax credit that can't be fully offset against its own income tax liability in the income year the supplementary dividend is paid, attach a note to the front of the return giving details of how to treat any excess credit. Question 29G Imputation credits If the company has imputation credits, it may have a net loss to carry forward. This will happen if the company's total imputation credits are greater than the tax payable at Box 29F. To calculate the net loss to carry forward, subtract the amount at Box 29F from the total imputation credits (Box 29G) and divide the answer by 0.28 (28%). If the deemed net loss is to be offset to other companies within the same group (rather than carried forward), reduce the amount of net loss shown at Box 27 by the amount offset. Question 30 Refunds and/or transfers If you want your refund transferred to another account or to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement, please tell us the date you would like this done. The date you can choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. www.ird.govt.nz 31 If the transfer is to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement, you'll need to include a note with your return authorising the transfer and giving the following information: –that the transfer is to arrears currently under an instalment arrangement –the name and IRD number of the taxpayer the transfer should be made to –whether the taxpayer is an "associated taxpayer" –the tax type and period –the date you want the transfer to take place. Note Question 30B Associated taxpayers For companies, the following persons are associated taxpayers for the purposes of transferring overpaid tax: –another company in the same group of companies –a shareholder-employee of the company –a partner in the same partnership. If you want your refund transferred to another person, you will need to show if they are an associated taxpayer. Transfer date You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it is not before the relevant dates set out as follows. For credit transferred: to your account/an associated taxpayer's account If the credit is from excess tax deducted (eg, RWT deducted on interest) it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax it's the day you overpaid it. Please note that special rules apply if tax pooling funds have been transferred in. to a non-associated taxpayer's account It's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you file your return. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 32 Future transfer dates If you want your credit transferred at a future date, attach a note to the front of your return with the details of the amount you want transferred, the account you want it transferred to (if it's to another person and they are associated) and the date you want it transferred. If you don't tell us the date you want your credit transferred, we will transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. If you want the credit transferred at a different date, you can ask us to change it (even if we have transferred your credit to cover a debt). Requesting transfers on your return You can ask us to transfer a refund to another account by filling out page 4 of the return. If you ask us to, we will transfer the refund to: • the company's own account or an account of someone associated to the company on the later of: –the day after the balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March) –the due date in the destination account. • an account of someone not associated to the company on the day after the return was filed. If you want the company's refund transferred at a different date from those listed earlier, you can attach a note to the return, including the details of the account you want the refund transferred to and the transfer date you want. If the transfer is going to another person, tell us if they are associated to the company. www.ird.govt.nz 33 Question 31 Initial provisional tax liability A company has an initial provisional tax liability if it: –starts to derive income from a taxable activity in the tax year, and –had not derived gross income from a taxable activity within the preceding four years, and –has residual income tax (RIT) of $60,000 or more in the current year. New businesses don't pay provisional tax in their first year of operation because there is no RIT from the previous year to base the calculation on. However, companies that have an initial provisional tax liability may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date. The instalment date interest applies from is determined by the business start date. Some new businesses make voluntary payments to reduce liability for interest. More information about the dates interest applies from is available in our guide Provisional tax (IR289). There are special rules about how interest is calculated when a company has an initial provisional tax liability and has changed its balance date. For further information, see our Provisional tax (IR289) guide. Print the date the company started to derive income from the taxable activity in Box 31. Question 32 2020 provisional tax 2020 provisional tax is charged for income the company will earn in the 2020 income year. It is payable in two, three or six instalments. There are three options for calculating your provisional tax - standard, estimation and ratio. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 34 If the company's 2019 RIT is: –$2,500 or less it does not have to pay provisional tax, but it can make voluntary payments –more than $2,500 but expected to be $2,500 or less for 2020 it may estimate 2020 provisional tax at nil –more than $2,500 and expected to be more than $2,500 for 2020 it must pay 2020 provisional tax using one of the payment options. Standard option (S) Under this option, your 2020 provisional tax is your 2019 RIT (where it is more than $2,500) plus 5%. If you think your income for 2020 will be more than your 2019 income, you can make voluntary payments over and above the amount you have to pay under the standard option. Note Estimation option (E) Companies can estimate their 2020 provisional tax. They can re-estimate any number of times up to and including their final instalment due date. If the company's 2020 RIT is expected to be less than its 2019 RIT, estimating may prevent the company from paying more than it has to. An estimate must be fair and reasonable at each instalment it applies to. If you use the estimation option, see "Not taking reasonable care penalty" and "Interest" on page 35. Note If the company estimates its provisional tax, write E in Box 32A and the amount of 2020 provisional tax in Box 32B. If you estimate your provisional tax your instalments should be one-third of your estimation. If you're using the ratio option and select E at Box 32A this will mean you are electing to stop using the ratio option. www.ird.govt.nz 35 Ratio option (R) If you're GST registered, you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 32A if you have already elected to use the ratio option. Your application to use the ratio option must be made by phone or in writing before the beginning of the income year you want to use it. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 32A. There is more information about the ratio option in our guide Provisional tax (IR289). Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the company's 2020 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2020 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, you may be liable for a not taking reasonable care penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax. Interest If the company has paid too much provisional tax, we may pay interest. If it has not paid enough provisional tax, we may charge interest. Interest the company pays is tax deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. Election to be a provisional tax payer A company is a provisional tax payer for the 2019 year if its RIT for that year is more than $2,500. If the 2019 RIT is $2,500 or less but the company paid provisional tax for the year, the company may elect to be a provisional tax payer for that year. This may affect the interest the company may be entitled to for that year. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2019 year, attach a note to the front of the 2019 return. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 36 Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in the balance date. For more information, read our guides Penalties and interest (IR240) and Provisional tax (IR289). Tax pooling Tax pooling allows taxpayers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool. This reduces their possible exposure to late payment penalties and interest. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: tax pooling). Payment dates 2020 provisional tax Generally, a company with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: First instalment 28 August 2019 Second instalment 15 January 2020 Third instalment 7 May 2020 A company with a balance date other than 31 March generally pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. There are two exceptions: • If it would be due on 28 December it is due on 15 January. • If it would be due on 28 April it is due on 7 May. These dates will alter if the company is registered for GST, and • the GST filing frequency is six-monthly, or • provisional tax is paid through the ratio option. If either of these situations apply to you, read our guide Provisional tax (IR289). www.ird.govt.nz 37 2019 end-of-year income tax Companies that have an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2020 to pay their tax. If you think this applies to your company, contact your agent. A company with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax (Box 29L) and any interest by 7 February 2020. A company with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the 7th day of the month before the following year's balance date. How to make payments You can make payments: • electronically • by credit or debit card. We recommend making electronic payments because it's the most accurate and reliable method. These electronic options are available through your bank: • online banking • automatic payment • direct credit, and • direct debit. When making electronic payments, include: • your IRD number • an accout type code • the period the payment relates to. Go to www.ird.govt.nz/pay for full details of our payment options. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 38 Late payment We may charge you a late payment penalty if you miss a payment or it’s late. We’ll also charge you interest if you don’t make your tax payment by the due date. Call us if you can’t pay your tax by the due date. We’ll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement depending on your circumstances. For more information go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: managing penalties). Question 34 Foreign rights If you calculated CFC or FIF income at Question 18 you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. For all interests of 10% or more in a foreign company, the additional disclosure is required. For other investments, the requirement for an additional disclosure depends on the company you are preparing the Companies income tax return (IR4) for. • If the company isn't widely held or a PIE, additional disclosure isn't required if the investments are in countries New Zealand holds a double tax agreement with (as at 31 March 2019) and the fair dividend rate or comparative value has been used. • If the company is widely held or a PIE you are required to file an additional disclosure. The disclosure forms are available at www.ird.govt.nz Please call 0800 377 774 if you need help to find the appropriate disclosure form. For information on foreign exchange rates, go to our website (search keywords: overseas currencies). Find out more about the base erosion profit shifting (BEPS) hybrid mismatch rules at www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: hybrid mismatch). www.ird.govt.nz 39 Question 35 Share repurchases When amounts distributed to shareholders on cancellation or repurchase of shares fall below specified thresholds, the amounts are taxable in full to shareholders as dividends. When distributions on repurchases exceed those thresholds, or occur through the stock exchange, the distributions will be deducted from available subscribed capital of the company and will be tax-free to the shareholders. However, this is only to the extent that the distributions are not in lieu of dividends. If the subscribed capital of the company has been depleted, the distributions will be taxable. Specific rules also govern the repurchase and subsequent sale of Treasury stock. The total value entered on the return should be the aggregate value of all distributions made by the company during the year for company shares repurchased, redeemed, cancelled or purchased as Treasury stock. Question 36 Foreign-sourced dividends Generally, funds would use the default FIF income calculation method (the fair dividend rate) which does not tax dividends separately. However, the foreign tax deducted from the dividend can be claimed as a credit against the tax payable on the calculated FIF income. A credit for any tax paid by the foreign company (on its earnings) may be allowed in calculating the amount payable by the New Zealand company. Any NRWT deducted from the foreign dividend paid to the New Zealand company may also be allowed as a credit. Information about exempt foreign dividends Although most foreign dividends received by companies are exempt from tax, you should still answer ''Yes'' to this question if the company receives an exempt foreign dividend. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 40 Foreign dividends from some investments are taxable. These should be included in the tax return as income from overseas. Dividends on foreign investments are taxable in three situations: • When the investment gives the company a direct income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, but the investment is one of certain investments that are excluded from the normal FIF rules (see Question 18 on page 18 for the most common exclusions). • When the dividend relates to an investment in fixed-rate shares ("fixed-rate foreign equity"). • When the dividend paid is tax-deductible in a foreign country by a foreign company (a "deductible foreign equity distribution"). Question 37 Company controlled or owned by non-residents We need to know whether the company is owned or controlled by non-residents because we may need to apply subpart FE or sections CH 9, GC 6-14 and GB 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Question 38 Lowest economic interests of shareholders The ownership tests measure a shareholder's voting and market value interests in a company. They apply to the net loss carry forward and grouping provisions, imputation credit carry forward provisions and the qualifying company rules. A shareholding individual's economic interest in a company will generally be measured by referring to the percentage of voting power they hold in that company. www.ird.govt.nz 41 A company has two shareholders, Barbara and Maria. The company has two classes of shares: • Class A shares carry a right to vote on matters other than the payment of dividends and appointment of directors. • Class B shares carry unrestricted voting rights. Barbara holds all 100 of the A shares in the company while Maria holds all 100 of the B shares. Barbara's percentage of voting interest in the company is measured as follows: DistributionsConstitution Variation in capital Directors 0 + 50 + 50 + 0 = 100 =25% 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 = 400 Maria's percentage of voting interest is 75%, calculated as follows: DistributionsConstitution Variation in capital Directors 100 + 50 + 50 + 100 = 300 =75% 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 = 400 Example The percentage of voting interest is the total percentage of rights a person has, by reason of their holding of shares (and options), to vote on: –the dividends or other distributions to be made by the company –the constitution of the company –any variation in the capital of the company –the appointment or election of directors. The continuity thresholds will be satisfied by taking into account the lowest economic percentage of rights attached to shares held by each shareholder of a company. If Barbara and Maria hold these proportions of shares for the entire income year, the "total lowest economic interest of shareholders" or the minimum continuity is 100%, because Barbara's 25% plus Maria's 75% equals 100%. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 42 If the proportion of shares held does not change during the entire income year, the total lowest economic interest of shareholders will always be 100%, as shown in the example below: On 1 September 2018 Barbara and Maria swapped shares and held these proportions to 31 March 2019, the company's balance date. 1 April 2018 1 Sep 2018 31 Mar 2019 Lowest Barbara 25% 75% 75% 25% Maria 75% 25% 25% 25% The lowest percentage of rights held by each shareholder during the income year is 25%. So, the total lowest economic interest of shareholders, or the minimum continuity, is 50%. Example In certain circumstances the shareholders' economic interests in a company will also be determined by the market value interests in the company. This is where the voting interests don't reflect the true economic interests held in a company. A shareholder's market value interest in a company equals their percentage share of the total market value of shares (and options) held in that company. The specific factors that require a market value interest to be calculated are called market value circumstances. A market value circumstance exists where: –the company has on issue debentures to which sections FA 2 and FZ 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply –the company has on issue shares where payment of dividends is guaranteed by a third party –there's an option to acquire shares in the company –an arrangement exists with the purpose of defeating a provision that depends on measurement of voting and market value interests. Add together the lowest economic interest of each shareholder and print the total in Box 38. Write percentages in the following format, for example, show 50% as 50.00, and 100% as 100.00. www.ird.govt.nz 43 Effect on the imputation credit account (ICA) If you keep an ICA and have had a change of shareholding of more than 34% you may need to make an adjustment on your annual imputation return at Box 42D ("Other debits") - see page 46. Question 39 Shareholder details - see also the IR4S Complete Question 39 if shareholders, directors and relatives of shareholders received remuneration or a loan. Remuneration is liable for ACC levies. Shareholders' salaries Write all remuneration with no PAYE deducted that the company paid to that person in Box 39B. For the company to claim a deduction for shareholder remuneration it must be paid either: –during the income year, or –within the time allowed for the company to file its return. If the remuneration isn't paid in time, the deduction can't be claimed until the following year. Loss offsets and subvention payments Record details of any losses claimed or transferred from or to each group member at Box 39E. Record details of any subvention payments claimed or transferred from or to each group member at Box 39F. The total of Boxes 39E must be recorded at Box 27. The total of Boxes 39F must be recorded at Box 27A. Current account balance If the shareholder's current account balance has been overdrawn, (that is, the shareholder owes the company money) then it is a debit balance. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 44 Annual imputation return The annual imputation return must be completed for the period 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019, regardless of your accounting year. If you're a member of an imputation group, see page 7. For more information please read our guide Imputation (IR274). Question 40 Opening balance This is the same as the closing balance at 31 March 2018. Tick either "Credit" or "Debit" below Box 40. New companies won't have a closing balance to bring forward. Write "0.00" in Box 40. Question 41 Credits Question 41A Income tax paid Include in Box 41A all payments of income tax and provisional tax made from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 for 1989 and subsequent income years.

Don’t include an amount at 41B. Question 41C RWT on interest received If the company received interest with RWT deducted between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, print the total RWT in Box 41C. Question 41D Imputation credits attached to dividends received If the company received dividends with imputation credits attached between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, print the total credits in Box 41D. www.ird.govt.nz 45 This is the total imputation credits attached to dividends received. This amount is not limited to the tax payable on your dividends and is not necessarily the same amount as the imputation credits being claimed in Box 14. Note Question 41E Other credits List any other credits made to the ICA from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019. Use a separate sheet of paper if necessary. Attach it to the top of page 3 and print the total in Box 41E. Other types of credits include: –RWT on dividends received –provisional tax allocated to the company by a company in the same wholly owned group that has overpaid its provisional tax –residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit deducted from the sale or transfer of residential land located in New Zealand during the income year, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transfered to outstanding amounts during the income year. Supplementary available subscribed capital account (SASCA) If you're a public unit trust or a group investment fund that maintains a SASCA and you're eligible to transfer credits from that account to the ICA, record the credits being transferred to the ICA in Box 41E (other credits). All public unit trusts or group investment funds maintaining a SASCA should, by the due date for filing the 2019 IR4 or IR4J, send a copy of that memorandum account together with any written queries to: Investment Desk Large Enterprises Inland Revenue PO Box 2871 Christchurch 8140 For more information on negative dividends and the SASCA rules, see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002). COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 46 Qualifying company election tax (QCET) payments Include any QCET payments made after 17 May 2007 as a credit in the ICA when working out the balance. Use the account balance in the formula, when calculating the imputation credit to be attached to a dividend paid by the qualifying company. See our Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs) Vol 11, No 5 (May/June 1999) and Vol 20, No 3, page 127 (April 2008). Question 42 Debits Question 42A Income tax refunded Print in Box 42A the company's total income tax refunds received from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 for 1989 and subsequent income years. Don't include any interest on tax received or income tax refunded for any year before 1989. Question 42B FDP refunds The FDP rules have been fully repealed from 1 April 2017. Don’t include an amount at 42B. Question 42C Imputation credits attached to dividends paid If the company paid dividends from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 with imputation credits attached, print the total credits in Box 42C. Question 42D Other debits List any other debits in the ICA and print the total in Box 42D. Examples of other types of debits are: –any provisional tax allocated by the company to a company in the same wholly owned group that has underpaid its provisional tax –an adjustment for a change of shareholding of more than 34% during the period 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019, regardless of your accounting year –an adjustment for a change in an imputation ratio –tax payable by a company on any part of a distribution not sourced from the subscribed capital of the company, where that company repurchases a share on-market. www.ird.govt.nz 47 Qualifying companies The 66% continuity of shareholding requirement does not apply to qualifying companies. There is no need to make an adjustment where there has been a change of shareholding, except in the year the company ceases to be a qualifying company. Question 43A Adjustments to debit balance If a qualifying company received an income tax refund after 1 April 1995 that created a debit balance in the ICA, no further income tax is required to the extent of any refunds received. If the qualifying company has a debit balance as a result of income tax refunded from 1 April 2018, please subtract the amount refunded at Box 43A. If the closing balance is a credit, there is no tax to pay. If the closing balance at Box 43B is a debit, it must be paid by 20 June 2019. There are two types of relief from payment of debit ICA balances. These are: –the offsetting income tax payments –same debit ICA balances reflected in successive years. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 16, No 1 (February 2004). Note Question 44 Imputation penalty tax Imputation penalty tax of 10% of the debit closing balance is also payable by 20 June 2019. Work out the 10% penalty in Box 44. If the total in Box 44A exceeds $100 and is not paid by the due date, late payment penalties and interest will apply - see page 38. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE 48 Limitations on tax refunds We may hold all or part of a refund if: –the company is expecting an income tax refund, and –the credit balance in the ICA at 31 March 2019 is less than the refund. If there have been additional credits to the ICA since 31 March 2019, the company may file an interim 2020 IR4J return in anticipation of an IR4 annual return being filed at a later date. We may then be able to release the refund. We can apply non-refundable overpaid income tax to a company's previous years' income tax liabilities, where these debits exist, rather than transferring the credit forward to the next year's provisional tax. This avoids further payments having to be made to meet back-year debts. Self-assessment by taxpayers Taxpayers have to assess their own liability as part of their return filing obligations. We may amend your assessment if a correction is required. If you dispute our assessment please go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: disputes) for more information. The four-month period for you to issue a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) to your self-assessment will start on the date Inland Revenue receives your return. www.ird.govt.nz 49 Accident Compensation Act 2001 Under the Accident Compensation Act 2001, Inland Revenue is required to provide the earnings information at Box 39B from this return to the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). The information is used by ACC to invoice all ACC levies. ACC invoicing for close companies (including earners' levy for shareholder-employee earnings with no PAYE deducted) starts from September each year. Maximum earnings from multiple companies The maximum amount of earners' levy that can be collected from a shareholder-employee is $1,755.37. A shareholder- employee may be due for a refund from ACC if the shareholder-employee's combined total remuneration from two or more companies is over $126,286. Please call ACC on 0800 222 776 to find out about the refund process. ACC earners' levy Shareholder-employees' salaries or directors' fees without PAYE deducted are liable for ACC earners' levy. The company will be invoiced by ACC for this levy. For more information about refunds or levies, please go to www.acc.co.nz or call ACC on 0800 222 776.

Look-through companies (LTC) file an IR7 income tax return each year they're an LTC. For further information about LTCs refer to our Look-through companies - IR879 guide. If yours is an Australian company or part of an imputation group, please see page 7. Non-active companies A non-active company is a company that has: –not received any gross income –no deductions –not disposed of any assets –not been party to any transactions during the tax year that: (i) gave rise to income for any person, or (ii) gave rise to fringe benefits to any employee or any former employee, or (iii) gave rise to a debit in the company's ICA (imputation credit account). These companies may be excused from filing tax returns if they complete a Non-active company declaration - IR433 form. Return due date If the company has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2020 to file the return, unless you have been granted an extension of time. If you have a balance date other than 31 March, this date may be different. Call us on 0800 377 774 if you are not sure of the filing date. If the company has a tax agent, you may have until 31 March 2021 to file the return. If this applies, contact your agent. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE6 Late filing penalties If you have to file a return and you don't send us one, you may be charged a late filing penalty. You should apply for an extension of time if you are unable to file your return on time. The penalty for filing your IR4 late depends on the company's net income. If your income is: –below $100,000, the penalty is $50 –between $100,000 and $1 million (both figures inclusive), the penalty is $250 –above $1 million, the penalty is $500. If you need an extension to your tax return filing date, tell us your reasons before your return is due. If you get a late filing penalty before applying for an extension, the penalty will stand. If you use a tax agent who has an extension of time arrangement with us and the extension is withdrawn, we will notify you that you must now file your return. Tax sparing Any company that has claimed a foreign tax credit for a tax sparing arrangement under a double tax agreement, must also complete a Tax sparing disclosure return - IR486 and send it to: International Revenue Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Group investment funds If the company's income is solely from Category A income, you must file an IR4.

Read the notes in the IR44E for further information. Research and development (R&D) tax losses You may be able to cash out any R&D losses if your company is a loss-making company that is a resident in New Zealand and your expenditure on R&D salary and wages is 20% or more of your total salary and wage expenditure. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/research-development ird.govt.nz7 Superannuation schemes A superannuation scheme, not registered with the Financial Markets Authority (FMA), which lets beneficiaries contribute, will be treated as a company for tax purposes and must file IR4 returns. Trans-Tasman imputation and imputation groups Australian companies can elect to maintain a New Zealand imputation account from the 2003-04 tax year. A form of grouping (for imputation purposes only) has also been introduced, which Australian companies may join. Return filing for trans-Tasman imputation Australian companies that make a trans-Tasman imputation election are required to file an Annual imputation return - IR4J by 31 July, after the end of the tax year. A Companies income tax return - IR4 isn't required, unless the company has a permanent establishment (eg, maintains an office) in New Zealand. Return filing for imputation groups Companies income tax return - IR4 Company returns must be filed by: –all New Zealand companies that elect to be a member of an imputation group and –Australian companies with New Zealand-sourced income. Annual imputation return - IR4J The imputation return for an imputation group should be filed by the group representative on a separate IR4J return. Imputation group members should not include any imputation details on page 7 of the IR4. An exception applies for nominated companies of a resident imputation group where there is an ICA debit balance. Foreign dividend payments - FDP The FDP rules have been fully repealed from 1 April 2017. This means FDP can no longer be included in your annual income tax return. Please do not include FDP credits in Box 14A and also leave 43B and 44B blank. For further details go to ird.govt.nz/imputation COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE8 Imputation return Most New Zealand resident companies, unit trusts, producer boards and cooperatives must file an imputation return each year. If you're an Australian company or part of an imputation group, please read page 7. The following bodies don't have to file imputation returns: –non-resident companies –look-through companies –trustee companies (but not group investment funds with Category A income) –any company with a constitution that prevents it distributing all its income or property to any proprietor, member or shareholder –companies whose income is completely exempt from tax –local authorities –Crown research institutes –non-active companies –Māori authorities. Note If you need to file the company’s imputation return before the income tax return is due, to allow a refund to be released, complete an Annual imputation return - IR4J. Questions 1 to 8 Company details Fill in Questions 1 to 8 only if the correct information is not printed on the return. Question 2 - Company name If the company has changed its name since the last time a return was filed, please attach a copy of the new certificate of incorporation with the name change details or call us on 0800 377 774 so we can update our records. Question 4 - Postal address If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 4. If your new address is a PO Box number, please show your box lobby if you have one. If you are unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealand Post. Leave this address panel blank if the company uses its agent's postal address. The agent will let us know of any change of address when they update their client list. ird.govt.nz9 Question 6 - Business industry classification (BIC) code If you're involved in a business or a trading activity, please write the BIC code only in Box 6. You don't need to give a description. We're required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to businessdescription.co.nz or call ACC on 0508 426 837. It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. Question 7 - Phone number We ask for your daytime phone number so we can contact you if we have any questions about your return. Question 8 - Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, eg, a building society account. If your bank account number isn't preprinted on the return form, please include it at Question 8. If your suffix has only two digits, enter them in the first two squares of the suffix box. Question 9 Non-resident A company is a tax resident of New Zealand if: –it's incorporated in New Zealand, or –its head office or centre of management is in New Zealand, or –its directors control the company in New Zealand. Otherwise, it's a non-resident for tax purposes. Questions 10 and 10A Imputation Page 7 of the IR4 return is the annual imputation return. If you have made any monetary entries in the annual imputation return, tick "Yes" at Question 10A. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE10 Note If you have filed, or will file, a separate Annual imputation return - IR4J, tick “No” at Question 10. Question 11 Has the company ceased? If this is a final return, include a set of accounts up to the date the company ceased trading and include details of any distribution of assets and liabilities. If the company is registered for GST or as an employer, you will need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. Depending on the company's circumstances, a number of other issues may need to be finalised, for example: –outstanding returns –arrears –FBT or ACC –imputation account balances (for qualifying companies) –specified superannuation contributions –RWT on dividends –10-year bonus issues. Find out how to finalise the company's tax accounts or deregister for GST at ird.govt.nz Note A company is still a legal entity until it is taken off the Companies Register. A company can stop trading (become non-active) but still have tax obligations such as filing returns. Non-active companies can be excused from filing - see page 5. ird.govt.nz11 Company tax return Question 12 Income from schedular payments If the company has received any schedular payments, we will send you a summary of income (previously known as a summary of earnings). Add up the total tax withheld and all the gross payments shown on the summary of income and write the totals in Boxes 12A and 12B. The summary of income form may not contain all the company's earnings information. If any details are missing, please include them at Question 12. If the company received a payment with no tax deducted, include the gross amount in Box 12B. Mineral mining tax credit Include in Box 12A the amount of refundable tax credit being claimed where a tax loss is incurred on disposal of land or by claiming rehabilitation expenditure. Transferring tax deductions Tax deducted from schedular payments made to close companies can be transferred directly to the company’s shareholder-employee(s) in some circumstances. You’ll need to reduce the amount claimed in Box 12A by the amount of tax deducted from schedular payments which has been transferred direct to a shareholder-employee of the company. You will still need to include the total schedular payments made to the company in Box 12B. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE12 Example LLC received schedular payments of $10,000 with total tax deducted of $2,000 during the year. The $10,000 is attributable to the company’s shareholder- employee through the attribution rule. LLC can transfer up to $2,000 of the tax deducted from the schedular payments it received to the company’s shareholder-employee(s). LLC transfers the full $2,000 of tax to the company’s sole shareholder-employee. As the full amount of tax has been transferred from LLC the amount in Box 12A should be $0. If the company is transferring tax deducted to shareholder- employee(s) it should attach details of the transfer to the return. The amount of tax transferred from the company to its shareholder-employee(s) will also need to be recorded as a debit entry in the company’s imputation credit account - see Question 44D on page 49. Question 13 New Zealand interest Interest from all New Zealand sources must be shown in the return. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 13A. If the company has had NRWT deducted from New Zealand interest, include this in Box 13A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 13B. Interest on broken term deposits If you have broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for "negative interest". This is interest repaid on the term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare on the tax return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business- related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest amount shown on the RWT withholding certificate (IR15 or equivalent statement). Deduct the allowable negative interest part, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Question 13 of the tax return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later tax return when the term deposit matures. ird.govt.nz13 Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you have paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Box 13B of your tax return. 3 Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we pay interest, include the interest in Box 13B for the income year the company received the interest. If the company paid us interest, include it as a deduction in the return for the income year the interest is paid. Note If expenses are deductible against the interest income, claim them at Box 20B. Don't send in the certificates or IR15 forms with the return, but keep them in case we ask for them. Income from financial arrangements If the company was a party to a financial arrangement, such as government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts or deferred property settlements, the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement may have to be calculated using a spreading method, rather than on a cash basis. If the financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation known as a base price adjustment must be made. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Show the RWT deducted and any income from the financial arrangement in Boxes 13A and 13B. Question 14 New Zealand dividends Generally, dividends are taxable. However, there is an exemption for dividends paid between members of a wholly owned group. To work out the total gross dividends, add up all net dividends received, any imputation credits, and any RWT deductions. Write the total of all dividends in Box 14B. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE14 Note The FDP rules have been fully repealed from 1 April 2017. Don’t include any FDP credits in Box 14A. Dividend tax credits The total tax credits for dividends (i.e. imputation credits) you can claim is limited to the income tax payable (28%) on each dividend the company receives. This is to ensure that surplus tax credits are not used to shelter tax on other income. Work out whether you need to apply this limitation to the dividend tax credits you will claim. Copy your total gross dividends (calculated for each dividend that had an imputation credit) from Box 14B to Box 1. 1 Multiply Box 1 by 0.28 (28%), and write the result in Box 2. 2 Write your total dividend tax credits (calculated for that dividend) in Box 3. 3 For each dividend, claim a dividend tax credit for the lower amount shown in Box 2 or Box 3. Write the total dividend imputation credits you are allowed to claim in Box 14. In Box 14A write the sum of your total dividend RWT credits you are allowed to claim. Note If expenses are deductible against the dividend income, claim them at Box 20B. Unit trusts Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable. The statement you receive from the unit trust should show the amounts to include in the return. For unit trusts that are also portfolio investment entities (PIEs) see page 19. ird.govt.nz15 Transfer of deductible expenses between member and master funds From the 2002-03 income year a member fund may, in certain circumstances, elect to transfer deductible expenses to a master fund. The master fund must invest, in whole or in part, in the member fund. The master fund can then deduct the transferred expenses. A member fund can include a group investment fund that derives Category A income, a public unit trust or a superannuation fund. A master fund can include a group investment fund that derives Category A income or a public unit trust. A public unit trust includes: –retail unit trusts, whose units are offered to the public and which have 100 or more unit holders –wholesale unit trusts, whose units are held by widely held investment vehicles such as other unit trusts or superannuation funds. Member or master funds wanting to take advantage of this provision should include details of the adjustment in a tax reconciliation statement accompanying the return. The information should accompany the returns of both funds involved in the transfer. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). Qualifying companies Generally, if a qualifying company is a shareholder in a company that isn't a qualifying company, all dividends the qualifying company derives from the other company are taxable. Dividends derived by a company (that has been a qualifying company at any time before deriving the dividends) are taxable. If a qualifying company is a shareholder in another qualifying company, only dividends with imputation credits attached and a return of a 10-year bonus issue before the 10-year period expires, are taxable. Dividends with no imputation credits attached, or a return of a 10-year bonus issue 10 years from the payment date, are exempt income. A distribution of a 10-year bonus issue before the 10-year period has expired, made when the company winds up, isn't taxable. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE16 If you need more help, read our guide Qualifying companies - IR435. Don't send in the dividend statements with the return, but keep them in case we ask for them. Question 15 Ma ̄ori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 15 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Māori authority credit and is part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, so the distributions are not taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: –the distribution made to you, including the taxable portion and the non-taxable portion –Māori authority credit. These amounts, not including any non-taxable distribution, will need to be transferred to the relevant boxes at Question 15. Example A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. It pays tax on this profit of $1,750 (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distributes the entire profit to its 10 members. Each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority liable to file an IR4 return would show the following information at Question 15: – Box 15B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) – Box 15A - $175 ird.govt.nz17 Question 16 Partnership, estate or trust income If the company received any income from a partnership, estate or trust, write any tax credits in Box 16A and the income totals in Box 16B. Don't include any: –overseas income - show this at Question 18 along with any credits attached –dividend imputation credits attached to dividends (include these in Box 14, RWT withheld in Box 14A and the gross dividend in Box 14B). Add up any other tax credits from partnerships, estates or trusts and write the total in Box 16A. Add up all the other income from partnerships, estates or trusts and write the total in Box 16B. Losses from limited partnerships If the company is claiming a loss from a limited partnership and you need help working out the amount you can claim, please go to ird.govt.nz Estate or trust income If you received a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust, please attach a note with your return giving details of the amount and any associated tax credits. We separate taxable distributions from a non-complying trust because they are taxed at a different rate. We need these details to work out your tax liability correctly. Question 18 Overseas income If your company received income from or while based overseas, between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020, show it in New Zealand dollars at Box 18B. If the company is a New Zealand resident for tax purposes, you must include any foreign contract or service income in Box 18B. Foreign investment fund (FIF) If the company held rights, such as shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, unit trust, superannuation scheme or life insurance policy, at any time during the 2020 income year, you may be required to calculate FIF income or loss. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE18 If the company has an interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC), they must calculate any attributed income or loss from that interest. Generally, the company will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The main exclusions from an interest in an FIF are: –investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts –interest in certain Australian unit trusts –limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand) –a 10% or greater interest in a CFC. CFC income and losses New rules were introduced in 2009 for calculating income or losses from a CFC. If the company has an interest in a CFC, they must calculate any attributed income or loss from that interest. Losses from a CFC can't be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses carried forward to the next tax year. Generally, these losses can only offset income or future income from CFCs resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. When CFC income or losses are calculated under the new rules, transitional rules apply to the use of carried forward losses incurred under the old rules. You can find more information on the rules at ird.govt.nz and in our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 21, No 8 (October/ November 2009). What to show in your return You can convert all overseas income and tax credits to New Zealand dollars by:  using the rates table available from ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators  contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. ird.govt.nz19 If the income was received from a financial arrangement, refer to Determination G9A or G9C under section 90 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Write the total of the allowable overseas tax paid in Box 18A. Include in Box 18B income before the deduction of any tax. Credit for tax paid overseas will be limited to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on that income. Please note that Australian franking credits or tax credits on dividends from the United Kingdom can't be claimed. Staple proof of tax paid overseas to the top of page 3 of the return. Foreign tax credits attached to dividends that are not required to be returned under the FIF rules can be claimed up to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on the FIF interest. Some foreign dividends have New Zealand imputation credits attached or New Zealand RWT deducted. These credits are not subject to the foreign tax credit limitation rule. Investments in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) Certain PIEs attribute their net income/loss and tax credits to the investors. Companies that are investors include the attributed income or loss in their tax return. Each year, the PIE is required to provide an investor statement setting out the details of the income/loss attributed to the investor for the year. The statement also shows the various types of tax credits associated with the income that has been attributed. These tax credits are subject to the tax credit limits calculated in relation to the tax on the attributed PIE income. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the company's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. Generally, PIEs have a 31 March balance date. The amount of income the company derives as a distribution by a PIE is excluded income unless it is fully imputed dividends from a listed PIE. Dividends from these PIEs are not liable for RWT. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz or read our guides, Information for companies that invest in PIEs - IR857 and Portfolio investment entity: a guide for PIEs - IR860. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE20 Question 19 Income and expenditure from residential property This question applies to close companies that own residential property, including overseas property that come within the residential property deduction rules in subpart EL of the Income Tax Act 2007. The residential property deduction rules, and question 19, do not apply to residential land that is owned by companies other than close companies. Close company - generally a company with five or fewer natural persons whose total voting interests are more than 50%. Associated persons are treated as one person. Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). The rules generally limit the amount of residential deductions you can claim in the year to the total amount of residential income earned in that year. If the residential property makes a loss it must be carried forward to the next year in which residential income, including income from properties held on revenue account, is earned. There are two levels of exclusions from the residential rules. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the new rules if the property is:  the main home;  property subject to the mixed-use asset rules (holiday home rented out part-time);  property owned by companies other than close companies;  property owned by government enterprises;  certain employee accommodation. For these types of property, the existing rules apply with the rental income or loss shown at Box 20 and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in Box 21. Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the new rules if it is for:  property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land;  other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. ird.govt.nz21 For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at Box 20 and taxable disposal net loss is shown at Box 21. Net rental income and net income from a taxable disposal plus any depreciation recovered is shown as residential income at Box 19A. Refer to the Rental income – IR264 guide for information on when the rules apply, how to calculate your income, the amount of deductions you can claim for this year, and the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. The residential property deduction rules also apply to any company who has borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities with significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity - and has interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land directly or indirectly. They come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. Completing Question 19 in your return Tick the method you used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. You can use one of the following:  Portfolio basis – combine the income and deductions for all rental properties in a portfolio.  Individual, property-by-property basis – income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option.  Combination of the property-by-property basis and portfolio basis – choose to apply different methods to different property. The Residential property deductions worksheets – IR1226 can be used to calculate the information required to be shown in your return. Calculate and identify the amounts for Boxes 19A to 19F using your chosen method/s. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE22 Write the total residential income in Box 19A. This is the total of: a. all residential rental income from a portfolio and/or individual property b. all depreciation recovery income for assets disposed of from a portfolio and/or individual property c. net income from the taxable sale/disposal of a property in a portfolio and/or individual property, and d. all net residential rental income, depreciation recovery income and net income from the taxable disposal of property from residential property excluded because it is held on revenue account. Only include the net income from a disposal once. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look-through company and have been attributed residential income Box 26G on the IR7P or IR7L include that here. Write the total residential rental deductions for residential rental properties in Box 19B. This is the total deductions for the current year – Box 14 on the Rental income – IR3R if completed. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential rental deductions shown in Box 26M on the IR7P or IR7L include that in Box 19B. If the company has breached the continuity rules, or you’re transferring excess deductions to a wholly owned group member, you’ll need to reduce the current year deductions in Box 19B to reflect the adjustment. The brought forward and carry forward boxes are calculated by our system when your return is processed. If the deductions are too low, you’ll need to contact us so we can change it when we process your return. Include a note with your return. See Question 27 for details on the continuity rules. Include the amount of any interest paid on an investment in a residential land rich entity that relates to the rental activity in Box 19B. Include the amount of interest paid that doesn’t relate to the rental property in Box 20. ird.govt.nz23 Write the total excess residential rental deductions brought forward from last year in Box 19C. This Box cannot be completed for the tax year ending 31 March 2020. Add Boxes 19B and 19C for total rental deductions. Calculate the amount of allowable deductions you can claim this year adjusting for excess deductions. Write the total Residential rental deductions claimed this year in Box 19D. This should equal Box 19B plus Box 19C less the amount of excess deductions for each property and/or property portfolio shown in Box 19F. The amount cannot exceed total residential income at Box 19A, unless there was a taxable sale/disposal of a rental property. Combine the net income results (after adjusting for any excess deductions) for all properties and write the total in Box 19E. Your total Net residential income in Box 19E cannot be a loss, unless the rental property or all the properties in the portfolio have been disposed of as taxable sales. Any losses are counted as zero unless the loss is the result of either:  excess deductions released as the result of the taxable disposal of the rental property or all portfolio properties.  claimable interest paid on your investment in a residential land-rich entity. Refer to the Rental income – IR264 guide. Write the total excess deductions for the year to be carried forward to next year in Box 19F. This is calculated as Residential rental deductions Box 19B minus Residential rental deductions claimed this year Box 19D. This includes the amount of any excess deductions to be carried forward for interest paid on an investment in a land rich entity in Box 19F. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE24 NOTES Note 1 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is not taxable; or you sell/dispose of the last property in a portfolio and at least one of the sales in the portfolio was not taxable, any excess deductions will transfer to another property or portfolio and carried forward to a future year in which you earn income from a residential rental property (including properties on revenue account). Note 2 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is taxable, or you sell/dispose of the last rental property in a portfolio, and the sale of all your rental properties in a portfolio were taxable, any remaining loss/excess deductions are released and can be offset against other income. However, this does not include any excess deductions transferred to the portfolio/property. Note 3 If you want to claim that a property is held on revenue account where the sale may be taxable, you need to tell us the property details of the property. You will be stating the sale will be a taxable sale when the property is disposed of. You must be able to separately identify the deductions relating to the property. For more information read the Rental income – IR264 guide. ird.govt.nz25 Question 20 Business or other rental income Write the net profit or loss in Box 20B. This is the amount of income or loss after the deduction of all allowable business expenditure, including shareholders’ salaries paid or credited. Only include net residential rental income or losses not included at Question 19 and commercial rental income in Box 20B. Don’t include any income already shown at Questions 12 to 16 and 19, losses from CFCs (see the notes to Question 36 on page 41) or claim donations here (see the notes to Question 25 on page 30). Note If expenses are deductible against income declared in Questions 12 to 14, claim them here. Attach either: –a fully completed Financial statements summary - IR10 form, or –the company's financial accounts. The IR10 is a statistics form that sets out a general summary of information from the financial accounts. If you complete an IR10 you don't need to send the financial accounts as well. You still need to complete them (unless the company is very small) and keep them in case we ask for them. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE26 Very small companies are not required to prepare financial accounts if these conditions apply during the income year. The company:  is not part of a group  has not derived income over $30,000  has not incurred expenditure over $30,000. Companies that don't prepare financial accounts must fill in an IR10 using information from their trial balance or financial records. For more information about who has to prepare financial accounts and minimum financial reporting requirements, go to our website at ird.govt.nz/records The attribution rule Under the attribution rule, anyone whose actions cause an "associated person" (company, trust or partnership) to earn income, can be personally liable for tax on that income. If this rule applies to persons associated to your organisation, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. To find out how to apply this rule, please refer to our Ta x Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000) and Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). ird.govt.nz27 Question 21 Income from taxable property sales/disposals Include all income and tax losses from land sales that are not included at Question 19.  Tax losses from disposals of residential property are also included under this question.  Net income from a bright-line sale is included under Residential income at Question 19. Except when the main home or holiday home taxed under the mixed-use asset rules apply. The profits are taxable if the company bought a property for the purpose of reselling it or if the company is in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. The profits may be taxable if the company:  is a building company and improved a property before selling it  developed or subdivided land and sold sections  had a change of zoning on company property and sold it within 10 years of buying it. If the company is a New Zealand tax resident it will need to pay tax on its worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales worldwide whether caught under the bright-line test for residential property sales or the other property rules. If the company purchased a residential property on or after 1 October 2015 and sold/disposed of it within the bright-line period, any profit will be taxable, whether the intention at the time of purchase was for resale or not. The bright-line period for:  properties purchased/acquired on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive, is two years,  properties purchased/acquired on or after 29 March 2018 is five years. Correctly calculate your profit or loss by completing a Property sale information – IR833 form for each property you have sold or disposed of. Include the results of any profit in your return. You can download the IR833 from ird.govt.nz Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary – IR10 or set of accounts. For more information on property sales see our guide Buying and selling residential property – IR313. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE28 Write the income or loss (other than a bright-line income or loss) at Box 21B. Question 21A Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If the company is an “offshore RLWT person” and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The company should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The company can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than one amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Question 22 Insurance premiums paid to an overseas insurer Special rules apply to any company paying a premium, including a reinsurance premium, to a non-resident insurer. If you're paying a premium to a non-resident insurer you need to get a separate IRD number to account for the tax on the premium income. This is because you're considered to be the insurer's agent. You will need to file an IR4 return under this separate IRD number and declare premiums paid as the only income received. Only 10% of the total gross premiums paid to overseas insurers is subject to the company tax rate of 28%. This equals 2.8% of the total premiums paid. Any premiums paid to insurers in Switzerland aren't subject to tax in New Zealand and should be deducted from the total gross premiums paid. Agency obligations also extend to other New Zealand residents, eg, brokers, who may initially collect premiums for payment to the non-resident insurer. If there is any default, the insured person is responsible for the tax. Print the gross amount of premiums paid to a non-resident insurer in Box 22. Print the gross amount of premiums paid to Switzerland in Box 22A. Deduct the figure in Box 22A from Box 22 and multiply the net amount by 0.1 (10%). Print your answer in Box 22B and copy this amount to Box 30. ird.govt.nz29 No other income should be returned as an agent for an overseas insurer. The company still needs to declare other income under its original IRD number. If you have any enquiries, contact: Large Enterprises Services Investigations and Advice Private Bag 39984 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 Phone 0800 443 773 Question 23 Other income Show any other income received by the company at Question 23. For example, the sale of: –shares or other property –securities –income from an undertaking or scheme. Note If the company has a 2020 loss it is carrying back to 2019, enter the loss amount in Box 23B (Other income) in your 2020 income tax return. See ‘Loss carry-back’ at Question 27 on page 32. Income from sale of non-FIF shares or other property Profits from the sale of shares and other property are taxable if the company: –buys and sells shares or other property as a business, or –buys shares or other property for the purpose of resale. This does not apply if shares are FIFs. List the details of income and expenses from these sales on a sheet of paper and staple it to the top of page 3 of the return. Include the total profit in Box 23B. Losses from shares or other property that are not a foreign investment fund (FIF) If the company has made a loss from the sale of an asset that was not a FIF and you can show that any profit made would have been taxable, you may be able to claim the loss as a deduction. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE30 Financial arrangements A company must account for income from financial arrangements on an accrual basis. Financial arrangements include government stock, futures contracts and deferred property settlements, excluding short-term agreements for sale and purchase of property. Changes to the rules for the treatment of financial arrangements have split the rules into two sets. Generally, the first set applies to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 and the second applies to financial arrangements entered into on or after that date. Both sets of rules require the income or expenditure to be spread over the term of the financial arrangement. This applies in every case - the company doesn't have to be in the business of buying or selling financial arrangements, or be intending to sell, as it would with shares. The company may, in certain cases, deduct any losses. Sale or maturity of financial arrangements When a financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment, must be made. The calculation ensures that the total gains or losses from the financial arrangement are accounted for. If you need any information on when losses can be deducted or how to calculate a base price adjustment, please call us on 0800 443 773. Income from an undertaking or scheme Profits from any undertaking or scheme entered into for the purpose of making a profit are taxable. Describe the undertaking or scheme and list the details of income and expenses from them. Staple this information to the top of page 3 of the return and include the total profit in Box 23B. Question 25 Donations A company (including an unlisted company with five or fewer shareholders) can claim a deduction for donations it makes to any society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund that has donee organisation status. You can view the list of these organisation at ird.govt.nz/donee Note State-funded tertiary education institutions, state schools and state-integrated schools don’t have to be approved to have donee organisation status. ird.govt.nz31 The deduction for donations can't be more than the company's net income after expenses (before the donation deduction is taken into account). Use the following steps to calculate the company's donation deduction.  If the amount in Box 24 is a loss, print nil in Box 25B.  If the donations made by the company exceed the amount in Box 24, copy the amount in Box 24 to Box 25B.  If the donations made by the company don't exceed the amount in Box 24, print the amount of the donations in Box 25B. Question 27 Net losses brought forward Losses from CFCs are not included in Box 27 - see Question 38 on page 42. Before a company is allowed to carry forward net losses, 49% continuity of minimum voting interest or market value interest must be maintained by a group of persons at all times, from the beginning of the year of net loss to the end of the year of carrying it forward (the continuity period). To check whether the shareholder continuity requirements have been met, use the lowest percentage of economic interest held by each shareholder during the continuity period. To calculate the total lowest economic interest see Question 40 on page 43. There are two types of net losses - specified activity net losses and other net losses. Specified activity net losses These are net losses from specified activities incurred before the 1991 income year. Any loss balance in relation to a specified activity that remained at the end of the 2019 income year must be offset against net income for the 2020 income year before taking into account other losses. The amount of this offset cannot exceed the net income. If the loss balance from specified activities incurred before the 1991 income year exceeds the net income for the 2020 income year, that excess amount is added to the tax loss for the year. The tax loss may be grouped with another company, subject to satisfying the commonality and continuity rules (see Question 29 below). Other net losses Other net losses are all those incurred from the 1991 income year onwards, including any net loss arising from excess imputation credits, and any net losses that were not limited before 1991. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE32 Write the total of all specified activity net losses and other net losses the company can bring forward to 2020 in Box 27A, and the amount the company has offset against 2020 income in Box 27B. If the company cannot offset any net losses in the 2020 income year write “0.00” in Box 27B. Note You should be able to find the amount of net loss the company has to bring forward on the loss notice sent to you with the company’s 2019 income tax assessment. If you don’t have a loss notice, enter the details from your own records. Loss carry-back Where on your return to claim a loss carried back You must let us know if the company is going to use the loss carry-back scheme. You can do this in the ‘I want to’ section of your income tax account in myIR and selecting “Opt-in to carry-back loss”. Claiming a loss carried back to 2019 from 2020 If the company has a 2020 loss it is carrying back to 2019, enter the loss amount in Box 23B (Other income) in your 2020 income tax return. You will then need to amend the company 2019 income tax return (if already filed) to include the loss. In myIR choose amendment reason “loss carry-back”. Select income type “you are claiming net losses brought forward” and enter the amount of the loss carried-back in Box 25B (Amount claimed this year). Claiming a loss carry-back in 2020 from 2021 If the company is claiming a loss carry-back in 2020, based on an estimated loss in 2021, enter the amount of the estimated loss carry-back in Box 27B (Amount claimed this year). Question 28 Total income after net losses brought forward Subtract Box 27B from Box 26. Print your answer in Box 28. ird.govt.nz33 Question 29 Net losses and subvention payments To offset net losses there must be a common shareholding of at least 66%, and 66% continuity of minimum voting interest must also be maintained (or 66% market value interest if a market value circumstance exists). To calculate voting or market value interest see Question 40 on page 43. To offset a net loss incurred during a current income year, the loss company and the profit company must be members of the same group at all times for that income year. To offset a net loss brought forward, the loss company and the profit company must be members of the same group of companies for the entire period, beginning with the income year the net loss is incurred in and ending with the year of offset. The amount of loss offset cannot exceed the taxable income of the profit company and neither may the amount of loss to be offset exceed the net loss of the loss company. Record individual details of the losses claimed or transferred and subvention payments received or made at Questions 41F or 41G. The total of these must equal Boxes 29 or 29A respectively. Part-year grouping The general part-year grouping rule is that only the part of the net loss incurred in the same period as the profit is derived may be offset, if, during the period: –the loss company maintains continuity of shareholding, and –commonality of shareholding between loss and profit companies has been maintained. Net loss and profit amounts allowed to be offset are based on periods where continuity and commonality requirements are met for all companies taking part in a part-year grouping arrangement. If the company received net losses from another company or made a subvention payment to another company, put a minus sign in the relevant last box. Attach a schedule setting out the names and IRD numbers of the companies and the amount of the payment or loss. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE34 Qualifying companies Net losses are restricted for grouping and subvention payment purposes. A qualifying company loss can be offset against any group company profit (including non-qualifying company profits). Question 31E Foreign investor tax credit The foreign investor tax credit rules reduce the combined income tax and NRWT imposed on foreign investors with interests in a New Zealand company. See Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008) for details about the change of company tax rate. A company is entitled to a foreign investor tax credit when it pays a supplementary dividend of the same amount to its non-resident shareholders. The foreign investor tax credit can then be offset against the company's income tax liability. The foreign investor tax credit arises in the income year the supplementary dividend is paid and is to be offset in the following order: 1. Against the company's income tax payable for the year the supplementary dividend is paid. Enter this amount in Box 31E. 2. At the company's election, either: - against the company's income tax liability for any of the previous four income years, or - against the income tax liability for another company in the same wholly owned group of companies for the year the supplementary dividend is paid in or any of the previous four income years. 3. Carried forward to subsequent years for offset against the tax liability of the company or another company in the same wholly owned group of companies. If the company has a foreign investor tax credit that can't be fully offset against its own income tax liability in the income year the supplementary dividend is paid, attach a note to the front of the return giving details of how to treat any excess credit. ird.govt.nz35 Question 31G Imputation credits If the company has imputation credits, it may have a net loss to carry forward. This will happen if the company's total imputation credits are greater than the tax payable at Box 31F. To calculate the net loss to carry forward, subtract the amount at Box 31F from the total imputation credits (Box 31G) and divide the answer by 0.28 (28%). If the deemed net loss is to be offset to other companies within the same group (rather than carried forward), reduce the amount of net loss shown at Box 29 by the amount offset. Question 32 Refunds and/or transfers If you want your refund transferred to another account or to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement, please tell us the date you would like this done. The date you can choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. Note If the transfer is to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement, you’ll need to include a note with your return authorising the transfer and giving the following information: –that the transfer is to arrears currently under an instalment arrangement –the name and IRD number of the taxpayer the transfer should be made to –whether the taxpayer is an “associated taxpayer” –the tax type and period –the date you want the transfer to take place. Question 32B Associated taxpayers For companies, the following persons are associated taxpayers for the purposes of transferring overpaid tax: –another company in the same group of companies –a shareholder-employee of the company –a partner in the same partnership. If you want your refund transferred to another person, you will need to show if they are an associated taxpayer. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE36 Transfer date You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it is not before the relevant dates set out as follows. For credit transferred: to your account/an associated taxpayer's account If the credit is from excess tax deducted (eg, RWT deducted on interest) it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax it's the day you overpaid it. Please note that special rules apply if tax pooling funds have been transferred in. to a non-associated taxpayer's account It's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you file your return. Future transfer dates If you want your credit transferred at a future date, attach a note to the front of your return with the details of the amount you want transferred, the account you want it transferred to (if it's to another person and they are associated) and the date you want it transferred. If you don't tell us the date you want your credit transferred, we will transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. If you want the credit transferred at a different date, you can ask us to change it (even if we have transferred your credit to cover a debt). Requesting transfers on your return You can ask us to transfer a refund to another account by filling out page 4 of the return. If you ask us to, we will transfer the refund to:  the company's own account or an account of someone associated to the company on the later of: –the day after the balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March) –the due date in the destination account.  an account of someone not associated to the company on the day after the return was filed. ird.govt.nz37 If you want the company's refund transferred at a different date from those listed earlier, you can attach a note to the return, including the details of the account you want the refund transferred to and the transfer date you want. If the transfer is going to another person, tell us if they are associated to the company. Question 33 Initial provisional tax liability A company has an initial provisional tax liability if it: –starts to derive income from a taxable activity in the tax year, and –had not derived gross income from a taxable activity within the preceding four years, and –has residual income tax (RIT) of $60,000 or more in the current year. New businesses don't pay provisional tax in their first year of operation because there is no RIT from the previous year to base the calculation on. However, companies that have an initial provisional tax liability may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date. The instalment date interest applies from is determined by the business start date. Some new businesses make voluntary payments to reduce liability for interest. More information about the dates interest applies from is available in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. There are special rules about how interest is calculated when a company has an initial provisional tax liability and has changed its balance date. For further information, see our Provisional tax - IR289 guide. Print the date the company started to derive income from the taxable activity in Box 33. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE38 Question 34 2021 provisional tax 2021 provisional tax is charged for income the company will earn in the 2021 income year. It is payable in two, three or six instalments. There are three options for calculating your provisional tax - standard, estimation and ratio. If the company's 2020 RIT is: –$5,000 or less it does not have to pay provisional tax, but it can make voluntary payments –more than $5,000 but expected to be $5,000 or less for 2021 it may estimate 2021 provisional tax at nil –more than $5,000 and expected to be more than $5,000 for 2021 it must pay 2021 provisional tax using one of the payment options. Standard option (S) Under this option, your 2021 provisional tax is your 2020 RIT (where it is more than $5,000) plus 5%. Note If you think your income for 2021 will be more than your 2020 income, you can make voluntary payments over and above the amount you have to pay under the standard option. Estimation option (E) Companies can estimate their 2021 provisional tax. They can re-estimate any number of times up to and including their final instalment due date. If the company's 2021 RIT is expected to be less than its 2020 RIT, estimating may prevent the company from paying more than it has to. Note An estimate must be fair and reasonable at each instalment it applies to. If you use the estimation option, see “Not taking reasonable care penalty” and “Interest” on page 39. If the company estimates its provisional tax, write E in Box 34A and the amount of 2021 provisional tax in Box 34B. If you estimate your provisional tax your instalments should be one-third of your estimation. If you're using the ratio option and select E at Box 34A this will mean you are electing to stop using the ratio option. ird.govt.nz39 Ratio option (R) If you're GST registered, you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 34A if you have already elected to use the ratio option. Your application to use the ratio option must be made by phone or in writing before the beginning of the income year you want to use it. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 34A. There is more information about the ratio option in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the company's 2021 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2021 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, you may be liable for a not taking reasonable care penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax. Interest If the company has paid too much provisional tax, we may pay interest. If it has not paid enough provisional tax, we may charge interest. Interest the company pays is tax deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. Election to be a provisional tax payer A company is a provisional tax payer for the 2020 year if its RIT for that year is more than $2,500. If the 2020 RIT is $2,500 or less but the company paid provisional tax for the year, the company may elect to be a provisional tax payer for that year. This may affect the interest the company may be entitled to for that year. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2020 year, attach a note to the front of the 2020 return. Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in the balance date. For more information, read our guides Penalties and interest - IR240 and Provisional tax - IR289. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE40 Tax pooling Tax pooling allows taxpayers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool. This reduces their possible exposure to late payment penalties and interest. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to ird.govt.nz/tax-pooling Payment dates 2021 provisional tax Generally, a company with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: First instalment 28 August 2020 Second instalment 15 January 2021 Third instalment 7 May 2021 A company with a balance date other than 31 March generally pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. There are two exceptions:  If it would be due on 28 December it is due on 15 January.  If it would be due on 28 April it is due on 7 May. These dates will alter if the company is registered for GST, and  the GST filing frequency is six-monthly, or  provisional tax is paid through the ratio option. If either of these situations apply to you, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. 2020 end-of-year income tax Companies that have an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2021 to pay their tax. If you think this applies to your company, contact your agent. A company with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax (Box 31L) and any interest by 7 February 2021. A company with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the 7th day of the month before the following year's balance date. ird.govt.nz41 How to make payments You can make payments by:  direct debit in myIR  credit or debit card at ird.govt.nz/pay  internet banking - most New Zealand banks have a pay tax option. When making a payment, include:  your IRD number  the account type you are paying  the period the payment relates to. Find all the details of our payment options at ird.govt.nz/pay Late payment If you do not pay a bill on time, you may have to pay penalties and interest. Contact us if you are not able to pay on time. We’ll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement. Find out more at ird.govt.nz/penalties Question 36 Foreign rights If you calculated CFC or FIF income at Question 18 you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. For all interests of 10% or more in a foreign company, the additional disclosure is required. For other investments, the requirement for an additional disclosure depends on the company you are preparing the Companies income tax return - IR4 for.  If the company isn't widely held or a PIE, additional disclosure isn't required if the investments are in countries New Zealand holds a double tax agreement with (as at 31 March 2020) and the fair dividend rate or comparative value has been used.  If the company is widely held or a PIE you are required to file an additional disclosure. The disclosure forms are available at ird.govt.nz Please call 0800 377 774 if you need help to find the appropriate disclosure form. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE42 For information on foreign exchange rates, go to ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators Find out more about the base erosion profit shifting (BEPS) hybrid mismatch rules at ird.govt.nz/beps Question 37 Share repurchases When amounts distributed to shareholders on cancellation or repurchase of shares fall below specified thresholds, the amounts are taxable in full to shareholders as dividends. When distributions on repurchases exceed those thresholds, or occur through the stock exchange, the distributions will be deducted from available subscribed capital of the company and will be tax-free to the shareholders. However, this is only to the extent that the distributions are not in lieu of dividends. If the subscribed capital of the company has been depleted, the distributions will be taxable. Specific rules also govern the repurchase and subsequent sale of Treasury stock. The total value entered on the return should be the aggregate value of all distributions made by the company during the year for company shares repurchased, redeemed, cancelled or purchased as Treasury stock. Question 38 Foreign-sourced dividends Generally, funds would use the default FIF income calculation method (the fair dividend rate) which does not tax dividends separately. However, the foreign tax deducted from the dividend can be claimed as a credit against the tax payable on the calculated FIF income. A credit for any tax paid by the foreign company (on its earnings) may be allowed in calculating the amount payable by the New Zealand company. Any NRWT deducted from the foreign dividend paid to the New Zealand company may also be allowed as a credit. Information about exempt foreign dividends Although most foreign dividends received by companies are exempt from tax, you should still answer ''Yes'' to this question if the company receives an exempt foreign dividend. ird.govt.nz43 Foreign dividends from some investments are taxable. These should be included in the tax return as income from overseas. Dividends on foreign investments are taxable in three situations:  When the investment gives the company a direct income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, but the investment is one of certain investments that are excluded from the normal FIF rules (see Question 18 on page 17 for the most common exclusions).  When the dividend relates to an investment in fixed-rate shares ("fixed-rate foreign equity").  When the dividend paid is tax-deductible in a foreign country by a foreign company (a "deductible foreign equity distribution"). Question 39 Company controlled or owned by non-residents We need to know whether the company is owned or controlled by non-residents because we may need to apply subpart FE or sections CH 9, GC 6-14 and GB 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Question 40 Lowest economic interests of shareholders The ownership tests measure a shareholder's voting and market value interests in a company. They apply to the net loss carry forward and grouping provisions, imputation credit carry forward provisions and the qualifying company rules. A shareholding individual's economic interest in a company will generally be measured by referring to the percentage of voting power they hold in that company. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE44 Example A company has two shareholders, Barbara and Maria. The company has two classes of shares:  Class A shares carry a right to vote on matters other than the payment of dividends and appointment of directors.  Class B shares carry unrestricted voting rights. Barbara holds all 100 of the A shares in the company while Maria holds all 100 of the B shares. Barbara’s percentage of voting interest in the company is measured as follows: DistributionsConstitution Variation in capital Directors 0 + 50 + 50 + 0 = 100 =25% 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 = 400 Maria’s percentage of voting interest is 75%, calculated as follows: DistributionsConstitution Variation in capital Directors 100 + 50 + 50 + 100 = 300 =75% 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 = 400 The percentage of voting interest is the total percentage of rights a person has, by reason of their holding of shares (and options), to vote on: –the dividends or other distributions to be made by the company –the constitution of the company –any variation in the capital of the company –the appointment or election of directors. The continuity thresholds will be satisfied by taking into account the lowest economic percentage of rights attached to shares held by each shareholder of a company. If Barbara and Maria hold these proportions of shares for the entire income year, the "total lowest economic interest of shareholders" or the minimum continuity is 100%, because Barbara's 25% plus Maria's 75% equals 100%. ird.govt.nz45 If the proportion of shares held does not change during the entire income year, the total lowest economic interest of shareholders will always be 100%, as shown in the example below: Example On 1 September 2019 Barbara and Maria swapped shares and held these proportions to 31 March 2020, the company’s balance date. 1 April 2019 1 Sep 2019 31 Mar 2020 Lowest Barbara 25% 75% 75% 25% Maria 75% 25% 25% 25% The lowest percentage of rights held by each shareholder during the income year is 25%. So, the total lowest economic interest of shareholders, or the minimum continuity, is 50%. In certain circumstances the shareholders' economic interests in a company will also be determined by the market value interests in the company. This is where the voting interests don't reflect the true economic interests held in a company. A shareholder's market value interest in a company equals their percentage share of the total market value of shares (and options) held in that company. The specific factors that require a market value interest to be calculated are called market value circumstances. A market value circumstance exists where: –the company has on issue debentures to which sections FA 2 and FZ 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply –the company has on issue shares where payment of dividends is guaranteed by a third party –there's an option to acquire shares in the company –an arrangement exists with the purpose of defeating a provision that depends on measurement of voting and market value interests. Add together the lowest economic interest of each shareholder and print the total in Box 40. Write percentages in the following format, for example, show 50% as 50.00, and 100% as 100.00. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE46 Effect on the imputation credit account (ICA) If you keep an ICA and have had a change of shareholding of more than 34% you may need to make an adjustment on your annual imputation return at Box 44D ("Other debits") - see page 49. Question 41 Shareholder details - see also the IR4S Complete Question 41 if shareholders, directors and relatives of shareholders received remuneration or a loan. Remuneration is liable for ACC levies. Shareholders' salaries Write all remuneration with no PAYE deducted that the company paid to that person in Box 41B. For the company to claim a deduction for shareholder remuneration it must be paid either: –during the income year, or –within the time allowed for the company to file its return. If the remuneration isn't paid in time, the deduction can't be claimed until the following year. Over-payments of AIM provisional tax that relate to shareholder employee salary accruals are allowed to be used to meet the shareholder’s tax liability on that salary at the end of the income year. Record details of any AIM tax credits transferred to each shareholder at Box 41C. Loss offsets and subvention payments Record details of any losses claimed or transferred from or to each group member at Box 41F. Record details of any subvention payments claimed or transferred from or to each group member at Box 41G. The total of Boxes 41F must be recorded at Box 29. The total of Boxes 41G must be recorded at Box 29A. Current account balance If the shareholder's current account balance has been overdrawn, (that is, the shareholder owes the company money) then it is a debit balance. ird.govt.nz47 Annual imputation return The annual imputation return must be completed for the period 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020, regardless of your accounting year. If you're a member of an imputation group, see page 7. For more information please read our guide Imputation - IR274. Question 42 Opening balance This is the same as the closing balance at 31 March 2019. Tick either "Credit" or "Debit" below Box 42. New companies won't have a closing balance to bring forward. Write "0.00" in Box 42. Question 43 Credits Question 43A Income tax paid Include in Box 43A all payments of income tax and provisional tax made from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020 for 1989 and subsequent income years. Don't include any FBT, ESCT, interest on tax, late payment penalties, imputation penalty tax or RWT. Question 43B FDP paid The FDP rules have been fully repealed from 1 April 2017. Don’t include an amount at 43B. Question 43C RWT on interest received If the company received interest with RWT deducted between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020, print the total RWT in Box 43C. Question 43D Imputation credits attached to dividends received If the company received dividends with imputation credits attached between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020, print the total credits in Box 43D. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE48 Note This is the total imputation credits attached to dividends received. This amount is not limited to the tax payable on your dividends and is not necessarily the same amount as the imputation credits being claimed in Box 14. Question 43E Other credits List any other credits made to the ICA from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020. Use a separate sheet of paper if necessary. Attach it to the top of page 3 and print the total in Box 43E. Other types of credits include: –RWT on dividends received –provisional tax allocated to the company by a company in the same wholly owned group that has overpaid its provisional tax –residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit deducted from the sale or transfer of residential land located in New Zealand during the income year, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transfered to outstanding amounts during the income year. Supplementary available subscribed capital account (SASCA) If you're a public unit trust or a group investment fund that maintains a SASCA and you're eligible to transfer credits from that account to the ICA, record the credits being transferred to the ICA in Box 43E (other credits). All public unit trusts or group investment funds maintaining a SASCA should, by the due date for filing the 2020 IR4 or IR4J, send a copy of that memorandum account together with any written queries to: Investment Desk Large Enterprises Inland Revenue PO Box 2871 Christchurch 8140 For more information on negative dividends and the SASCA rules, see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002). ird.govt.nz49 Qualifying company election tax (QCET) payments Include any QCET payments made after 17 May 2007 as a credit in the ICA when working out the balance. Use the account balance in the formula, when calculating the imputation credit to be attached to a dividend paid by the qualifying company. See our Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs) Vol 11, No 5 (May/June 1999) and Vol 20, No 3, page 127 (April 2008). Question 44 Debits Question 44A Income tax refunded Print in Box 44A the company's total income tax refunds received from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020 for 1989 and subsequent income years. Don't include any interest on tax received or income tax refunded for any year before 1989. Question 44B FDP refunds The FDP rules have been fully repealed from 1 April 2017. Don’t include an amount at 44B. Question 44C Imputation credits attached to dividends paid If the company paid dividends from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020 with imputation credits attached, print the total credits in Box 44C. Question 44D Other debits List any other debits in the ICA and print the total in Box 44D. Examples of other types of debits are: –any provisional tax allocated by the company to a company in the same wholly owned group that has underpaid its provisional tax –an adjustment for a change of shareholding of more than 34% during the period 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020, regardless of your accounting year –an adjustment for a change in an imputation ratio –tax payable by a company on any part of a distribution not sourced from the subscribed capital of the company, where that company repurchases a share on-market. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE50 Qualifying companies The 66% continuity of shareholding requirement does not apply to qualifying companies. There is no need to make an adjustment where there has been a change of shareholding, except in the year the company ceases to be a qualifying company. Question 45A Adjustments to debit balance If a qualifying company received an income tax refund after 1 April 1995 that created a debit balance in the ICA, no further income tax is required to the extent of any refunds received. If the qualifying company has a debit balance as a result of income tax refunded from 1 April 2019, please subtract the amount refunded at Box 45A. If the closing balance is a credit, there is no tax to pay. If the closing balance at Box 45B is a debit, it must be paid by 20 June 2020. Note There are two types of relief from payment of debit ICA balances. These are: –the offsetting income tax payments –same debit ICA balances reflected in successive years. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 16, No 1 (February 2004). Question 46 Imputation penalty tax Imputation penalty tax of 10% of the debit closing balance is also payable by 20 June 2020. Work out the 10% penalty in Box 46. If the total in Box 46A exceeds $100 and is not paid by the due date, late payment penalties and interest will apply - see page 41. ird.govt.nz51 Limitations on tax refunds We may hold all or part of a refund if: –the company is expecting an income tax refund, and –the credit balance in the ICA at 31 March 2020 is less than the refund. If there have been additional credits to the ICA since 31 March 2020, the company may file an interim 2021 IR4J return in anticipation of an IR4 annual return being filed at a later date. We may then be able to release the refund. We can apply non-refundable overpaid income tax to a company's previous years' income tax liabilities, where these debits exist, rather than transferring the credit forward to the next year's provisional tax. This avoids further payments having to be made to meet back- year debts. Self-assessment by taxpayers Taxpayers have to assess their own liability as part of their return filing obligations. We may amend your assessment if a correction is required. If you dispute our assessment please go to ird.govt.nz/disputes for more information. The four-month period for you to issue a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) to your self-assessment will start on the date Inland Revenue receives your return.
