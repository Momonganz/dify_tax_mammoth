1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 (September 1996) Introduction From 1 July 1996 the income tax scale consists of a bottom rate of 21.5c in the dollar for all taxable income up to $34,200, and a top rate of 33c on each additional dollar of income. From 1 July 1997 the income tax scale will consist of a bottom rate of 19.5c in the dollar for all taxable income up to $38,000. The top marginal tax rate continues unchanged. These changes result in composite tax rates applying for the 1996-97 and 1997-98 income years. The PAYE and RWT rates have been changed accord- ingly. Background The Government announced in its publication Tax Reduction and Social Policy: Programme: Details that the aims of the tax reduction programme are to: • help more people get into paid work • increase the rewards they get from paid work • improve the lifetime rewards from training and education. Reducing the lower tax rate and increasing the top marginal tax rate threshold will increase the rewards available to people who undertake overtime or under- take training or education. New Zealand has a two-step statutory income tax scale. Before 1 July 1996 the bottom tax rate was 24c on each dollar of income up to $30,875 per annum and 33c on each subsequent dollar. The two-step tax scale will remain but the rates and thresholds at which the rates apply will change. Composite rates explained As many of the proposed tax changes apply from 1 July, part-way through an income year, it is necessary to apply a composite tax scale for that income year. A composite rate is simply a weighted average of the applicable tax scale applying for the first three months of the income year and the tax scale applying for the last nine months of the income year. For example, from 1 July 1996 the income tax scale will be a bottom rate of 21.5c in the dollar for all taxable income up to $34,200 and a top rate of 33c on each additional dollar of income. The composite rate for taxable income up to $30,875 will be 22.125c in the complete dollar. This is the average of the 24c rate for the first three months and the 21.5c rate for the last nine months in the income year. Key features Changes taking effect on 1 July 1996 From 1 July 1996 the income tax rates are a bottom rate of 21.5c in the dollar for all taxable income up to $34,200 and a top rate of 33c on each additional dollar of income. Given the 1 July application date, this results in the following composite rate scale for the 1996-97 income year: Tax rate Incomeper dollar $1 - $30,87522.125c $30,876 - $34,20024.375c $34,201 and over33c This composite tax scale has been inserted into Part B of Schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. These rates were fixed by the Taxation (Annual Rates of Income Tax 1996-97) Act 1996, which received royal assent on 26 July 1996. The resident withholding tax deduction rate applying to interest has been lowered from 24c to 21.5c of each dollar of interest income. The amendment applies to any interest paid on or after 1 July 1996. It ensures that the resident withholding tax rate is maintained at the lower statutory marginal tax rate during the 1996-97 income year. Income tax rates Schedule 1, Schedule 14 and Schedule 19 Income Tax Act 1994 Tax Reduction and Social Policy Bill Part 1 - Tax Rate Reductions This part discusses the three items which form part of the reduction in income tax rates. The first item concerns the reduction in the statutory tax rates. The second deals with the changes to the low income rebate, and the third deals with the implications of the tax reductions for provisional taxpayers. These changes to the income tax rates only apply to individual taxpayers (other than on trustee income). There is no change to the company income tax rate or rates applying to non-individuals. continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 (September 1996) The withholding rate applying to secondary employ- ment and extra emoluments has been amended. The rate is reduced from 28c to 24c from 1 July 1996. This sets the rate at the effective marginal tax rate applying to income from employment for those who earn between $9,500 and $34,200 in the 1996-97 income year. The weekly PAYE tables are also amended with effect from 1 July 1996, to incorporate the changes to all of the following: • the statutory tax scale • the New Zealand Superannuitant surcharge exemp- tion • the withholding rates applying to secondary employ- ment and extra emoluments • the low income rebate. Changes taking effect on 1 July 1997 From 1 July 1997 the marginal tax rate on taxable income up to $38,000 will be 19.5c in the dollar. The top marginal tax rate continues unchanged. This results in the following composite rate scale for the 1997-98 income year: Tax rate Incomeper dollar $1 - $34,20020c $34,201 - $38,00022.875c $38,001 and over33c The composite tax rate scale for the 1996-97 income year has been replaced by this scale for the 1997-98 income year. These rates will be confirmed during the 1997-98 income year by an annual taxing provision. The resident withholding tax deduction rate applying to interest subject to resident withholding tax will be reduced from 21.5c to 19.5c from 1 July 1997. The withholding rate applying to secondary employ- ment and extra emoluments will be reduced from 24c to 21c from 1 July 1997. A new weekly PAYE table has been inserted. The PAYE tables have been amended, with effect from 1 July 1997, to incorporate the changes to: • the statutory tax scale • the changes in the New Zealand Superannuitant surcharge exemption • the withholding rates applying to secondary employ- ment and extra emoluments • the changes in the low income rebate. Changes taking effect on 1 April 1998 The tax rates applying to individuals for the 1998-99 income year and subsequent years will be: Tax rate Incomeper dollar $1 - $38,00019.5c $38,001 and over33c As there is no change in tax rates applying from 1 July 1998, this tax scale is not a composite tax scale; it reflects the actual tax rates applying for the whole year and subsequent years. Again these rates will need to be fixed by an annual taxing provision passed during the 1998-99 income year. No change in withholding rates, such as the resident withholding tax rate applying to interest, is required because the PAYE and other withholding rates as set on 1 July 1997 remain correct. from page 1 Low income rebate Section KC 1 Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The low income rebate is being altered to maintain the effective tax rate of 15c in the dollar which applies to income between zero and $9,500 per annum. The abatement rate is being altered to ensure that abatement ceases at the point the top marginal tax rate starts. Background In the 1995-96 income year the low income rebate applied to natural persons who earned less than $30,875 of income a year. For superannuitants the rebate was 9.0c for every complete dollar of net income earned up to $9,500. For other natural persons with net income of less than $9,500 the rebate was 9.0c for every dollar of assessable income other than interest, dividends, royalties, rents, beneficiary income and taxable distribu- tions (distributions from non-qualifying and foreign trusts). The rebate resulted in an effective tax rate on the first $9,500 of income of 15c in the whole dollar, being the 24c statutory rate applying in that income year less the 9c rebate. Those natural persons whose income from personal exertion exceeds $9,500 or superannuitants whose income exceeds $9,500 receive the maximum rebate of $855, reduced by 4c for each dollar of assessable income over $9,500. The rebate was fully abated when assess- able income reached $30,875. It provided a middle effective tax rate for those who qualified for the low income rebate of 28c in the whole dollar, made up of the 24c statutory rate plus the 4c abatement. The effect of the changes to the rebate are: • to maintain the effective tax rate of 15c in the dollar which applies to annual incomes between zero and $9,500. This means that as the statutory tax rate is reduced there is also a consequential reduction in the value of the rebate. • to set the abatement rate so that the rebate is fully abated when a person’s income reaches the top statutory tax rate. For example, for the 1996-97 income year the rebate is fully abated when income reaches $34,200, being the threshold above which the 33c in the dollar top marginal rate applies. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 (September 1996) Key features The low income rebate has been reduced so that the composite rebate for the 1996-97 income year is, for super- annuitants, 7.125c for every complete dollar of assessable income earned up to $9,500. For other natural persons with assessable income of less than $9,500, the rebate is 7.125c for every dollar of assessable income other than interest, dividends, royalties, rents, beneficiary income and taxable distributions (distributions from non-qualifying and foreign trusts). This reduces the composite statutory tax rate for this year of 22.125c in the dollar to 15c in the dollar. The abatement rate for incomes between $9,500 and $30,875 is 2.875c for each complete dollar. Above $30,875 the abatement rate is 1.875c, with the rebate fully abated when income reaches $34,200.

This reduces the composite statutory tax rate for this year from 20c in the dollar to 15c in the dollar. The abatement rate for incomes between $9,500 and $34,200 is 1.75c for each complete dollar. Above $34,200 the abatement rate is 1.125c, with the rebate fully abated when income reaches $38,000. The low income rebate is further reduced for the 1998-99 income year to 4.5c for every complete dollar, with the abatement rate of 1.5c in the complete dollar applying to income between $9,500 and $38,000. Unlike the previous two years’ low income rebate figures, this is not a composite rebate. For those who qualify for the low income rebate, the composite tax rates and the effective tax rates per dollar of income for the 1995-96 to 1998-99 income years are: 1995/96 (Current scale)1996/971997/981998/99 Tax rates Composite Tax rates Composite Tax ratesTax rates Income bandTax ratesplus LIRtax ratesplus LIRtax ratesplus LIRTax ratesplus LIR $0 - $9,50024c15c22.125c15c20c15c19.5c15c $9,500 -$30,87524c28c22.125c25c20c21.75c19.5c21c $30,875 - $34,20033c33c24.375c26.25c20c21.75c19.5c21c $34,200 - $38,00033c33c33c33c22.875c24c19.5c21c $38,000 and up33c33c33c33c33c33c33c33c Provisional tax Section MB 2 (1) Income Tax Act 1994/Section 144 Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction The uplift factors which provisional taxpayers apply to a prior year’s residual income tax to determine the amount of provisional tax payable in the current year have been amended. They have been reduced to ensure that provisional taxpayers do not overpay 1996-97 provisional tax as a result of the tax rate reductions. Background With the reduction in tax rates, if natural persons used a prior year’s tax liability to determine the amount of provisional tax payable this year they would overpay their provisional tax if no adjustment were made to the last year’s payment basis. The amendments apply only to taxpayers whose residual income tax is $2,500 or more, and whose previous year’s taxable income was less than $70,000. continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 (September 1996) from page 3 A similar adjustment will be considered for the 1997-98 income year in a subsequent tax bill. It is not possible to make the adjustments at this time as the appropriate changes in uplift percentage depend on factors such as the changes in the income levels of natural person provisional taxpayers. Key features If 1995-96 year’s income is known A natural person with taxable income up to $70,000 for the 1995-96 income year may pay provisional tax for the current year on the basis of his or her 1995-96 residual income tax. Previously, a taxpayer paying under this option was required to pay on the basis of 1995-96 residual income plus 5%. If 1995-96 year’s income is not known There is a change for natural persons with taxable income up to $70,000 for the 1994-95 income year, who have an extension of time for filing their 1995-96 income tax returns, and whose returns have not been filed. They may pay the first two instalments of provi- sional tax for the current year on the basis of the 1994-95 residual income tax plus 5%. Previously, taxpayers paying under this option had to pay the 1994-95 residual income plus 10%. If natural persons with taxable income up to $70,000 for the 1995-96 income year voluntarily estimate their provisional tax liability but nevertheless underestimate their liability, no underestimation penalty will be imposed if they paid more than their 1995-96 year’s residual income tax. Inland Revenue has written to provisional taxpayers informing them of the changes in the provisional tax payment rules. Application date The amendments apply to the 1996-97 income year in relation to provisional tax instalments due on or after 7 July 1996. 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 (September 1996) Part 2 - Family Assistance This part deals with the changes to the Family Support and the Guaranteed Minimum Family Income tax credits as well as a new tax credit called the Independent Family Tax Credit. These changes resulted from the Government’s wish to commit a significant proportion of the Budget surplus to boost the income and future prospects of low-middle income families with dependent children. continued on page 6 Introduction A new family assistance measure, the independent family tax credit (IFTC), is introduced to increase the rewards to those low and middle income families who are not reliant on significant state or ACC support. Background The Government introduced the IFTC to encourage families back into the workforce as a means of improv- ing lifetime income and opportunity and to contribute to the extra costs of working, including child care. Key features On 1 July 1996 the IFTC will be set at $7.50 per week per child, with the composite IFTC amount for the 1996-97 income year set at $292.50 a year. On 1 July 1997 the IFTC will be set at $15.00 per week per child, with the composite IFTC for the 1997-98 income year set at $682.50 The IFTC rate for the 1998-99 income year and subse- quent years will be set at $780 per annum per child ($15 per week). The IFTC is not available to families if either spouse receives any of the following forms of income: • an income-tested benefit (for example, domestic purposes benefit, sickness benefit, training benefit, unemployment benefit) • New Zealand Superannuation • veteran’s pension • any basic grant or any independent circumstances grant made under section 193 of the Education Act 1964 or sections 303 of the Education Act 1989, such as an income-tested student allowance (paragraph (g) of the definition of “salary and wages”) • any weekly compensation paid by the Accident Compensation Corporation or its agent, under para- graphs (h) and (I) of the definition of salary or wages in section OB 1, for a period of more than three consecutive months. The three month term applies because a short-term receipt of ACC compensation paid weekly is not considered to be significant state mandated financial support. People who have received weekly compensation for more than three months before 1 July 1996 are not entitled to receive IFTC. If they have received compen- sation for less than three months they may receive IFTC until the date they have received compensation for three consecutive months. A family which receives supplementary income support, such as the accommodation supplement or a special needs grant may still receive IFTC. It is only receipt of the main income-tested social welfare benefits which excludes eligibility. Payments of ACC independence allowance and other cash grants which are not earnings-related compensa- tion do not make a person ineligible for IFTC. A family which suspends an income-tested benefit will not be eligible for IFTC during the period the benefit is suspended. If the family moves off the benefit for a short period and wishes to receive IFTC it should cancel its benefit. Family credit of tax New section KD 2 introduces a new term - the “family credit”. This credit is determined as follows: a + b - c In this formula: a is the amount of the Family Support credit (before abatement) b is the amount of the independent family tax credit (before abatement) c is the amount of the family credit abatement. Independent family tax credit Section KD Income Tax Act 1994 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 (September 1996) income, or, if he or she has a spouse, their combined specified income. Information on implementation So Inland Revenue can verify entitlement to IFTC, at the end of the income year ACC will transfer to Inland Revenue information on people who have received weekly compensation for a continuous period of three months. This transfer of information is an information matching programme and as such will conform to the requirements of the Privacy Act 1993. Tax practitioners who want to calculate the amount of IFTC a client is entitled to will need information on the period that the client has been receiving weekly com- pensation from ACC. Tax practitioners may obtain this information from ACC by completing a form letter which requires the client to authorise the release of the information to the agent. Abatement The abatement which previously applied to Family Support now applies to the family credit of tax (which means that it applies equally to Family Support and IFTC). The abatement amount is calculated and first applied to any Family Support credit, with the remain- der, if any, being applied to the IFTC. This approach ensures that two families on the same income and in identical circumstances, except that one receives the IFTC and the other does not, receive the same amount of Family Support after abatement. The family credit abatement uses the same rates and thresholds that used to apply to Family Support. They are: • 18c in the complete dollar of specified income exceeding $20,000 but not exceeding $27,000 • 30c for every subsequent dollar of specified income. The abatement is based on the recipient’s specified from page 5 Family Support Section KD 2, 2A, 5, 6 Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction Family Support rates have risen by $2.50 per child per week from 1 July 1996, and will rise by a further $2.50 per child per week from 1 July 1997. Background Currently, about 250,000 families receive Family Support. Those who received their entitlement during the year have automatically received their increased Family Support entitlement after 1 July each year. We have contacted recipients by direct mail to tell them of the changes. Those who are eligible for Family Support but do not receive payment during the year will receive their entitlement as an income tax refund once they have filed their tax return. Key features On 1 July 1996 Family Support increased by $2.50 per child per week. The composite rates which will apply for the 1996-97 income year will be: • $2,281.50 for the eldest dependent child • $1,501.50 for each further child under 13 years of age • $1917.50 if the child is 13 years of age or older. On 1 July 1997 Family Support will increase by a further $2.50 per child per week. The composite rates for the 1997-98 income year will be: • $2,411.50 for the eldest dependent child • $1,631.50 for each further child under 13 years of age • $2,047.50 if the child is 13 years of age or older. For the 1998-99 and subsequent income years the annual Family Support entitlement is: • $2,444 for the eldest dependent child • $1,664 each for other dependent children, if they are under the age of 13 • $2,080 for a child of 13 years of age or older. These are not composite rates but represent the on- going Family Support position. The sections which deal with joint custody have been changed to clarify that persons can be dependent children when aged 18 if they are not financially independent and are still attending school or a tertiary educational establishment. The changes to joint custody are, in essence, a simplification of the previous provi- sions. The amounts of Family Support, GMFI and IFTC will be shown separately on the certificate of entitlement issued by the Commissioner. If a family’s income is within the abatement range, the amount of the abatement will first be assigned to the Family Support entitlement, and only when there is no Family Support entitlement left to abate will the IFTC amount begin to be abated. 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 (September 1996) Abated family support for beneficiaries Beneficiaries who currently receive an income-tested benefit may choose to receive either full or zero Family Support from New Zealand Income Support Service (NZISS). In order to treat beneficiaries the same as non-benefici- ary Family Support recipients, beneficiaries will now be able to receive abated Family Support. If NZISS consid- ers that a beneficiary’s income exceeds $20,000 a year, the payment of Family Support will be abated. Until NZISS systems can be amended to pay abated Family Support, beneficiaries whose income exceeds $20,000 will have their Family Support entitlement from NZISS cancelled and asked to apply to Inland Revenue for their Family Support entitlement. Inland Revenue will calculate their abated entitlement and pay it to them. Beneficiaries who receive Family Support from Inland Revenue will have to file an income tax return at the end of the income year. Guaranteed minimum family income Section KD 3 Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction Guaranteed minimum family income (GMFI) will rise from $278 (after tax) a week to $284 a week from 1 July 1996, and to $290 per week from 1 July 1997. Background GMFI tax credit supplements the incomes of low wage working families with dependent children. To qualify, a person must work a required number of hours (20 hours for a sole parent or 30 hours combined for a couple). The credit currently provides a guaranteed after-tax income of $278 per week ($14,456 per annum), with Family Support being paid on top of this tax credit. The level of GMFI is to be increased to pass on the benefit of tax cuts to low wage families. Key features On 1 July 1996 the GMFI rate will be increased to $284 per week. The composite rate for the 1996-97 income year will be $14,690. On 1 July 1997 the GMFI rate will be increased to $290 per week. The composite rates for the 1997-98 income year will be $15,002. For the 1998-99 income year and subsequent income years the GMFI level will be $15,080 a year. Changes to the GMFI formula The GMFI entitlement formula has been simplified by removing the references to Family Support. The definition of net specified income has also been changed. The new formula grosses up the assessable income for the period, but instead of taking away actual tax paid from the grossed up income, the amended formula takes off the tax that would have been paid on the grossed up income. The only rebate which is taken into account in the calculation of the tax that would be payable is the low income rebate. 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 (September 1996) Part 3 - Surcharge and pension changes Introduction The threshold above which the New Zealand Super- annuitant surcharge applies has been increased from $80 per week for a single superannuitant to $90 from 1 July 1996, and $100 from 1 July 1997. For a couple, the threshold has been increased from $120 per week to $135 from 1 July 1996 and to $150 with effect from 1 July 1997. Background The amendments to the New Zealand Superannuitant surcharge give effect to the policy measures announced by the parties to the Accord on Retirement Income Policies on 4 December 1995. The increases in the surcharge exemption on 1 July 1996 and 1 July 1997 are expected to result in about 20,000 fewer superannuitants being liable for the surcharge in 1998-99 than would be liable under the current thresholds. Those who do not have their super- annuation completely abated by the surcharge will benefit from this measure, and there will be reductions in liability for those who continue to be liable. Key features 1 July 1996 From 1 July 1996 the current single person exemption of $80 a week will increase to $90 a week, and the couple exemption will increase from $120 a week to $135 a week. The composite annual exemption for the 1996-97 income year will be $4,550 for a single person ($87.50 per week), and $6,825 for a couple ($131.25 per week). 1 July 1997 From 1 July 1997 the single person exemption will increase by a further $10 to $100 per week, and the couple threshold will increase a further $15 to $150 a week. The composite annual exemption for the 1997-98 income year will be $5,070 for a single person ($97.50 per week) and $7,605 for a couple ($146.25 per week). 1 April 1998 The surcharge exemption for the 1998-99 income year and subsequent years will be $5,200 for a single person ($100 per week) and $7,800 for a couple ($150 per week). Changes to surcharge codes The surcharge codes which apply to source deduction income (other than New Zealand Superannuation) are amended to take into account the increase in the thresholds. New Zealand Superannuitant surcharge (Section JB 3 (1), JB 4 (1), NI 5 Income Tax Act 1994) Qualifying foreign private annuities - income tax and surcharge treatment Sections CG 15, JB 2, JB 3 and OB 1, Income Tax Act 1994 Sections 245R and 245RA, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction New rules relating to the income tax and New Zealand Superannuitant surcharge treatment of foreign-sourced private pensions, and annuities have been introduced into the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 1976. Certain foreign private pensions and annuities derived from an interest in a qualifying foreign private annuity (QFPA) are now excluded from the foreign investment fund (FIF) regime. Instead, they will be subject to tax on a receipts basis, in the same manner as income derived from salary or wages. In addition, only fifty percent of the gross pension or annuity will be subject to sur- charge. Background The amendments follow recommendations made to the Government by the parties to the Accord on Retirement Income Policies (the Accord). 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 (September 1996) Previously, with some limited exceptions, all resident taxpayers who received a foreign pension or annuity had an interest in a FIF. This required disclosure of the interest to Inland Revenue, together with a calculation of the taxpayer’s FIF income attributable to his or her interest in the FIF. The FIF income was also fully subject to surcharge. The Accord parties were concerned that the previous treatment of foreign pensions was not consistent with paragraph 3.2.1 of the Accord. That paragraph states: In regard to New Zealand taxation and the surcharge, a foreign-sourced private pension should have no advantage or disadvantage over a New Zealand-sourced private pension. In addition to the concerns raised by the Accord parties, the Government was concerned that residents who received foreign pensions and annuities were not aware they had an interest in a FIF and were subject to that tax regime. To address these concerns, the Government agreed to introduce amendments to exclude certain foreign- sourced private pensions and annuities from the FIF regime and to make only fifty percent of these pensions subject to surcharge. Not all foreign pensions qualify for this treatment. This is explained further in the appendix to this TIB, which relates to the definition of a QFPA. Key features An interest in a foreign superannuation scheme or life insurance policy that is an interest in a QFPA is ex- cluded from the FIF regime. Pensions and annuities derived from a QFPA will now be subject to income tax on a receipts basis. Only fifty percent of the gross amount of these pensions and annuities will be subject to the surcharge. The amendments apply from the beginning of the FIF regime. Persons who were complying with the FIF regime have until the due date for filing their 1997 return of income to elect to stay with the FIF regime for the income years from the beginning of the FIF regime until the end of their 1995-96 income year. They are also entitled to elect irrevocably to continue to return their pension or annuity under the FIF regime. These features are given effect in the legislation as follows: • A new definition of “qualifying foreign private annuity” (QFPA) is inserted into section OB 1. • Section CG 15 (2) (which exempts certain interests in foreign entities from the FIF regime) is amended to exclude interests in a QFPA from the FIF regime. • The section OB 1 definition of an “Interest in an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme” (ERFSS) is amended to ensure that if an interest meets both the definition of an ERFSS and a QFPA, the QFPA treatment takes precedence. • The definition of “other income” in section JB 3 is amended to exclude one-half of any amount received from a QFPA. • The definition of “net New Zealand Superannuation surcharge” in section JB 2 is amended to include one- half of any amount received from a QFPA. • For surcharge purposes the concessional surcharge treatment is also extended to those interests in foreign entities which meet both of these conditions: – They do not meet the definition of an interest in a FIF because of the exclusions in section CG 15 (2)(d) to (f). – They are received by a person who is in breach of the non-resident contributions test in paragraph (a) of the QFPA definition. Application date The amendments made to sections CG 15 (2) and OB 1 apply retrospectively from the beginning of the FIF regime. This means they apply from the 1992-93 income year for most taxpayers, or from the 1991-92 income year for taxpayers whose corresponding non- standard accounting year ends after 2 July 1992. Because of the retrospective application of the amend- ments to the FIF regime, it was necessary to amend both the 1976 and 1994 Income Tax Acts. The amendments have retrospective application because some people who received a foreign pension or annuity did not realise that the FIF regime applied, and reported their income on a cash-receipts basis. However, people who have complied with the provisions of the FIF regime may elect to continue with that regime. The amendments to the surcharge provisions, namely sections JB 2 (3) and JB 3 (1), apply from the beginning of the 1996-97 income year. A more detailed analysis of these changes is contained in the appendix to this TIB. 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 (September 1996) Introduction The requirements an IR 5 taxpayer must meet to be exempt from filing a tax return have been simplified for the 1995-96 income year. The income threshold for compulsory filing by IR 5 taxpayers other than super- annuitants will be increased from $20,000 to $34,200 for the 1996-97 income year, and to $38,000 for the 1997-98 income year. Taxpayers who are subject to the superannuitant surcharge, Family Support recipients, liable parents and Student Loan borrowers are still required to file tax returns. Background Both the Government and Inland Revenue have a commitment to simplifying the tax system and minimis- ing compliance costs. A key area in the simplification of the tax system is the simplification of tax return filing obligations for individuals, which has two objectives: • to reduce the number of taxpayers required to file tax returns • to simplify tax returns for taxpayers who are still required to file. The amendments described here represent the first step in this process. The Government has issued a discussion paper on the further expansion of non-filing to IR 5 taxpayers whose income is over $38,000, and to IR 5 taxpayers to whom social policy measures such as Family Support and the Student Loan scheme apply. Key features 1995-96 income year A new section 33A has been inserted into the Tax Administration Act with effect from the 1995-96 income year. The section sets out the criteria a natural person must meet to be exempted from the requirement to file a tax return. This provision is effectively the old pay- period taxpayer definition clarified, with a number of minor simplifications. The pay-period taxpayer definition has been repealed. New non-filing rules The new section 33A(1) provides the rules that taxpayers must meet to be exempted from the requirement to file a tax return. The main requirements are that a person must derive income from these sources only: • employment from which tax deductions were liable to be made in accordance with the PAYE rules • interest or dividends from which resident withholding tax was liable to be deducted in accordance with the PAYE rules. Further, the person’s total income must not exceed whichever of the following applies: • $9,500 (regardless of the source of the income) • $20,000 (if all the income was from employment) • $20,000 (if there was not more than $1,500 of interest included in the income). Further, the person will have to file a return if he or she meets any of these conditions: • derives income as a shearer or as a shearing shed hand • is an absentee • has a family certificate of entitlement or a spouse who has a family certificate of entitlement • is liable to pay Child Support • has a Student Loan balance with Inland Revenue • is a superannuitant with more than $3,120 of other income. The other income of a superannuitant is defined as income from: • employment (other than NZ superannuation) • interest and dividends • 50% of any pension from a superannuation fund and 50% of any annuity which section CB 9 (f) applies (annuities paid under a life insurance policy entered in to or offered in New Zealand by a life insurer, or offered or entered into outside New Zealand by a life insurer that is resident in New Zealand). Previously the pay-period taxpayer definition required that a tax deduction be made in respect of all income from employment in accordance with the PAYE rules. In effect, this provision placed an obligation on the employee to ensure that the employer was correctly deducting PAYE. The new provision simply requires that employment income be liable to deduction in accordance with the PAYE rules. A similar amendment has been made in relation to interest. The new section provides for two situations in which a person must file a return. • A tax return must be filed if a person or the spouse of that person receives abated Family Support from NZISS. This provision is required because the joint impact of the changes in the benefit abatement rules and the increase in this maximum income threshold above which a tax return must be filed means that it is possible for a beneficiary to earn over $20,000 income and thus be entitled only to abated Family Support. Without a tax return from this beneficiary it would be Part 4 - IR 5 non-filing requirements simplified Section IC, OB 1, OB 4 Income Tax Act 1994 Section 22(3), 33, 33A, 41 Tax Administration Act 1994 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 (September 1996) Part 5 - Minor correction to rebate abatement calculation Section KB 3 Income Tax Act 1994 A minor amendment confirms that if the calculation of a rebate results in a negative amount, the rebate amount will be treated as zero and not a negative number for the purposes of determining that rebate. This corrects a minor drafting error which meant that it was technically possible for a taxpayer’s abatement to exceed the amount of rebate for which he or she qualified. This amendment applies from 1 July 1996. impossible to ensure that a family receives its correct Family Support entitlement. • Taxpayers who have received a special tax code must file a tax return. While this has been the Commission- er’s policy, the previous legislation allowed the Commissioner to request a return from taxpayers with special tax codes only if he was satisfied that the tax code was invalid when applied in determining a tax deduction. Consequential amendments References to the term “pay-period taxpayer” have been removed and, where necessary, references to the new section 33A have been inserted. The amendments apply from 1 April 1995. 1996-97 income year For the 1996-97 income year the non-filing income threshold is raised from $20,000 to $34,200, which is the boundary between the bottom and top statutory marginal tax rates for that year. The distinction between income from interest and dividends and income from employment is also removed. This non-filing income threshold applying to super- annuitants is increased from $3,120 to $3,412.50 for the 1996-97 income year. The increased threshold repre- sents the minimum possible surcharge exemption applying to a married superannuitant for that year, ensuring that those with a potential NZ Superannuitant surcharge liability are required to file. 1997-98 income year The non-filing income threshold for the 1997-98 and subsequent income years is further increased to $38,000. Again, the extra non-filing income threshold applying to superannuitants is increased from $3,412.50 to $3,802.50. 1998-99 income year For the 1998-99 income year the non-filing income threshold applying to superannuitants’ other income increases to $3,900. This final increase is required as the surcharge threshold applying in the 1997-98 income year was a composite threshold, so the extra filing threshold was effectively a composite rate as well. 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 (September 1996) Introduction The amendment prevents the continued payment of Family Support and guaranteed minimum family income for children for whom orphan’s benefit or unsupported child’s benefit is being paid. It corrects an unintended legislative change that allowed Family Support to be paid for children for whom orphan’s benefit or unsupported child’s benefit is also being paid, which has resulted in double state funding of some families. Background Legislation pertaining to the entitlement and payment of Family Support and guaranteed minimum family income (GMFI) is contained in Part KD of the Income Tax Act 1994 and Part XIA of the Income Tax Act 1976. Changes to the Family Support legislation in 1991, when family benefit was abolished, inadvertently allowed Family Support and GMFI to be paid for a child for whom orphan’s benefit or unsupported child’s benefit is paid. Before the abolition of family benefit, Family Support and GMFI were payable only for a child for whom family benefit was payable. Because family benefit was not payable for a child for whom orphan’s benefit or unsupported child’s benefit was being paid, Family Support and GMFI were not payable for such a child. Key features The amendment prevents principal caregivers claiming Family Support and GMFI for children for whom orphan’s benefit or unsupported child’s benefit is being paid. This is achieved by excluding such children from the definition of “dependent child” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and section 374A of the Income Tax Act 1976. Because Family Support and GMFI are payable only for a “dependent child”, they will not be payable for these children. Application date The amendment generally applies from the income year beginning 1 April 1991 to prevent principal caregivers who have not already received Family Support for such children from doing so. The exceptions to the general application date are as follows. • Principal caregivers who, before the date of introduc- tion of the bill (12 December 1995), had applied for an income-tested benefit and Family Support for the 1995-96 income year to NZISS for a child for whom orphan’s benefit or unsupported child’s benefit is being paid were entitled to family support until 31 March 1996. • Principal caregivers who have a current year certificate of entitlement for Family Support and GMFI in respect of a child for whom orphan’s benefit or unsupported child’s benefit is being paid were entitled to Family Support until 31 March 1996 if that certificate was held or applied for before the date of introduction of the bill. Family Support received for such children after 31 March 1996 will therefore need to be repaid. Principal caregivers who have claimed Family Support and GMFI in the 1994-95 income year before 12 Decem- ber 1995 as part of the Family Support end-of-year square-up for a child for whom orphan’s benefit or unsupported child’s benefit is being paid, may also claim Family Support and GMFI for that child as part of the 1995-96 income tax returns and Family Support statement.

The Tax Reduction and Social Policy Bill was enacted on 10 May 1996. It was split into the following Acts: • Income Tax Act 1994 Amendment Act 1996 • Income Tax Act 1976 Amendment Act 1996 • Tax Administration Amendment Act 1996 • Social Security Amendment Act • Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1996. This TIB deals only with the tax changes which have occurred; it does not cover the changes to the Social Welfare legislation. The Finance Bill (No.6) was enacted on 1 July 1996. The bill became the Income Tax Act 1994 Amendment Act (No.2) and the Income Tax Act 1976 Amendment Act (No.2) This TIB is broken down into six parts and an appendix. The first five parts deal with the changes which have resulted from the Tax Reduction and Social Policy Bill. The sixth part deals with the changes resulting from the Finance Bill (No.6). The appendix provides an in-depth analysis of the amendments to the tax treatment of foreign-sourced private pensions.

These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding pubic ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. How- ever, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. GST - Supplies of dwellings and other real property Summary This item deals with the apportionment of consideration between, and the valuation of, supplies of dwellings and other real property for GST purposes. Sections 5(15) to 5(19) essentially reverse the decision in Coveney v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,193 (see page 32, TIB Volume Seven, No.9 - February 1996). If a supply includes a dwelling, section 5(15) deems the supply of the dwelling to be a separate supply from the supply of any other real property included in the supply. A dwelling includes that area surrounding the dwelling that is necessary for its enjoyment. Any apportionment of the consideration for the supply of a dwelling and other real property must reflect the true respective values of the dwelling and the surrounding land. The onus of proof that an apportionment is correct is on the person seeking to rely on the apportionment. To satisfy this onus it may be necessary to support the apportionment with a valuation. In cases of doubt and/or involving significant amounts of consideration, Inland Revenue may require a valuation from a regis- tered valuer. When the supplier and recipient are both GST regis- tered, the same apportionment, as set out in the tax invoice, will apply to both parties. Ideally, this should be negotiated between the parties and agreed at the time of supply. For GST registered purchasers, the same dwelling valuation applies for GST and stamp duty purposes. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, unless otherwise indicated. Background Sections 5(15) to 5(19) were inserted into the Act by the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1995, and essentially apply to all supplies made on or after 11 August 1995. Those provisions reverse the decision in Coveney v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,193 and ex- pressly provide that if a dwelling forms part of a wider supply, the supply of the dwelling is a separate supply. This position is consistent with the Commissioner’s policy before the Coveney decision: see page 2 of TIB Volume Three, No. 5 (March 1992). For GST purposes the supply of the dwelling and the other real property must be separately valued. Certain issues have arisen as to when and how dwellings are valued. In particular, instances have arisen when suppliers and recipients have adopted different valuations. There have also been cases when purchasers of dwellings have used different valuations for GST and stamp duty purposes. Legislation Section 8(1) imposes GST on the supply (other than an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person. Section 2 defines “dwelling” as: any building, premises, structure, or other place, or any part thereof, used predominantly as a place of residence or abode of any individual, together with any appurtenances belonging thereto and enjoyed with it; but does not include a commercial dwelling: Section 5 defines the meaning of “supply”. Section 5(15) states: Where a dwelling is included in a supply, the supply of that dwelling is deemed to be a separate supply from the supply of any other real property included in the supply. Section 5(16) deals with the situation when a registered person has claimed an input tax deduction for a dwell- ing (before the introduction of the amending legisla- tion), and then supplies that dwelling or any part of that dwelling. It states: Where a registered person has claimed a deduction in accordance with section 20(3) of this Act in respect of the supply of a dwelling, any subsequent supply by the registered person of - (a)The dwelling; or (b)Any land or other part of the dwelling that has ceased or will by reason of the supply cease to be appurtenant to or enjoyed with the dwelling, - will, for the avoidance of doubt but subject to subsections (17), (18), and 19(b) of this section, be deemed to be a taxable supply. Section 5(16) does not apply when before the supply of the dwelling the registered person has taken either of these actions: continued on page 2 •made a one-off adjustment under section 21(1) (and no further one-off adjustment under section 21(5)): section 5(17) •elected to treat the dwelling as being supplied by the registered person before 1 August 1996: section 5(19). Under section 5(18), if a registered person has claimed an input tax deduction for only a proportion of a dwelling, then any subsequent supply of the dwelling is only a taxable supply to the extent that the proportion claimed bears to the whole dwelling. Section 20(3) permits the deduction of input tax from output tax. Section 2(1) defines “input tax” as: “Input tax”, in relation to a registered person, means- (a)Tax charged under section 8(1) of this Act on the supply of goods and services made to that person:... (c)Any amount equal to the tax fraction (being the tax fraction applicable at the time of supply within the meaning of section 9 or any other provision of this Act) of the consideration in money for the supply, being a supply by way of sale that is not a taxable supply, to a registered person of any secondhand goods situated in New Zea- land,... - being in any case goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: Provided that where, in relation to any supply to which paragraph (c) of this definition applies, the supplier and recipient are associated persons, or the supply is not the only matter to which the consideration relates, the consideration in money for that supply shall, for the purposes of this definition, be deemed to be the lesser of the purchase price or the open market value of that supply: Under section 10(18), if a taxable supply is not the only matter to which a consideration relates, the supply is deemed to be for such part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it. Section 24(3) sets out the particulars to include within a tax invoice. Section 24(3)(g) requires that a tax invoice includes either: •the total amount of the tax charged, the consideration, excluding tax, and the consideration, inclusive of tax for the supply; or •when the amount of tax charged is the tax fraction of the consideration, the consideration for the supply and a statement that it includes a charge in respect of the tax. Application Section 5(15) deems the supply of a dwelling forming part of a wider supply to be a separate supply. For example, the supply of farm land that includes a farmhouse, and the supply of a commercial office building with a penthouse apartment. If a dwelling is supplied along with other real property it is necessary to identify the physical area of the dwelling, and the consideration that relates to the dwelling, and the area and consideration that relates to the other real property. Definition of “dwelling” The definition of dwelling, and in particular what is meant by the words “together with any appurtenances belonging thereto and enjoyed with it” has been consid- ered by the courts. In Norfolk Apartments Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,212 the Court of Appeal held that common areas and facilities offered within a retirement village complex were appurtenances to the individual dwellings within the complex. The whole of the land surrounding the apartments was laid out in driveway, paths, gardens and landscaped grounds for the use and enjoyment of residents. All of the land was integral to and within the curtilage of the building. In the course of its judgment the Court considered authorities on the meaning of “appurtenances” for single, domestic dwellings: Trim v Sturminster Urban District Council \[1938\] 2 All ER 168, and Methuen-Campbell v Walters \[1979\] 1 All ER 606. The Trim case considered the word “appurtenances” in a statutory definition of “house”. It held that it has its natural meaning and could not extend to cover land outside the curtilage of the house. Farm land adjacent to the house was not an appurtenance. In Methuen-Campbell the issue was whether a paddock adjoining the garden of a dwelling-house was an appurtenance to the house. A fence separated the paddock from the garden, although access had once been available through a now boarded-up gate in the fence. The defendant argued that an appurtenance included anything used and occupied with or for the benefit of the principal land. Reviewing the development of the law in this area, the Court in Methuen-Campbell concluded that “appurte- nances” equates to the curtilage of a house. The Oxford English Dictionary defines “curtilage” as “a small court, yard, or piece of ground attached to a dwellinghouse and forming one enclosure with it”. What is within the curtilage is essentially a question of fact in each case. The paddock did not form part of the curtilage, being well apart from the house and physically separated from the garden. The paddock did not form an integral whole with the dwelling. Case M64 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,363 also considered the definition of “dwelling”. Bathgate DJ stated (at page 2,368) that the definition: ... would normally apply only to the land upon which the dwelling stood, and that, perhaps, immediately adjacent thereto, including, depending on the circumstances, land for access to and from the dwelling. It would not under the definition of “dwelling”, in the Act, include necessarily the whole of the allotment on which the dwelling was erected. As a rule appurtenances apply more to rights affecting the land, such as easements, rather than land itself. An appurtenance is something that belongs to another, an accessory to a principal. Normally with regard to a house, the word “appurtenance” will pass with the house, the rights, privileges and accessories thereto, such as gardens and orchards close by and used by the houseowner, but not the land - Trim v Sturminster Rural District Council (supra). from page 1 Determining what part of a wider supply is the supply of a dwelling will involve an examination of the facts of the case to ascertain what is the curtilage, i.e., the physical area belonging to and enjoyed with the place of residence. Output tax on supplies of dwellings and other real property Section 5(15) deems that if a dwelling forms part of a wider supply, the supply of the dwelling is a separate supply. This means that the applicability of GST to the supply of the dwelling is considered separately from the other supply. Generally, GST will not be chargeable on the supply of the dwelling because it will not be sup- plied in the course or furtherance of the supplier’s taxable activity. It will generally be the supply of a private or exempt asset. The exceptions are: •The dwelling is supplied in the course or furtherance of the supplier’s taxable activity, e.g. a builder or property developer: •An input tax deduction has been claimed for all or a part of the dwelling (and sections 5(17) to 5(19) do not apply): section 5(16). If a dwelling is a supply of a private or exempt asset, no GST will be payable on the part of the total considera- tion that relates to the dwelling. When the other real property is supplied in the course or furtherance of the supplier’s taxable activity, GST will be payable on that supply. In such a case, section 24(3)(g) requires the tax invoice relating to the supply of the other real property to state the consideration for that supply. As a consequence, the supplier needs to determine what part of the total consideration is for the dwelling and what part is for the other real property. Ideally, this should be negotiated between the parties and agreed at the time of supply. When a sale and purchase agreement does not apportion the consideration for the supply of a dwelling and other real property, the tax invoice issued by the supplier will determine the amount of GST payable on the supply of the other property. Under section 10(18) that considera- tion must be that part of the total consideration that is properly attributable to it. The onus of proof that the apportionment is correct is on the person seeking to rely on the apportionment. The GST supplier may need to support the apportionment with a valuation. As dis- cussed below, in cases of doubt and/or involving significant consideration, Inland Revenue may require a valuation from a registered valuer. Input tax on supplies of dwellings and other real property A GST registered purchaser of a dwelling and other real property may wish to claim an input tax deduction for the consideration paid. Input tax deductions are only available for supplies of goods or services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies - “the principal purpose test”. By virtue of section 5(15), this test applies separately to the supply of the dwelling and the supply of other real property. Generally, a dwelling will not be acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: it will be a private or exempt asset. For example, the purchase of a farm that includes a farmhouse. When the other real property satisfies the principal purpose test, an input tax deduction is only available for the consideration paid for that property. If the supplier is GST registered, the tax invoice will indicate the amount of GST that is claimable in relation to the supply of the other real property (section 20(2)(a)). This is an important point for GST registered purchasers and their advisers. The amount of input tax that may be claimed by a GST registered purchaser is limited to the amount of GST shown on the tax invoice as having been paid for the other real property. Accord- ingly, as noted above, ideally the apportionment of the total consideration should be negotiated between the parties and agreed at the time of supply to circumvent later disputes over what part of the consideration is properly attributable to the other real property. If a purchaser acquires, by way of sale, a dwelling and other real property from a non-registered vendor, or from a GST registered vendor who is not supplying the property in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, no GST will be payable on the supplies. However, by virtue of paragraph (c) of the definition of “input tax” in section 2, the purchaser may claim an input tax deduction if real property is acquired by way of sale for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Again, the principal purpose test applies separately to the supply of the dwelling and the supply of the other real property. In such cases, the proviso to the definition of “input tax” deems the consideration for the supply of the other real property to be the lesser of the purchase price or the open market value of that supply. (This is because the supply of the other real property is not the only matter to which the consideration relates.) If the sale and purchase agreement apportions the total consideration between the dwelling and the other real property, the consideration for the other real property is the lesser of the apportioned amount and its open market value. If the sale and purchase agreement does not apportion the total consideration, the consideration for the other real property is equal to its open market value. As noted, the onus of proof that an apportionment is correct is on the person seeking to rely on the apportion- ment. A GST registered purchaser may need to support the apportionment with a valuation. As discussed below, in cases of doubt and/or involving significant considera- tion, Inland Revenue may require a valuation from a registered valuer. When the purchaser intends to use a part of the curtilage for the making of taxable supplies, or part of the other real property for the dwelling, on-going periodic section 21 adjustments will apply to that part. continued on page 4 Stamp duty The Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 (“SCD Act”) imposes conveyance duty on instruments of conveyance for certain transfers of real property. Conveyance duty is borne by the purchaser. Under section 24(1) of that Act, a transfer of a dwellinghouse is exempt from convey- ance duty. The section 24(3) definition of “dwelling- house” is defined in very similar terms to the GST definition of “dwelling”, being: a building, or part of a building, that is a house, flat, townhouse, home unit, or similar dwelling erected primarily and principally as a residence, and includes any land, im- provements, or appurtenances belonging to the dwellinghouse or usually enjoyed with it. Section 24(2) of the SCD Act provides that if conveyed property consists partly of a dwellinghouse and partly of other property: such proportion of the value of the property conveyed as the Commissioner determines is not attributable to the purposes of occupation as a dwellinghouse shall be subject to convey- ance duty as if the instrument of conveyance related to that proportion of the property only. The same area is “appurtenant” to a dwelling for GST and stamp duty purposes. The definitions of “dwelling” (in the SCD Act) and “dwellinghouse” (in the GST Act) do not differ in any material way. The definition of “dwellinghouse” expressly includes “land”, “improve- ments”, and “appurtenances”. However, these features are only included to the extent that they belong and are usually enjoyed with the dwellinghouse. The definition of “dwelling” includes all appurtenances that belong to the dwelling and are enjoyed with it. As seen, the courts have interpreted “appurtenances” to include land and improvements as well as rights affecting land. Therefore, for both stamp duty and GST purposes the relevant area will be the curtilage, i.e. the physical area belonging to and enjoyed with the place of residence. Accordingly, purchasers who acquire dwellings and other real property should adopt the same valuation of the dwelling for both purposes. Section 24(2) also provides an exemption from convey- ance duty for conveyances of residential property up to 4,500 square metres. This exemption does not apply to conveyances of residential property with other property. In the case of conveyances of residential property with other property, purchasers cannot adopt a curtilage of 4,500 square metres as a matter of right. The exemption for conveyances of residential property with other property applies to the actual curtilage. The same curtilage area applies for both stamp duty and GST purposes. Under section 24(2) of the SCD Act, stamp duty is payable on the proportion of the value of the property conveyed that the Commissioner determines is not attributable to the purposes of occupation as a dwellinghouse. Method of valuation If a dwelling is supplied with other real property, a valuation may be necessary when: •A GST registered supplier and recipient cannot agree on the value of the dwelling and the other real property: •A GST registered supplier needs to issue a tax invoice and the sale and purchase agreement does not appor- tion the consideration: •A GST registered recipient wishes to claim an input tax deduction for the other real property under paragraph (c) of the definition of “input tax”. In some cases a valuation may also be necessary for the calculation of on-going periodic section 21 adjustments. As noted, the onus of proof that a particular apportion- ment and the method adopted to reach that apportion- ment are correct, is on the party seeking to rely on the apportionment. The method of valuation depends on the circumstances of the case. The method adopted should reflect the true value of the property. Different circum- stances may require different methods. For example, the item on page 2 of TIB Volume Two, No. 8 (April 1991) acknowledges that an area apportionment may not always be appropriate. In some cases it may be more appropriate to value residential land on farm properties by comparison with sales of residential properties in nearby rural townships. Ideally, the valuation should be made by a registered valuer. In cases of doubt and/or significant considera- tion, Inland Revenue may insist on a valuation by a registered valuer. If registered persons are in doubt as to whether they need to obtain a valuation from a regis- tered valuer, they should contact their local Inland Revenue office. Any valuation relied upon needs to identify the method of valuation and reasons for adopting that method. Example A GST registered farmer negotiates to sell a 225 hectare farm that includes two farmhouses. The farmer and his family occupy the main farmhouse. A fenced garden area of 4,000 square metres surrounds the farmhouse. There is an adjacent paddock of 5,000 square metres, known as the “home paddock” that includes a chicken coop, the vegetable garden and various small sheds. Farm employees and their families occupy the second farmhouse from time to time. It is fenced on two sides, has a hedge on one side and a stream running along the fourth side. The area within these boundaries measures 4,750 square metres. The area includes a garage, a few trees and a washing line. There is no garden. Section 5(15) applies to the supply of the farm property. It deems each supply of a dwelling to be separate from the supply of the balance of the farm land. from page 3 The farmer has not claimed an input tax deduction in accordance with section 20(3) in the case of either farmhouse. Neither supply of a farmhouse is a taxable supply. The main farmhouse is a private asset, being principally used for private accommo- dation. The second farmhouse is an exempt asset, being either let or licensed to farm employees (section 14(c)(i) and (ii)) or occupied under a service occupancy agreement by farm employees (section 14(c)(iii)). Accordingly, only the supply of the farm land is subject to GST. The physical area of the dwelling in each case is: •Main farmhouse - 4,000 square metres. The home paddock is not part of the curtilage of the farm- house. Although enjoyed in part with the farm- house (vegetable garden and chicken coop), it is predominantly an area relating to the farm. The area is physically divided off from the farmhouse. It is reasonable to treat the fenced area immedi- ately surrounding the farmhouse as its curtilage. •Second farmhouse - 4,750 square metres. Al- though fairly large, it is reasonable to treat this area as appurtenant and enjoyed with the farm- house. This area is physically divided off from the surrounding farm land by both artificial and natural features. Anticipating selling the property, the farmer has recently had the farm independently valued by a registered valuer. The valuation (exclusive of GST) shows: Farm (land and farm improvements)$700,000 Dwellings$150,000 Total value$850,000 The farmer negotiates to sell the farm for $875,000 plus GST, to a GST registered purchaser who is acquiring the farm to carry on a taxable activity of farming. The sale is not a sale of a going concern. In finalising the terms of the sale and purchase agreement, the parties agree that the purchase price shall be apportioned between the farm as to $725,000 and the dwellings as to $150,000. (The purchaser is prepared to accept this price and the apportionment, having received his own valuation.) The sale and purchase agreement includes the following details: Consideration$875,000 GST ($725,000 x 12.5%)$ 90,625 Total purchase price (including GST)$965,625 Apportionment of consideration: Farm$725,000 Dwellings$150,000 The farmer issues a tax invoice to the purchaser for the taxable supply of the farm. In accordance with section 24(3)(g) the tax invoice shows: The total amount of the tax charged$ 90,625 The consideration, excluding tax$725,000 The consideration for the supply, including GST$815,625 The purchaser is entitled to claim an input tax deduction of $90,625. The purchaser must pay conveyance duty on the value of the property not attributable to the purposes of occupation as a dwellinghouse. Accordingly, conveyance duty is payable on $815,625 (the GST inclusive value). Long service leave - when expenditure on account is incurred Summary This item states the Commissioner’s new policy on when an employer “incurs” expenditure on account of long service leave. Under the new policy, the Commis- sioner accepts that an employer incurs expenditure for long service leave in the income year that an employee becomes unconditionally entitled to payment for the leave. Note that section EF 1 will apply to expenditure on account of long service leave which is incurred in income years starting from 1 April 1990. The effect of this provision is that expenditure on account of long service leave is deductible in the year that it is incurred, but that deduction must be added back to the employer’s assessable income until the income year that the long service leave payments are made to the employee. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Background Public Information Bulletin 111 (May 1981) set out the Commissioner’s previous policy on when an employer incurred expenditure on account of long service leave. Under the previous policy, an employer incurred such expenditure and could claim a deduction for that expenditure only when the employee took the leave, died, or had his or her service terminated. The Commis- sioner’s policy as stated in PIB 111 no longer applies. The Commissioner’s policy in PIB 111 has been amended following the Commissioner’s decision not to appeal the High Court decision of Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited (Life Branch) v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,341 (“CML”). In CML the Court consid- ered the issue of when a liability for long service leave was incurred by an employer under the previous life insurance regime, and held that the expenditure was incurred by CML when an employee became uncondi- tionally entitled to payment for the leave. The High continued on page 6 Court’s approach in CML was confirmed in another High Court decision, King Country Electric Power Board v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,122. Legislation Cross-reference table Income TaxIncome TaxIncome Tax Act 1994 1 Act 1994 2 Act 1976 BD 2BB 7104 EF 1EF 1104A OB 2 (2)OB 2 (2)6(2) Tax AdministrationIncome Tax Act 1976 Act 1994 37(5)17(6) 126(2)30(2) 1.as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 2.prior to amendment by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 Section BB 7 is the general deductibility section which allows an employer to deduct any expenditure incurred in gaining or producing assessable income or in carry- ing on a business for the purposes of gaining or produc- ing assessable income. The timing of such deductions was modified in certain situations by the insertion of section EF 1 with effect from the income year starting on 1 April 1990. The effect of section EF 1 is that employers have to include the “unexpired portion” of monetary remuneration (such as expenditure on account of long service leave) in their assessable income. The “unexpired portion” of expendi- ture on account of long service leave is expenditure incurred for long service leave which has not been paid to the entitled employee in the income year or further specified period. Section EF 1 (6) deems monetary remuneration (such as expenditure on account of long service leave) to be paid in an income year in either of the following situations: •For payments made to employees (other than share- holder-employees to whom section OB 2 (2) applies), if the money is actually paid to the employee in that income year, or if the money is paid to the employee within 63 days after the end of that income year. •For payments made to shareholder-employees to whom section OB 2 (2) applies (close company shareholder-employees), if the money is actually paid to the shareholder-employee in that income year or, if the company has obtained an extension of time for filing its income tax return under section 37(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, if the money is paid to the shareholder-employee no later than 31 March of the year succeeding the relevant income year. This time extension for filing tax returns gives a period of 6 to 18 months to claim a deduction for such expendi- ture, depending on the company’s balance date. How the legislation applies Expenditure on account of long service leave is incurred by an employer in the income year that an employee becomes unconditionally entitled to payment for such leave, even if payment for the long service leave is not actually made until some time later. An employee becomes unconditionally entitled to payment for long service leave when the employee has the right to demand payment. The fact that an employee may lose the right to long service leave if his or her employment is terminated for misconduct etc., does not operate to defer the time when the expenditure is incurred by an employer. No deductions allowable while long service leave is accruing Expenditure accrued by an employer on account of employees who are in the process of qualifying for long service leave is not incurred by or deductible to the employer in the year it accrues, because an employee has no right to demand payment of the long service leave at that stage. An employee only has the right to demand payment when he or she has satisfied the conditions of employment under which a right to long service leave arises. Post-1990 expenditure in respect of long service leave The practical effect of section EF 1 is that, while an employer may have incurred expenditure on account of long service leave, a deduction for such expenditure is delayed until such time as payments for the long service leave are paid to the entitled employee. Section EF 1 applies to expenditure incurred from the income year commencing 1 April 1990. Applying the change in policy on “incurred” The Commissioner’s new policy on when expenditure on account of accrued long service leave is “incurred” is applicable to all current claims and objections to assessments. Taxpayers may also apply to the Commis- sioner under section 126(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for a late objection to be considered. Examples Example 1 Employee A’s employment contract with Company Y states that she is entitled to 10 days’ long service leave after 15 years’ employment with Company Y. On 15 February 1987, Employee A celebrated 15 years’ employment with Company Y, and became entitled to take long service leave. She had the right to demand immediate payment at that time. However, because of work commitments she decided to take her long service leave in June later that year. from page 5 Company Y incurred, and was entitled to deduct, the leave expenditure on 15 February 1987, even though it was not required to make payment on account of the long service leave until June later that year. Section EF 1 did not apply to this ex- penditure because it was incurred before 1 April 1990. Example 2 Employee B’s employment contract with Company Y states that he is entitled to 5 days’ long service leave after 5 years’ employment with Company Y. Employee B started employment with Company Y on 14 March 1995. On 14 March 1996 he has had one year’s service with Company Y. Company Y is not entitled as at 14 March 1996 to make a proportionate deduction for expenditure on account of Employee B’s accruing leave. This is because Employee B is in the process of qualifying as a long service employee and does not have any present right to demand payment. Company Y must wait until Employee B has satisfied the conditions of employment under which a right to long service leave arises (i.e. the condition that he has been employed with Company Y for 5 years). Example 3 Employee C’s employment contract with Company Y states that he is entitled to 10 days’ long service leave after 10 years’ employment with Company Y. On 28 February 1996, Employee C celebrated 10 years’ employment with Company Y, and became entitled to take long service leave. He has the right to demand immediate payment. However, because of sporting commitments he decided to take his long service leave in July of that year. Company Y has a 31 March balance date. Although Company Y has incurred the long service leave expenditure on 28 February 1996, the deduction for the long service leave must be added back to Company Y’s assessable income for the 1996 income year because the payment for long service leave does not occur in the 1996 income year or within 63 days of the end of that income year (i.e. within 63 days after 31 March 1996). Company Y can deduct the long service leave expenditure in the 1997 income year because it makes the payment for long service leave to the employee in that income year.

NZ Guardian Trust Company Ltd’s NZGT30 Fund Product ruling - BR Prd 96/25 Note: Product ruling BR Prd 96/25 applies from 30 September 1996 to the end of the 1996-97 income year. BR Prd 96/28 is identical to BR Prd 96/25, except that it incorporates section reference changes brought about by the passing of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 and applies from the beginning of the 1997-98 income year to 31 March 2001. This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BB 9, CF 2 (3), CF 2 (3A) and LE, CF 3 (1)(b), GB 1 (3), and HH 3 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment of the NZGT30 Fund (“the Fund”), pursu- ant to the Deed of Trust dated 5 September 1996, to act as a specialist investment fund to hold a portfolio of shares and other securities that match the composition and weighting of the NZSE 30 Capital Share Price Index (“Index”). The trustee and manager of the Fund is The New Zealand Guardian Trust Com- pany Limited. It is registered as a trustee company under the Trustee Companies Act 1967. The Fund is established under the Trustee Companies Act 1967 and meets the definition of “group investment fund” contained in section OB 1. The beneficial interest in the Fund is divided into units. Each unit confers an equal interest in the Fund, but does not confer any interest in any particular invest- ment of the Fund. Income derived by the Fund comprises of dividends, interest on convertible notes, gains on futures contracts and interest on deposited funds. This income is distributed to investors holding units in the Fund as at the income distribution date, which is semi-annually. Each investor subscribes for the issue of units in the Fund. The issue price is determined by dividing the total market value of the net assets of the Fund by the number of units issued in the Fund (“current unit value”). It is possible for investors to transfer similar securities to the Fund in lieu of a cash payment. The majority of the investors in the Fund are from “designated sources” as defined in section HE 2 (3) ( “category A units”). However, some units may be acquired with funds from “designated sources” as defined in section HE 2 (3) (“category B units”). These category B units are subject to the same rules regard- ing income distribution and redemption of units as apply to category A unit holders. Investors are able to redeem their units at any valuation time (weekly) by giving notice to the fund manager. Their units are redeemed in cash at a price equal to the current unit value. It is possible for the fund manager, in the ordinary course of the fund manager’s activities, to purchase the units from the unit holders as an alternative to re- demption. The purchase price of the units paid by the fund manager is determined accord- ing to the current unit value. Other facts of the Arrangement and relevant information are as set out in the prospectus of the Fund dated 30 September 1996. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the assumptions that: •The Fund will be a “qualifying trust” as defined in section OB 1; and •All cancellation of units by the Fund will be in whole but not in part; and •None of the units will be a “non-participating redeemable share” as defined in section CF 3 (14); and •Any relevant cancellation will not be, or form part of, a “pro rata cancellation” as defined in section CF 3 (14); and •The Fund will be an “unlisted trust” as defined in section CF 3 (14); and •The units will be issued on such terms that their redemption is subject to section CF 3 (1)(b)(iv)(B); and •No election will be made by the Fund to treat the category A units issued as shares of a separate class; and •Any relevant cancellation will not be an “on-market acquisition”; and •At the date of redemption there is no arrangement for the units redeemed to be replaced by the subsequent issue of new units where the arrangement is intended to effect a substitution for the payment of dividends; and •Any cancellation of units will only be effected in order to allow unit holders to exit the Fund; and •The unit holders will not in anyway retain any interest in the units which are sold to the fund manager. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •In the case of a payment or transaction with an investor in the Fund that is a dividend under section CF 2 (3), section CF 2 (3A) will treat the Fund as if it were a company for the purposes of section LE; and •The entire amount paid to category A unit holders on the redemption of their units will be excluded from the definition of dividend by section CF 3 (1)(b) to the extent it does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share can- celled; and continued on page 14 •In respect of category B income distributed to category B unit holders semi- annually, this will be treated as “beneficiary income” for tax purposes and subject to section HH 3; and •Any gain on the redemption of category B units by a category B unit holder will not be assessable for income tax to the extent that it does not include beneficiary income, under section HH 3 (5). The accrued income component representing beneficiary income on distribution will be taxable to the category B unit holder; and •In the absence of other factors relating to the circumstances of any particular category A unit holder, any gain on the sale of the category A units to the fund manager will not of itself give rise to the application of section GB 1 (3) and section BB 9; and •In the absence of other factors relating to the circumstances of any particular category B unit holder, any gain on the sale of the category B units to the fund manager will not of itself give rise to the application of section BB 9. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 30 September 1996 to the end of the 1996/97 income year. This Ruling is signed by me on the 30th day of September 1996.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Binding ruling BR Prd 96/9 withdrawn Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Lump sum tenancy inducement payments - assessability Case:High Court CP 1287/95, CP 1288/95 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 65 (2)(a) and (l). Keywords:Inducement payments, assessability Summary:The High Court found that lump sum payments made to induce potential ten- ants to sign lease agreements were assessable income, as the objectors’ ordinary business operations did not include the acquisition or disposition of leases. Facts:The objectors were partners in a partnership which leased a number of premises in various locations. In one of the locations, the leases were due to expire. Over a period of ten months the objectors negotiated to enter a lease for new premises. As well as the Agreement to Lease, a Collateral Deed was signed which pro- vided for a number of inducements to the objectors as tenants. These included a rental subsidy, hard and soft fit out and a lump sum payment. There was no restriction on the use of the lump sum payment. Decision:It was found, as a matter of fact, that the partnership’s ordinary business opera- tions did not include the acquisition or disposition of leases. The lump sum payment was found to essentially be a form of rent subsidy and as such it was assessable as income in the year of its receipt. Letter of credit - time of payment for GST taxable supply Case:TRA No 95/013 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - section 20 (3)(b)(i) Keywords:Payment Summary:The TRA found that an irrevocable letter of credit redeemable at some time in the future was just as valid a means of payment as if the objector had handed over cash. The giving of the letter of credit by the objector to the ANZ Bank was a payment for the purposes of section 20 (3)(b)(i). Facts:The objector entered into an agreement to buy a building for $706,000. The objector paid a deposit of $106,000 on the date of signing. The remainder of the purchase price was top paid on settlement. This was to be effected by the objec- tor giving the vendor an ANZ Bank irrevocable letter of credit for $600,000. The payment date specified on this letter was six months after settlement. When the objector took possession, in November 1993, it gave the vendor the irrevocable letter. The ANZ subsequently honoured the letter of credit on the due date which was May 1994 (six months later). The objector contended it was entitled to continued on page 18 an input tax in the period ending November 1993. The Commissioner contended the objector was entitled to the credit in the GST period ending May 1994. Decision:The TRA held that the parties had stipulated that the balance of the purchase price be paid by the ANZ Bank, not the objector. This was regarded as a means by which the vendor could safely allow the purchaser to go into possession before payment of all moneys due under the agreement. Judge Willy found it was crucial to that arrangement that the vendor felt it would not have to rely on the objector’s ability to pay the remainder of the purchase price on the deferred date, six months from settlement. He was satisfied that in those circumstances the letter of credit was irrevocable and unconditional. The vendor had rights against the bank only. Its rights against the objector had been extinguished by the letter of credit. Thus the transaction became complete in November 1993. Judge Willy found the parties’ agreement to an irrevocable letter of credit which was redeemable at some time in the future was just as valid a means of payment as if the purchaser had paid with cash. The consideration agreed upon was a payment both at common law and for the purposes of section 20 (3)(b)(i) of the GST Act. The correct taxable period was therefore November 1993, not May 1994. Severance of employment payments - assessability Case:TRA Nos 96/114 and 96/059 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 65 (2)(b) Keywords:Monetary remuneration, personal grievance - employment issues Summary:The TRA found that, on the balance of probability, it could not find that the entire payment made to each objector for severance of employment was related to humiliation, loss of dignity and injury to their respective feelings. Clearly the major ingredient of the payment was for loss of earnings and Judge Barber apportioned the respective parts of each payment accordingly, so that a potion of each payment was taxable while the remaining portion was not. Facts:This case involved two separate cases stated which were heard together. The two objectors, M and S, were both employed by an insurance company. In 1992 they were both informed that their positions were to be downgraded in terms of earning potential and status. The objectors responded by bringing personal grievance claims in the Employment Tribunal. They both received severance of employment payments under a Settlement Agreement. S received $79,769.89 and M received $136,546.53. Their focus at the settlement meeting was on the amount of the payment rather than its components. After the settlement meeting the taxpayers realised that only $10,000 of the payments was attributable to loss of dignity and injury to feelings and therefore non-taxable. They sought to increase this amount. Their evidence is that the entire payment was for loss of dignity and injury to feelings and that they both accepted their settlement on that basis. However the final signed agreements were lost in transit and there are no copies of them. Decision:Judge Barber accepted that it was Inland Revenue’s policy that payments for loss of earnings are assessable income under section 65 (2)(b) because they are ‘mon- etary remuneration’. He also accepted Inland Revenue’s policy that payments for humiliation, loss of dignity and injury to feelings are not assessable. He could not find, on the balance of probability, that the entire payment to each objector was related to the latter. It was clear that the major ingredient of the settlement payment was loss of income. Judge Barber therefore apportioned the settlement payment appropriately between non-assessable and assessable income. from page 17 Company strike-off - effect on case stated proceedings Case:TRA No 93/WN/029 Keywords:Strike off, dissolution Summary:This is an interlocutory matter concerning the effect striking an objector com- pany off from the Companies Register has upon existing case stated proceed- ings. The TRA applied the High Court decision in Suzy Speed Holdings Limited v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,108. Facts:The Objector was a company incorporated in July 1984. As a result of disallowed objections, a case stated was requested in December 1992, and was filed in July 1993. The Objector’s agent requested that the Objector be struck off the Compa- nies Register under section 366 of the Companies Act 1955. The strike off was advertised in the Gazette on 26 January 1995 and the company was eventually struck off on 14 March 1995. Judge Barber addressed three issues at the hearing. They were: 1.Once the Objector was struck off, could it (or anyone else) continue the case stated? 2.What is the effect of an invalid removal of the Objector from the Companies Register (less than three months had passed from the date of advertising in the Gazette to the date of strike off)? 3.What is the effect of the Objector failing to show up at the earlier Directions hearing? Decision:The TRA confirmed the decision in Suzy Speed Holdings Limited v CIR. Judge Barber decided the three issues as follows: 1.From the time the Objector was removed from the Companies Register under the Companies Act 1955, the company is dissolved and must be treated as if it no longer exists. The TRA can not look behind the certificate saying the com- pany had been struck off, as to do so was outside the taxpayer’s jurisdiction. Neither the taxpayer’s agent nor any former officer of the Objector has the power to represent the company once it is dissolved and before it is resolved to the Register (if that occurs). 2.Judge Barber would not consider this question as to do so would be outside the ambit of the TRA’s jurisdiction. He could only consider the papers in front of him which included a certificate that the Objector had been struck off. 3.The case was deemed to be withdrawn under regulation 9 (6) of the TRA Regulations 1994, as a result of the Objector failing to appear at the Directions hearing. However Judge Barber did adjourn the matter to 22 November 1996 for the resumption of the directions hearing to allow the parties to consider the implications of the ruling. If there was no valid appearance at that date the case would be deemed withdrawn.

Administration Act.......................39 Background - new compliance and penalties rules The complex job of reviewing and reforming the compliance and penalties rules began four years ago, when in the 1992 budget the Government announced its intention to launch a review and a reform of the compliance and penalties rules in the Inland Revenue Acts. There was widespread consultation about the changes. The principles of the reforms were outlined in a discussion document issued August 1994. The Government then issued a second document in April 1995, for further consultation, which contained detailed proposals and draft legislation. In October 1995 the Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties and Disputes Resolution Bill was introduced into Parliament. The Finance and Expenditure Committee considered the bill and submissions from various groups and individuals. Problems with the existing rules The current legislative scheme dates back at least to 1916, particularly in respect of income tax. Since then many major changes and new rules have been added to make up the tax system that exists today. At the same time, the nature of tax administration has changed from a system in which each taxpayer’s liability was quantified using a manual process to one that is largely based on modern technology. The provisions detailing taxpayer obligations and standards of behaviour, and sanctions which enforce these have not kept pace with the changing nature of tax legislation and administration. The current rules have a number of weaknesses which broadly relate to gaps in coverage, flaws in design and inconsistencies in application. This has resulted in several problems: •The rules are unfair to the majority of taxpayers, who comply with the law. •There are unnecessary costs for taxpayers, their agents and the tax administration. •The legal processes and requirements are unclear to taxpayers. •The rules are less effective than desirable in supporting taxpayers’ obligations in a self-assessment environment. The new provisions comprehensively address these problems. Benefits of the new rules The last ten years have seen major reforms in taxation and tax administration. They include: •a significant broadening of the tax base, and associated changes in tax rates •modernisation of tax administration •an increasing responsibility placed on taxpayers to assess their own tax liability. All these changes have taken place in an environment of increasing business and commercial sophisti- cation. However, the rules relating to taxpayers’ compliance obligations have never been clearly stated. Fundamental defects in the area of sanctions have meant that taxpayers who wish to “play the system”, could do so, usually without risk of loss. However, under the new rules those found to be engaged in this activity will face interest from the original due date of the tax and the prospect of significant penalties. There will be considerable benefits from the new rules. Replacing the current ad hoc structure with a comprehensive new structure will encourage all taxpayers to comply with their obligations. The foundation of the new rules is a clear statement of the appropriate standards that taxpayers must meet in complying with their obligations. These standards are reinforced by a comprehensive structure of penalties. Many people regard these amendments to taxpayer obligations and tax penalties as the most important change to the tax system in many years.

The taxpayer obligations are contained in new sections 15A and 15B. Background A recent review of the Inland Revenue Department, chaired by Sir Ivor Richardson, identified New Zealand as operating a system of substantial self-assessment. Under such a system individuals and companies must assess their own tax liability and pay tax according to the requirements of the law. For taxpayers to be able to satisfy the requirements placed upon them by self-assessment, they must be aware of their primary tax obligations. The new amend- ments clarify taxpayers’ obligation to assess their tax liability and clearly spell out their responsibility to determine the correct amount payable and pay it on time. The obligations represent the target taxpayers should be aiming for. However, in some circumstances failure to satisfy a tax obligation may not justify imposing a penalty. To reflect this, standards are introduced to define how far taxpayers are expected to go to meet their tax obligations. Legislation Section 15A states the purpose of the new part and Section 15B sets out taxpayers’ primary obligations as follows: •correctly determine their amount of tax payable •deduct or withhold the correct amount of tax from payments or receipts •pay tax on time •keep all necessary information and maintain all necessary accounts or balances •disclose all information that the Commissioner requires in a timely and useful way •co-operate with the Commissioner to the extent required by the Inland Revenue Acts •comply with other specific tax obligations. Discussion An obligation to comply with the Act remains with the person on whom it is imposed; it cannot be transferred to a third party even if the taxpayer contracts with a third party to meet that obligation. For example, a taxpayer who must file a tax return employs a tax agent. If the return is not filed, it is the taxpayer, and not the agent, who is liable, as the obligation is the taxpayer’s. Part 2 - Interest Introduction Use of money interest is not a penalty. Rather, it is intended to reduce any advantage or disadvantage when taxpayers overpay or underpay tax. Interest will be a cost imposed on taxpayers or on the Government to compensate for having the use of the other party’s money over a period of time. The principle behind use of money interest is that all taxpayers’ tax payments are due on prescribed dates, and taxpayers have an obligation to pay on those applicable dates. Interest will provide an incentive to taxpayers to pay the right amount of tax at the right time by removing the timing benefit from deferring tax payments. The interest provisions have adopted a commercial approach, together with safeguards to ensure that Inland Revenue is not used as a financing or investment vehicle. Adopting a commercial approach to the payment of interest permits the concepts of interest and penalties to be clearly distinguished, and allows them to be applied separately. Interest charges do not imply any culpability on the part of the taxpayer. The primary objective of interest is to provide compensation. The new interest rules apply to all taxes and duties from the 1997-98 income year onwards, as set out in the table on page 2. Background The Tax Simplification Consultative Committee recommended that a full two-way interest system be implemented. It considered that charging interest on underpayments or late payments of tax would give taxpayers an incentive to pay the right amount of tax at the right time by removing any timing benefits from deferrals. Paying interest on overpayments would recognise that taxpayers had lost the use of their funds continued on page 4 and should be compensated, especially when large refunds are involved and the time delay is significant. Under the present system interest is not applied consist- ently across revenues, and does not apply at all in some areas. Key features •Split interest rates will apply consistently to all taxes and duties. •There are comprehensive interest rules for overpayments and underpayments of tax. •Interest will generally be payable on underpaid and overpaid tax from the original date tax was due until paid or refunded. •Interest rates will be determined on a market basis to reflect their compensation function and to encourage timely payments. •Interest will be assessable and subject to resident withholding tax (or NRWT as appropriate). •Interest will be deductible, subject to the usual business test. Legislation Interest is covered in Part VII. Section 120A states that Part VII has three purposes: •to compensate the Commissioner for the loss of use of money through taxpayers paying too little tax •to compensate taxpayers for the loss of use of money through their paying too much tax •to encourage taxpayers to pay the correct amount of tax on time. Section 120(2) provides that interest is not a penalty. Discussion In accordance with section 120D, interest will compen- sate taxpayers if they overpay tax, and the Commis- sioner if taxpayers underpay tax. Interest will apply simultaneously with any late payment penalty on any underpaid tax. Currently, interest applies only to a small number of tax types and duties. The new interest rules will apply consistently to all taxes and duties. The taxes and duties to which use of money interest will apply are as follows: •Accident compensation premium deductions by employers (employer and earner premium) •casino duty •cheque duty •Child Support deductions by employers •credit card transaction duty •Family Support •dividend withholding payment accounts •fringe benefit tax •gaming machine duty •gift duty •goods and services tax •imputation accounts •income tax •lottery duty •non-resident withholding tax (on interest and divi- dends) •PAYE deductions •qualifying company election tax •resident withholding tax (on interest and dividends) •stamp duty •Student Loan deductions by employers •specified superannuation contribution withholding tax •totalisator duty However, interest will not apply to the following: •Student Loan borrowers •custodians and liable parents •persons who fail to deduct amounts and return them to the Commissioner under section 157, section 43 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, section 154 of the Child Support Act 1991 and section 46 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992. (These sections require third parties to make deductions from any payments made to the taxpayer and forward them to Inland Revenue.) There have been changes to some tax and duty rules to make them consistent with use of money interest. Each is briefly discussed below. Duties (stamp and cheque duties, gift duty and gaming duties) Each duty previously contained a provision so that if it wasn’t paid by the due date, interest at 5% per month was chargeable. This was effectively a late payment penalty, not interest. These rules have been repealed and duties will be subject to use of money interest. Dividend withholding payment accounts The present dividend withholding payment (DWP) interest rules have been incorporated into the new use of money interest rules. Currently, interest applies to underpayments only if late payment penalty is not imposed. From 1 April 1997 interest and late payment penalty can apply at the same time. Fringe benefit tax Currently, if a taxpayer elects to pay fringe benefit tax on an annual or income year basis, interest is charged from the due dates which would have applied had the taxpayer not made the election. This was to compensate the Government for the deferral. The regulation which gave effect to this has now been repealed, and section from page 3 120S sets out the amount and nature of interest to be added to fringe benefit tax paid on an annual or income year basis. Section 120S gives the same effect as the now-repealed regulation. However, under the new rules interest will be paid on overpayments. Provisional tax The new interest rules are effectively an extension of the current provisional tax use of money interest provisions. However, they don’t eliminate specific provisions relating to provisional taxpayers, such as dates from which interest applies, and the criteria used to establish who is a provisional taxpayer. Sections 120K to 120N cover the implications of the new rules for provisional taxpayers. A $100 tax threshold will apply before any use of money interest is imposed or paid. This is provided for in section 183F. The interest rates applying to provisional tax will be consistent with the general interest rates applying to all taxes and duties. Calculating the interest Section 120E sets out the formula for calculating interest. It will be calculated on a daily basis on the amount of unpaid or overpaid tax. Interest will not compound or be included in the calculation of late payment penalties. However, it will be assessable and deductible and subject to resident withholding tax or NRWT. Use of money interest will be calculated on the daily balance of the taxpayer’s account, excluding any court costs and solicitors’ fees. Interest on underpayments will be charged on any amount of tax owing to the Commissioner, including any accumulated penalties. This will include any late payment penalty, underestimation penalty, late filing penalty and any shortfall penalty due. The start date for interest will be the day after the date the penalty is due. Under the previous provisional tax interest rules, payments received after specific due dates were not taken into account when calculating interest. However, under the new rules any payment made at any date will be taken into account for interest calculations. This means taxpayers could incur both debit and credit interest within the same tax period. Section 120F(4) provides that when debit and credit interest amounts are calculated for the same period, the sum of those amounts will constitute the interest figure that is applied to the taxpayer’s account. Start date Underpayments Use of money interest on underpayments will start on the day after the original due date for paying the tax, and end on the date the tax is fully paid. For example, if a reassessment increases a taxpayer’s income tax liability of three years ago, three years’ interest will be owing to the Commissioner. Interest will be charged on the difference between the original amount of tax paid and the new amount assessed, even though time will be allowed for payment before a late payment penalty is imposed. Overpayments Use of money interest on overpayments will start on the later of: 1.the day after the original payment due date 2.the day after the date the payment was made. The stop date is the date the tax is fully refunded or transferred to another account. If a tax return must be filed for the tax to which the interest relates, the start date for credit interest will be the later of either 1 and 2 above, or the day after the tax return is filed. This is because Inland Revenue cannot refund the tax until the return is filed. An exception is made for provisional taxpayers, to ensure they receive interest on overpaid provisional tax. GST refunds For a GST refund, use of money interest starts on the latest of the following days: 1.the day after the earlier of: –the 15th working day after Inland Revenue receives the GST return –the original due date for payment 2.the day after the return is received 3.the day after the date payment is made. Interest rate Section 120H states that the interest rate for both underpayments and overpayments will be set by Order in Council. The rate may be reviewed “from time to time”. The interest rates have yet to be determined. They will be determined before 7 February 1997, and based on market interest rates applicable at that time. Threshold Under section 183F, a threshold of $100 of underpaid or overpaid tax will apply before interest is charged or paid. This means that only unpaid or overpaid tax greater than $100 on a specific due date will attract interest. Payment application Section 120F provides that payments made by taxpayers will first clear any unpaid interest amounts and then be credited against the tax outstanding. This is consistent with the commercial approach to charging and collect- ing interest. Recovery of interest For recovery purposes, debit interest is treated as being of the same nature as the tax to which it relates. Like- continued on page 6 wise, overpayments of credit interest can also be recov- ered in the same manner. Credit interest may be applied towards payment of unpaid tax. This approach also avoids the need to impose late payment penalty on interest. Assessability and deductibility Interest paid on overpayments will be assessable, and interest charged on underpayments will be deductible under the normal income tax rules. Interest will be deemed to be interest on money lent for the purposes of determining whether a deduction is available under the Income Tax Act. Interest will be assessable in the income year in which it is refunded to the taxpayer or transferred to clear tax owing in another revenue account. For reassessments, interest will be assessable in the income year following the year of reassessment. Interest will be deductible in the income year in which it is assessed. For reassessments, it will be deductible in the income year following the year of reassessment. Tax in dispute The tax in dispute provisions were introduced to compensate taxpayers and Inland Revenue for the time value of money over the period of the dispute, and to reduce the taxpayers’ incentives to continue litigation simply to defer paying tax. Under the new disputes resolution rules, the obligation to pay non-deferrable tax in dispute before requesting a case stated or commencing a challenge is unchanged. If the taxpayer is successful in the dispute, the Commis- sioner will pay interest on the tax which the taxpayer paid before litigation. Alternatively, if the Commis- sioner is successful the taxpayer will be liable for interest on the unpaid portion of the tax which is outstanding from the original due date. Objection to interest Section 120I provides that a taxpayer may not object to or challenge the imposition of interest payable. How- ever, if the amount of interest imposed has been calcu- lated incorrectly, the taxpayer is still able to require the Commissioner to make the appropriate amendments to ensure that the interest charged is correct. Special provisions The following sections contain provisions which relate to particular areas. Section 120G states that the payment date for interest payable by a taxpayer to the Commissioner is “immedi- ately and without the need for a demand.” This means that interest is due from the date that it is charged whether or not a statement of account is sent to the taxpayer. Section 120O deals with the date interest starts on tax reconciliations. It provides that when tax is overpaid, interest will start on whichever of the following is applicable: 1.If the due date is unchanged, the day after the later of: –the due date for payment –the date the payment is made 2.If there is a new due date, the later of: –the day after the original due date for paying the tax –the date the payment is made. Section 120P applies when taxpayers can elect to spread income back over previous income years. It states that no interest is payable before the terminal tax date for the election income year or apportionment income year. Example A taxpayer incurred a tax shortfall in the 1998 year and elected to apportion it back over the 1995, 1996 and 1997 years. Interest would apply only from the 1998 payment due date. Section 120Q states that for the purposes of Part VII, the due date of underestimation penalty tax is the taxpayer’s third instalment date. Currently the due date is the due date for the payment of terminal tax. Section 120R states that for foreign dividend withhold- ing payments, if a taxpayer elects to reduce losses instead of making foreign dividend withholding pay- ments, payment will be deemed to be made within the required period if the notice of election is given within that time. Section 120U provides that when a taxpayer pays a bond or other security rather than making a deduction from a payment to a non-resident, and it is later established that a deduction should have been made, the interest start date will be the day after the day on which the amount would have been payable if a bond or other security had not been provided. from page 5 Part 3 - Penalties Introduction Section 139 sets out the purpose of the penalties provi- sions of the Act, which are as follows: •to encourage taxpayers to comply voluntarily with their tax obligations and to co-operate with Inland Revenue •to ensure that penalties for breaches of tax obligations are imposed impartially and consistently •to act against non-compliance with tax obligations effectively and at a level that is proportionate to the seriousness of the breach. The legislation introduces important changes to the penalty provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts. These changes promote fairer and more effective enforcement and improve the consistency in applying penalties overall and between the different tax types. The foundation of the new rules is a statement of standards which taxpayers must meet in complying with their obligations. These standards are then reinforced by a comprehensive structure of penalties. At the core of the penalty rules is a positive standard of reasonable care. This means that individual taxpayers’ actions in meeting obligations should be at the standard expected of a reasonable person. In addition, for inter- pretive matters which involve significant amounts of tax, taxpayers must ensure that they have interpreted the law in a reasonable way. Background Existing provisions do not comprehensively address the different ways taxpayers may fail to meet the require- ments placed on them. They tend to focus on taxpayers’ responsibilities to provide factual information, even though today’s environment requires more than just the provision of information. The current system generally relies on taxpayers to make a first assessment of their own tax liability, so the standards they are expected to meet in interpreting and applying the law needed to be clarified. The new penalty rules support self-assessment concepts by encouraging voluntary compliance with the law. They clarify the standards and obligations expected of taxpayers in relation to their tax liability, and reinforce these with a comprehensive structure of penalties. Key features •The legislation introduces a late filing penalty of $50, $250 or $500, depending on the taxpayer’s net income for the relevant year. •The late payment penalty has been changed from 10% to 5%, with 2% monthly incremental penalties. •Shortfall penalties for taxpayers who do not take reasonable care to determine the correct amount of tax have been introduced. •There is a new penalty of 20% of the resulting tax shortfall if taxpayers have an unacceptable interpreta- tion of how the law applies to their tax affairs. The penalty will apply if the tax at stake exceeds a speci- fied threshold. •Taxpayers who engage in an abusive tax position will be liable to a shortfall penalty of 100% of the result- ing tax shortfall. •Shortfall penalties will be reduced by 75% for volun- tary disclosure before audit and by 40% for voluntary disclosure during an audit. Adequate disclosure at time of filing of an unacceptable interpretation will result in a 75% reduction. •Shortfall penalties will be increased by 25% if a taxpayer obstructs the Commissioner. •Shortfall penalties will be reduced by 75% if an incorrect tax position is reversed or corrected in a return period prior to an audit. •Criminal penalties have been standardised and a maximum five-year term of imprisonment for evasion and related offences introduced. Monetary penalties of up to $50,000 apply to most offences. •Additional tax and penal tax have been repealed. •Court orders to obtain information have been intro- duced. Civil penalties Section 3(1) defines civil penalty as: •an underestimation penalty •a late filing penalty •a late payment penalty •a shortfall penalty Each category of civil penalty is discussed below. Non-deductibility of civil penalties Section DB of the Income Tax Act 1994 prohibits tax deductions for income tax penalties. This has been amended to include civil penalties. Civil penalties are therefore not tax-deductible. Underestimation penalty The provisional tax underestimation penalty has been retained. This penalty is still necessary as it has been designed specifically to enforce a particular obligation which cannot be effectively enforced using generic civil penalties like the late payment penalty. continued on page 8 Late filing penalty Legislation Section 139A states that late filing penalties will apply to the following annual returns which are required under the TAA: •annual income tax returns •Family Support end of year statements •partnership returns, •returns by executors and administrators •special returns for agents, non-resident traders, taxpayers leaving New Zealand or who have ceased business, returns to date of death, bankruptcy or liquidation •PAYE and ACC earner premium reconciliation statements •ACC employer premium calculation returns. A taxpayer is liable to a late filing penalty if the re- quired return is not filed on time and the taxpayer has been notified that the penalty is payable. For income tax returns the amount of the penalty is as follows: Amount ofLate filing net incomepenalty less than $100,000 $50 $100,000 - $1,000,000$250 greater than $1,000,000$500 reconciliation statements$250 Initially Inland Revenue will restrict the late filing penalty to annual income tax returns for individuals and companies, PAYE reconciliations and ACC reconcilia- tions. Note that this penalty does not apply to either GST or FBT returns, or other periodic returns that require a payment at the time of filing. Discussion The International Monetary Fund recommended introducing a late filing penalty after its review of Inland Revenue in 1989. It proposed that the penalty be a flat fine automatically imposed by Inland Revenue. The Tax Simplification Consultative Committee supported this recommendation in 1990. The obligation for taxpayers to file income tax returns by the due date is a basic one, but previously there was no effective penalty for those who failed to do so. Because the tax system relies on taxpayers filing their returns on time, it was considered that a failure to meet this obligation should attract a penalty. Application of penalty The late filing penalty may apply to a taxpayer who does not file a return “on time”, which means on or before the due date. This means the late filing penalty could apply both to late and non-filers of returns. The late filing penalty will be imposed at the Commis- sioner’s discretion, and only after the taxpayer has been notified that a return is required. The notification would advise taxpayers that they must file a return or notify Inland Revenue if there is some valid reason for not filing the return. Taxpayers who do not file their return or notify Inland Revenue of the reason for not filing will have the late filing penalty imposed. The amount of late filing penalty will depend on the amount of the “net income” returned. Net income is the gross income less expenses and before any loss offsets. The late filing penalty may be remitted if taxpayers were not able to file on time for reasons beyond their control. This is discussed in detail in Part 6, which deals with remissions. Any taxpayer who files a “nil” or incomplete return by the due date to avoid the late filing penalty may be liable to shortfall penalties. At the very least, a taxpayer who files a return knowing that it may be incorrect would not have shown reasonable care. Due date for late filing penalty The late filing penalty for annual income tax returns will be due and payable on the latest of these dates: •30 days after the Commissioner notifies the taxpayer that the penalty is payable •7 February for IR 5 taxpayers •the terminal tax due date for all other taxpayers. The due date for paying the late filing fee for reconcilia- tions will be the latest of these dates: •30 days after the Commissioner notifies the taxpayer •31 May following the income year to which the reconciliation relates. A late filing penalty may be imposed even if the return results in no tax to pay or a refund, as the penalty is related to the filing of returns and not the amount of tax payable. The objective of the late filing penalty is to get taxpayers to file their returns on time. The late filing penalty will be subject to late payment penalty and interest if not paid by the due date. Extension of time issues Section 37(3) allows the Commissioner to extend the due date for filing returns if a taxpayer makes a written application on or before the due date for filing. The Commissioner also has a discretion to accept a late request for extension of time. Written requests for extension of time should state the return period to which the extension application relates, the length of time the extension is required and the reasons for requesting the extension. Acceptable reasons for requesting an extension of time are generally from page 7 reasons beyond the taxpayer’s control. Some examples of acceptable reasons would be illness or accident. If a taxpayer becomes a client of an agent who receives an extension of time, and the late filing penalty has already been imposed, the penalty will stand. Also, if an agent’s extension of time for a client is withdrawn, the client could become liable for the penalty for the unfiled return. In this situation, Inland Revenue will give the taxpayer notice before we impose the penalty. Late payment penalty Legislation Section 139B states that a taxpayer who does not pay the tax (called ‘unpaid tax’) by the due date is liable to pay a late payment penalty. The initial penalty is 5% of the unpaid tax, and is imposed on the day after the due date for paying the unpaid tax. The incremental late payment penalty is 2% of the amount of tax to pay as at each month after the day on which a penalty is imposed. It continues for successive monthly intervals as long as any tax to pay remains unpaid. The term ‘tax to pay’ means the unpaid tax together with any accumulated late payment penalty or incre- mental penalty. The term ‘unpaid tax’ includes deductions that must be made and paid to the Commissioner (such as a PAYE deductions made and not returned), but does not include a late payment penalty. Discussion Application The new rules introduce a standardised late payment penalty across all tax types except Student Loan repay- ments and Child Support. There are two parts to the late payment penalty: an initial component which penalises taxpayers for not meeting a tax obligation by a due date, and an incre- mental component which encourages prompt payment of the debt over time. The initial late payment penalty of 5% will be charged on the amount of tax outstanding after the payment due date. The existing incremental penalties allow payment to be deferred by almost six months before further penalties apply. The new system shortens this interval, but reduces the rate of penalty. The new incremental penalties of 2% per month will be charged on the amount of tax outstanding as at the date of imposition. The late payment penalty will apply from the day after the due date for paying the tax. Threshold Under section 183F the late payment penalty will not apply to unpaid tax of less than $100. Only unpaid tax greater than $100 will attract a late payment penalty and interest. Late payment penalties are deemed to be of the same nature as the tax to which they relate, so they are included in the base amount when calculating interest. Due date for paying tax For various duties, the payment due dates are as follows: Totalisator-20 days from the end of the month in dutywhich the race or sporting event was held Lottery duty-14 days after the lottery is drawn Cheque duty -the due dates remain unchanged Stamp duty-for an instrument stamped in New Zealand: six months after the date the instrument was executed -for an instrument stamped outside New Zealand: six months after the date it was first received in New Zealand after execution Gift duty-six months after dutiable gift is made If a tax liability is increased as a result of a reassess- ment, a new due date will be set for paying the addi- tional tax assessed. The late payment penalty will apply only if the taxpayer does not pay the tax due by the new due date. The previous “original due date” provisions for calculat- ing additional tax when a taxpayer has been guilty of neglect or default have been repealed and replaced with the interest rules explained in Part 2 of this bulletin. Taxpayers in financial difficulties will be able to minimise the impact of the late payment penalties by making an instalment arrangement with the Commis- sioner. The Commissioner will also be able to remit late payment penalties in limited circumstances. This is discussed in detail in Part 6, which deals with remis- sions. Specific provisions The following sections also relate to the late payment pen- alties: Section 139C - Late payment penalty and provisional tax Section 140 - If another person deducts and pays resident withholding tax Section 140A - Underestimation penalty when income tax underestimated as at the final instalment date Section 140B - Imputation penalty tax payable when there is an end of year debit balance Section 140C - Dividend withholding payment penalty tax payable when there is an end of year debit balance Section 140D - Application of other provisions of Act to imputation penalty tax and dividend withholding payment penalty tax. continued on page 10 from page 9 Shortfall penalties The following table summarises the breaches and shortfall penalty rates applicable and includes the various adjust- ments that may be made to the base penalty rate. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Penalty - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - If reducedIf reducedIf reduced by 75% forby 40% forby 75% forIf increased Standarddisclosuredisclosuredisclosureby 25% for Action subject to penaltyratebefore auditduring auditwhen filingobstruction Lack of reasonable care20%5%12%n/a\*25% Unacceptable interpretation20%5%12% 5%25% Gross carelessness40%10%24%n/a\*50% Abusive tax position100%25%60%25%125% Evasion150%37.5%90%n/a\*187.5% \*This reduction is limited to the unacceptable interpretation and abusive tax position penalties because it specifically relates to the disclosure of the taxpayer’s interpretation at time of filing. The following diagram summarises how to determine whether an action is subject to a penalty, and the penalty rate that will apply. Reasonable care Legislation Section 141A provides that a taxpayer who does not take reasonable care in taking a tax position is liable to pay a shortfall penalty. This penalty will be 20% of the resulting tax shortfall. If a taxpayer uses an acceptable interpretation of tax law in taking a tax position, he or she has also taken reasonable care in taking that tax position. Discussion The penalty for lack of reasonable care applies to any taxpayer who must take a tax position. That means it includes taxpayers who are required to make source deductions and who fail to exercise reasonable care in calculating the amount of tax to deduct or account for. For example, if an employer is away on a planned absence and forgot to make arrangements to pay tax deductions, that employer may incur a penalty for lack of reasonable care. Whether the taxpayer acted intentionally is not a consideration. The reasonable care test requires a taxpayer to exercise the care that a reasonable person would be likely to exercise in the taxpayer’s circum- stances to fulfil the tax obligations. It is not a question of whether the taxpayer actually foresaw the probability that the act or failure to act would cause a tax shortfall, but whether a reasonable person in the same circum- stances would have foreseen the shortfall as a reason- able probability. It equates with the concept of negli- gence in the civil law of Torts, and the jurisprudence is well established: “Negligence is to be measured objec- tively by ascertaining what in the circumstances would be done or omitted by the reasonable man.” (Meulan’s Hair Stylists Ltd v CIR) In the tax context, reasonable care includes exercising reasonable diligence to determine the correctness of a return position. It also includes keeping adequate books and records to substantiate items properly, and generally making a reasonable attempt to comply with the tax law. The reasonable care test is not intended to be overly onerous to taxpayers. Reasonable care does not mean perfection. The effort required of the taxpayer is commensurate with that of a reasonable person in the taxpayer’s circumstances. Factors to consider Ordinarily what is expected is the achievement of a standard appropriate to the category of taxpayer, rather than of the individual taxpayer involved. The category of taxpayer will affect what constitutes reasonable care in each particular case. The standard required of a salary and wage earner will differ from that required of a business taxpayer. For most PAYE taxpayers, an earnest effort to follow the Tax Pack instructions will be sufficient to pass the reasonable care test. For business taxpayers, reasonable care means there must be an appropriate record keeping system and other procedures to ensure that the income and expendi- ture of the business is properly recorded and classified for tax purposes. The circumstances that may be taken into account when determining whether a taxpayer has exercised reason- able care include: •the complexity of the law and the transaction (the difficulty in interpreting complex legislation) •the materiality of the shortfall (the gravity of the consequence and the size of the risk) •the difficulty and expense of taking the precaution •the taxpayer’s age, health and background. Business taxpayers For a business, reasonable care may also take into account: •the size and nature of the business •the internal controls in place •the business’s record keeping practices •system failures (however, this would be balanced with consideration as to why the system failure occurred). If a taxpayer’s accounting systems are designed to correctly classify entries according to their attributes and the system is monitored to ensure that the likeli- hood of error is reduced to an acceptable level, reason- able care is exercised. Arithmetical errors Arithmetical errors may indicate a failure to take reasonable care, but they are not conclusive. The decision will depend on the procedures the taxpayer had in place to detect such errors, the size, nature and frequency of the error, or the circumstances in which the taxpayer made the error. Interpretations On questions of interpretation, reasonable care requires a taxpayer to come to conclusions that a reasonable person would come to in the particular category of taxpayer. If a taxpayer is uncertain about the correct tax treatment of an item, reasonable care requires the taxpayer to make reasonable enquires. Accordingly, for questions of interpretation, reasonable care will depend on: •what efforts the taxpayer had taken to resolve the issue •the types of advice received •the certainty of the law. Materiality Materiality is implicit in the standard of “reasonable care”. In considering whether a taxpayer has taken reasonable care, consideration will be given not only to the nature of the shortfall, but also to the size of the shortfall in relation to the taxpayer. continued on page 12 Case law In Australia, to date, there has been only one case of “lack of reasonable care” taken to the courts. It is Case 34/95, 95 ATC 319, which involved the deduction of a superannuation claim. The judge referred to the explanatory memorandum which illuminates Parliament’s intended meaning of the phrase “reasonable care”. It explained that reasonable care “....requires a taxpayer to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the provisions of \[the Act\] and regulations. The effort required is one commensurate with all the taxpayer’s circumstances, including the taxpayer’s knowledge, education, experience and skill”. The judgment then stated that “...given that the taxpay- er’s return was prepared by experienced tax agents, who objectively should have known, or at the very least, had the resources to find out, the requirements in respect of the deduction of superannuation contributions, and who furthermore prepared the returns for the particular employer involved, it is difficult to find that reasonable care has been exercised.” A similar case in New Zealand would have a different outcome. This is because New Zealand taxpayers are not vicariously liable for a tax adviser’s carelessness. In such a case in New Zealand, if it was established that the taxpayer had reasonably relied on the tax adviser’s advice, the taxpayer would be considered to have taken reasonable care. Burden and standard of proof The burden of proof rests with the taxpayer to show that he or she has taken reasonable care. The standard of proof is the civil standard of “balance of probabilities”. Accordingly, a taxpayer who can show that it is prob- able that he or she took reasonable care will have satisfied the standard. Example 2 Facts: A newly-established business was experienc- ing rapid growth, and its accounting system had not kept pace and had become inadequate. The firm’s tax return was prepared from this accounting system Inland Revenue audited the business and found several omissions of income (from accounts for services rendered by the firm), along with over- stated claims for deductions. The tax shortfalls could have been avoided if proper records had been maintained. Penalty: The taxpayer had been careless in main- taining an inadequate accounting system, which resulted in the tax shortfall. For business taxpayers, reasonable care would require having an appropri- ate record keeping system to ensure that the busi- ness’s income and expenditure is properly recorded and classified for tax purposes. A reasonable person conducting the business would have foreseen during the year that unless the accounting system was improved it could have resulted in a tax shortfall. The taxpayer is subject to a penalty of 20% for lack of reasonable care. Example 1 A retired taxpayer receives NZ Superannuation, interest income from three bank accounts and dividend income on several parcels of shares inherited from her late husband. She has not previously prepared a tax return because her husband always dealt with tax matters. Accord- ingly, she is now completing a tax return for the first time. When she filled in the first tax return since her husband’s death, she overlooked a dividend re- ceived from a parcel of shares that had been sold during the year and a small amount of interest. However, she has otherwise carefully returned all other amounts of interest and dividends received as well as the NZ Superannuation. In this situation, the taxpayer has exercised reason- able care. The oversight was minor and does not detract from her generally careful approach. No penalty would be applied to any resulting tax shortfall. Defence to reasonable care In large adjustment cases when the matter turns on a question of interpretation, the acceptable interpretation standard must be satisfied. A taxpayer who can demon- strate that the position taken is an acceptable interpreta- tion is deemed to have satisfied the reasonable care standard. Tax agents/advisers A taxpayer who has reasonably relied on the advice of a tax adviser or Inland Revenue will usually be considered to have exercised reasonable care. However, a taxpayer could still be liable for a penalty for lack of reasonable care by taking any of these actions: •providing inadequate information when seeking advice •failing to give reasonable instructions to a tax adviser •relying unreasonably on a tax adviser or on wrong advice. A taxpayer does not satisfy his or her obligation to take reasonable care simply by using the services of a tax agent or tax adviser. The taxpayer is still responsible for the proper recording of his or her tax affairs during the year, and for drawing all the relevant facts to the attention of the agent or adviser, in order to satisfy the reasonable care test. Taxpayers are expected to answer honestly any questions asked by the agent or adviser to do with preparing the return. Taxpayers are unlikely to be considered to have breached the standard if Inland Revenue has failed to provide adequate information in our guides, if the taxpayer has relied on misleading information from reputable sources, or if the relevant information is extremely complex or specialised. Errors made for these reasons are understandable. from page 11 Example 3 Facts: The same as in the previous example, except that the amounts involved were small in relation to total income for the year. The errors occurred early during the period of rapid expansion, and the taxpayer had fixed the problem with the accounting system before the end of the taxable period, by introducing a new system to cope with the expan- sion of the business. No errors were detected in the later part of the year. Penalty: The taxpayer had realised that the ac- counting system had proven inadequate for the expanding needs of the growing business and had taken positive steps to resolve the problem as soon as it became apparent. A reasonable business taxpayer, when establishing the business, may not have foreseen that the accounting system would be inadequate at the outset, but would have foreseen during the year that unless the system was improved it would result in a tax shortfall. Accordingly, there would be no penalty. Example 4 Facts: During the stock take an employee trans- posed the cost price of one category of stock. The entire stock take involved counting 2000 different categories of stock. The error was not found during normal checking procedures used by the company, but came to light during an audit. The shortfall was minimal in relation to the entire stock figure. Penalty: The taxpayer had taken reasonable care in carrying out the stock take. The procedures in place would have normally picked up any discrepancies. The error was also not sufficiently material to put the taxpayer on notice. Accordingly, there would be no penalty. Example 5 Facts: The taxpayers, a husband and wife, own a corner dairy. The husband looks after all operations in the shop. His wife helps in the shop and keeps basic accounts which are sent to their accountant at year end for preparation of the final tax return. The business is registered for GST and files two- monthly returns. During previous audits it has been ascertained that good records are kept for each return, comprising a full worksheet substantiated by relevant documentation. One of the taxpayers prepares the GST return and, after completion, the return is checked by the other. As a result of an audit, a tax shortfall is found in the return for one period. The discrepancy is due to an arithmetical error and is small relative to the GST payable for the period. Penalty: Inland Revenue considers that the taxpay- ers have taken reasonable care to complete the GST return. Good records are maintained and the return was carefully prepared and checked as usual. The shortfall is not material and therefore does not detract from the fact that the taxpayers took reason- able care in completing the GST return. Accord- ingly, no penalty would be imposed in this case. Example 6 Facts: The taxpayer is a salary and wage earner who regularly gives money to a church group that meets weekly at a member’s house to pray. The group is raising funds to build a church. At year end, she refers to the IR 5 income tax return guide to prepare her income tax return. She notes that the guide states that she may claim a rebate for “donations to churches” provided that she holds a receipt to substantiate her claim. She claims the maximum rebate of $500 as she holds a receipt which she has received from the group which substantiates that she has donated $1,500 for the building of the church. The return is audited and Inland Revenue notes that the receipt in the return is not from a recognised church in New Zealand that holds approved donee status. The receipt is not eligible for the rebate claimed. Accordingly, the return is reassessed, creating a tax shortfall of the amount of the rebate claimed. Penalty: The taxpayer has exercised reasonable care as she has followed the instruction as set out in the guide. There was no apparent reason to make further enquires. A reasonable person in the taxpay- er’s circumstances would not have been aware that the church was required to hold approved donee status. There would be no penalty in this case. Example 7 Facts: A salary and wage earner started up a lawn mowing business which he operates in the evenings and weekends, to make some additional income. The taxpayer knows that this additional income is taxable and has set up a cash book system for recording his lawn mowing income. However, occasionally when he is busy he forgets to record some of this income. He prepares his income tax return using the infor- mation in his records. As a result of an audit, he incurs a tax shortfall resulting from lawn mowing income being understated. Penalty: The taxpayer has displayed a lack of reasonable care. Although he has set up a system and kept records, he has not maintained them sufficiently to return the correct amount of income for tax purposes. The result of not keeping accurate records would have been foreseen by a reasonable person in this taxpayer’s circumstances. Therefore there is a 20% penalty for lack of reasonable care. continued on page 14 consequences should take extra care. The standard is designed to encourage taxpayers to ensure that the conclusions they reach are sound. Interpretation or application of a tax law The unacceptable interpretation standard only applies to tax shortfalls caused by a taxpayer treating a tax law as applying in a particular way. A taxpayer treats the tax law as applying in a particular way by concluding that, on the basis of the facts and the way the law applies to those facts, a particular conse- quence follows. An example would be concluding that an amount of expenditure is deductible. In some cases a taxpayer’s tax position may not represent the taxpayer’s conclusions, but instead reflect errors in calculation or transposition. As a broad rule, if a tax shortfall was caused by an error in calculation or transposition error, section 141B will not apply because the taxpayer will not have treated a tax law as applying in relation to a matter in a particular way. An example would be a transposition error in a depreciation schedule. However, in such a case the reasonable care standard would need to be considered. Threshold The unacceptable interpretation standard applies only if the tax shortfall exceeds a specified threshold. Section 141B(2) states: A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if - (b)The tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer’s tax position exceeds both - (i)$10,000; and (ii)The lesser of $200,000 and one percent of the taxpayer’s total tax figure for the relevant return period. Tax cap There is a $200,000 tax cap attached to the one percent threshold. The reason for this is that any tax shortfall over $200,000 is considered significant to the revenue, even if it isn’t considered significant to the taxpayer. For example, if a taxpayer’s total tax position was $30 million the cap of $200,000 tax would apply, as one percent of $30 million is $300,000. The taxpayer’s total tax figure The taxpayer’s total tax figure is defined in section 141B(3) as: (a)The amount of tax paid or payable by the taxpayer in respect of the return period for which the taxpayer takes the taxpayer’s tax position before any group offset election or subvention payment; or (b)Where the taxpayer has no tax to pay in respect of the return period, - (i)Except in the case of GST, an amount equal to the product of - (A)The net losses of the taxpayer in respect of the return period, ascertained in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994; and (B)The basic rate of income tax for companies in the relevant return; or Example 8 Facts: The taxpayer inherited two rental properties in 1996. The properties had been rented out before he inherited them, and each was being managed by a separate real estate firm. The taxpayer noted that the property values in the area where one of the houses was situated had increased substantially. He undertook renovations in this house which involved redecorating the interior and replacing carpet in the living room. He also had a carport built at this property as there had previ- ously been no off-street parking. In the tax return for the year ended 31 March 1998 he understated his gross income by omitting to return the March rental from one of the properties, because he had not received the rental income statement from the real estate agent. He also claimed a deduction for the expenditure incurred in erecting the carport, along with the cost of redeco- rating and recarpeting one of the properties. As a result of an audit, a tax shortfall was ascer- tained for the understated income, and the expendi- ture claimed for building the carport was disal- lowed. Penalty: The taxpayer had been careless in not returning the rental income for March as he should have been aware that not all of the income for the year had been accounted for. Before claiming the carport as a revenue expense, a reasonable person would have contacted Inland Revenue or an adviser to find out if this expenditure was deductible for tax purposes. Accordingly, there will be a 20% penalty for lack of reasonable care . Unacceptable interpretation Legislation Section 141B provides a penalty for unacceptable interpretations. A taxpayer who has a tax shortfall for a return period will be liable to pay a shortfall penalty if all of the following apply: •The shortfall was caused by a tax position involving an interpretation or application of a tax law. •The tax shortfall exceeded both $10,000 and the lesser of $200,000 or 1% of the taxpayer’s total tax figure for the relevant return period. •The tax position taken, when viewed objectively, fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. The penalty payable is 20% of the resulting tax short- fall. Discussion The unacceptable interpretation standard signals that taxpayers who take a position which has significant tax from page 13 (ii)In the case of GST, the refund of tax to which the taxpayer is entitled for the return period, - that is shown as tax paid or payable, or losses incurred, or as a refund to which the taxpayer is entitled, in a tax return provided on time by the taxpayer for the return period. Accordingly, a taxpayer who is in a loss situation for the relevant period may convert the tax losses into a tax figure for the purposes of establishing the total tax position. This is done by using the company tax rate applicable for that period. This applies both for indi- viduals and companies, for the purposes of converting the losses in the relevant period. Note that the losses to be converted are only those incurred for that relevant period - they do not include losses carried forward. For example, if a company made a profit of $50,000 in 1999 and had losses carried forward from 1998 of $100,000, the taxpayer’s total tax position for 1999 would be $50,000, as this is the taxpayer’s tax position before any losses carried forward or offsetting occurs. The relevant return period “Return period” is defined as “..the period covered by a tax return, or which would be covered by a tax return if one were provided”. Therefore if a discrepancy spanned several periods, a separate tax shortfall would be calculated for each return period. Other entities Partnerships Section 141B(8)(a) provides that in establishing whether a partnership is over the threshold it is neces- sary to consider the shortfall incurred by the partnership against the partnership income. This means that for the purposes of calculating whether a partnership is over the threshold, it is treated as a separate entity, as it currently would be for GST. Section 141B(8)(b) provides that the company tax rate applies when calculating the tax shortfall to determine whether a partnership is over the threshold. Example In one return period, a partnership takes various tax positions which result in $1,200,000 tax to pay. During an audit Inland Revenue disallows a claim for a non-allowable deduction, resulting in a tax shortfall of $14,000 for the partnership. The two partners in the partnership share equally in the profits, so each partner would be assessed with an additional $7,000 tax. For the purposes of establishing whether an unac- ceptable interpretation standard applies, the short- fall of the partnership ($14,000) is considered, not that of the individual partners. As the partnership tax shortfall exceeds both $10,000 and $12,000 (being 1% of $1,200,000), the partnership must have an acceptable interpretation. If it is determined that the partnership has an unacceptable interpretation, a shortfall penalty would be imposed. The penalty would be $2,800, being 20% of the tax shortfall. Accordingly, each partner would be assessed with $7,000 tax and a shortfall penalty of $1,400. Trusts When a shortfall arises from a trust the tax shortfall will be assessed as trustee income and any shortfall penalties will be imposed on the trustee. This is because the trust is a separate legal entity, with the trustee liable for tax on any income which is not beneficiary income. Accordingly, when establishing whether the trust is over the threshold it is necessary to consider the shortfall incurred by the trust. Joint ventures Joint venturers will be separately liable for any shortfall penalty as they are independent parties for tax purposes. Generally, a share of gross income is returned by each venturer and the individual expenses of each venturer deducted. In these situations it is appropriate that the threshold for the penalty be determined on each indi- vidual venturer. Similar or identical items Section 141(10) states: If (a)In a return period, a taxpayer takes a taxpayer’s tax position - (i)In respect of, or as a consequence of entering into, an arrangement; or (ii)In respect of an article, item, or matter; and (b)In the same return period, the taxpayer takes a similar or identical taxpayer’s tax position - (i)In respect of, or as a consequence of entering into, a similar or identical arrangement; or (ii)In respect of a similar or identical article, item, or matter, - the tax shortfalls arising from the taxpayer’s tax positions are to be aggregated and deemed to be one tax shortfall. “Identical” and “similar” items are to be treated as one tax shortfall. As no guidance is given in the Act on what “similar” means, it takes its ordinary meaning. The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary definition of similar is: Of the same substance or structure throughout; homogeneous. Having a resemblance or likeness; of the same nature or kind. The second of the Government’s discussion documents on this subject provided the following example: Separate lease payments for two cars leased on the same terms will be added together for the purposes of testing whether the threshold has been reached. continued on page 16 Accordingly, identical and similar items must be treated as one for the purposes of determining whether the tax position is over the threshold. What is an “unacceptable interpretation” Section 141B of the Act provides that ..an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law is, in relation to a tax position taken by a taxpayer that ....(b) Fails to meet the standard of being, viewed objectively, about as likely as not to be the correct tax position. Level of standard The unacceptable interpretation standard does not require that the treatment a taxpayer gives to a particu- lar matter must be the better view, or must be more likely than not the correct treatment. The test is “about as likely as not to be correct”. The commentary to the Bill states ...the words ‘about as likely as not correct’ are intended to confirm that it need not be a 50% or more expectation that the taxpayer’s position is the better view. A slightly lower expectation will be accepted... Significant emphasis should be given to the word “about”. It is not intended to remove the right of a taxpayer to take up issues with the Commissioner, rather, it must be a position to which a court would give serious consideration, but not necessarily agree with. This means that the prospect of the taxpayer’s interpre- tation being upheld by the court must be substantial, although not necessarily 50 percent. The taxpayer’s argument should be sufficient to support a reasonable expectation that the taxpayer could succeed in court. If a taxpayer adopts one of several equally likely interpretations this will generally satisfy the standard, as each position is about as likely as any other position to be the correct tax position. Taxpayer effort The unacceptable interpretation standard is an objective test involving an analysis of the law to the relevant facts. This means that it is not relevant that a taxpayer believes that the position taken was an acceptable interpretation. The unacceptable interpretation standard does not take into account taxpayers’ efforts in resolving unclear issues. The standard is intended to focus on the merits of an argument in support of a particular position, rather than the taxpayer’s effort in resolving issues. The strength of the argument is weighed by considering the existence and reasoning of relevant authorities. Relevant authorities have not been defined in the legislation, but the following matters must be considered. Matters which must be considered Section 141B(7) states: The matters that must be considered in determining whether the tax position taken by a taxpayer involves an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law include - (a)The actual or potential application to the tax position of all the tax laws that are relevant (including specific or general anti-avoidance provisions); and (b)Decisions of a court or a Taxation Review Authority on the interpretation of tax laws that are relevant (unless the decision was issued up to one month before the taxpayer takes the taxpayer’s tax position). Relevant tax laws Tax law is defined in section 3(1), which states: Tax law means - (a)A provision of the Inland Revenue Acts or an Act that an Inland Revenue Act replaces: (b)An Order in Council or a regulation made under another tax law: (c)A non-disputable decision: (d)In relation to an obligation to provide a tax return or a tax form, also includes a provision of the Accident Rehabilita- tion and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 or a regulation made under that Act:” Section 141B(7)(a) specifically refers to the anti- avoidance provisions. This ensures that it cannot be argued that a tax position or interpretation is an accept- able interpretation in terms of a particular legislative provision irrespective of the operation of other provi- sions such as general anti-avoidance provisions. This is a scheme and purpose view of tax legislation. Relevant court decisions Factors that affect the weight of an authority: •Source - This refers to the court or tribunal which made the decision upon which the taxpayer places reliance. The higher the source of a decision in the judicial hierarchy, the greater the weight. For exam- ple, a Court of Appeal decision will be accorded greater weight than a TRA decision. •Relevance - Authorities that have similar factual circumstances to the case asserted by a taxpayer are more relevant than those authorities which can be materially distinguished on the facts. •Persuasiveness - An authority that merely states a conclusion is ordinarily less persuasive than one that reaches its conclusions by cogently relating the applicable law to pertinent facts. However, if a taxpayer has no authorities to support a case there may still exist an acceptable interpretation. In such cases, a taxpayer needs a well-reasoned construc- tion of the statutory provision which is about as likely as not to be correct. Opinions expressed by tax professionals The commentary to the bill states ...In the absence of relevant case law, information which supports a reasonable argument may include such items as......the contents of tax opinions, legal articles and related material. However, the mere existence of an opinion from an adviser would not on its own indicate that an acceptable interpretation exists. It is the contents of the opinion, not the fact of seeking advice, which will be relevant. from page 15 Accordingly, the existence of a tax professional’s opinion does not of itself indicate an acceptable inter- pretation, but the contents of that opinion may support an acceptable interpretation. Other matters Other matters which may be considered in particular circumstances include the commentary to the bill, enacting the relevant law, binding public rulings on similar issues, articles written by tax professionals with expertise in the particular field, and related material, and references made to statutes other than the Inland Revenue Acts. Timing Under section 141B(5), whether an interpretation of a tax law is acceptable is to be determined at the time the taxpayer takes a tax position in which the interpretation is involved. To determine whether an unacceptable interpretation exists, one must consider the authorities available at the time the taxpayer took the tax position - generally when the taxpayer files the tax return. In addition, subsequent clarification or development of case law or public rulings in a particular area may confirm that a position taken is acceptable. However, subsequent developments will not be used to argue that a taxpayer’s position was an unacceptable interpretation. For example, a taxpayer may have relied on a court case which was later overturned. The taxpayer would not be penalised because at the time of taking the tax position the law supported the interpretation. An unacceptable interpretation standard applies whether or not the taxpayer has articulated that position. Tax- payers will be able to substantiate their arguments if a dispute arises after filing their returns. However, in most cases taxpayers will need to consider the validity of an interpretation relating to a sizeable transaction when they take the position in their returns or earlier. Binding rulings and the unacceptable interpretation standard The fact that a taxpayer adopts an interpretation that differs from that of a ruling will not necessarily mean that the taxpayer has an unacceptable interpretation. However, the existence of an applicable binding ruling supporting the taxpayer’s position will be an absolute defence against the imposition of a penalty as there will be no tax shortfall. Relationship to the reasonable care standard The aim of the unacceptable interpretation standard is to ensure that taxpayers take care in considering their position. This is also required by the reasonable care standard, but the unacceptable interpretation standard takes away some of the so called “subjective elements” (for example, taxpayer effort) when there is a significant amount of tax at stake. A taxpayer who satisfies the unacceptable interpretation standard is also deemed to have satisfied the reasonable care standard. Example 1 Facts: When preparing its tax return, a corporate taxpayer claims a $500,000 deduction for the purchase of a particular item. This deduction exceeds the threshold for requiring an acceptable interpretation. In taking this tax position, the corporate taxpayer adopted an old TRA decision in which it had been held that items of that nature were revenue expendi- ture. However, over subsequent years case law in this area has evolved, and a recent Privy Council decision clearly established that this type of ex- penditure is of a capital nature and should be capitalised and depreciated, rather than deducted. That decision was given 12 months before the taxpayer took the tax position. Penalty: The taxpayer’s tax position was based on a TRA authority which had similar factual circum- stances, so it would not be considered unreasonable. However, the recent Privy Council decision also had similar factual circumstances which could not be materially distinguished from those of the taxpayer, so its authority outweighs the TRA decision. Accordingly, the corporate taxpayer’s tax position fails to satisfy the standard of “about as likely as not to be correct”. The corporate taxpayer did not have an acceptable interpretation, so a penalty of 20% would be imposed on the tax shortfall resulting from the tax position taken. Example 2 Facts: The taxpayer is a corporate entity involved in property development. Its in-house accountant prepares the year end tax return. During the year the taxpayer purchased land which cost $1,000,000, for the purpose of a large residen- tial housing development project. However, at year end development of the land had not started. The taxpayer sought advice from an outside tax adviser on the appropriate tax treatment of the development of the project. The tax adviser consid- ered that the taxpayer could claim the cost of the land as a deductible expense. However, the adviser overlooked the fact that as development had not yet started the cost of the land had to be added back to income. The corporate taxpayer’s tax return showed that the total tax payable for the year was $210,000. Inland Revenue audited the taxpayer’s income tax return. Even though the cost of the land was a deductible expense, no development had started by year end. The purchase price of the land was considered to be trading stock, and accordingly added back to assessable income. The result was that the taxpayer incurred a tax shortfall in excess of the threshold for requiring an acceptable inter- pretation. continued on page 18 Penalty: The taxpayer had taken reasonable care with its tax affairs as it had sought advice regarding the correct tax treatment of the land purchased. The taxpayer had no reason to doubt the tax advice received about the development project. As the unacceptable interpretation standard is objective, the taxpayer’s efforts and intention are irrelevant. The unacceptable interpretation standard focuses on the merits of an argument in support of a particular position, rather than the taxpayer’s effort in resolving the issues. It is clear in statute law that any trading stock must be added back to income at year end, and case law supports this interpretation. The purchase of the land is considered to be trading stock, so the taxpayer’s position does not meet the test of being “about as likely as not correct”. Consequently, the taxpayer is liable to a 20% shortfall penalty for an unacceptable interpretation. Example 3 Facts: A large corporate taxpayer values its closing trading stock at cost price for the year ended 31 March 1998. In accordance with the group’s policy on trading stock it then adjusts the closing stock values, based on a formula which writes down all trading stock by a fixed percentage. The adjust- ment is made to allow for obsolescence. In compiling its tax return for the year ended 31 March 1998, the taxpayer did not add back the adjustment made to the closing stock. The adjust- ment for the return period ended 31 March 1998 was for $730,000 which exceeded the threshold for requiring an acceptable interpretation. Tax law clearly provides that taxpayers must value their closing stock at either cost price, market selling price or replacement price. The taxpayer has valued the closing stock at cost price, and then made an adjustment to this value, resulting in an overall lower value of trading stock. The taxpayer considers that tax law allows for adjustments to trading stock for obsolescence and, accordingly, contends that the adjustment should not be added back for taxation purposes. It is accepted that adjustments can be made to trading stock for obsolescence. However, using a fixed percentage writedown across all closing stock does not fairly reflect the obsolescence of the individual lines of stock. Statute law requires that the basis used must be fair and reasonable and gives guidance in this area on the factors to be consid- ered. Penalty: Even though the taxpayer used what it considered to be the most appropriate method of valuation, it is well established in tax law that such global adjustments to trading stock, resulting in a stock reserve, are not allowable for tax purposes. To reasonably reflect the obsolescence of stock, the taxpayer should have considered the stock items held on a line by line basis. Accordingly, the taxpayer’s tax position does not meet the test of being “about as likely as not correct”. A 20% penalty for an unacceptable interpretation would be imposed on the tax shortfall. Gross carelessness Legislation Section 141C deals with gross carelessness. It states: (1)A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the taxpayer is grossly careless in taking the taxpayer’s tax position (referred to as “gross carelessness”). (2)The penalty payable for gross carelessness is 40% of the resulting tax shortfall. (3)For the purposes of this Part, gross carelessness means doing or not doing something in a way that, in all the circumstances, suggests or implies complete or a high level of disregard for the consequences.” Discussion Gross carelessness is a more serious breach than lack of reasonable care. Gross carelessness will occur if a taxpayer’s behaviour displays a high degree of careless- ness and disregard of consequences. Typically, a high level of carelessness will be characterised by conduct which creates a high risk of a tax shortfall occurring when this risk and its consequences would have been foreseen by a reasonable person in the circumstances. Gross carelessness does not require taxpayers to intend to pay less than is owed, but will require more than mere inadvertence or carelessness. Gross carelessness is a new objective standard. It is something more than a lack of reasonable care but less than evasion in that it does not require the necessary intention to evade. Gross carelessness is similar to recklessness. However, the standard does not consider the knowledge or intent of the taxpayer concerned, but rather whether a reason- able person would have known that there was a high chance that the action or inaction would have resulted in a tax shortfall. Gross carelessness is not tax evasion because the taxpayer may not have the requisite criminal intent (mens rea) to evade. However, such action is more than negligence. Gross carelessness is “the doing of some- thing which in fact involves a risk, whether the doer realises it or not, and the risk being such having regard to all the circumstances, that the taking of that risk would be described as ‘gross carelessness’. from page 17 Example 1 Facts: A taxpayer started up a window cleaning business. She knows that her income from this venture is taxable and, after taking the advice of a tax agent, has set up a cash book system for record- ing the income and expenditure. However, over the year she has neglected on numerous occasions to record her income in the cash book. She could find the time to update her cash book if she was better organised, but felt that personal matters were more important. At year end, before giving her records to the tax agent to prepare her income tax return, she makes a guess as to how much income she has earned and notes the cash book accordingly. As a result of an audit by Inland Revenue, it is ascertained that her income has been substantially understated. Penalty: Although the taxpayer is aware that her business income is taxable, she has not kept suffi- cient records to accurately record the income. The result of not keeping complete records would have been foreseen by a reasonable person in this taxpay- er’s circumstances. The taxpayer has demonstrated such a level of carelessness that it resulted in a high risk of her income being understated. This is a higher breach then failure to take reasonable care as there is clearly a complete disregard for the consequences. She would therefore be charged a 40% penalty for gross carelessness. Note that the taxpayer has not intended to evade paying tax. She has consistently, over the year, neglected to take the necessary steps to ensure that the correct amount of income is returned. Example 2 Facts: During the year a large company spent a substantial amount of money on renovations to part of its premises. At year end, the company’s in-house tax accountant claimed all of the expenditure as deductible repairs and maintenance. The accountant was unsure whether all of the items were deductible for tax purposes, but did not bother to review the account to ascertain which items of expenditure were of a capital nature and therefore not deduct- ible. As a result of an IRD audit, a substantial tax shortfall was revealed. Penalty: Any reasonable person in this same situation would have analysed the repairs and expenditure account to ensure that capital items had not been claimed. In neglecting to do so, the company has shown complete disregard for the consequences. Therefore the penalty of 40% for gross carelessness is imposed. The company had not intended to evade paying tax. However, the accountant neglected to take the necessary steps to ensure that the correct amount of income was returned. This is a more serious breach than not taking reasonable care. Example 3 Facts: A company rents some space in a neighbour- ing warehouse as its existing premises are no longer adequate owing to the increase in business. The owner of the company oversees the year end stock take, as he has done for many years. He forgets to include the stock held off premises. Before completing his records to give to his ac- countant, the manager recalls that his stock take figure is not correct. He is aware that he should have accurate figures available for the accountant but considers that he is too busy to take the time to check the stock held off-site. He makes a guess at the value of the stock in the other building and includes this in the total stock take figure. As a result of an IRD audit, a substantial tax shortfall which is caused by the inaccurate stock figures is ascertained. Penalty: The taxpayer did not intentionally set out to underestimate his tax liability. However, he was grossly careless in not ensuring that the stock take figures were accurate. A reasonable person would have foreseen the results of inadequate attention to ensuring the accuracy of the stock take figures. He has displayed a high level of disregard for the consequences. Accordingly, a 40% penalty for gross carelessness is imposed. Abusive tax position Legislation Section 141D introduces a penalty for abusive tax positions. A taxpayer who has a shortfall for a return period will be liable to pay a shortfall penalty for abusive tax position if all of the following apply: •The tax shortfall exceeded $10,000. •The tax position taken is an unacceptable interpretation. •It has a dominant purpose of avoiding of tax. The penalty payable is 100% of the resulting tax shortfall. Purpose statement The purpose statement is relatively new to tax law. It is intended to give the judiciary, taxpayers, tax advisers and Inland Revenue officers further guidance on what Parliament intended to achieve. Section 141D(1) introduces the purpose statement for ‘abusive tax positions’. It states: The purpose of this section is to penalise those taxpayers who, having applied an unacceptable interpretation to a tax law, have entered into or acted in respect of arrangements or interpreted or applied tax laws with a dominant purpose of taking, or of supporting the taking of, tax positions, that reduce or remove tax liabilities or give tax benefits. continued on page 20 Discussion The objective of an avoidance penalty is to deter taxpay- ers from entering into arrangements which have a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. Such arrangements are a risk to the revenue base. They may rely on literal interpretations of the law but abuse the law’s intent. It is intended that the penalty for abusive tax positions may apply not only when an anti-avoidance provision is invoked, but also when other provisions have been applied. This is important to ensure that identical conduct is not penalised differently solely because taxpayers are of different levels of sophistication or because Inland Revenue is not required to resort to an anti-avoidance provision. Before a penalty for an abusive tax position can be imposed, three criteria must be met: •The position taken must be an unacceptable interpre- tation. •It must involve over $10,000 tax. •There must be a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. Unacceptable interpretation The unacceptable interpretation standard will be applied to determine if a penalty is warranted. The standard recognises that there are many uncertainties in law and that more than one valid interpretation of that law is possible. In determining whether an interpretation is unaccept- able, all provisions of the relevant legislation, including the potential application of any general or specific anti- avoidance provisions, will be considered. Therefore, it can not be argued that a tax position or interpretation is acceptable in terms of a particular legislative provision irrespective of the operation of other provisions such as general anti-avoidance provisions. This is a scheme and purpose view of the tax legislation. (This is discussed under the section on Unacceptable Interpretation.) Threshold Section 141D(4) states: This section applies to a taxpayer only if - ... (b)The tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer’s tax position exceeds $10,000. Accordingly, this threshold differs from the threshold for an unacceptable interpretation. The 1% materiality threshold which applies to the “unacceptable interpreta- tion” penalty does not apply to the “abusive tax posi- tion” penalty. Dominant purpose of avoiding tax Section 141D(7) states: For the purposes of this Part, an ‘abusive tax position’ means a tax position that, -... (b)Viewed objectively, the taxpayer takes - (i)In respect, or as a consequence, of an arrangement that is entered into with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly; or (ii)Where the tax position does not relate to an arrange- ment described in subparagraph (i), with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indi- rectly.” Dominant purpose The Act refers to a dominant “purpose”. This differs from section BB 9 of the Income Tax Act 1994, which refers to “its purpose or effect is tax avoidance”. Inland Revenue considers that nothing turns on the distinction between “purpose or effect” and “purpose”. In the context of section BB 9, case law certainly supports this view (Tayles v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1982\] 2 NZLR 726 ,734). It could be considered that the term “purpose” is more of a “subjective” term than that of “effect”, which is an objective term. However, the new legislation is explicit that the test of whether an arrangement has the domi- nant purpose of avoiding tax is an objective one 1 . It is also firmly established in case law that the purpose of an arrangement is to be argued objectively for section BB 9: Purpose is something to be decided not subjectively in terms of motive but objectively by reference to the arrangement itself 2 . It is well established that the approach is objective not subjective; the taxpayer’s motives are irrelevant, purpose and effect being gathered from the arrangement itself 3 : Avoiding tax The concept of “avoiding tax” encompasses the deferral of tax and the claiming of tax credits. Inland Revenue considers that “avoiding tax” would incorporate “tax avoidance” as defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Facts to consider The commentary to the bill states that: indicators of a dominant purpose of avoiding tax may include artificiality, contrivance, circularity of funding, concealment of information and non-availability of evidence, and spurious interpretations of tax laws. Situations which do not involve anti-avoidance provisions A taxpayer may be reassessed under a substantive provision of the Inland Revenue Acts rather than an anti-avoidance provision. This does not mean that the penalty for an abusive tax position cannot apply. Section 141D(6) states: A taxpayer’s tax position may be an abusive tax position if the tax position is an incorrect tax position under, or as a result of either or both of - 1.“Abusive tax position” means a tax position that, viewed objectively, the taxpayer takes ... with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly. 2.Challenge v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1986\] 2 NZLR 513,533 (CA) 3.Hadlee v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1989\] 2 NZLR 447,466 (HC) from page 19 continued on page 21 (a)A general tax law, or (b)A specific or general anti-avoidance tax law. The commentary to the bill stated The penalty for abusive tax positions will apply not only in situations where a general or specific anti-avoidance provision is invoked but also where other provisions have been applied. The need for the Commissioner to rely explicitly on an anti- avoidance provision does not necessarily indicate that the tax position is more deserving of a high penalty than an aggres- sive interpretation intended to avoid tax but which fails under another provision. Accordingly, the penalty can apply even when an anti- avoidance provision has not been used. Evasion or similar act Legislation Section 141E of the TAA imposes a penalty for evasion if a taxpayer takes any of the following actions: •evades the assessment or payment of tax on his or her own behalf or on behalf of any another person •knowingly applies or permits someone else to apply a deduction or withholding of tax which had to be paid to the Commissioner •knowingly does not make a deduction or withholding of tax which had to be made; •obtains a refund or payment of tax knowing that he or she is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment •enables another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not entitled to the refund or payment. The penalty payable for evasion or similar act is 150% of the resulting tax shortfall. Discussion Wilful or knowing breach of an obligation is the most serious form of non-compliance. The civil penalty for tax evasion has been rewritten to apply generically to all revenue tax types. Tax evasion involves a deliberate attempt to cheat the revenue. This may include a taxpayer obtaining refunds (tax credits, rebates) knowing that he or she is not lawfully entitled to them and knowingly not accounting for tax deductions to the Commissioner. The category for “evasion or similar act” is not signifi- cantly different from the previous penal tax provision for evasion. The main difference lies in the standard of proof. The difference between the standard of “on balance of probabilities” and “beyond reasonable doubt”, is explained under “Onus and standard of proof” on page 34 of this TIB. Under section 149(5), if a shortfall penalty has been imposed on a taxpayer for taking an incorrect tax position, the Commissioner may not subsequently prosecute the taxpayer for taking the incorrect tax position. However, prosecution does not preclude the Commissioner from imposing the civil penalty for evasion. Example 1 Facts: A salary and wage earner who enjoys working with cars has trained as a mechanic. In the evenings and on weekends he undertakes mechani- cal repairs for customers that he has gained through advertising in the local paper. The taxpayer knows that the money he earns from his private business is taxable but he has no inten- tion of returning the income. To this end, he asks his customers to pay him in cash. He puts this cash into a separate bank account under a false name. At year end, he prepares his income tax return omit- ting all mention of his income earned from his mechanical repair business. Penalty: This taxpayer deliberately attempted to cheat the revenue. He is fully aware that this income is taxable and has taken steps to conceal the income from Inland Revenue. Penalty of 150% for tax evasion is imposed. In addition, he is liable to prosecution for knowingly making a false return with the intention to evade tax. However, prosecu- tion must be taken before a shortfall penalty is imposed. Example 2 Facts: A taxpayer owns a business which mainly has cash sales. During the year he took $100 per week from the till for personal use. He banked the remainder in the business bank account. The taxpayer’s accountant prepares his income tax returns. At year end the taxpayer told his account- ant that all the money earned from the business was deposited into the business bank account and none was taken for private use. The taxpayer knew that his income would be understated in his tax return. Penalty: The taxpayer deliberately lied to his accountant to get his income understated and his tax liability reduced. He is liable for a penalty of 150% for tax evasion. In addition, he is liable to prosecution for knowingly filing a false return with the intention of evading tax. However, prosecution must be taken before a shortfall penalty is imposed. Example 3 Facts: The taxpayer operates a small business. During the year he has materials and goods deliv- ered to his home. He falsifies details on the invoices to show the delivery details to be his business premises and claims the expenditure as deductible for tax purposes. Inland Revenue undertakes an investigation and the auditor confirms that the expenditure claimed using the altered invoices was private expenditure. Penalty: The taxpayer has deliberately altered invoices to make them appear to be for business expenditure. He is liable to the 150% penalty for continued on page 22 Legislation Section 141G provides that a shortfall penalty imposed on a taxpayer under sections 141A to 141E may be reduced if the taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure of all details relating to the tax shortfall. The disclosure must be made either before the taxpayer receives the first notice that an audit or investigation is to be under- taken, or after the first notification but before the audit or investigation starts. The Commissioner may at any time specify the information required for a full volun- tary disclosure and advise the form in which it must be provided The level by which the shortfall penalty is reduced is: •for pre-notification disclosure - 75% •for post-notification disclosure - 40% Discussion Disclosure before notification of an audit The fixed rate for shortfall penalties will be reduced by 75% (reflecting a minimum penalty of 5% for breaches) for full voluntary disclosure before notification of an audit. The reduced penalty for voluntary disclosure before an audit will apply if the disclosure is made before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation. This follows similar procedures already in practice. Notification of a pending audit or investigation will be the date of the written confirmation advising the start of the audit or investigation. In the case of registration checks and other unan- nounced visits, the date of first contact with the taxpayer will be the date of notification. If an investigator is carrying out an audit of one revenue and the taxpayer discloses a discrepancy in another revenue, and the taxpayer has not been notified that the other revenue was going to be audited, then the taxpayer will qualify for the voluntary disclosure before notifica- tion of an audit. Disclosure after notification of an audit A 40 percent shortfall penalty reduction is available for disclosure made after notification of an audit. This reduction will apply if the disclosure is made after the taxpayer is notified of a pending tax audit or investiga- tion, but before the start of the audit or investigation. Subsection (4) provides that a taxpayer has been notified of a pending audit or investigation if any of the follow- ing persons have received notification: •the taxpayer •an officer of the taxpayer •a shareholder of the taxpayer (for close companies) •a tax adviser acting for the taxpayer •a partner in a partnership •a person acting for, or on behalf of, or as a fiduciary of the taxpayer. evasion. He is also liable to prosecution for know- ingly making a false return with the intention to evade tax. However, prosecution must be taken before a shortfall penalty is imposed. Officers liable to pay amounts equal to shortfall penalties Legislation Section 141F of the TAA deals with cases involving tax deductions and withholding payments. It provides that officers may be liable to pay a shortfall penalty equal to that which could be incurred by their employer if: •the law requires the employer to deduct or withhold tax and pay it to the Commissioner, •an officer of the employer fails to deduct or withhold the tax, or applies or permits the tax to be used for anything other than payment to the Commissioner. Discussion Section 194 previously imposed penal tax upon an employer or any other person who knowingly permitted a deduction to be applied in any way other than to the Commissioner. This section is now repealed. Section 141F replaces the previous provision and allows a shortfall penalty to be imposed upon the officer responsible. The shortfall penalty imposed would be equal to that which could have been imposed on the taxpayer. Accordingly, the Commissioner has not changed the policy on this offence. It is clear that the person who failed to make and/or account for the deductions would have had to do so knowing that the deductions were to be made or accounted for to the Commissioner. This would usually be a person in a responsible position within the company, such as a director or secretary. It would be very unlikely that a person in a clerical position, merely following instructions from a senior officer, would be accountable for the penalty. Factors affecting level of penalty imposed The amount of shortfall penalty may be adjusted for the following reasons: •voluntary disclosure before or during an audit •disclosure of an unacceptable interpretation at time of filing the return •self-amended returns •obstruction of an Inland Revenue officer during an investigation •temporary shortfall Voluntary disclosure There are two areas of voluntary disclosure: •voluntary disclosure before notification of an audit •voluntary disclosure after notification of an audit. from page 21 Subsection (5) states that a tax audit or investigation starts at the earlier of: 1.the end of the first interview an Inland Revenue officer has with either the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s representative, after the taxpayer receives the notice. 2.the time when: –an Inland Revenue officer inspects the taxpayer’s information (including books or records) after the taxpayer receives notice; and –the taxpayer is notified of the inspection. Any disclosure made by a taxpayer during an unan- nounced visit would be a disclosure made after notifica- tion of an audit and a 40% reduction in the shortfall penalty will be allowed. Disclosure by a subsidiary of a company An audit of a parent company, or a subsidiary of that company, may necessitate the audit of other subsidiaries in the group. In such cases, disclosure would depend upon which entity had been notified. If the parent company had received notification that the audit was restricted to that entity, then any disclosure made by the subsidiary is voluntary disclosure before notification of an audit. However, if another company in the group has been notified that the audit is being extended, any disclosure made by that other company would be considered a disclosure after notification of an audit. When a company has a branch or branches, they are considered to have been notified at the same time as the company, as they are part of the company, not separate entities. Methods of making a voluntary disclosure A voluntary disclosure can be made by either visiting, telephoning or writing to Inland Revenue. In addition, specified forms for voluntary disclosure are available from Inland Revenue. Adequate disclosure Disclosure must be full and complete. This does not mean disclosing the discrepancies to the last dollar, but does require providing enough information to enable the Commissioner to make an assessment. It is not up to the Commissioner to elicit the required information from the taxpayer. It is the taxpayer’s responsibility to have the necessary accounts and returns prepared. If a taxpayer is not able to make a full disclosure at the first point of contact with Inland Revenue, he or she may still make the disclosure and advise the Commis- sioner when the remaining information will be pro- vided. A time limit will be imposed for providing the remaining information. To satisfy full and complete disclosure, the following minimum details must be provided: •taxpayer’s details (name, trade name, IRD number, address, date of birth, contact telephone and contact times) •an explanation as to why the errors or omissions occurred •enough information to enable an assessment to be made •a declaration and signature by taxpayer. Section 146(2) states that the Commissioner must not publish the names of taxpayers who make a voluntary disclosure before notification of an audit, if they give complete information and full particulars of: •the relevant offence; or •their tax position giving rise to the relevant shortfall penalty. In addition, a taxpayer who makes a voluntary disclo- sure will not be prosecuted. Self-amended returns Self-amended returns will be treated as a form of voluntary disclosure if they are made before notification of an audit. Accordingly, if the tax shortfall being amended is due to a culpable act, the taxpayer will receive a reduced penalty in accordance with a volun- tary disclosure made before notification of an audit. If a self-amended return is made after notification of an audit but before the start of the audit the taxpayer must provide sufficient details, as is required for voluntary disclosure after notification of an audit, before the amended return will be treated as a voluntary disclosure and any reduction made to the shortfall penalty. If a taxpayer files an amended return after the audit has already started, it will not be treated as a form of voluntary disclosure. For income tax purposes, if an amended return is made before the earlier of the issuing of an assessment for the tax or the due date for payment of the tax, no penalty will be imposed as there will be no tax shortfall. In addition, if a tax shortfall is corrected in a later return period from that in which the original tax position was taken and before notification of an audit, it will be treated as a temporary tax shortfall. Temporary tax shortfalls are discussed later. Disclosure at time of filing Legislation Section 141H provides that: •A shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer for having an unacceptable interpretation or having taken an abusive tax position may be reduced if adequate disclosure of the tax position is made at the time of filing the tax return. •The level by which a shortfall penalty is to be reduced for adequate disclosure is 75%. •The Commissioner may at any time specify the type of information required for adequate disclosure and the form in which the information must be provided. continued on page 24 (2)A person who is convicted of an offence under subsection (1) is liable— (a)The first time the person is convicted of that type of offence, to a fine not exceeding $25,000; and (b)on every other occasion the person is convicted of the same type of offence, to a fine not exceeding $50,000. Discussion Taxpayers must co-operate with Inland Revenue, to the extent required by the tax laws, in providing informa- tion and facilitating investigations. Obstruction is a term used to describe situations in which a taxpayer takes steps to prevent the Commissioner from discover- ing part or all of the deficient tax in an audit. Differences between civil obstruction and criminal obstruction For both civil and criminal obstruction the onus of proof rests with the Commissioner. However, the standard of proof varies. The standard of proof for civil obstruction is the civil standard of “on balance of probabilities”. This requires the Commissioner to show that it was more than probable that the event occurred. The standard of proof for criminal obstruction is “beyond reasonable doubt”. In addition, the civil penalty for obstruction can be applied only if there is a tax shortfall, but a tax shortfall is not necessary for the criminal sanction. Meaning of obstruction The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary definition of obstruction is: The action or an act of obstructing something or someone; the condition of being obstructed; the action of impeding the movement of traffic on a highway. A thing impeding or preventing passage or progress; an obstacle, a blockage Case law In Urlich v Police (1989) 4 CRNZ 144: “the ordinary meaning of “obstruct” is to impede or to make more difficult.....” Accordingly, obstruction occurs when the action or actions make it more difficult for the Commissioner or officer to carry out their lawful duties. Obstruction does not require physical use. In Urlich v Police it was found that “there is no reason why words alone, provided they are uttered in circumstances under which they can be believed, cannot amount to obstruc- tion.” Before obstruction can constitute an offence, the con- duct must be without justification and lawful excuse. This was discussed in the following cases: •Goldsmith v Police (1993) 10 CRNZ 106: “The conduct must be obstructive and without justification or lawful excuse.” •Police v Hardaker \[1959\]: “Once a prima facie case of obstruction is made out against a defendant, the onus lies on him to satisfy the Court that his conduct was with lawful justification or excuse.” Discussion A taxpayer can disclose the tax position taken in his or her tax return at the time of filing. Provided the disclo- sure is adequate and the position taken is not frivolous, the taxpayer would be eligible for a reduced penalty if the position is later found to be an unacceptable inter- pretation. For disclosure to be effective, the taxpayer must provide full and relevant arguments for the tax position taken. The level by which a shortfall penalty is to be reduced for adequate disclosure at the time of filing is 75%. Adequate disclosure at time of filing Section 141H(3) states that the Commissioner may from time to time specify the type of information required for adequate disclosure. Disclosure must be made on a specified form. The following information will be required in order to satisfy the requirement of adequate disclosure: •taxpayer’s details (name, trade name, IRD number, address, date of birth, contact telephone and contact times) •overview of the position taken •interpretation of case law on the subject, contents of any tax opinions, legal articles and related material •any relevant Inland Revenue public ruling •a calculation, if necessary, to show the position and how it was arrived at •a declaration and signature by taxpayer. The disclosure form must be filed with the return in which the particular tax position has been taken. E-File If the tax return is filed electronically, the specified form will need to be sent to Inland Revenue separately. Obstruction Legislation The new penalty provisions contain both a civil penalty and criminal penalty for obstruction. Section 141K provides for the civil penalty for obstruction as follows: (1)A shortfall penalty payable by the taxpayer under any of sections 141A to 141E may be increased by the Commis- sioner if the taxpayer obstructs the Commissioner in determining the correct tax position in respect of the taxpayer’s tax liabilities. (2)The level by which a shortfall penalty may be increased for obstruction is 25%. Section 143H provides for the criminal penalty for obstruction as follows: (1)A person who obstructs the Commissioner or an officer of the Department acting in the lawful discharge of the duties or in the exercise of the Commissioner’s or officer’s powers under a tax law commits an offence against this Act. from page 23 •Stewart v Police \[1961\] NZLR 680: “The appellant in evidence gave no reason for his decision to do what he, in fact, did. He might, for example, have given evidence of some reasonable excuse such as sudden illness or the like.” Accordingly, it is clear from case law that two factors must be present before a penalty can be imposed for obstruction. First, the conduct must be obstructive and second, it must be without justification or lawful excuse. Actions that are not obstruction A taxpayer is entitled to: •exercise legal rights (Accordingly, obstruction does not include asserting the right to legal privilege.) •contest an assessment (The obstruction offences are not intended to discourage taxpayers from using legal processes in the course of any disagreement with Inland Revenue.) •maintain an opinion contrary to that of Inland Revenue. Examples of obstruction Examples may include: •refusing reasonable access to business premises •destroying relevant records •successful prosecution of a taxpayer for a section 17 offence of failing to provide records or information requested •lying at an interview •falsifying details in a statement of assets and liabili- ties (IR 110) •deliberate delay by the taxpayer to frustrate Inland Revenue enquiries. Agents and other third parties The civil penalty for obstruction will not apply to agents and third parties. For example, when an agent obstructs an Inland Revenue officer, the civil penalty for obstruc- tion cannot be applied, as it must be the taxpayer who obstructs and there must be a resulting tax shortfall. If agents and third parties obstruct, the criminal offence of obstruction may be used, resulting in prosecution and possible fines. Temporary shortfalls Legislation Section 141I deals with temporary shortfalls. A tax shortfall is a temporary tax shortfall if all of these conditions are met: •It has been permanently reversed or corrected in an earlier or later return period, so that the taxpayer pays the correct amount of tax or calculates and returns the correct tax liability. •No tax shortfall will arise in a later return period for a similar item or matter. •No arrangement exists in any return period which has the purpose or effect of creating a further related tax deferral or advantage. •The tax shortfall was permanently reversed or cor- rected before the taxpayer was first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation. If a shortfall is temporary the shortfall penalty must be reduced; it will be 75% of the penalty that would otherwise apply. Discussion This section is restricted to tax shortfalls which have been permanently reversed or corrected in a return period before notification of an audit or investigation. The definition applies provided that no arrangement exists in any return period which has the purpose or effect of creating a further related tax deferral or advantage. Example A property developer enters into an unconditional sale and purchase contract to sell a townhouse. The purchaser pays a deposit to the property developer on 1 June 1997, with the balance being due when the purchaser takes actual possession of the townhouse three months later. The property developer is registered for GST on an invoice basis and files two-monthly GST returns. She returns the amount of the deposit received in the GST return for the period ended 30 June and the balance of the sale price in the GST return for the period ended 31 October. However, the time of supply took place when the contract became unconditional and the deposit was received, so she must return the entire amount of the sale price in the GST period ended 30 June. This results in a tax shortfall of $15,000. As the matter relates to an issue of interpretation and the amount is over the specified threshold, she must have an acceptable interpretation for the position taken. Assuming that she doesn’t have an acceptable interpretation, she would be liable to a shortfall penalty of 20% of the tax shortfall. However, the tax shortfall qualifies as a temporary shortfall because it has been corrected in a later return period before an audit and there is no arrangement to reverse the correction out in a later period. Accordingly, the shortfall penalty imposed would be 5%. continued on page 26 (return) for the same return period, the credit will be offset against the debit for the purposes of calculating the tax shortfall. •If a debit adjustment is made to a taxpayer’s return and that adjustment causes a corresponding credit adjustment in an associated person’s return for the same return period, the resulting refund or increased refund will be offset against the debit. •The Commissioner may treat companies in a wholly- owned group as a single taxpayer when determining a tax shortfall. •If two tax types have different return periods (for example, income tax and GST), the Commissioner may treat one of the tax types as having the same return period as the other. •Similar or identical tax shortfalls will be aggregated and deemed to be one tax shortfall. •If an adjustment to a return increases the taxpayer’s assessable income under section EC 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, and the taxpayer elects to allocate that increased income to the year of adjustment and any other income year, the total tax shortfall will be computed for the year of adjustment when calculating the penalty. •The tax effect of a tax position taken by a taxpayer in a return period is to be calculated using the taxpayer’s marginal tax rates for that return period. •If a taxpayer has no tax to pay in the return period, the rate of tax that would apply is the lowest marginal rate that would apply to the return period if the taxpayer did have tax to pay. •For the purposes of this section, “tax” does not include a civil penalty. Discussion Before a shortfall penalty can be imposed, there must be a tax shortfall. In calculating this shortfall, adjustments will be offset between wholly-owned group companies and associated persons, and within the same tax type on a return basis. This section also provides that offsets will be allowed across different tax types if these two conditions are met: •An adjustment to one tax type has a direct effect on another tax type. •The effect on the other tax type results in a credit available to be refunded. The amount of the offset will be the lesser of the amount of the refund and the credit available as a direct result of the adjustment. Taxpayers in a loss situation will still be subject to shortfall penalties, but they may elect to pay those penalties by offsetting an equivalent amount of tax losses in accordance with section IG 9A of the Income Tax Act 1994. To calculate the equivalent amount of tax losses, the lowest marginal tax rates are used. Limit to reduction Legislation Section 141J sets out the limit on reducing a shortfall penalty. When a taxpayer who is liable to a shortfall penalty makes a voluntary disclosure, and the penalty is for a temporary tax shortfall, the shortfall penalty will be reduced only once. This means the total reduction will be 75%. Discussion Taxpayers may make a voluntary disclosure of a tempo- rary shortfall. The fixed rate for shortfall penalties will be reduced by 75% for voluntary disclosures made before notification of any pending tax audit or investigation. This reduction is consistent with the reduction offered when the tax shortfall is temporary. However, a taxpayer will not receive a reduction for both a temporary shortfall and voluntary disclosure before an audit. In such a case the total penalty reduc- tion will still be 75%. Disputes resolution A taxpayer has the right to disagree with the Commis- sioner’s decision to impose shortfall penalties. The Commissioner will raise the issue of shortfall penalties as soon as practicable, which in most cases will be at the time the substantive issues are being discussed. A Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) will be issued before any assessment or adjustment of shortfall penalties unless there is full agreement with the taxpayer before the issue of the NOPA or a court has directed the adjustment. If the taxpayer cannot resolve the issues in the NOPA with the Inland Revenue officer who initially dealt with the case, the matter will be referred to Inland Revenue’s Adjudication Unit for further consideration before any assessments are issued. A taxpayer who still disagrees with the assessment has the normal rights of review through the courts. Calculating shortfall penalties Legislation Section 141 deals with calculating tax shortfalls. Here is a summary of its provisions: •A tax shortfall is calculated each time a taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty. •A separate tax shortfall calculation is required for each return period and for each tax type. •Each tax deemed to be another tax is a separate tax type. •The tax shortfalls in the return will be calculated taking any overstatement into account on a pro rata basis. •If a debit adjustment in a tax type (return) results in a corresponding credit adjustment in another tax type from page 25 Example An individual taxpayer files a tax return which shows tax losses of $20,000. An audit of the taxpayer establishes that a deduction of $10,000 was not deductible for tax purposes, so there is a tax shortfall of $2,400. A penalty of $480 for lack of reasonable care is imposed, being 20% of the tax shortfall. The taxpayer still has $10,000 losses available, so he may elect to use some of these losses to pay the shortfall penalty of $480. The taxpayer would need to forfeit $2,000 of losses. ($480 ÷ 0.24 = $2,000). 0.24 is the lowest marginal tax rate that applies - 24 cents in the dollar. A taxpayer who has no losses carried forward from prior years, but who expects to have losses in the current year, can elect to use those losses, even though the final determination of the losses for that current year has not been established. Section IG 9A(2) provides that if the taxpayer does incur sufficient losses for that current income tax year, then the shortfall penalties will be deemed to have been paid by the due date. However, if at the end of the income year the taxpayer does not incur sufficient losses, late payment penalties and interest will be imposed on the tax shortfall penalty that should have been absorbed by the losses. A tax shortfall may result in adjustments across varying tax types, which are likely to have different return periods. In such cases, the Commissioner may deem one tax type to have the same return period as another. An example would be when a taxpayer’s income tax return period ends on 31 March, and the GST period spanning that date is 1 March to 30 April. In this case, the Commissioner may decide to treat both tax types as having the 31 March return period. The two examples that follow demonstrate how the penalty offset applies. The shortfall penalty categories used in these examples have been applied for calcula- tion purposes only. Example 1 This example includes calculations for shortfall penalties, late payment penalties and interest. A taxpayer is audited as follows: •Income tax - year ended 31 March 1998 •GST - 6 two-monthly periods from the period ended 31 May 1997 •FBT - four quarters from the quarter ended 30 June 1997 Several shortfalls were found in all three revenues. Because of the interrelationship between GST and income tax, and between FBT and income tax, a credit adjustment occurred in the income tax calculation. In the following calculations, the shortfalls have been converted into tax shortfalls. Shortfall penalties Income tax The following income tax shortfalls attract shortfall penalties: Gross carelessness$12,339.364%40%$4,834.73 Lack of reasonable care$36,442.7912%20% $7,252.10 Lack of reasonable care - temporary shortfall 4 $259,247.3484% 5% $12,691.17 Total$308,029.49 $24,778.00 Less adjustments for GST and FBT assessed ($5,858.64) Tax shortfall$302,170.85 1 Calculating tax shortfall: any credits that became available to the taxpayer as a result of the audit must be taken into account. Therefore the tax shortfall equals the total tax discrepancy less the tax value of any credits ascertained. 2 Calculating percentage of total: percentage of total is calculated on the total tax discrepancy before the credit adjustments are deducted as follows: 12,339.36 ÷ 308,029.49 = 4% 36,442.79 ÷ 308,029.49 = 12% 259,247.34 ÷ 308,029.49 = 84% 3 Calculating the penalty: to calculate the total, the adjusted tax shortfall is used \[as the denominator\] to obtain the amount of penalty attributed to each tax shortfall: 302,170.85 x 4% = 12,086.83 x 40%=4,834.73 302,170.85 x 12% = 36,260.50 x 20%=7,252.10 302,170.85 x 84% = 253,823.51 x 5%=12,691.17 Total shortfall penalty=24,778.00 4 Calculating temporary shortfall: Penalty rate for temporary shortfall is 75% of the standard rate for a culpable act. In this example there is a penalty for lack of reasonable care, but the tax shortfall was temporary. The lack of reasonable care penalty (20%) is therefore reduced to 5%. Goods and services tax The taxpayer did not take reasonable care in calculating the GST liability, so there is a 20% shortfall penalty. The following tax shortfalls were established: 31 May 1997$3,379.5720%$675.91 31 Jul 1997$3,379.5720%$675.91 30 Sept 1997$3,379.5720%$675.91 31 Oct 1997$3,379.5720%$675.91 31 Jan 1998$3,379.5720%$675.91 31 Mar 1998 $3,379.57 20% $675.91 Total$20,277.42$4,055.46 Fringe benefit tax The taxpayer did not take reasonable care in calculating the FBT liability, so there is a 20% shortfall penalty. The following tax shortfalls were established: continued on page 28 Interest Income tax Interest will be calculated from the time the tax shortfall was originally due (7 February 1999) until the date of the amended Notice of Assessment (30 November 1999) - a total of 296 days. The amount of interest shown on the amended notice of assessment would be as follows: $302,170.85 x 296 x 12% = $29,405.77 365 In this example the taxpayer was allowed two months in which to pay the tax shortfall, interest and penalties. The taxpayer did not pay within this time so interest continues to accrue from the date the amended Notice of Assessment is issued (30 No- vember 1999) to the date payment is made. Calcula- tions for the various periods are as follows: –1 December 1999 to 30 January 2000 (61 days): $302,170.85 x 61 x 12% = $6,059.97 365 –1 January 2000 to 27 February 2000 (28 days): $334,296.29 x 28 x 12% = $3,160.21 365 –28 February 2000 to 30 March 2000 (31 days): $350,162.21 x 31 x 12% = $3,568.78 365 –31 March 2000 to 15 April 2000 (16 days): $357,165.45 x 16 x 12% = $1,878.79 365 Therefore total interest calculated would be as follows: 7 February 1999 to 30 November 1999$29,405.77 1 December 1999 to 30 January 2000$6,059.97 31 January 2000 to 27 February 2000$3,160.21 28 February 2000 to 30 March 2000$3,568.78 31 March 2000 to 15 April 2000 $1,878.79 Total$44,073.52 The taxpayer’s statement of account issued on 15 April 2000 would look like this: 30/11/99Shortfall$302,170.85$302,170.85 30/11/99Shortfall penalty$24,778.00$326,948.85 31/1/20005% LPP$16,347.44$343,296.29 28/2/20002% LPP$6,865.92$350,162.21 31/3/20002% LPP$7,003.24$357,165.45 15/4/2000Interest$44,073.52$401,238.97 Goods and services tax Interest is calculated on each period up to the date of the amended notice of assessment as follows: –For the period ended 31 May 1997 the original due date was 30 June 1997. From 1 July 1997 to 30 November 1999 is 883 days. $3,379.57 x 883 x 12% = $ 981.09 365 30 Jun 1997$12,722.0620%$2,544.41 30 Sept 1997$12,722.0620% $2,544.41 31 Dec 1997$12,722.0620%$2,544.41 31 Mar 1998$12,722.06 20% $2,544.41 Total$50,888.24$10,177.64 Summary of shortfall penalties Total shortfall penalties incurred by the taxpayer are as follows: Income tax$24,788.00 Goods and services tax$4,055.48 Fringe benefit tax$10,177.64 Total$39,011.12 Late payment penalties Income tax Amount of tax shortfall$302,170.85 Amount of shortfall penalty$24,778.00 The original due date for the 1998 income tax period is 7 February 1999. The amended notice of assessment is dated 30 November 1999, and it sets a new due date of 30 January 2000. Assuming that, as at 15 April 2000, the taxpayer has not paid the tax shortfall or the shortfall penalties, the late payment penalty would be calculated as follows: 30/11/99Shortfall$302,170.85$302,170.85 30/11/99Shortfall penalty$24,778.00$326,948.85 31/1/20005% LPP$16,347.44$343,296.29 28/2/20002% LPP$6,865.92$350,162.21 31/3/20002% LPP$7,003.24$357,165.45 Goods and services tax For this example, late payment penalty has been calculated for the period ended 31 May 1997 only. The calculations for other periods are similar. Tax shortfall attributed to each period$3,379.57 Shortfall penalty attributed to each period$675.91 The amended notice of assessment is dated 30 No- vember 1999, and it sets a new due date of 30 Janu- ary 2000. Assuming that, as at 15 April 2000, the taxpayer has not paid the tax shortfall or the shortfall penalties, the late payment penalty is calculated as follows: 30/11/99Shortfall$3,379.57$3,379.57 30/11/99Shortfall penalty$675.91$4,055.48 31/1/20005% LPP$202.77$4,258.25 28/2/20002% LPP$85.16$4,343.41 31/3/20002% LPP$86.86$4,430.27 Fringe benefit tax In this example the FBT shortfall and associated shortfall penalties were paid by the new due date of 30 January 2000. Accordingly, no late payment penalties would be imposed. from page 27 –For the period ended 31 July 1997 the original due date was 31 August 1997. From 1 September 1997 to 30 November 1999 is 821 days. $3,379.57 x 821 x 12% = $ 912.20 365 –For the period ended 30 September 1997 the original due date was 31 October 1997. From 1 November 1997 to 30 November 1999 is 760 days. $3,379.57 x 760 x 12% = $ 844.42 365 –For the period ended 30 November 1997 the original due date was 15 January 1998. From 16 January 1998 to 30 November 1999 is 684 days. $3,379.57 x 684 x 12% = $ 759.98 365 –For the period ended 31 January 1998 the original due date was 28 February 1998. From 1 March 1998 to 30 November 1999 is 640 days. $3,379.57 x 640 x 12% = $ 711.09 365 –For the period ended 31 March 1998 the original due date was 30 April 1998. From 1 May 1998 to 30 November 1999 is 579 days. $3,379.57 x 579 x 12% = $643.32 365 Total interest = $4,852.10 For this example, further interest has been calcu- lated on the period ended 31 May 1997 only. The calculations for other periods are similar. The taxpayer’s Notice of Assessment was issued on 30 November 1997, and allowed the taxpayer until 30 January 1998 to pay the tax shortfall, interest and penalties. However, the taxpayer did not pay until 15 April 2000, so interest continued to accrue from the date of the amended notice of assessment (30 November 1999) until the date payment is made. The calculations are as follows: –1 December 1999 - 30 January 2000 (61 days): $3,379.57 x 61 x 12% = $67.77 365 –31 January 2000 - 27 February 2000 (28 days): $4,258.25 x 28 x 12% = $39.20 365 –28 February 2000 - 30 March 2000 (31 days): $4,343.25 x 31 x 12% = $44.26 365 –31 March 2000 - 15 April 2000 (16 days): $4,430.27 x 16 x 12% = $23.30 365 Therefore total interest calculated for the period ended 31 May 1997 would be as follows: 30 June 1997 to 30 November 1999$ 981.09 1 December 1999 to 30 January 2000$67.77 31 January 2000 to 27 February 2000$39.20 28 February 2000 to 30 March 2000$44.26 31 March 2000 to 15 April 2000 $23.30 Total$1,155.62 The taxpayer’s statement of account for the May 1997 period will look like this: 15/4/2000Interest$44,073.52$401,238.97 30/11/99Shortfall$3,379.57$3,379.57 30/11/99Shortfall penalty$675.91$4,055.48 31/1/20005 % LPP$202.77$4,258.25 28/2/20002 % LPP$85.16$4,343.41 31/3/20002 % LPP$86.86$4,430.27 15/4/2000Interest$1,155.62$5,585.89 Fringe benefit tax The calculation that applied for GST will also apply to each FBT quarter. Interest will be calculated on each quarterly shortfall from the date the tax was originally due to the date of the amended notice of assessment, and then on the account balance including shortfall penalty and late payment penalty (but not on any previous interest charged) through to the date of payment. Only interest has been calculated in this case. Shortfall attributed to each quarter = $12,722.06 Interest calculated on each period up to the date of the amended notice assessment is as follows: –Period ended 30 June 1997 (original due date 20 July 1997). From 21 July 1997 to 30 Novem- ber 1999 = 863 days. $12,722.06 x 863 x 12% = $3,609.57 365 –Period ended 30 September 1997 (original due date 20 October 1997). From 21 October 1997 to 30 November 1999 = 771 days. $12,722.06 x 771 x 12% = $3,224.78 365 –Period ended 31 December 1997 (original due date 20 January 1998). From 21 January 1998 to 30 November 1999 = 679 days. $12,722.06 x 679 x 12% = $2,839.98 365 –Period ended 31 March 1998 (original due date 20 April 1998). From 21 April 1998 to 30 No- vember 1999 = 589 days. $12,722.06 x 589 x 12% = $2,463.54 365 Total interest = 12,137.87 In this example the FBT shortfall and related shortfall penalties were paid by the new due date of 30 January 2000. Accordingly, no further interest is accrued. continued on page 30 Therefore, after considering the culpability resulting from the partnership shortfall, the amount of shortfall is then allocated to the partners and the tax shortfall ascertained. Shortfall penalties are then imposed on the individual partners based on each individual partner’s tax shortfall. As a result of the audit of the partnership the following shortfalls have been ascertained and are liable to penalty: Year ended 31 March 1999 Lack of reasonable care: The partnership shortfall ascertained is $2,955, so the share of shortfall allocated to each partner is $1,477.50 (50% of total shortfall). Year ended 31 March 2000 Lack of reasonable care: The partnership shortfall ascertained is $23,140, so the share of shortfall allocated to each partner is $11,570 (50% of total shortfall). Unacceptable interpretation 5 : The partnership shortfall ascertained is $33,634, so the share of shortfall allocated to each partner is $16,817. Individual partners As a direct result of the audit of the company and partnership the partners have incurred tax short- falls. The shortfalls arose due to the assessing of deemed dividends to the partners in their respective returns. The partners are liable to penalty as follows: Note: for the purpose of the exercise, tax shortfall is calculated at a rate of 33%. Year ended 31 March 1998 Lack of reasonable care: The total deemed dividend allocated to each partner as a result of company audit is $3,407 (50% of deemed dividends disallowed). The tax shortfall allocated to each partner is therefore $1,124.31 Year ended 31 March 1999 Lack of reasonable care: The total deemed dividend allocated to each partner as a result of company audit is $2,804 (50% of deemed dividends disallowed). The tax shortfall allocated to each partner is therefore $925.32. Lack of reasonable care: The partnership shortfall ascertained is $2,954. The share of shortfall allocated to each partner is therefore $1,477 (50% of total shortfall). This means each partner’s tax shortfall is $487.41. 5 When determining whether the shortfall breaches the threshold for requiring an acceptable interpretation, the figure used is the shortfall in the partnership return, not the amount allocated to the original partners. Example 2 This example involves a partnership consisting of two 50/50 partners who also run a company. The partners are the company shareholders, and they do all of their own day to day accounting. At the end of the year they give their paperwork to their account- ant. During the year end meeting with the accountant, the partners neglected to advise the accountant that they sometimes pay personal accounts through the company. The accountant assumed that all accounts paid were company expenses. Inland Revenue audited both the company and the partnership. Company The audit covered the income tax return periods ended 31 March 1998, 31 March 1999 and 31 March 2000. A number of discrepancies were ascertained and culpability has been considered. In the years ended 31 March 1999 and 2000, the taxpayer incurred shortfalls for which Inland Revenue considered shortfall penalties were war- ranted. However, as a result of the audit, credits were ascertained in those years which reduced the tax shortfall to a negative amount. As a result no penalty was imposed for those years. In the following example, the shortfall has been converted into a tax shortfall. 31.3.98 Lack of reasonable care$6,81420%$1,362.80 31.3.99 Lack of reasonable care$5,608Nil Less cr. adjustments($20,428 ) Tax shortfall($14,820) 31.3.2000 Lack of reasonable care$4,000Nil Unacceptable interpretation11,367Nil Less cr.adjustments($17,615) Tax shortfall($2,248) Partnership During the audit of the partnership for the return periods ended 31 March 1999 and 2000, shortfalls were ascertained and penalties imposed. The partnership return for the year ended 31 March 1998 did not require reassessment, but the partners incurred a 1998 shortfall each as a result of the audit of their company. As the partnership is not assessed with tax, the shortfall is allocated to the partners in their respec- tive percentages and at their respective tax rates. from page 29 Year ended 31 March 2000 Lack of reasonable care: The total deemed dividend allocated to each partner as a result of company audit is $2,000 (50% of deemed dividend disallowed). Tax shortfall allo- cated to each partner is therefore $660. Lack of reasonable care: The partnership shortfall ascertained is $23,140. The share of shortfall allocated to each partner is therefore $11,570 (50% of total shortfall), and each partner’s tax shortfall is $3,818.10 Unacceptable interpretation: The partnership shortfall ascertained is $33,634. The share of shortfall allocated to each partner is therefore $16,817. Each partner’s tax shortfall is $5,549.61. Penalties will be calculated for each partner as follows: 31 March 1998 Lack of reasonable care$1,124.3120%$224.86 31 March 1999 Lack of reasonable care$925.3220%$185.06 Lack of reasonable care $487.4120% $97.48 Total penalty$282.54 31 March 2000 Lack of reasonable care$660.0020%$132.00 Lack of reasonable care$3,818.1020%$763.62 Unacceptable interpretation $5,549.61 20%$1,123.10 Total penalty$2,005.54 Summary Total penalty imposed for each partner: Year ended31.3.98$224.86 31.3.99$282.54 31.3.2000$2,005.54 Total penalty$2,512.94 Due dates for paying penalties Legislation These sections set the due dates for paying penalties: 142Late filing penaltylater of 30 days after notification and various dates as set out in legislation 142ATax that is not aat least 30 days after notice penalty (if amountof assessment or reassess- due on a due datement issued is increased) 142BShortfall penaltiesat least 30 days after notice of assessment or reassess- ment issued 142CPayments by officersat least 30 days after notice of assessment or reassess- ment issued 142DRepayment of excesslater of 30 days after the refund or credit of taxdate of notification requiring payment or the date specified in the notice 142EImputation penalty20 June following the end tax and dividend with-of the imputation year holding penalty tax 142EunderestimationTerminal tax date for penalty taxincome year to which unpaid provisional tax relates 142Fdeferrable tax30th day after the last day of the relevant period of deferral Discussion A taxpayer who is charged a shortfall penalty will generally receive a new due date for paying both the penalty and the tax shortfall to which the penalty relates. The exception is if the taxpayer has failed to file a return. However, interest on the unpaid tax will still be charged from the original due date until the date the assessment identifying the shortfall is issued. Criminal penalties Legislation The legislation provides for criminal penalties under the following sections: 143 -Absolute liability offences 143A -Knowledge offences 143B -Evasion or similar offences 143C -Offence for failure of officers of Department to maintain secrecy 143D -Offence for failure of other persons to maintain secrecy 143E -Secrecy requirements where information given by Department 143F -Offence in relation to inquiries 143G -Offence in relation to court orders 143H -Obstruction 145 -Penalties for offences for which no specific penalty imposed 147 -Employees and officers 148 -Aiding or abetting Discussion In current legislation criminal offences and penalties are contained in a number of the Inland Revenue Acts. They duplicate each other and treat similar breaches in an inconsistent manner. In many cases the penalties are ineffective. The new legislation consolidates the criminal offences and standardises the resulting penalties across all revenues. The sanctions for some offences have been increased so they act as a more effective deterrent. A maximum jail continued on page 32 •knowingly provides altered, false, incomplete, or misleading information (including tax returns and tax forms) •knowingly does not account to the Commissioner for an amount of tax deducted or withheld •knowingly does not deduct or withhold tax •knowingly issues two tax invoices (as defined in the GST Act) for the same taxable supply. Several subsections provide that persons or companies are not liable to conviction if they did not hold the information requested, or any failure to make or account for withholding payments was beyond their control. The maximum penalties for conviction under section 143A are: •$25,000 for a first offence •$50,000 for any subsequent offence. However, under subsection (8) the penalty for know- ingly not accounting to the Commissioner for a deduc- tion or withholding payment made is imprisonment for up to five years, and/or a fine of up to $50,000. This applies for each occasion the person is convicted. A taxpayer who makes a deduction but fails to return it to Inland Revenue has committed an offence similar to evasion, and will be penalised accordingly. This offence will only require the proof of knowledge. Evasion or similar offences Section 143B(1) provides that the following are offences: •knowingly not keeping the books and documents that must be kept •knowingly not providing information (including tax returns and tax forms) when required to do so •knowingly providing altered, false, incomplete, or misleading information (including tax returns and tax forms) •knowingly not making a deduction or withholding of tax required to be made •pretending to be another person for any purpose or reason relating to a tax law – – if a person does them for any of these reasons: •to evade the assessment or payment of tax by the person or any other person •to obtain a refund or payment of tax in the knowledge that the person is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment •to enable another person to obtain a refund or pay- ment of tax in the knowledge that the other person is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment. In addition, section 143B(2) provides that a person who evades or attempts to evade the assessment or payment of tax by the person or another person commits an offence. The penalty, if convicted under section 143B is impris- onment for up to five years, and/or a fine of up to $50,000. term of five years may be imposed for evasion, and for most offences a maximum monetary fine of $50,000 may be imposed. While higher sanctions have been introduced, the nature and scope of the offences have not changed signifi- cantly. Tax offences relating to negligence have been repealed as the new shortfall penalties will punish negligent conduct. Criminal offences fall into three broad categories: •absolute liability offences •offences for knowingly failing to comply with an obligation •evasion or similar offences Absolute liability offences Section 143(1) provides that it is offence if a person – •does not keep the books and documents required to be kept by a tax law •does not provide information (including tax returns and tax forms) when required to do so by a tax law •does not apply for registration as required under section 51 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. It is fundamental to the operation of the tax system that taxpayers provide and maintain information. Accord- ingly, failure to keep the books and documents required by a tax law and provide information to the Commis- sioner when required to do so by a tax law are to remain absolute liability offences. The only defence against conviction under the absolute liability offences would be if the person required to provide information, other than tax returns and tax forms, did not have the information in his or her “...knowledge, possession, or control...” However, the obligation always remains with the taxpayer to provide tax returns or tax forms even if the taxpayer has con- tracted with a third party to meet that obligation. The penalty for conviction of an absolute liability offence is: •a maximum of $4,000 for a first offence; •a maximum of $8,000 for a second offence; •a maximum of $12,000 for any subsequent offence. Knowledge offences A person may be convicted for a number of offences for knowingly breaching a tax obligation. Section 143A outlines the knowledge offences. Knowledge offences include instances when a person: •knowingly does not keep the books and documents that must be kept •knowingly does not provide information (including tax returns and tax forms) when required to do so from page 31 Offences relating to court orders Legislation Under section 143G a person who fails to comply with the terms of a Court order made under section 17A commits an offence. Anyone who is convicted of such an offence is liable to the same penalties that may be imposed under section 112 of the District Courts Act 1947. Discussion Section 112(c) of the District Courts Act 1947 sets out the penalty for disobeying the order or direction of any officer of the Court. For each offence, the Judge may sentence the person to prison for up to three months, or to a fine of up to $1,000. Obstruction Section 143H states: a person who obstructs the Commissioner or an officer of the Department acting in the lawful discharge of the duties or in the exercise of the Commissioner’s or officer’s powers under a tax law commits an offence against this Act. The penalty for this offence is a maximum fine of $25,000 for the first offence and $50,000 for subsequent offences. Civil and criminal penalties for obstruction are ex- plained on page 24 of this TIB. Aiding or abetting Section 148 states: (1)A person who aids, abets, incites, or conspires with another person to commit an offence...also commits an offence against this Act. (2)A person convicted of aiding, abetting, inciting, or conspiring...is liable for up to the same maximum fine or term of imprisonment, or both, that could apply to a person who commits the principal offence. A person who aids or abets another to commit an offence will be liable to the same penalty as the person who commits the principal offence. This could result in a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment. Penalties for offences for which no specific penalty is imposed Section 145 imposes fines for offences for which no particular penalty is prescribed. It imposes a fine of up to $15,000 for a first offence and up to $25,000 for any subsequent offences. Other offences The following sections have been carried over from the previous Inland Revenue Acts: Section 143C - Offence for failure of Inland Revenue officers to maintain secrecy Section 143D - Offence for failure of other persons to maintain secrecy Section 143E - Secrecy requirements where information given by Inland Revenue Section 143F - Offence in relation to inquiries Section 144 - Certain offences in relation to Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 Section 150 - Information may charge several offences Section 150A - Information may be laid within 10 years for income tax and GST offences Section 150B - Information may be laid within 4 years for stamp duty and gaming duty offences Section 150C - Authority to lay information Section 150D - Evidence in proceedings for failure to furnish returns and information Section 150E - Evidence inconsistent with instrument not admissible to reduce stamp duty Section 151 - Non-presentation of instrument for stamping Section 152 - Evidence of financial or property transac- tions Publication of names Section 146 specifies that names of the following must be published in the Gazette: •anyone liable to pay a shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position •anyone liable to pay a shortfall penalty for evasion or similar act (including knowingly failing to deduct a tax deduction) •anyone convicted of knowingly failing to account for a tax deduction •anyone convicted of evasion or similar act •anyone convicted of aiding, abetting, inciting or conspiring with another person to evade tax or fail to account for a tax deduction. The section also sets out the details which the Commis- sioner must publish about each person. Employees and officers Legislation Under section 147 a company’s employee, agent, or officer commits an offence if the company commits an offence (the principal offence) and either of the follow- ing apply: •The principal offence was caused by an act or omis- sion of the employee, agent or officer, or through knowledge attributable to him or her. •The principal offence is evasion committed by the employee, agent, or officer. An employee or officer of a company includes anyone who is responsible for undertaking an action on the company’s behalf. If such a person is convicted, he or she is liable for up to the same maximum fine and/or term of imprisonment that apply for committing the principal offence. continued on page 34 •whether or not to make an order requiring the tax- payer to produce the information requested •whether or not the information required is subject to legal professional privilege. Subsection (8) authorises the court to order production of information or any part for review by the Commis- sioner if the court is satisfied that the information is not subject to legal professional privilege, and meets either of these conditions: •It is likely to be relevant for a purpose relating to administering or enforcing any Inland Revenue Act. •It involves a matter connected with another function conferred on the Commissioner. Forms of legal professional privilege other than that established in section 20 may be claimed for tax pur- poses. For example, litigation privilege under which information obtained from third parties for the purposes of litigation against the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is protected from disclosure, even though it does not strictly fall within section 20. Standard of proof When deciding whether or not to grant a court order the court considers whether the request is reasonable. The standard of proof required in proving that the request is reasonable is the balance of probabilities. Interaction with section 17 Section 17 allows the Commissioner to obtain informa- tion which is necessary to administer or enforce the Inland Revenue Acts. This provision will be used first to obtain information. If the information is not forthcom- ing the Commissioner can either prosecute the taxpayer or seek a court order. The imposition of a court order is an additional incentive for the taxpayer to provide the information. A taxpayer who fails to provide the information could be liable to a harsher sanction than that provided by section 17, including a term of impris- onment. Onus and standard of proof Section 149A sets out the standard and onus of proof as follows: PenaltyStandard of proofOnus of proof Civil penalty exceptBalance ofTaxpayer evasion or obstructionprobabilities Civil penalty forBalance ofCommissioner evasion or obstructionprobabilities Criminal penaltiesBeyondCommissioner reasonable doubt Application of CourtBalance ofCommissioner Orders under sec. 17Aprobabilities Civil standard and criminal standard - the difference The difference between the two standards is clearly established in case law. The standard in criminal cases is proof “beyond reasonable doubt” and the civil stand- ard is proof “on the balance of probabilities”. Discussion This section imposes a penalty upon a company’s employee, agent or officer if that person was responsible for the company committing a breach. Such a person is liable to the same fine as any other person who would have committed the offence. The penalty could include a fine or term of imprisonment, or both. For a fine to be imposed upon a company’s employee, agent or officer, the Commissioner would have to prove to the standard of “beyond reasonable doubt” that the person had knowingly or intentionally committed the breach. Obviously, a clerk who follows instructions given by a senior officer and does not know that a breach is being committed would not be liable to a fine or imprisonment if the company was found to have committed a breach. Court orders Legislation Section 17A gives the Commissioner an additional power to obtain information or tax returns which are necessary to administer or enforce the Inland Revenue Acts. If a taxpayer fails to provide information or tax returns requested under section 17, the Commissioner may apply to the District Court for an order requiring the person to produce the information for review. A court order can be used instead of or in conjunction with prosecution for failure to furnish information or a return, or after prosecution has occurred and the information or return is still outstanding. Discussion Application The Commissioner can apply to the District Court for an order asking the person named in the application to provide information or a return. The court will then issue notice to the person, who will have the opportunity to appear at the hearing of the application. On hearing the application, the court may order the person to produce the documents or may vary the order. Appeal rights A taxpayer may appeal the District Court decision to the High Court, as the High Court has jurisdiction over any District Court decisions. Likewise the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction over High Court decisions. Legal professional privilege A court order cannot require the production of docu- ments which are subject to legal professional privilege. This is in line with section 20. In general, claims to legal professional privilege are expected to be deter- mined by the court in the course of hearing the Com- missioner’s application for the court order. Subsection (7) authorises the courts to review the information requested to determine: from page 33 The difference cannot be any more clearly defined than the often quoted exposition by Lord Denning in Miller v Minister of Pensions \[1947\] 2 All ER 372, at 373-374. His lordship began with the criminal standard: That degree is well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry a high degree of probability. Proof beyond reason- able doubt does not mean proof beyond the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour, which can be dismissed with the sentence “of course it is possible but not in the least probable” the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice. In relation to the civil standard, Lord Denning said: That degree is well settled. It must carry a reasonable degree of probability but not so high as is required in a criminal case. If the evidence is such that the tribunal can say: ‘We think it more probable than not’, the burden is discharged, but if the probabilities are equal, it is not. Garrow and McGechan’s Principals of Law of Evidence (1984 7 ed, at p.27) commented: ...in a civil action the standard is merely ‘more likely than not’, permitting a reasonable doubt nevertheless whether the finding is correct; whereas in a criminal case the Court must be ‘sure’ in the sense that no reasonable doubt remains. It is to be emphasised that doubt, to be effective to preclude proof, in a criminal case must be ‘reasonable’, as distinguished from fantastic or purely speculative or irrational. Garrow and McGechan (at p.29) also cautioned on the use of substitutes for beyond reasonable doubt: Epithets such as ‘morally certain’ should not be used. The expression ‘giving the prisoner the benefit of the doubt’ should not be used. It is not a question of giving the benefit of doubt; if the jury are left with any degree of doubt that the prisoner is guilty, then the case has not been proved: R v Onufrejczyk \[1955\] 1 QB 388. Clearly, the standard of proof for imposing a criminal penalty is much higher than that required to impose a civil penalty. Onus of proof When challenging the imposition of a civil penalty, except for evasion or obstruction, the onus of proof will lie with the taxpayer. This is considered reasonable as matters raised by way of defence by a taxpayer are primarily within the knowledge of the taxpayer. In these circumstances it would be extremely difficult for the Commissioner to discharge the onus. Proper record keeping, full and honest disclosure to agents and conformity with the advice of agents are all matters within a taxpayer’s control. However, the onus rests with the Commissioner for civil penalties for evasion and obstruction and all criminal penalties. These are more serious breaches of the Inland Revenue Acts, and before imposing penalties for such breaches the Commissioner should be required to have gathered sufficient evidence to discharge the onus of proof. The Commissioner must also satisfy the onus of proof for court orders. Imposition of civil and criminal penalties Legislation Section 149 sets down the following rules about impos- ing a penalty: •Each time a taxpayer breaches a tax obligation he or she may be liable to a civil penalty, and/or to a criminal penalty (if convicted). •A taxpayer is liable to only one shortfall penalty for each tax shortfall. •If a taxpayer could be liable to more than one shortfall penalty for a tax shortfall, the highest shortfall penalty is to be imposed. •The Commissioner may assess and impose civil penalties after a taxpayer has been prosecuted for an offence under the Act, whether or not the prosecution is successful. •If a shortfall penalty has been imposed on a taxpayer for taking an incorrect tax position, the Commissioner may not subsequently prosecute the taxpayer for taking the incorrect tax position. Discussion There are instances when a single breach will make the taxpayer liable to both a civil and a criminal penalty. Examples are evasion and failure to file a tax return. The Commissioner may impose both civil and criminal penalties for the same breach provided that the Com- missioner prosecutes the taxpayer before imposing the civil penalty. A new section 94A provides that when assessing civil penalties, the Commissioner must use the same proc- esses as apply to the tax on which the penalty is im- posed. Section 94A states: (1)The Commissioner may make or amend an assessment of a civil penalty in the same way as the Commissioner may make or amend an assessment of the tax in respect of which the penalty is imposed; (2)The Commissioner must assess a shortfall penalty in the same way as the tax to which it relates, but separately from the tax; (3)The Commissioner may assess a shortfall penalty before or after unpaid tax has been assessed, or has become assessable or payable, or has been paid. Late filing penalties and late payment penalties will be imposed at the time that the non-compliant action occurs. These penalties will not be subject to the new disputes resolution rules. Section 138K(2) provides that a taxpayer has no right to challenge charging or amount of a civil penalty assessed by the Commissioner for late filing of a tax return or late payment of tax. Taxpayers may dispute the imposition of shortfall penalties, but they cannot dispute the amount. Part 6 - Remissions Introduction Remission provisions are needed to allow the Commis- sioner to accommodate circumstances when a penalty is not appropriate. The main remission provisions the Act provides are: •remission for reasonable cause •remission consistent with collecting the highest net revenue over time. Provisions that apply to specific situations, such as the provisional tax underestimation provision, will remain. The new provisions will apply to all the Inland Revenue Acts and the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act. Provisions to remit late payment penalties, late filing penalties and interest accommodate circumstances in which it was not equitable to impose penalties or interest. There is no provision to remit shortfall penalties. This is because a taxpayer’s circumstances are taken into account before a shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care, gross carelessness or evasion is imposed. Background The Inland Revenue Acts currently provide for the remission of penalties if the Commissioner considers remission “equitable”. If a penalty can be imposed because a taxpayer has failed to meet an obligation, but not applying it can be justified on equity grounds, the penalty is remitted. Remission is initiated by a taxpayer and results in the debt being legally forgiven. Key features •Late payment penalties and late filing penalties may be remitted when taxpayers have “reasonable cause beyond their control”. •Shortfall penalties will not be remitted. •Interest may be remitted or cancelled in limited circumstances. •There is a general discretionary remission consistent with the Commissioner’s objective to collect the highest net revenue over time. •There are specific legislative guidelines for instalment arrangements. Legislation Under section 183A the Commissioner may remit a late filing penalty, a late payment penalty, any imputation penalty tax or any dividend withholding penalty tax if both of these conditions are met: •The taxpayer has reasonable cause for paying late or not filing a return on time. •The taxpayer pays the unpaid tax as soon as practica- ble. Reasonable cause could include an event such as accident or disaster, or illness or emotional or mental distress. It does not include an omission by an agent, unless caused by an event or circumstance beyond the agent’s control which could not have been avoided by following accepted business standards and professional conduct. Reasonable cause also excludes the taxpayer’s financial position. Section 183B provides that the Commissioner may cancel incremental late payment penalties if taxpayers have satisfied the terms of an instalment arrangement entered into with the Commissioner. If taxpayers arrange to pay a tax debt by instalment before the due date for the tax (knowing they are in financial difficulty) the initial late payment penalty will also be reduced from 5% to 2%. Section 183C provides that interest will be cancelled for the period from the date of the notice until the due date specified in the notice if tax is paid by the due date stated in the notice. It also provides that late payment penalties on deferrable tax in the period of deferral will be cancelled if the taxpayer makes a competent objection or starts proceed- ings to challenge an assessment. Section 183D states that the Commissioner may remit a late filing penalty, late payment penalty or interest if it is consistent with the collection of the highest net revenue over time. Section 183E states that if the unpaid tax is remitted, the interest relating to that tax will be remitted. Section 183F states that late payment penalty and interest will not be charged if the related unpaid tax is $100 or less on a specific due date. Section 183G states that if the Commissioner remits an amount of penalty or tax and the taxpayer has already paid it, the amount will be refunded to the taxpayer or applied towards meeting another tax liability. Section 183H states that a taxpayer who wishes to apply for remission or cancellation must apply in writing, and must produce any information the Commissioner requires about the request. Discussion Late payment penalties and late filing penalties may be remitted under two categories: reasonable cause, or if remission will result in collecting the highest net revenue over time. Interest may only be remitted if remission will result in collecting the highest net revenue over time. Shortfall penalties cannot be remit- ted. Difference between remission, cancellation and reversal Remission: occurs when the tax, penalty or interest is correctly imposed at the time but a decision has been made to relieve the taxpayer of the liability to pay. Cancellation: occurs when the tax, penalty or interest was correctly imposed at the time but a provision of the legislation relieves the taxpayer from the obliga- tion to pay, such as, adhering to an instalment arrangement. Reversal: the tax, penalty or interest should not have been charged in the first place. Reasonable cause A late filing penalty or late payment penalty can be remitted if the Commissioner is satisfied that late filing or late payment was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer’s control. The taxpayer is responsi- ble for filing and paying, so specific action or inaction by a tax agent will not constitute reasonable cause. The legislation gives guidance as to what could be considered to be events or circumstances beyond a taxpayer’s control, as well as events or circumstances which would not fall within that category. The events and circumstances set out in the legislation are not exhaustive, so the Commissioner may consider other matters on a case by case basis. Collecting highest net revenue over time The Commissioner has a discretion to remit late filing penalty, late payment penalty and interest if it is consistent with the duty to collect, over time, the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law. The intent is to allow for genuine circumstances if those circumstances are not consistent with reasonable cause. With regards to the late filing and late payment penal- ties, the sort of situation which may be given favourable consideration would be if non-payment is caused by genuine oversight. However, in these situations payment of the underlying tax should have been made as soon as the oversight was recognised. With interest, the sort of situation which may be given favourable consideration would be if non-payment is caused by Inland Revenue error. The provision to remit is discretionary, so prior consid- eration may be given to the taxpayer’s circumstances, liquidity and assets and liabilities. Only in exceptional circumstances will interest be remitted, as it is compensation for the use of crown money. Cancellation of interest When the Commissioner issues a notice of assessment and the amount specified in the notice (assessment plus interest) is paid by the due date, the interest applying from the date of the notice until the due date specified in the notice will be cancelled. Cancellation if instalment arrangement made Late payment penalty can be cancelled if a taxpayer makes a payment arrangement which requires two or more instalments. Sixty percent of the initial late payment penalty may be cancelled if the arrangement is entered into before the due date for payment and all the terms of the arrange- ment are strictly adhered to. This would reduce the initial late payment penalty from 5% to 2% and cancel any incremental late payment penalties. If the arrangement is made after the due date of the tax or after a notice under section 157 of the TAA or section 43 of the GST Act is issued, all incremental late payment penalties imposed after the date of the arrange- ment or notice may be cancelled if the arrangement is adhered to. The penalties will only be cancelled if the taxpayer keeps all terms of the arrangement. This means that if, as part of the arrangement, returns must be filed or current taxes kept up to date, and the taxpayer does not meet these obligations, the Commissioner can enforce payment of penalties incurred after the date of the arrangement. Application dates Late payment penalty remissions considered after 1 April 1997, regardless of the period they apply to, will be considered under the new rules. Any instalment arrangements entered into before 1 April 1997 will come under the current rules, regardless of when the arrangement ends. Part 7 - Amendments to other Acts Other Acts As discussed earlier, the new penalties apply to all the Inland Revenue Acts and the premiums of earners, employers and the self-employed under the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act, not just to the Income Tax Act and Goods and Services Tax Act. Broadly speaking, the old penalty provisions in those Acts were repealed and replaced with the new generic penalty provisions in the Tax Administration Act. The exception is the Student Loan Scheme Act and the Child Support Act - in these the new penalty provisions apply only to employer obligations. In addition, some minor changes were made to aspects of various Inland Revenue Acts. These changes are discussed below. Stamp and Cheque Duties Act Stamp duty is now payable six months after a document is executed or received in New Zealand. However, if a document is presented for stamping more than six months after execution because of delay in approval from, say, the Land Tribunal or the Overseas Invest- ment Commission, the new remission provisions will generally apply. Estate and Gift Duties Act Gift duty is now payable six months after the making of a dutiable gift. Approved issuer levy (AIL) The new penalty rules do not explicitly apply to AIL. This is because if the issuer of a security does not comply with the requirements of AIL, the taxpayer automatically defaults back to the non-resident with- holding tax (NRWT) rules. The new penalties apply to any non-compliance with the NRWT requirements. Gaming Duties Act The due date for paying totalisator duty is now the 20th of the month following the last race. Accordingly, if totalisator duty is not paid by this due date, late payment and interest will apply.

These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding pubic ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. How- ever, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. Transfers of depreciable property between 100% commonly owned companies - withdrawal of Commissioner’s practice Summary Currently, the Commissioner has an administrative practice that allows assets to be transferred between commonly owned companies at book value. The Com- missioner considers that, with the consolidation and depreciation regimes now in place, such a practice is no longer appropriate. Accordingly, it is withdrawn with effect from 1 April 1997. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Background For a long time the Commissioner has allowed compa- nies with 100% identical shareholding to transfer assets to each other at book value (under the current legisla- tion referred to as “adjusted tax value”), provided that certain conditions are met. Essentially, these conditions are that an assurance is given by the purchasing com- pany that, in the event of any sale, any depreciation allowed the vendor company would, if recovered, be returned as assessable income of the purchasing com- pany. In Tax Information Bulletin, Volume Four, No. 9 (May 1993) at page 11 we stated that this practice was under review, but would continue in the meantime. There is no legislative basis for allowing 100% com- monly owned companies which are not part of a con- solidated group to transfer property at adjusted tax value. Under section FD 10 (1) and (2), companies included in a consolidated group are required to transfer property at adjusted tax value. At the time this legisla- tion was introduced, submissions were made to the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee asking for the retention of the Commissioner’s administrative practice, irrespective of whether a company chose to be a member of a consolidated group. The Committee rejected these submissions. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 EG 17111 EG 19117 FD 10191N Schedule 17Twenty-Second Schedule In the current depreciation regime, sections EG 17 and EG 19 are relevant to the transfer of property between associated persons. Under section EG 17, when a taxpayer has acquired depreciable property from an associated person: •Under subsection (1), the taxpayer is not allowed any greater deduction for depreciation than would have been allowed to the associated person, if the associ- ated person had retained the property. If any amount so allowed as a deduction to the associated person has been dealt with under section EG 19, a deduction is allowed based on the aggregate of the amounts so allowed and the depreciated value of the property immediately before it was acquired by the taxpayer. •Under subsection (2), subsection (1) does not apply when the Commissioner is of the opinion that the depreciation of the property should be based on the actual price or other consideration given for the property. Following an amendment made by the Income Tax Act 1994 Amendment (No. 4) 1995, subsection (1) does not apply to intangible property if the acquisition price of the property is assessable income to the associated person. When the disposal is at market value: •Section EG 19 (2) applies so as to assess the lesser of the depreciation allowed in respect of the property or the excess over the adjusted tax value; or continued on page 2 A continuation of the previous practice of allowing the transfer of depreciable property at book value would be inconsistent with Parliament’s aims in enacting the formal consolidation regime. Policy The Commissioner’s practice of allowing 100% com- monly owned companies , which are not part of a consolidated group, to transfer depreciable property to each other at adjusted tax value is withdrawn with effect to any disposals of depreciable property from 1 April 1997. After 1 April 1997, the vendor company should calculate depreciation recovered/loss on disposal: •On the actual sale price; or •When the Commissioner believes that the property has been disposed of for a consideration that is not market value, and, under section EG 19(7), deems the property to have been disposed of for market value, on the market value. The purchasing company should value the property at the cost it incurred, or the value the Commissioner deems the vendor to have disposed of that property for, to calculate the depreciation to be claimed, subject to the limitations imposed by section EG 17. •If the market value is less than the adjusted tax value, section EG 19 (3) allows a deduction for the differ- ence between the adjusted tax value and market value. Under section EG 19 (7), when the Commissioner believes the disposal is not at market value, he shall deem the property to have been disposed of for market value or, if the market value cannot be specified, for a consideration that he specifies. The vendor will, therefore, be deemed to have disposed of the property at market value. Although the Act does not expressly deem the purchaser to have acquired depreciable property from the associated person for a particular value, this would normally be cost, i.e., the price agreed to by the parties. In cases when the Com- missioner deems the vendor to have disposed of the property for market value under section EG 19 (7), the Act does not expressly deem the purchaser to have acquired the property for that same value, but the intention of the legislation seems clear and the pur- chaser would be permitted to use that value to calculate depreciation, subject to the limitations imposed by section EG 17. from page 1 Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Aluminium scaffolding - depreciation determination DEP19 In TIB Volume Eight, No. 6 (October 1996) at pages 9 and 10 the Commissioner published a draft general deprecia- tion determination for aluminium scaffolding. No submissions were received on this draft. Accordingly, the Commissioner has now issued the determination. It may be cited as “Determination DEP19: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 19”. The determination is reproduced below. The new depreciation rate for “Scaffolding (Aluminium)” of 22% DV is based on an estimated useful life (“EUL”) of 8 years and a residual value of 13.5% of cost.

Jeff Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Horizontal directional drilling machines - draft depreciation determination The Commissioner has been made aware that there is currently no general depreciation rate for horizontal direction drilling machines used in the civil contracting industry chiefly in the installation of pipes (water or gas) or cables (telecommunication or electrical) underground, without having to dig ditches. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general depreciation determination which will: •insert a new asset class “Drilling machines (Horizontal Directional)” with an estimated useful life of 6.66 years and a general depreciation rate of 26% DV and 18% SL, under the “Contractors, Builders and Quarrying” industry category. •insert the asset class “Drilling machine components, underground, (Horizontal Directional)” in the “Contractors, Builders and Quarrying” industry category with an estimated useful life of 2 years and a general depreciation rate of 63.5% DV and 63.5% SL. The draft determination is reproduced below. The proposed new depreciation rates are based on the estimated useful lives set out in the draft determination below and residual values of 13.5%.

Taxation of commissions received by life agents on own policies and family policies Public ruling - BR Pub 96/9 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BB 4 and CI 1 (h) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies This Ruling considers the various ways in which a life agent may benefit from taking out a policy on his or her own life (“own policies”) or from selling a policy to family members (“family policies”). The Arrangement is as follows: •The receipt by life agents of cash commissions on their own policies or family policies, or the set off of commissions on such policies against premiums payable on the life agents’ own policies. •The receipt of discounted premiums by life agents on own policies or the receipt of discounted premiums by members of their families on family poli- cies. “Set off” and “Life insurer” have the following meanings for the purposes of this Ruling: •Set off means that the life agent’s obligation to pay the full amount of pre- mium for his or her own policy is set off against commission entitlement so that only the net amount of premium is paid. •Life insurer means a life insurance company who engages life agents as either employees or independent contractors. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: •Cash commissions received by life agents on own policies or family policies are assessable income under section BB 4 (a) (if the life agent is an independ- ent contractor) and section BB 4 (b) (if the life agent is an employee). When life agents set off commissions on such policies, the amount of commission set off is assessable income under section BB 4. continued on page 6 •When life agents receive discounted premiums on own policies, or persons associated with the life agents receive discounted premiums on family poli- cies, the discounted premium will be a fringe benefit under section CI 1 (h). The life insurer will be liable for fringe benefit tax (FBT) on the value of the benefit. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 January 1997 to 30 September 1997 to the receipt of cash commissions, the set off of commissions, or the receipt of discounts by life agents or by members of their families, occurring within that period. This Ruling is signed by me on the 13th day of November 1996.

When life agents set off commissions on such policies, the amount of commission set off is gross income under section CD 3 or CH 3. •When life agents receive discounted premiums on own policies, or persons associated with the life agents receive discounted premiums on family poli- cies, the discounted premium will be a fringe benefit under section CI 1 (h). The life insurer will be liable for fringe benefit tax (FBT) on the value of the benefit. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1999 to the receipt of cash commissions, the set off of commissions, or the receipt of discounts by life agents or by members of their families, occurring within that period. This Ruling is signed by me on the 13th day of November 1996. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Commentary on public rulings BR Pub 96/9 and 96/9A This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Rulings BR Pub 96/9 and 96/9A (“the Rulings”). The Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 amended a large number of sections in the Income Tax Act 1994. It has done this, in the main, by repealing those provisions and replacing them with new amended provisions. The new provisions take effect from the commencement of each taxpayer’s 1997-98 income year (i.e. from 1 April 1997 for standard balance date taxpayers). Given that the repealed provisions will no longer apply from the commencement of each taxpayer’s 1997-98 income year, the Commissioner has produced two rulings. BR Pub 96/9 applies for the period from 1 January 1997 to 30 September 1997. BR Pub 96/9A applies for the period from 1 January 1997 to 31 De- cember 1999. For example, if a taxpayer has a standard balance date, i.e. 31 March 1997, BR Pub 96/9 will apply to that taxpayer for the period from 1 January 1997 to 31 March 1997. From 1 April 1997 the new provisions take effect and BR Pub 96/9A will apply to that taxpayer for the period from 1 April 1997 to 31 December 1999. The commentary refers to the Income Tax Act 1994 as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996. In particular, it refers to sections CD 3 and CH 3 (previously sections BB 4 (a) and BB 4 (b)) and to the concept of “gross income” (previously in the context of these Rulings “assessable income”). The subject matter of the Rulings was previously considered in TIB Volume Four, No.10 (May 1993) at pages 4 and 5. The Rulings replace that earlier state- ment. Background The item Commissions on Life Insurance sold to Agent’s Family in TIB Volume Four, No.10 (May 1993) stated that: Commissions received by agents or employees of Life Insurance Offices who take out life insurance policies on their own lives or on the lives of their immediate family members should be regarded as reductions or discounts from the premiums payable under the policies, and not as assessable income. In this context “immediate family” means the agent’s or employee’s spouse and dependent children. The provision of such benefits by the employer will be subject to FBT, unless excluded from the definition of Fringe Benefit by section 336N(1)(j)(ii)(B) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (“the Act”). A number of taxpayers asked the Commissioner to reconsider this policy. The Commissioner now takes a different view. Cash commissions received by life agents on own policies or family policies are gross income. continued on page 8 employer’s business, normally provides such services for payment, the price for which, at the time when the services were so provided to the employee, services identical or similar to those services were customarily provided by the employer of the employee to a member of the general public in the open market in New Zealand on ordinary trade terms between buyers and sellers independent of each other: Section GC 15 (1) states: For the purposes of the FBT rules, where any benefit which, if it were provided for or granted to an employee would be a fringe benefit, is provided or granted by the employer of the employee,...for or to a person other than the employee of the employer, the employee of the employer and the other person being associated persons, that benefit shall be deemed to be a benefit provided for or granted to the employee by the employer of the employee. For the purposes of section GC 15 “associated person” is defined in section OD 7 (1). That section states that: For the purposes of this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, at any time associated persons or persons associated with each other are- ... (c)Two persons who are at the time relatives;... “Relative” is defined in section OB 1: (a)Except in the international tax rules, in relation to any person, means any other person connected with the first- mentioned person by blood relationship, marriage, or adoption; and includes a trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit; and for the purposes of this paragraph- (i)Persons are connected by blood relationship if within the fourth degree of relationship: (ii)Persons are connected by marriage if one is married to the other or to a person who is connected by blood relationship to the other: (iii)Persons are connected by adoption if one has been adopted as the child of the other or as a child of a person who is within the third degree of relationship to the other: Application of the Legislation 1. Cash commissions received by life agents on their own policies or family policies “Income” is not a term of art and has to be examined in accordance with ordinary concepts and usages (Scott v C of T (1935) 35 SRNSW 215 at page 219). The courts have identified several criteria that are considered to be the hallmarks of receipts of an income nature. The High Court in Reid v CIR (1983) 6 NZTC 61,624 at page 61,629 described the criteria as follows: •Income is something which comes in; and •Income imports the notion of periodicity, re-occur- rence and regularity; and •Whether a particular receipt is income depends upon its quality in the hands of the recipient. The payment of a commission arises from an arrange- ment between the life agent and the life insurer. The life agent receives the commission for introducing business to the life insurer, not for taking out the policy and paying the premiums.

Section CH 3 states: All monetary remuneration derived by a person is gross income. Section OB 1 defines “employer” and “employee” for the purposes of the FBT rules. “Employee” means: ...a person who will receive, receives, or has at any time received, or who will be, is, or has at any time been entitled to receive, a source deduction payment... “Employer” means: ...a person who will pay, pays, or has at any time paid, or who will be, is, or has at any time been liable to pay, a source deduction payment... “Source deduction payment” is defined in section OB 2 as: ...a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra emolument, or a withholding payment. Section CI 1 defines “fringe benefit”. Under section CI 1 (h), a fringe benefit includes any benefit that consists of: Any benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed by the employee in the quarter or...income year,- being, as the case may be...a benefit that is used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee (whether that employment will occur, is occurring, or has occurred) and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee;... Section CI 3 provides the methods for calculating the value of a fringe benefit. When services are provided to an employee, and the services are provided as part of the employer’s business, the fringe benefit is valued in accordance with section CI 3 (10)(a): Where the services were provided by the employer of the employee where the employer of the employee, as part of that from page 7 Does the mutuality principle apply? Although the life agent is the person who enters into the policy which causes the commission to be paid, the commission is not a return of the life agent’s own money. The commission comes from a source outside of the life agent, i.e. from the funds of the life insurer. The life agent is paid the commission for introducing business to the life insurer, not for taking out the policy and paying the premiums. Case law indicates that the mutuality principle only applies when a person trades with himself or herself, i.e. there is only one party to the transaction giving rise to the income. Here there are two parties to the transac- tion. The commission arises from the sale of a life insurance product by one party (the life insurer) to another party (the life agent). It does not matter that the life insurance product is sold by the life insurer through the life agent. There are still two parties to the transac- tion. Mutuality principle - conclusion The mutuality principle does not apply to commissions received by life agents on their own policies. Discount on premiums It may also be argued that cash commissions received by life agents on own policies should be regarded as discounts from the premiums payable under the policy and not as gross income. For example, a life agent takes out a policy on his or her life. The premium is $1,000. The life agent receives a cash commission of $200. The $200 can be seen as a discount, i.e. the ‘real’ cost of the policy is $800. As discussed in the background to the Rulings, this was the view taken in Commissions on Life Insurance sold to Agent’s Family in TIB Volume Four, No.10 (May 1993). The treatment of cash commissions as reductions or discounts from the premiums payable under the policies is not supported by the legislation. The commission payment arises from an arrangement between the life agent and the life insurer. The life agent receives the commission for introducing business to the life insurer, not for taking out the policy and paying the premiums. Conclusion Cash commissions received by life agents on own policies or family policies are gross income under section CD 3 or CH 3. 2. Life agents’ commission is set off Life agents may set off commissions on own policies or family policies against the premiums payable on their own policies. Under section EB 1 (1), an amount is deemed to have been derived by a person although it has not actually been paid to the taxpayer, or received by the person, or already become due or receivable, if that amount: An important feature of income is that it is something which comes in. This was emphasised in Lambe v IR Commrs (1933) 18 T.C. 212 where Finlay J said at page 217: Of course income may be of various sorts,...but none the less the \[income\] tax is a tax on income. It is a tax on what in one form or another goes into a man’s pocket. That is the general principle. Cash commissions received by life agents on own policies or family policies come in, in the same way that commissions from the sale of policies to unrelated third parties come in. The major determinant in many cases is the periodic nature of the payment. Generally, commission income is periodic in nature. However, this in itself is not enough. It is necessary to consider the relationship between the life insurer and the life agent to determine the quality of the commission in the hands of the life agent. Alternative arguments One possible argument is that commissions received by life agents on their own policies are not income but are the proceeds from mutual transactions. Mutual transactions The general principle of income tax known as mutuality starts from the premise that a person cannot make a profit from trading with himself or herself, or with a body or association of persons of which the person is a member. In Sydney Water Board Employees’ Credit Union Ltd v FC of T (1973) ATC 4,129 Barwick J said: The description “mutuality principle” is used, unfortunately as I think, to express the reason for the conclusion that the return to a taxpayer of a share of the surplus of a fund to which he has contributed in common with others after its use for a purpose agreed between them is not income...What distin- guishes the amount refunded in such circumstances from profit or income is that the payment is made out of moneys which are in substance the moneys of the contributors. (At page 4,131.) Prima facie the profits from mutual transactions are not gross income. There are numerous cases discussing the mutuality principle. Most discuss the situation where a person trades with a body or association of persons of which he or she is a member. There was some discussion of the principle that a person cannot trade with himself or herself in Dublin Corporation v M’Adam 2 T.C. 387 at page 397. The Court stated that: There must be, at least, two parties...If these two parties are identical, in my opinion there can be no trading. No man, in my opinion, can trade with himself; he cannot, in my opinion, make, in what is its true sense or meaning, taxable profit by dealing with himself; and in every case of this description it appears to be a question on the construction of the Act whether the two bodies - the body that supplies and the body or class that has to pay - were either identical, or, upon the true construction of the Act, must be admitted to have been held by the Legislature to be identical... continued on page 10 agents have the option of receiving a commission, or not receiving a commission and receiving a discounted premium, the issue of convertibility arises. In particular, does the existence of the option (to receive the commis- sion in lieu of the discounted premium) mean that the discounted premium is convertible into money, and therefore assessable? Case law The principle of convertibility was initially laid down in Tennant v Smith \[1892\] 3 T.C. 158. Tennant involved a bank employee who received a benefit in the form of rent free accommodation. The issue was whether the accommodation was assessable under Schedule E of the UK legislation (by virtue of the words “salaries, fees, wages, perquisites or profits payable”). The Court held that the taxpayer would only be taxable if what he received was convertible into money, i.e. was money or money’s worth. Because the taxpayer could not sublet the accommodation or turn it to pecuniary account in any other way, he was not taxed. The principle of convertibility has been discussed and applied by the New Zealand courts on a number of occasions. See C of IR v Parson (No. 2) (1968) NZLR 574, Stagg v Inland Revenue Commissioner (1959) NZLR 1,252, and Dawson v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1978) 3 NZTC 61,252. The convertibility test is normally satisfied by demon- strating that the benefit may be sold or exchanged for money. ( In Stagg the value of holiday airfares given to an employee were held not to be assessable income of the employee. The employee could not sell the fares or require the company to give him the equivalent cash value.) However, it is clear from case law that there are other ways in which convertibility can be satisfied. See Abbott v Philbin \[1961\] 2 All E.R. 763 and Heaton (Inspector of Taxes) v Bell \[1969\] 2 All E.R. 70. The principle of convertibility was considered by the New Zealand Supreme Court in Dawson. The taxpayer subscribed for debenture stock under a debenture holders’ colour television plan. Under that plan a person could subscribe for debenture stock and would receive in return a TV free of hire for five years. No interest was payable on the debentures. The Commissioner argued that the use of the TV set was the substitution of one form of a benefit for another, i.e. interest, and that in taking the hire of the set rather than the payment of interest, the taxpayer received a benefit which could be valued in terms of money. McMullin J said at page 61,258: In the view which I take of this matter, it is of some impor- tance to note that Objector did not apply for a television set as an alternative to an interest-bearing investment. It is true that it was open to him initially to choose to invest in interest- bearing stock as, I have no doubt, many other investors did, but he completed his application for a television set and a television set only. ...has been credited in account, or reinvested, or accumulated, or capitalised, or carried to any reserve, sinking, or insurance fund, or otherwise dealt with in the person’s interest or on the person’s behalf. Case law has established that income is derived under section EB 1 when the taxpayer does not receive a payment of that income, but some other benefit moves to the taxpayer. This has been found to occur when income that would otherwise have been paid to the taxpayer is diverted for uses that are of benefit to the taxpayer (Dunn v C of IR (1974) 1 NZTC 61,245). When life agents set off the commission, the amount of commission is gross income under section CD 3 or CH 3. The commission (which would otherwise have been paid to the agent) is diverted for uses that are of benefit to the life agent, i.e. payment of the premiums on own policies. The practice of setting off commissions on policies may also occur in respect of policies sold to third parties. For example, a life agent sells a policy to an unrelated third party and becomes entitled to a commission. Instead of being paid the commission, the life agent sets the commission off against premiums payable on own policies. Here, the commission, although not paid to the life agent, is derived by the life agent and is therefore gross income. 3. Receipt of discounted premiums by life agents on own policies or by members of life agents’ families on family policies It is common for life insurers to allow life agents to receive lower commissions in order to discount premi- ums to prospective clients. The Commissioner under- stands that if a life agent does not charge a commission on the sale of a policy, there is a corresponding reduc- tion in the premiums payable under that policy. The Commissioner also understands that when life agents do not charge commissions on their own policies or on family policies, the premiums payable under those policies are reduced. Life agents who do not charge commissions on policies sold to third parties are not assessable on any notional commission, i.e. the amount of commission which would have been received. As discussed, an important feature of income is that it is something which comes in. When a life agent does not charge commission no income comes in. This must also be the case when life agents do not charge commission on their own policies or family policies. As the life agent receives no commission, no income arises. Alternative arguments An important feature of income is that it is something which comes in. When life agents do not charge com- mission on their own policies no money comes in. They do not receive a cash commission. However, if life from page 9 The Court held that the benefit which the taxpayer received was that he did not have to pay rental for the TV. That benefit did not constitute income in the ordinary sense because the benefit received by the taxpayer was not in monetary form, nor was it capable of being sold, surrendered, assigned, or mortgaged for money or money’s worth. Arguably Dawson provides some support for the view that the receipt of a discounted premium is convertible into money or money’s worth, the discounted premium being a substitution for the commission. It may be implied from the Court’s comments in Dawson that if the taxpayer had the option of investing and receiving either a TV set or an interest-bearing investment, and in fact received a TV set, the benefit would be convertible into money. However, the better view is that discounted premiums are not convertible into money or money’s worth. The fact that a life agent initially has the choice of receiving a commission, or not receiving a commission and receiving a discounted premium, is not relevant. The issue of convertibility is considered at the time the taxpayer receives the benefit. If a life agent chooses to receive a commission, no question of convertibility arises as the commission is money. However, when a life agent chooses to receive a dis- counted premium, it is the discounted premium itself which must be convertible into money or money’s worth. At the time the discounted premium is received it cannot be converted into money. Therefore, the convert- ibility principle does not apply. Conclusion When life agents receive discounted premiums on own policies or members of their families receive discounted premiums on family policies, the amount of the discount is not gross income of the life agent. 4. FBT and discounted policies A life insurer who provides discounted premiums to life agents on own policies or to members of their families on family policies may be liable to FBT. For the purposes of FBT a life agent is an “employee”, regardless of whether the life agent is an employee or an independent contractor at common law. Employee vs independent contractor The terms “employee”, “employer” and “employment” are defined for FBT purposes by reference to the PAYE system. Section OB 1 defines “employee” for the purposes of the FBT rules as: ...a person who will receive, receives, or has at any time received, or who will be, is, or has at any time been entitled to receive, a source deduction payment... Section OB 2 defines “source deduction payment” as: ...a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra emolument, or a withholding payment. “Withholding payment” is defined in section OB 1 as: ...a payment which is declared by regulations under this Act to be a withholding payment for the purposes of the PAYE rules: Under section 4 of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979, all payments of the classes specified in the Schedule to the regulations are with- holding payments for the purposes of the PAYE rules. Included in Part A of the Schedule are commissions or other remuneration to insurance agents or sub-agents, or to salesmen. A life agent who is an employee at common law is an “employee” for the purposes of FBT because of receiv- ing a source deduction payment, namely salary and wages. A life agent who is an independent contractor at common law is also an “employee” for the purposes of FBT because of receiving a source deduction payment, namely withholding payments. Discounts on family policies If an employer provides a benefit to an associated person of any of the employer’s employees, i.e. a member of the life agent’s immediate family (and the benefit would have been a fringe benefit if provided to an employee), section GC 15 (1) deems the benefit to be a benefit provided to the employee. For the purposes of section GC 15, “associated person” is defined in section OD 7 (1). An “associated person” includes two persons who are at the time relatives. A relative of a life agent is any person connected with the life agent: •By blood relationship (if within the fourth degree of relationship); or •By marriage (persons are connected by marriage if one is married to the other or to a person who is connected by blood relationship to the other); or •By adoption (persons are connected by adoption if one has been adopted as the child of the other or as a child of a person who is within the third degree of relation- ship to the other). Is there a fringe benefit? As discussed above, when a life agent does not charge a commission and receives a discounted premium, that discounted premium is not gross income of the life agent. A discounted premium which represents a reduction is charges other than commission and is also not gross income. A discount is not regarded as gross income. Income is something which comes in, not something that is saved from going out (see Tennant Lord Halsbury at page 165). continued on page 12 the life agent are not “sick, accident, or death benefit funds” as defined in section CB 5 (2) (see CI 1 (e)), nor is the discount a “specified insurance premium” as defined in section OB 1. The life insurer does not pay the life insurance premiums of the life agent or the agent’s family on the life agent’s own policies or family policies (see section CI 1 (f)). Value of the benefit The Act provides methods for valuing a fringe benefit. Specific provisions exist for determining the value of services provided to an employee when they are pro- vided as part of the employer’s business. Here the benefit is the provision of a life insurance policy at less than market value. The life insurer is in the business of selling such life insurance policies to the general public. Therefore, section CI 3 (10)(a) applies to determine the value of the benefit. The extent to which the benefit is subject to FBT will depend on the extent to which the discounts provided to life agents or members of life agents’ family are greater than the discounts available to members of the general public. It is a question of fact whether the price paid for the policy by the life agent is the same as is customarily paid by a member of the general public in the open market on ordinary trade terms between buyers and sellers independent of each other. There will be no taxable value if the amount paid by the employee is the same as, or exceeds, the price customarily paid by a member of the general public in the open market on ordinary trade terms between buyers and sellers inde- pendent of each other. Expenditure on account of an employee The Rulings cover the situation when an employer (the life insurer) provides a benefit to the employee or associated person (the life agent or relative) by discount- ing the premiums payable by the life agent on the insurance policy. It does not seek to address the situa- tion when the life insurer pays the life insurance premium of a life agent. When a life insurer pays a life agent’s insurance premiums, that expenditure will be expenditure on account of an employee if the employee is liable to pay the insurance premiums. Expenditure on account of an employee is monetary remuneration and is assessable income to the employee. When a life insurer pays a life agent’s insurance premiums, and the life insurer is liable for those premi- ums, that expenditure is a fringe benefit (unless ex- pressly excluded from the definition of fringe benefit in section CI 1). The issue then is whether discounted premiums received by life agents on own policies or discounted premiums received by members of their families on family policies constitute fringe benefits. Analysis Section CI 1 defines “fringe benefit” for the purposes of the FBT rules: In the FBT rules, “fringe benefit”, in relation to an employee and to any quarter...or income year, means any benefit that consists of- ... Any benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed by the employee in the quarter or...income year,- being, as the case may be...a benefit that is used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee (whether that employment will occur, is occurring, or has occurred) and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee;... It is clear from these opening words that in order to be a fringe benefit there must be some benefit to the em- ployee, provided or granted by the employee’s employer. It may be argued that when life agents do not charge a commission on their own policies and receive dis- counted premiums, no benefit arises to the life agents because the benefit is also available to members of the public. (Life agents have a discretion to reduce their commission in order to reduce premiums on policies sold to members of the public). If a life agent purchases a life insurance policy at full value, i.e. the full amount of premiums are payable, there is no benefit to the life agent or his or her family. However, when a commission is not charged the full amount of premium is not paid. If a life agent does not charge commission, be it on an own policy or a policy sold to a member of the public, the amount of premium payable under the policy is reduced. This reduction in premium is clearly a benefit to the life agent and the public alike. A life agent who receives a discounted premium, when the discount represents a reduction in charges other than commission, clearly receives a benefit. The benefit being the receipt of the services of the employer (the life insurance policy) for less than market value. Therefore, discounted premiums received by life agents on own policies and discounted premiums received by members of their families on family policies are fringe benefits under section CI 1 (h). Note that sections CI 1 (e) and CI 1 (f) do not apply to discounts received by life agents (or associated persons) on own policies or family policies. The policies sold by from page 11 GST - advertising space and advertising time sold to non-residents Public ruling - BR Pub 96/10 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 11(2)(e) and 60(2). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the supply of advertising space in a publication, or the supply of advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service) by a GST registered person to a non-resident person who is outside New Zea- land at the time the services are performed. For the purposes of this Ruling, the supply of advertising space or advertising time means the service of communicating an advertising message, and includes all steps involved in providing this service by the supplier of the advertising space or time. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows. Section 11(2)(e) The supply of the service of providing advertising space in a publication or advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service) is zero- rated under section 11(2)(e) if the service is supplied contractually for and to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the service is performed. The supply is zero-rated irrespective of whether a New Zealand resident also otherwise benefits from the supply. The supply of advertising space in a publication or advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service) is not supplied “directly in connection with” any land (or improvement thereto) or moveable personal property situ- ated in New Zealand for the purposes of section 11(2)(e). This is because: •The provision of advertising space in a publication or advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service) is not supplied directly in connection with the subject matter of the advertisement; and •Where the supply is one of advertising space in a publication, the services are not supplied directly in connection with the publication itself. Section 60(2) If the supply is made to a New Zealand resident person who is acting as an agent for a non-resident principal, section 60(2) deems the supply to be made to the non-resident principal and not the resident agent. Section 11(2)(e) will apply to zero-rate the supply of services, provided that all the other requirements of section 11(2)(e) are satisfied. If services are supplied to a non-resident person who is acting as an agent for a New Zealand resident principal, section 11(2)(e) does not apply to zero-rate the supply of services. Section 60(2) deems the supply to be made to the New Zea- land resident principal. continued on page 14 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 96/10 (“this Ruling”). The subject matter covered in this Ruling was previ- ously dealt with in TIB Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) at page 14. This Ruling supersedes that earlier policy. Background In July 1994, the High Court delivered its judgment in Wilson & Horton v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,221. The case dealt with the circumstances in which a newspaper publisher should account for GST on the services of placing advertisements for non-resident clients. The High Court held that: •To qualify for zero-rating under section 11(2)(e), services must be provided “contractually to” and “beneficially for” a non-resident person. If a New Zealand resident receives the benefit of the advertis- ing services, the services are not zero-rated; and •The provision of advertising space and related services is not supplied directly in connection with the subject matter of the advertisements. Wilson & Horton appealed this decision to the Court of Appeal (Wilson & Horton v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325). The Court of Appeal held in favour of the taxpayer, and concluded that the supply of advertising space in New Zealand by Wilson & Horton to non- resident clients is zero-rated under section 11(2)(e) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, irrespective of whether a New Zealand resident also benefits from the supply. The Commissioner did not appeal this decision. Legislation Section 11(2)(e) zero-rates a supply of services when: The services are supplied for and to a person who is not resident in New Zealand and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, not being services which are supplied directly in connection with - (i)Land or any improvement thereto situated inside New Zealand; or (ii)Moveable personal property (other than choses in action, and other than goods to which paragraph (ca) of this subsection applies) situated inside New Zealand at the time the services are performed; - Section 60 sets out the GST agency provisions. Section 60(2) states: Subject to this section, for the purposes of this Act, where any registered person makes a taxable supply of goods and services to an agent who is acting on behalf of another person who is the principal for the purposes of that supply, that supply shall be deemed to be made to that principal and not to that agent: Court of Appeal decision The Court of Appeal held that the supply of the publica- tion of advertisements by Wilson & Horton to non- resident clients qualified for zero-rating under section 11(2)(e), irrespective of whether a New Zealand resident obtains a benefit from the supply. “For and to” The Court of Appeal rejected the High Court’s interpre- tation of “for” in section 11(2)(e), as meaning “benefi- cially for”. The Court of Appeal questioned whether this “benefit” test was workable. The Court noted that there are many parties who may potentially benefit from an advertisement placed by a non-resident, and that it was unlikely that the legislature would have intended a wide group of possible beneficiaries of a service to determine the GST treatment of the service. In discussing the “for and to” wording in section 11(2)(e), the Court of Appeal examined the possible meanings of “for” that may have been intended by the legislature and rejected the Commissioner’s interpreta- tion of “for” as meaning “beneficially for”. The Court concluded that “for” in section 11(2)(e) was used for emphasis only. Justice Richardson noted that legislative drafters often convey emphasis through the use of a combination of words and said that (at 12,330): I am inclined to think that the framers of s11(2)(e) employed both expressions to convey emphasis and perhaps to bring out the intent that the contract must be genuine and so the services must be supplied under that contract to and for the other contracting party. As a matter of statutory interpretation, the Court said that section 11(2)(e) would have been worded quite differently if the intent had been to preclude zero-rating, unless a non-resident recipient of a supply was the only person who could benefit from the services supplied. Justice Penlington considered that this result was consistent with one of the underlying themes of zero- The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 December 1996 and 30 November 1999. This Ruling is signed by me on the 13th day of November 1996. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Commentary on public ruling BR Pub 96/10 from page 13 “Directly in connection with” A supply of services to a non-resident will not be zero- rated under section 11(2)(e) if the services are supplied “directly in connection with” any land (or improvement to the land) or moveable personal property (other than choses in action and goods which are referred to in section 11(2)(ca)) situated in New Zealand at the time the services are performed. The Court of Appeal in Wilson & Horton did not discuss the meaning of “directly in connection with” in section 11(2)(e), nor resolve whether advertising space is supplied directly in connection with the newspapers in which advertise- ments are placed. Case law The determination of whether or not services are supplied “directly in connection with” land or moveable personal property depends on the circumstances in which the services are supplied. In Case E84 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,441, the TRA considered the meaning of the phrase “in connection with” in the context of section 165 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (section DJ 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994) and noted that (at 59,446): It is a matter of degree whether, on the interpretation of a particular statute, there is a sufficient relationship between subject and object to come within the words “in connection with” or not. It is clear that no hard and fast rule can be or should be applied to the interpretation of the words “in connection with”. Each case depends on its own facts and the particular statute under consideration. In the context of GST, the meaning of “directly in connection with” for the purposes of section 11(2)(a), prior to its amendment in 1988, has been judicially considered by the High Court in Auckland Regional Authority v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,080 and the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) in Case P78 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,532. Before amendment, section 11(2)(a) provided for zero-rating of services supplied “directly in connection with” transportation. The High Court and TRA cases concerned the application of section 11(2)(a) to various charges (landing dues, international terminal charges, and rubbish disposal charges) levied on overseas airlines. The High Court and the TRA adopted similar interpre- tations of the words “directly in connection with” under section 11(2)(a). The Auckland Regional Authority case summarises the reasoning of the TRA in Case P78 (at 11,084): There, the Taxation Review Authority, Judge Barber, held that “airport dues” were zero-rated for GST because passen- gers cannot realistically be transported to New Zealand by air unless a plane lands and parks on the tarmac; that charges for those services can be regarded as provided for international passengers who are in a sense “outside New Zealand” until they pass through customs. The services are fundamental to and directly connected with the transportation of passengers; The High Court and the TRA focus on whether a supply of services is fundamental or integral to transportation to determine whether the “directly in connection with” continued on page 16 rating - the preservation of New Zealand’s competitive- ness in world trade. It was also recognised that if advertised merchandise is sold in New Zealand, GST will be imposed on the sale at that time. “Directly in connection with” The Court of Appeal did not discuss whether the supply was made directly in connection with land or moveable personal property in New Zealand for the purposes of section 11(2)(e). The High Court had accepted that the supply of advertising space in a newspaper was not “directly in connection with” the subject matter of the advertising. During the Court of Appeal hearing, the potential argument that the services are supplied directly in connection with the newspapers themselves was also raised. However, the Court of Appeal did not allow the Com- missioner to introduce this new line of reasoning as it would have changed the basis upon which the assess- ment was made and objected to. The publishing industry has asked the Commissioner to clarify the application of the “directly in connection with” exclusion in section 11(2)(e) in this context. Application of the Legislation The key features of section 11(2)(e) are the phrases “for and to” and “directly in connection with”. “For and to” The Commissioner accepts the Court of Appeal’s interpretation of “for and to” in Wilson & Horton for the purposes of section 11(2)(e). In this context, “for and to” is a composite phrase. “For” simply emphasises “to” and does not connote any requirement that services must be provided for the exclusive benefit of the recipi- ent of the supply. If services are supplied pursuant to a contract with a non-resident and are for that non- resident, section 11(2)(e) will apply to zero-rate the supply regardless of any other benefits also arising to a New Zealand resident (provided that the other require- ments of the section are satisfied). The Court of Appeal’s interpretation of “for and to” is not restricted to the supply of advertising space in a newspaper. It also applies to the supply of advertising space in all forms of publication and to the supply of advertising time on radio or television (or other broad- casting service). This Ruling discusses the application of section 11(2)(e) to the supply of advertising space in publications, such as newspapers and magazines. The Ruling also covers the supply of advertising time on radio and television, or by way of any other broadcasting service, e.g. the internet. For the purposes of the Ruling, the supply of advertising space or advertising time means the service of communicating an advertising message, and includes all steps involved in providing this service by the supplier of the advertising space or time. supplied directly in connection with the subject matter of the advertisement. In the words of the High Court in Wilson & Horton v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,221 (at 11,224): The supply of space and services rendered by Wilson & Horton are directly connected with the advertising but not with the goods advertised. The goods are, as it were, at least one step removed from the services supplied by the newspaper proprietor. The Commissioner agrees with this view. There is no direct relationship or connection between the provision of advertising space and the subject matter of the advertisement. The same reasoning also applies to the supply of advertising space in all types of publication as well as advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service). The supply of advertising space or time in these media cannot be described as “directly in connection with” the advertised commodity. Similarly, when advertising space is supplied in a publication, the services are not supplied directly in connection with the publication in which the advertise- ments are published. The High Court judgment in Wilson & Horton concluded that the provision of advertising space was supplied directly in connection with (if anything) the advertising itself. The advertised goods were considered to be at least one step removed from the services. The Commissioner considers the same logic applies in respect of a newspaper or other publication. The service of communicating an advertis- ing message is directly connected with that message and not the publication. The publication is at least one step removed from the service and is merely the medium in which the advertising message is publicised. Accord- ingly, the service is not supplied directly in connection with the publication produced by the publishers. Consequently, the supply of advertising space in either a publication or by way of broadcast will be treated in the same way for GST purposes. The supply will qualify for zero-rating, provided that the services are supplied for and to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. Supplies through agents The application of section 60(2) may also need to be considered to determine whether a supply is zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). Section 60(2) deems a taxable supply of goods and services made by a registered person to an agent who is acting on behalf of a principal to be a supply made to the principal. Therefore, if a supply of advertising space or time is made to a New Zealand resident person who is acting as an agent for a non-resident principal, section 60(2) deems the supply to be made to the non-resident princi- pal and not the resident agent. Section 11(2)(e) will apply to zero-rate the supply of services, provided that all the other requirements of section 11(2)(e) are satisfied. A common example of this is where a resident advertising agency acts as an agent for a non-resident person in purchasing advertising space or time in New Zealand. test in section 11(2)(a) is satisfied. This reasoning is not strictly relevant for the purposes of interpreting “directly in connection with” in section 11(2)(e). This is because the focus of section 11(2)(a) was on services directly connected with transportation services, and the identifi- cation of a direct connection between a service and another service, and a service and an item of property, involves different considerations. However, the TRA has recently applied the proviso to section 11(2)(e) and considered the words “directly in connection with” in Case S88 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,551. The objector in Case S88 purchased motor vehicles from its non-resident parent company and then sold the vehicles to independent dealers, who on-sold them to the public. The parent company provided a contractual warranty to the objector. The objector agreed with the dealers that if a vehicle was repaired under warranty the objector would reimburse the dealer. The objector would then register a claim with the parent company under the warranty and receive payment pursuant to that claim. The TRA was required to consider whether the repair services provided by the objector pursuant to its contract with the non-resident parent were zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). The TRA concluded that section 11(2)(e) could not apply to zero-rate this supply as the services were supplied “directly in connection with” moveable personal property (the vehicles) situated in New Zealand at the time the services were provided. Although, the TRA did not examine the meaning of “directly in connection with” in great detail, it did state (at 7,558): The moveable personal property in question is the repaired vehicle. There is a direct relationship or connection between the service of the repairs and the vehicle. Accordingly, the said “proviso” to s 11(2)(e) must apply to the facts of this case and prevent the objectors from relying on the zero-rating provisions of s 11(2)(e). The repair service could not be performed but for the existence of the vehicle. \[Please note that Case S88 is currently under appeal by the taxpayer.\] Therefore, the case law discussing “in connection with” and “directly in connection with” indicates that the interpretation of the test will be dictated by the particu- lar context involved. The Commissioner considers that the “directly in connection with” proviso in section 11(2)(e) should be interpreted narrowly, and that there must be a clear and direct relationship with moveable personal property or land in New Zealand before a supply will be standard rated. This is consistent with the approach of the TRA in Case S88 in identifying on the facts of that particular case a “direct relationship or connection” between the repair services and the vehicles under repair. Advertising space and advertising time The supply of advertising space in a publication is the supply of the service of communicating an advertising message, involving all the steps required to achieve communication of the advertisement. This service is not from page 15 Example 2 A US resident distributor of soft drinks contracts for the supply of radio time on a national radio station in New Zealand. The soft drinks are available from all chains of supermarkets throughout New Zea- land. The supply of radio time by the New Zealand radio station to the US distributor is zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). This is because: •The radio station supplies its services contractu- ally for and to a non-resident. The fact that New Zealand resident retailers throughout New Zealand may potentially benefit from the supply through increased sales does not preclude zero- rating. •The services are not supplied directly in connec- tion with the products for sale in New Zealand. Example 3 An Australian computer distributor plans to adver- tise its product range in New Zealand. The comput- ers will be available through all major computer distributors in New Zealand. The Australian company contacts a New Zealand resident advertis- ing agency to arrange an advertising campaign. The agency, acting in the capacity as agent for the Australian company, purchases air time on a New Zealand resident television channel. The supply of air time by the television station to the Australian company is zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). This is because: •The television channel supplies the air time services contractually for and to a non-resident. Section 60(2) deems the supply to be made to the Australian company, as principal. The New Zealand resident advertising agency receives the supply as agent only. •The fact that New Zealand resident distributors may potentially benefit from the supply through increased sales does not preclude zero-rating. The services are not supplied directly in connection with the products for sale in New Zealand. Hunter Premium Funding Ltd: service of arranging loans is GST-exempt as a financial service Product ruling - BR Prd 96/30 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the Act) unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 3(1)(l), as it relates to sections 3(1)(c) and 3(1)(f). continued on page 18 Conversely, if a supply is made to a non-resident person who is acting as an agent for a New Zealand resident in relation to the supply, section 11(2)(e) will not apply to zero-rate the supply even if the criteria in section 11(2)(e) are otherwise satisfied. The supply will be deemed to be made to the resident principal and it will not be for and to a non-resident person. Examples For the purposes of these examples, it is assumed that: •A person referred to as a resident is a “resident” as defined in section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The converse applies to non-residents; and •If the services are supplied to a non-resident, the non- resident is outside New Zealand at the time of per- formance of the services. Example 1 A UK resident manufacturing company contacts a New Zealand magazine publisher and books advertising space for a newly developed product. The UK company has a GST registered subsidiary in New Zealand that sells the advertised product. The supply of advertising space by the magazine publisher to the UK manufacturer is zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). This is because: •The publisher supplies the services contractually for and to a non-resident. The fact that the New Zealand resident subsidiary potentially may benefit from the supply through increased sales does not preclude zero-rating. •The services are not supplied directly in connec- tion with either the products for sale in New Zealand or the magazines in which the advertise- ments are shown. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the supply of services to Hunter Premium Funding Limited (HPF), for which commissions are paid by HPF, by insurance brokers who act as intermediaries to negotiate and document loans which are “credit contracts” and/or which give rise to “debt securities”, as those terms are defined in the Act. Those loans, which are advanced by HPF, are applied for by borrowers to fi- nance insurance premiums payable on policies entered into by the borrowers. The supplies made by brokers to HPF will consist of negotiating and document- ing loan applications. The activities of the broker, in making that supply, will usually include: •Acting as an intermediary between HPF and the client seeking funds. •Calculating and notifying the cost of finance to the client. This may be done independently or in conjunction with HPF. •Collecting information from the client and assisting the client to complete application forms. •Collecting the first repayment instalment from the client. •Documenting details of the insurance that will be used as security for the loan. Assumption made by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the assumption that: •The insurance broker will be resident in New Zealand for GST purposes. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumption above, the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: •The services provided by insurance brokers acting as intermediaries who negotiate and document loan agreements which are credit contracts and/or give rise to debt securities in respect of funds to be advanced by HPF to borrowers are exempt financial services pursuant to section 3(1)(l), in that the activities of the brokers constitute the arranging of activities specified in sections 3(1)(c) or 3(1)(f). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 June 1996 to 30 June 1999. This Ruling is signed by me on the 22nd day of October 1996.

We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 Whether franchise agreements are depreciable Section EG 2 (section 108A, Income Tax Act 1976) - Formula for calculating depreciation deduction: A taxpayer has asked in what circumstances payments under a franchise agreement are depreciable. Franchise agreements can confer a variety of rights and obligations, and may require initial lump-sum payments, ongoing payments, or a combination of both from the franchisee. Ongoing payments are usually linked to the level of sales made each year. Franchise agreements are not a category of intangible asset that is property of a type listed in Schedule 17 (Twenty-second Schedule, Income Tax Act 1976), and accordingly they are not normally depreciable intangible property. However, any particular franchise agreement may give rise to specific rights that are listed in the Schedule. Note that it is the rights that are the depreciable intan- gible property, and not the franchise agreement. If a franchise agreement gives rise to a mixture of rights, and a particular right is specifically listed in the Schedule and capable of being separately and clearly isolated and valued, that right will be “depreciable intangible property” in its own right, and depreciable when the requirements of a declining value are also met. Inland Revenue will carefully scrutinise the amounts attributed to any mixture of Schedule 17 rights and rights not listed in Schedule 17. Section EG 2 sets out the formula permitting deductions for depreciation on “depreciable property”. Section OB 1 defines “depreciable property” as: (a)... any property ... which might reasonably be expected in normal circumstances to decline in value while used or available for use by persons- (i)In gaining or producing assessable income; or (ii)In carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income; but (b) Does not include - ... (iv)Intangible property other than depreciable intangible property. The same section further defines “depreciable intangible property” as: ... intangible property of a type listed in Schedule 17, which Schedule describes intangible property that has - (a)A finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its creation or acquisition; and (b)If made depreciable, a low risk of being used in tax avoidance schemes. Schedule 17 provides the following list of depreciable intangible property: 1.The right to use a copyright. 2.The right to use a design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or other like property or right. continued on page 20 3.A patent or the right to use a patent. 4.The right to use land. 5.The right to use plant or machinery. 6.The copyright in software, the right to use the copyright in software, or the right to use software. 7.The right to use a trademark. 8.Management rights and licence rights created under the Radiocommunications Act 1989. 9.A consent granted under the Resource Management Act 1991 to do something that otherwise would contravene sections 12 to 15 of that Act (other than a consent for a reclamation), being a consent granted in or after the 1996-97 income year. To be depreciable, an intangible asset must be both: •Property of a type listed in Schedule 17; and •Property which might reasonably be expected in normal circumstances to decline in value. As each franchise agreement must be considered on its own facts, only general guidelines can be provided. Franchises are not considered to be property of a type listed in Schedule 17, so in general they will not be depreciable. If a franchise gives rise to property or rights that are of a specific type listed in the Schedule (such as the right to use a trademark, secret formula, or process), then such rights will be depreciable only when there are no non-schedular prop- erties included, or when the schedular rights are capable of being separately and clearly isolated and valued. Regardless of whether or not the rights conferred under a franchise agreement are considered to be of a type listed in Schedule 17, they will not be depreciable if any of the following apply: •There is no finite and defined period of life estimable with a reasonable de- gree of certainty. •The rights are not expected to decline in value over their life. •The payment is made to purchase goodwill (rather than rights to secret for- mulae, processes or trademarks). If a right conferred under a franchise agreement is depreciable, it will usually have a legal life (as defined in section OB 1) equivalent to its estimated useful life. Accordingly, it must be depreciated using a straight-line method in terms of sections EG 3 (2) and EG 8 (sections 108B(2) and 108G, Income Tax Act 1976). If there are rights of renewal (of the franchise) that are automatic, or subject only to the payment of a predetermined fee, the legal life will be equal to the full term of the agreement, assuming the rights of renewal are taken up. The cost to be used for the annual depreciation calculation is the initial franchise fee (or separately valued amount), and the capital cost is increased when the renewal fee is incurred. Section EG 19 (section 117, Income Tax Act 1976) requires a calculation of the loss or gain on disposal of assets. The calculation is required for franchise rights which are depreciable, by virtue of the section EG 19 (9) definition of “disposal”, which: (a)Includes - ... (iv)Any event whereby the rights which constitute or are part of an item of intangible property will no longer be able to be exercised, at any time, by the taxpayer who owns that property: from page 19 ... (b)Does not include, in the case of intangible property, the disposal of that property as part of an arrangement to replace it with property of the same type. If the correct full cost of depreciable rights under a franchise agreement has not been claimed as an expense in the total depreciation claimed over its life, the operation of section EG 19 will ensure that the correct total is arrived at in the franchise’s year of ultimate expiry. This item has been concerned with the depreciability of franchise agreement rights. It does not purport to deal with the deductibility of ordinary franchise fees, which would require consideration of sections BB 7, EF 1, and BB 8 (a). Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Retirement allowance - assessability Case:TRA No 95/82 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 65 (2) (b), section 68 (2) Keywords:Long service payment Summary:The TRA took the view that the payment to the objector was a retiring allowance made in respect of his employment or service on the termination of that employ- ment or service. It did not matter that the payment could also be described as a bonus or gratuity. Facts:The objector had a sole period of employment for 29 years. He then sought early retirement on the basis of ill health and this request was accepted. The objector was paid the sum of $32,528 for long service. The issue to be determined was whether the payment was assessable under section 65(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1976 or whether it fell within section 68(2), which would deem it not to be assessable income. Decision:The TRA ruled that the lump sum payment was an allowance (or a bonus or a gratuity) available to the objector only at the point of retirement and related to his past employment. It was made not only on termination of that employment but because of such termination and because of a high standard of performance. As for the Commissioner’s submission that section 68(2) only applies to “true retirement” the TRA found that the section should not be limited in this manner and could refer to retirement from employment, termination of a career or cessation of primary employment. With regard to the Commissioner’s alternative submission that section 68(5)(d) excluded the payment from falling within section 68(2), the Authority found that the payment would only be excluded if it had been calculated with respect to any right or entitlement not dependent on the occurring of the retirement. Adjustment assistance payments - assessability Case:TRA No 96/38 , 96/39 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 65 (2) (a) , (h) or (l) Keywords:Compensation payments - assessability Summary:The TRA found that the adjustment assistance payments received by the objec- tors constituted assessable income in terms of section 65 (2) (a). Facts:The objector partnership purchased land containing 38 hectares of native bush in April 1990. The partnership intended to log the timber. In July 1990 the Govern- ment stopped all logging and exporting of indigenous timber products. In Au- gust 1990 it announced that it would pay adjustment assistance to persons af- fected by the ban. In March 1991 the partnership was successful in its application to the Ministry of Forestry for adjustment assistance. The issue to be determined by the TRA was whether the payments are assessable under section 65(2)(a) , (h) or (l) or whether there was a “sale” of timber under section 74 which would give rise to a deduc- tion for the cost of the timber under section 74(2)(b). Decision:The TRA reiterated the general principle that where any amount is received by way of compensation to fill a hole in profits, that payment takes its character from that which it replaces. It held that the payments were clearly compensation for the loss of profits from the taxpayers’ logging business as they were unable to cut down their indigenous trees and sell the timber or export it. The TRA also held that the payments were assessable as “royalties” under sec- tion 65(2)(h) as the payments were consideration for the abstaining of right to extract, remove or otherwise exploit the timber. It was further found that the payments could also be considered as “income derived from any other source whatsoever” under section 65(2)(l). With regard to section 74, the TRA held that there had been no “sale” and that the objectors still owned the timber and had not given anyone a licence or an easement or granted anyone the right to take the profits from it. Therefore sec- tion 74(2)(b) did not provide the objectors with a deduction and nor was the cost of the timber deductible under section 104. Liability for income tax - section 276 Case:BNZ Finance Limited v CIR and Nash, Wellington, CP 41/96 Fisher J. 24 October 1996. Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 276, section 25 Keywords:Liability, estoppel Summary:The plaintiff sought a declaration that it was not liable to pay income tax under section 276 of the Income Tax Act 1976 with respect to one of its former subsidi- aries. Two other issues were also put forward by the plaintiff. The first related to section 25 the second was concerned with estoppel. Facts:Between 1988 and 1992 a subsidiary of the plaintiff company derived income from investments in redeemable preference shares and debentures with various companies. The Commissioner originally assessed the subsidiary as having no liability for tax on the income derived. However the Commissioner’s subsequent examination of the scheme resulted in the conclusion that it was for the purposes of tax avoidance within section 99 of the Act. Consequently the Commissioner intended that the plaintiff would be liable for tax on the amended assessment income of its subsidiary for the 1988 to 1992 (inclusive) income years, pursuant to section 276. Decision:The High Court found that any steps taken by the Commissioner to assess or reassess a taxpayer are essentially procedural, crystallising the quantum of the assessable income and tax payable thereon. The underlying liability under the Act is present all along, with or without any assessment. The Court found that when the subsidiary was dissolved, it was “liable to be assessed” for the pur- poses of section 276. continued on page 24 In addition to the issue of section 276, the Court also examined whether it was too late for the Commissioner to have claimed for the 1989 and 1990 income years. It held that as the Commissioner had not yet made an effective amended assessment for the 1989 and 1990 years, and as the four year limit imposed by section 25 had expired with respect to those years, it was too late for the Com- missioner to issue an amended assessment for those years. The final issue before the Court concerned estoppel. The plaintiff argued that when the Commissioner signified, by way of letter, that he did not object to the dissolution of the subsidiary, he estopped himself from pursuing any further claim with respect to tax for which the company was then liable. On this point the Court held that firstly there is nothing inconsistent between the giving of a notice under section 335A agreeing to the dissolution of an original company on the one hand, and giving effect to a statutory liability automatically created for the new company under section 276(3) on the other. Secondly the Court found that in its view it was doubtful whether the Commissioner would have the power to estop himself in this context. Thirdly the Court held that there is no general foundation for such estoppel at common law. from page 23 Booklets available from Inland Revenue This list shows all of Inland Revenue’s information booklets as at the date of this Tax Information Bulletin.

However, we’re going to end Volume Eight at No.11 (December 1996) and start Volume Nine in January 1997. We’re doing this to synchronise the volume numbers as closely as possible with the binding ruling numbers, which work on a calendar year basis. It will also make references and filing easier in future years, because each volume number will equate to a calendar year. 1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Rifles, shotguns, pistols, firearms, fastening guns (explosive) - Depreciation Determination DEP20 In TIB Volume Eight, No.2 (August 1996) at pages 7 - 9, the Commissioner published a draft general depreciation determination for rifles, shotguns, pistols, firearms, and fastening guns (explosive). Two submissions were received on this draft. The first asked if air rifles and air pistols were to be included in the asset class of “Firearms” in the “Leisure” industry category. The second submission recommended that a new asset class for “paintball firearms” be inserted into the “Leisure” industry category. These issues have been considered, and the Commissioner has now issued the determination, as amended to take account of the above submissions. The determination is reproduced below, and may be cited as “Determination DEP20: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 20”. The new depreciation rates are based on the EULs set out in the determination below and residual values of 13.5% of cost. General Depreciation Determination DEP20 This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP20: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 20”. 1.

The Commissioner proposes to issue a general depreciation determination which will set the asset class for aquariums. The draft determination is reproduced below. The determination will set a new depreciation rate of 40% DV for the asset class “Aquariums”. The proposed new depreciation rate of 40% DV is based on an estimated useful life (“EUL”) of 4 years and a residual value of 13.5% of cost.

Special banking option for overseas pensions begins 1 April 1997 1 April 1997 has been set as the application date of recent amendments relating to a special banking option for New Zealand residents who receive United Kingdom social security pensions. The date was set by the Income Tax (Alternative Arrangement for Overseas Pensions) Commencement Order 1996 on 25 November 1996. The special banking option allows overseas pensions to be paid into a special bank account. The money is drawn down by the Department of Social Welfare, and in return the pensioner receives the full New Zealand Superannuation or Veteran’s pension. The Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Act 1996 amended sections CB 5 and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 so that pensions paid in this way would be treated as source deduction payments and exempted from tax. The date of application was to be fixed by the Governor General by Order in Council. See TIB Volume Eight, No.11 for further details on these amendments. Fringe benefit tax - prescribed interest rate decreased to 11.1% The prescribed rate of interest used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low interest employment-related loans has been decreased to 11.1% for the quarter beginning 1 October 1996. This rate will continue to apply to subsequent quarters until any further adjustment is made. The prescribed rate, down from 11.5%, is a reflection of the recent fall in market rates. 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Binding rulings This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995). You can order these publications free of charge from any Inland Revenue office. GST: input tax deductions for finance lease financiers and the appropriate method for section 21 adjustments Public Ruling - BR Pub 96/11 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 2(1) (definition of “input tax”), 3, 6, 8, 9, 14, 20, and 21 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the incurring of GST on goods and services acquired for the business of financing, by finance lease financiers who enter into finance leases with customers to finance the purchase or lease of goods. This includes: •GST incurred on goods the finance lease financier buys and which are the subject of the finance lease between financier and customer (for example, a car purchased from a car dealer and sold by way of hire purchase agreement to the customer). These goods are referred to as “finance lease goods” in the Ruling. •GST incurred on all other goods and services acquired by the finance lease financier (for example, head office, accounting, and administration goods and services). These goods and services are referred to as “general business goods and services” in the Ruling. For the purposes of the Ruling, a “finance lease financier” is a person whose business includes a substantial activity (which activity need not be the principal activity of the person) of financing the purchase or lease of goods by customers by way of finance leases. The term “finance lease” is not a legal term. It is a commercial term describing a lease or sale of finance lease goods for a fixed term when the lease rentals or purchase price instalments, and any other payments by the customer to the financier under the finance lease (such as a deposit or re- sidual value payment), relate to the value of the goods and not the value of their use. Under a finance lease, the total amount payable ensures that the financier recovers the capital cost of the goods and makes a commercial return on that capital. In ordinary commercial parlance, and for the purposes of this Ruling, a finance lease includes a hire purchase agreement. However, the Act does not define “finance lease” nor make any mention of whether a hire purchase agree- ment is included within the term. 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) A finance lease financier is most likely to be a finance company. It is not in- tended that the term cover persons who, as an adjunct of their business of selling goods, undertake the provision of finance to customers to encourage sales. However, the term is intended to cover a company whose business consists largely of financing the purchase or lease of goods when that company is in a group of companies for GST purposes. This is notwithstanding the deeming provisions of section 55(7). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •GST incurred on finance lease goods acquired by a finance lease financier will be deductible as “input tax”, as the goods are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. •GST incurred on general business goods and services acquired by a finance lease financier will not be deductible as “input tax”, because the principal purpose of acquiring such goods and services will be for making exempt supplies. •In respect of general business goods and services, if there is a partial taxable use of goods and services for which no input tax claim has been available, section 21(5) will apply. The appropriate method for the finance lease finan- cier to apply in determining the percentage of taxable use of general business goods and services is one of the following: –The Time Apportionment Method; or –The Profit Derivation Method; or –The 10% Fixed Percentage Method. The Time Apportionment Method calculates the percentage of taxable and exempt use of the general business goods and services by calculating the percentage of staff time spent on taxable and exempt supplies respectively. Financiers must have records to support the figure they calculate. The Profit Derivation Method calculates the percentage of taxable and exempt use of the general business goods and services by calculating the percentage of the financier’s gross profit that comes from taxable and exempt supplies respectively. Financiers must have records to support the figure they calcu- late. The 10% Fixed Percentage Method does not involve calculating the percent- age of taxable and exempt application of general business goods and services. Instead, it assumes that the general business goods and services are applied 10% in making taxable supplies. This method may be used by financiers for administrative convenience. This method allows financiers to make section 21(5) adjustments without records to support the calculation. It is a method of last resort when financiers do not have records to calculate either of the meth- ods described above. A financier may not use the 10% Fixed Percentage Method when records are held that support either of the other two methods, and those records disclose taxable use of below 10%. •If a section 21 method more accurate than those discussed above exists, it may be used in place of the methods above. Where taxpayers are unclear if the section 21 adjustment method they propose to use is more accurate than those discussed above, they may wish to confirm its appropriateness with their local Inland Revenue office. continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 96/11 (“the Ruling”). Background For more discussion on the GST treatment of finance leases generally refer to the policy statement entitled “GST and finance leases - classification, method of accounting and treatment of residual value clause” in TIB Volume Eight, No. 1 (July 1996) at page 1. This ruling and that policy statement are consistent and should be considered together. Legislation Section 2 defines “input tax”. Generally, “input tax” is the tax charged on supplies of goods and services made to a registered person when the supplies are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Section 6(1) defines “taxable activity”. A taxable activity is any activity carried on continuously or regularly, whether for pecuniary profit or not, and involves the supply of goods and services to other persons for consideration. Section 8(1) imposes GST on the supply (other than an exempt supply) of goods and services, in New Zealand, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person. Section 3(1) states: For the purposes of this Act, the term “financial services” means any one or more of the following activities:.. (c)The issue, allotment, drawing, acceptance, endorsement, or transfer of ownership of a debt security:... (f)The provision of credit under a credit contract:.. Section 14 states: The following supplies of goods and services shall be exempt from tax: (a)The supply of any financial services (together with the supply of any other goods and services, supplied by the supplier of those financial services, which are reasonably incidental and necessary to that supply of financial services), not being- ... (ii)A supply of goods and services which (although being part of a supply of goods and services which, but for this subparagraph, would be an exempt supply under this paragraph) is not in itself, as between the supplier of that first-mentioned supply and the recipient, a supply of financial services in respect of which this paragraph applies:... Section 9 determines the time at which any supply takes place. Section 9(1) states the general rule - it deems a supply to take place at the earlier of the time the supplier issues an invoice or receives a payment for that supply. The remaining subsections of section 9 provide exceptions to this general rule. Section 9(3) states: Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1) or subsection (2) of this section,- (a)Where goods are supplied under an agreement to hire...they shall be deemed to be successively supplied for successive parts of the period of the agreement ... , and each of the successive supplies shall be deemed to take place when a payment becomes due or is received, whichever is the earlier: ... (b)Where goods and services are supplied under a hire purchase agreement (as defined in the Hire Purchase Act 1971), that supply shall be deemed to take place at the time the agreement is entered into: (c)For the purposes of this subsection, the term “agreement to hire” means an agreement for the bailment of goods for hire and includes a lease of goods and a rental agreement; but does not include- (i)An agreement under which the property in the goods passes to the bailee or which expressly contemplates that the property in the goods will pass to the bailee; or (ii)A hire purchase agreement (as defined in the Hire Purchase Act 1971). Section 20(3) allows for the deduction of input tax from amounts of output tax. Section 21 states: (1)Subject to section 5(3) of this Act, to the extent that goods and services applied by a registered person for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies are subsequently applied by that registered person for a purpose other than that of making taxable supplies, they shall be deemed to be supplied by that regis- tered person in the course of that taxable activity to the extent that they are so applied:.. ... The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 February 1997 to 31 March 2000. This Ruling is signed by me on the 25th day of November 1996. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 96/11 from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) (5) For the purposes of this Act, where no deduction has been made pursuant to section 20(3) of this Act in respect of or in relation to goods and services acquired or produced ... by a person other than for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, and any such goods and services are subsequently applied in any taxable period by that person...those goods and services shall be deemed to be supplied in that taxable period to that person...and the Commissioner shall, to the extent to which those goods and services are so applied, allow that person...to make a deduction under section 20(3) of this Act... Application of the Legislation Output tax on supplies made by finance lease financiers Finance lease financiers make both taxable and exempt supplies pursuant to finance leases (unless they are only receiving assignments of hire purchase or other finance leases from retailers in which case the whole transaction is exempt, section 3(1)(c)). The taxable supply is the supply of goods pursuant to the finance lease. The supply of goods is a taxable supply because the financier’s activity of selling or leasing goods is within the definition of “taxable activity” in section 6(1)(a) and is subject to GST under section 8(1). A financier’s taxable supply of goods is not “reasonably incidental and necessary” to the exempt supply of financial services in terms of section 14(a). A financier does not make a supply of goods “reasonably incidental and necessary” to the supply of credit. The significant value and volume of the goods supplied and the effort incurred in dealing in the goods suggest that the goods are not reasonably incidental and necessary to the supply of credit in the sense intended by section 14(a). Furthermore, the words of section 14(a) that make some supplies exempt supplies if they are “reasonably inci- dental and necessary” to a supply of financial services came about as a result of the Court of Appeal decision in the Databank litigation. The amendment was in- tended to cover supplies that were truly incidental and minor to a supply of financial services, rather than the situation with finance lease financiers who sell or lease goods to such a degree that they are sufficient to be significant supplies in their own right. Therefore, finance lease financiers must account for GST output tax on their supplies of goods. For hire purchase agreements a financier must return output tax in the same taxable period as the input tax deduction, because of the time of supply rule in section 9(3)(b) and the section 20(3) rules on input tax deductions. How- ever, for agreements to hire the time of supply rules in section 9(3)(a) apply, and for other finance leases the general time of supply rule in section 9(1) may apply. See the discussion of time of supply rules in “GST and finance leases - classification, method of accounting and treatment of residual value clause” TIB Volume Eight, No. 1 (July 1996) for further discussion of these points. The supply of credit is an exempt supply under section 3(1)(f). Therefore, finance lease financiers do not need to account for GST on their supplies of credit. Input tax on goods and services acquired by finance lease financiers For GST to be deductible as input tax, it must be on goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. The definition of “input tax” means that whether GST is deductible as input tax is an all-or-nothing test: either GST is fully deductible as input tax or it is not deductible at all. There can be no partial deduction as input tax. Principal purpose of acquiring finance lease goods is for making taxable supplies GST on finance lease goods acquired by a finance lease financier will be deductible as “input tax” as the goods are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. The goods are acquired with the purpose of selling or leasing them to the customer, a taxable supply. For example, when a hire purchase financier buys a car from a dealer for sale to a customer, that sale to the customer, pursuant to a finance lease, is a taxable supply. Principal purpose of acquiring general business goods and services is for making exempt supplies A finance lease financier’s principal purpose of acquir- ing general business goods and services is for making exempt supplies. It is the supply of credit that generates income, more so than the supply of goods. This means the principal purpose of acquiring general business goods and services is to make exempt supplies; CIR v BNZ Investment Advisory Services (1994) 16 NZTC 11,111. Therefore, the tax charged on the general business goods and services is not “input tax” and no deduction is available under section 20(3). In the BNZ Investment Advisory Services case the taxpayer offered investment advice to customers for which a small charge was made (taxable supplies). The taxpayer also collected a commission on any investment subsequently made through it by those customers (exempt supplies). For the periods in question, income from advice was minor compared to commission income. In carrying on its taxable activity, the taxpayer acquired goods and services and sought to deduct the GST on them, claiming its principal purpose in so acquiring was to make taxable supplies of investment advice. The Commissioner considered the principal purpose of acquiring such goods and services was to make a profit from its business. The taxpayer’s business income was almost totally earned from commissions, that is, earned from making exempt supplies. The High Court found for the Commissioner. Doogue J considered the principal purpose of the taxpayer in acquiring the goods and services was not for a single goal of offering investment advice to customers, but for the purpose of continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) ment of a hire purchase agreement from a retailer). For example, a financier should make a section 21(5) adjustment when applying a computer system for recording details of the taxable supply of goods, and also for the ongoing monitoring of the credit contract. The issue then arises as to how the percentage of exempt and taxable use, which will form the basis of the section 21(5) adjustment, should be measured. Section 21 adjustment methods: standard methods Whatever method is adopted to make section 21(5) adjustments, that method should, as accurately as possible, reflect the extent to which general business goods and services are applied in making taxable and non-taxable supplies. The registered person should adopt a method that correctly reflects the application of the general business goods and services. The Commissioner has identified the following adjust- ment methods for general use (see the GST Guide - GST 600, or Technical Rulings 110.4). They are: •Direct Attribution Method; or •Turnover Method; or •A special method. If the Direct Attribution or Turnover Methods are not well suited to a specific case, a special method should be used. The Commissioner considers that neither the Direct Attribution nor the Turnover Method is a suitable method for a finance lease financier to use. The Direct Attribution Method allocates individual goods and services to taxable or non-taxable supplies on the basis of actual use. Direct Attribution requires the individual goods and services to be applied exclusively in making a taxable or non-taxable supply. When particular general business goods and services are applied to make both taxable and non-taxable supplies (as may often be the case with a finance lease financier), it is not appropriate to use the Direct Attribution Method. If it is not appropriate to use the Direct Attribution Method, a registered person may use the Turnover Method. This calculates taxable and non-taxable use of general business goods and services by dividing the total value of exempt supplies by the total value of all supplies. The figure that results from this calculation is the percentage of supplies that are exempt. (This figure is then used to determine the appropriate section 21 adjustment.) In the finance lease situation, the Turnover Method does not accurately reflect the application of the general business goods and services in making taxable and exempt supplies. The high value of goods supplied under finance leases, and the consequent high gross value of taxable supplies, means the Turnover Method gives a high percentage of taxable supplies relative to achieving income from GST-exempt services (page 11,117 of the judgment). Accordingly, the GST was not deductible as input tax. The conclusion that GST on general business goods and services acquired by a financier is not “input tax” derives further support from the United Kingdom’s VAT position. In an agreement between the UK Cus- toms & Excise and the UK Finance Houses Association Ltd, for the purposes of agreeing a level of partial exemption, the parties agreed that only 15% of the input tax on goods and services used in providing hire purchase credit related to taxable supplies. Thus in the UK, where a partial input tax deduction is possible, the authorities and trade body were both of the view that the principal purpose of hire purchase financiers acquiring general business goods and services was for making exempt supplies. The financier can not make input tax deductions on general business goods and services, because general business goods and services are not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Section 21 adjustments If a registered person who applies goods and services for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies subsequently applies those goods and services for making other than taxable supplies, a section 21(1) adjustment is required. There will be a deemed taxable supply to the extent of the application to non-taxable supplies. When the principal purpose of acquiring or producing goods and services is to make non-taxable supplies, and the goods and services are subsequently applied to making taxable supplies, section 21(5) allows a deduc- tion from output tax to the extent to which those goods and services are so applied. The section 21(5) adjust- ment is based on the lesser of the cost of the goods and services or the open market value of the supply of those goods and services. Section 21(5) adjustment methods are intended to measure the taxable use of goods and services acquired for making non-taxable supplies. Application of section 21 to finance lease financiers Finance lease financiers do not need to make sec- tion 21(1) adjustments for finance lease goods as the goods are used solely in making taxable supplies. For example, if a financier acquires a car from a dealer and then sells it to a customer pursuant to a hire purchase agreement, the supply of the car is a taxable supply without any exempt application. However, a finance lease financier may need to make section 21(5) adjustments for general business goods and services if the general business goods and services are applied to making exempt supplies of credit and also taxable supplies of goods (there are no taxable supplies of goods when the financier simply receives an assign- from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) exempt supplies. In reality, the general business goods and services are applied for making taxable supplies for only a small percentage of their use. Any taxable use generally requires little time or effort. The general business goods and services are applied mainly in making exempt supplies of credit. As the Direct Attribution and Turnover Methods are unsuitable methods for finance lease financiers to use, such financiers should use a special method. (There are many possible special methods, the three most appropri- ate methods for finance lease financiers are discussed below.) Appropriate special methods There are at least three appropriate section 21(5) adjustment methods finance lease financiers may use in calculating the adjustment for general business goods and services. They are: •The Time Apportionment Method; or •The Profit Derivation Method; or •The 10% Fixed Percentage Method. The Time Apportionment Method calculates the percentage of taxable and exempt use of the general business goods and services by calculating the percent- age of staff time spent on taxable and exempt supplies respectively. This gives a better reflection of the mixed use of general business goods and services than the Turnover Method because it focuses on the reality of the business earning income from exempt supplies. Finan- ciers must have records to support the figure they calculate. Use of such a method does not conflict with the BNZ Investment Advisory Services decision. In that case the High Court rejected use of a “time and effort” approach to determine the principal purpose of acquiring goods and services, because such an approach was completely different to the way the company earned income through the making of exempt supplies. It confused the means by which the taxpayer achieved its purpose (time largely spent on making taxable supplies) with its purpose (earning income from exempt supplies). Here the purpose of earning income from exempt supplies and use of a time and effort method will be consistent, as both the majority of income and the majority of time and effort relate to exempt supplies. The Profit Derivation Method calculates the percentage of taxable and exempt use of the general business goods and services by calculating the percentage of the financier’s gross profit that comes from taxable and exempt supplies respectively. This gives a better reflec- tion of the mixed use of general business goods and services than the Turnover Method because it reflects the importance of the particular supplies in earning the income that is the purpose of undertaking finance lease financing. Financiers must have records to support the figure they calculate. The Profit Derivation Method requires a profit to be made from the on-sale of the car to the customer, rather than from normal credit charges. The 10% Fixed Percentage Method does not involve calculating the percentage of taxable and exempt application of general business goods and services. Instead, it assumes that the general business goods and services are applied 10% in making taxable supplies. The Commissioner will allow use of this method by financiers for administrative convenience. This method allows financiers to make section 21(5) adjustments without records to support the calculation. As suggested by empirical evidence and the UK VAT agreement discussed above, this gives an appropriate reflection of the mixed use of general business goods and services because it is a reasonable estimate of taxable use. If financiers have good evidence of higher taxable use of general business goods and services, the Commissioner may accept a higher figure for section 21(5) purposes. A financier may not use the 10% Fixed Percentage Method when records are held that support either of the other two methods, and those records disclose taxable use of below 10%. When a section 21 method more accurate than those discussed above exists, it may be used in place of the methods above. If taxpayers are unclear as to whether the section 21 adjustment method they propose to use is more accurate than those discussed above, they may wish to confirm its appropriateness with their local Inland Revenue office. Examples Example 1 Company A finances the acquisition of motor vehicles. Over the last twelve months it has bought and on-sold $10,500,000 worth of motor vehicles under hire purchase agreements. Over the same period it earned $1,700,000 in net interest income from its financing activity. It earns no profit from the sale of motor vehicles. Company A has a staff of 25. The majority of the staff are involved in the credit side of the business. However, one staff member is employed solely in the inspection and sale of motor vehicles. Another staff member, spends about 50% of her time assisting in the inspection and sale of motor vehicles. Company A takes a full input tax deduction for cars it buys and then sells to customers (finance lease goods), but wants to know the appropriate way to account for GST on general business goods and services it acquires. Company A can not deduct the GST on general business goods and services as “input tax”. How- ever, it may make a section 21(5) adjustment because of partial taxable application of the general business goods and services. If Company A adopts the Time Apportionment Method, taxable use will amount to 6% of the general business goods and services (1.5 employees out of 25 employees). Therefore, exempt use will amount to 94% of the general business goods and services. continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Example 2 Company B is a finance company that receives assignments of hire purchase agreements from retailers. Company B may not make any input tax deduction. The assignment of the hire purchase agreement is an exempt supply of a financial service, on which there is no GST. Company B makes no taxable supplies, so it may not make any input tax deduction for GST charged on goods and services supplied to its business. GST: time of supply when payment is made by cheque, credit card, charge card or irrevocable letter of credit Public Ruling - BR Pub 96/12 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 9(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the supply of goods and services by a supplier to a recipient when the recipient pays by cheque, credit card, or charge card and no invoice has been issued by the supplier or recipient before payment. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: •When payment for a supply is received by the supplier in the form of a cheque, “payment” occurs for the purposes of section 9(1) when the cheque is handed over or received, unless the cheque is subsequently dishonoured. If the cheque is dishonoured, “payment” has never occurred. This rule applies equally to post-dated cheques. •If the supplier and recipient are associated persons, the Commissioner will need from the supplier as evidence of payment, details of the cheque’s pres- entation and honouring by the bank on which it is drawn, •When the supplier receives payment for a supply by means of a credit or charge card, “payment” occurs for the purposes of section 9(1) on the date the credit or charge card transaction takes place. •When the supplier accepts payment for a supply by way of an irrevocable letter of credit, “payment” occurs for the purposes of section 9(1) on the date the provision of the letter of credit is accepted as performance or payment. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1999 to payments that are received by GST registered persons during that period for the supply of goods and services. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of November 1996. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Applying the Profit Derivation Method would give a figure of 0% taxable use and 100% exempt use. This method does not best reflect the actual applica- tion of the general business goods and services. Company A cannot make a section 21(5) adjust- ment for 10% taxable use using the 10% Fixed Percentage Method as it has records supporting one of the other methods. Therefore, it makes a section 21(5) adjustment for the 6% taxable use of the general business goods and services on the basis of the Time Apportionment Method. from page 9 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 96/12 (“the Ruling”). Legislation Section 9(1) states: Subject to this Act, for the purposes of this Act a supply of goods and services shall be deemed to take place at the earlier of the time an invoice is issued by the supplier or the recipient or the time any payment is received by the supplier, in respect of that supply. “Payment” is not defined in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Section 9(2)(a) provides a special time of supply rule for associated persons in certain circumstances. Section 9(2) states: Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1) of this section, a supply of goods and services shall be deemed to take place- (a)Where the supplier and the recipient are associated persons,- (i)In the case of a supply of goods which are to be removed, at the time of the removal; and (ii)In the case of a supply of goods which are not to be removed, at the time when they are made available to the recipient; and (iii)In the case of a supply of services, at the time the services are performed: Provided that this paragraph shall not apply in any case where an invoice is issued, or any payment is made, in respect of that supply, on or before the last day for furnishing the return in relation to the taxable period during which, but for this proviso, that supply would have been made: Section 2 defines “Associated persons”: “Associated persons” has the meaning assigned to that term by section OD 8 (4) of the Income Tax Act 1994; and in- cludes- (a)Any 2 persons, one of whom is trustee of a trust under which the other has benefited or is eligible to benefit, except where, in relation to a supply of goods and services, - (i)The trustee is a charitable or non-profit body with wholly or principally charitable, benevolent, philan- thropic, or cultural purposes; and (ii)The supply is made in carrying out those purposes: (b)Any 2 persons who are relatives as defined in paragraph (a) of the definition of that term in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. (c)Any company and any person where the person is associ- ated with another person who is associated with the company: Provided that, for the purposes of this Act, any reference to the words “25 percent” in section OD 8 (4) of the Income Tax Act 1994 shall be deemed to be a reference to the words “10 percent”: Application of legislation Cheques The issue of payment by cheque has not been considered by the New Zealand courts in the context of GST. However, the courts have considered the issue in the income tax context. They have held that payment is made at the time a cheque is handed over or received, rather than when it is presented at the bank and hon- oured. A cheque that is subsequently dishonoured is treated as if payment were never made. The authorities on when a cheque is payment were reviewed in Nicks Ltd v Taylor Ltd \[1962\] NZLR 286. Hardie Boys J accepted the proposition that the giving of a cheque for a debt is payment conditional on the cheque being met, and if the cheque is met it is an actual payment ab initio, that is, from the moment it is delivered. Payment by cheque was also considered by the High Court in Ullrich v C of IR \[1964\] NZLR 386. At page 388 Perry J said: When a cheque is handed over in payment can that be regarded as a payment to the person receiving the cheque? My view is that if the course of dealing between the parties contemplates a payment which may be by cheque then the handing over of a cheque would be payment on the date of handing over. There is a line of English VAT Tribunal decisions that supports the contrary view that a payment by cheque is received only when it is presented and met by the recipient’s bank. The VAT cases are considered to over- emphasise the need for physical cash funds to be available, and they ignore the fact that the scheme of the Act creates a time of supply well before a cheque is even written out or handed over, i.e. when an invoice is issued. The Commissioner does not consider that the VAT decisions should be followed in New Zealand. The New Zealand case law on payment by cheque is based on general legal principles. Nothing in sec- tion 9(1) indicates that payment by cheque should occur at a later time in the context of GST. Cases such as L67 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,391 and N24 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,199 have indicated that normal commercial contingencies do not delay the time of supply for GST purposes, and provide further support for the view that payment occurs when a cheque is handed over. In addition to holding that a deposit is “any payment” and sufficient to trigger the time of supply for the whole of the value of the supply, Case L67 determined that payment occurred on the day of the auction when the contract was signed and the deposit handed over. Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 96/12 continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Post-dated cheques A post-dated cheque is an instrument that bears a date later than the date of its issue. Under section 13(2) of the Bills of Exchange Act 1908, a cheque is not invalid by reason only that it is post-dated. The Court of Appeal in Pollock v BNZ \[1901\] 20 NZLR 174 considered the effect of a post-dated cheque. At page 182 the Court held that: By section 13 of “The Bills of Exchange Act, 1883”, the post- dating of a bill of exchange does not invalidate the instrument. It is in effect a bill of exchange payable on demand with a post-date upon which demand is to be made. Because post-dated cheques are cheques under the Bills of Exchange Act 1908, the Commissioner’s view is that they should be subject to the same rules as cheques that are not post-dated. This means that if a post-dated cheque is accepted by a supplier, “payment” occurs for the purposes of section 9(1) at the time the post-dated cheque is handed over or received. (The supplier must account for output tax on this date.) A post-dated cheque that is subsequently dishonoured is treated as if payment were never made. Irrevocable letters of credit The principles applied above are further supported by the recent decision in Case S99 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,622 which dealt with the timing of a payment for a build- ing’s sale and purchase made by irrevocable letter of credit. In that case Willy DJ held that the time of payment was when the letter of credit was provided and the offer became unconditional, rather than six months later when the letter of credit was honoured. The letter was unconditional, irrevocable, and extinguished the vendor’s rights to recover payment from the purchaser. These rights were replaced with rights “only against the bank”. This case is not being appealed by the Commissioner. “Payment” will occur when a supplier accepts an irrevocable letter of credit as performance or payment. This is consistent with the treatment of payments made by other instruments, as that is the point in time when the supplier’s rights against the purchaser are extin- guished or suspended. Associated persons Section 9(2)(a) provides a special time of supply rule for associated persons in certain circumstances. When the associated persons’ deemed time of supply rule in section 9(2)(a) does not apply, the above rules on cheques and post-dated cheques apply. For the purposes of section 9(1) and 9(2)(a), “payment” occurs when the cheque is handed over or received. If the cheque is subsequently dishonoured, “payment” has never oc- curred. However, if the supplier and recipient are associated persons, the Commissioner will need from the supplier as evidence of payment, details of the cheque’s presenta- tion and honouring by the bank on which it is drawn. This is merely to provide evidence of the transaction occurring in an arm’s length fashion, consistent with the intent of section 9(2)(a). It does not alter the timing of the “payment” from rules applying to third parties. Credit and charge cards When a credit or charge card is used to purchase goods and services, the customer tenders the card as a means of payment. The retailer takes details of the customer’s card and the purchase. The customer, the retailer, and the credit or charge card issuer receive a copy of a form containing these details. The retailer’s account is credited by the issuer with the amount of the purchase, less any discount agreed upon. A statement is sent by the card issuer to the customer, who pays the amount of the invoices. The Commissioner’s view is that when goods and services are supplied by a supplier and the recipient pays by credit or charge card, “payment” occurs for the purposes of section 9(1) on the date the credit or charge card transaction takes place. This is the only time at which payment can occur. Once the supplier has accepted the credit or charge card and completed the sales voucher, the recipient is absolutely discharged from any liability to pay the supplier for those goods or services. This position is supported by the English Court of Appeal decisions in Re Charge Card Services Ltd \[1988\] 3 All ER 702 and Customs and Excise Commis- sioners v Diners Club Ltd and another \[1989\] 2 All ER 385. At page 393 of the Diners Club decision Woolf LJ said: As counsel for the taxpayer companies accepts, that decision (Woolf LJ is referring to the earlier decision in Re Charge Card Services Ltd) is binding authority that where a card is produced by a cardholder and accepted by a retailer and the cardholder signs the sales voucher the cardholder is uncondi- tionally discharged from liability to pay to the retailer the amount of the cost of the goods and services. Other references to “payment” The principles discussed above, in relation to when “payment” occurs for time of supply purposes, apply equally to the issue of when “payment” occurs for the purpose of input tax deductions made under sections 20(3)(a)(ia) and 20(3)(b)(i), dealing respectively with secondhand goods input tax deductions and payments or hybrid basis deductions for input tax to the extent that payment has been made. Examples In the following examples the GST registered persons account for GST on a payments basis. Regardless of the accounting basis, an input tax deduction cannot be claimed unless the requirements of section 20(2) are met. from page 11 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Example 1 A GST registered retailer owns a dress shop. On 28 July 1996: •A customer purchases a dress for $600 and pays by cheque. •The retailer buys 50 new clothes hangers from A Ltd. She pays by cheque. The cheque is for $200 and is post-dated for 3 August 1996. The retailer’s taxable period ends on 31 July 1996. At 31 July 1996, she has not banked the cheque for $600 received for the dress on 28 July 1996. A Ltd’s taxable period also ends on 31 July 1996. At 31 July, A Ltd has not banked the cheque post-dated for 3 August 1996. For the purposes of section 9(1), “payment” occurs when a cheque is handed over or received, provided the cheque is subsequently honoured. The GST implications are as follows: •The retailer must account for output tax on the $600 she received for the dress, even though she has not banked the cheque. •The retailer can deduct input tax in respect of the $200 paid to A Ltd, even though the cheque is post-dated for 3 August 1996 and has not been honoured. •A Ltd must account for output tax on the $200 received for the clothes hangers, even though the cheque is post-dated for 3 August 1996. Example 2 The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the retailer’s bank informs her on 7 August 1996 that the cheque written by the customer for $600 on 28 July 1996 has been dishonoured. Because the cheque has been dishonoured, payment has never occurred. If at 7 August 1996 the retailer has not submitted her GST return for the taxable period ended 31 July 1996, she should ignore the cheque. The retailer does not need to account for output tax on the $600 received for the dress. If at 7 August 1996 the retailer has submitted her GST return for the taxable period ended 31 July 1996, she should amend the output tax accounted for by notifying the Commissioner in writing, or issue the Commissioner with a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (see page 17 of TIB Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996)). Example 3 A GST registered retailer owns a lawn mower shop. On 8 August 1996: •A customer buys a lawn mower for $800 and pays by credit card. •The retailer buys 10 metres of astro turf from C Ltd for a window display. The astro turf costs $170, and the retailer pays with the business’s credit card. The retailer’s and C Ltd’s taxable periods end on 31 August 1996. For the purposes of section 9(1), payment occurs on the date of the relevant transaction, i.e. 8 August 1996. The GST implications are as follows: •The retailer must account for output tax on the $800 received for the lawn mower in the taxable period ending 31 August 1996. •C Ltd must account for output tax on the $170 received for the astro turf in the taxable period ending 31 August 1996. •The retailer can deduct input tax on the $170 in the taxable period ending 31 August 1996. Associated non-profit bodies - $1,000 income tax exemption Public Ruling - BR Pub 95/1A Note (not part of ruling): Public ruling BR Pub 95/1 (see TIB Volume Seven, No.2 \[August 1995\] at page 4) con- cerned section CB 4 (1)(k) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section 10(3) of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 repeals section CB 4 (1)(k), with effect from the 1997-98 income year. Section 91G(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 states that when a taxation law that is the subject of a binding ruling is repealed, the ruling ceases to apply to the extent of, and from the effective date of, that repeal. This means that public ruling BR Pub 95/1 will not apply to the 1997-98 income year and subsequent income years, but will apply to the 1995-96 and 1996-97 income years. Public ruling BR Pub 95/1A replaces public ruling BR Pub 95/1 with effect from the 1997-98 income year. It is intended that the cessation of public ruling BR Pub 95/1 and its replacement by public ruling BR Pub 95/1A should have no practical effect on the application of the taxation law contained in the rulings to the relevant taxpayers. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the claiming by a non-profit body associated with a national or principal organisation (“associated non-profit body”) of a deduction under section DJ 17 of the lesser of $1,000 or the body’s net income. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: The tax deduction under section DJ 17 for the lesser of $1,000 or a body’s net income is available to associated non-profit bodies which are separately identifi- able taxable entities and which satisfy the other requirements of section DJ 17. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to income derived by an associated non-profit body during the period of the 1998 income year, and applies regardless of the taxpay- er’s balance date. This Ruling is signed by me on the 8th day of December 1996. Jeffrey Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 95/1A from page 13 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusion reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 95/1A (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Ruling BR Pub 95/1 (TIB Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) at page 4 under the heading “Associated non-profit bodies - $1,000 income tax exemption”). The Ruling replaces and supersedes that earlier ruling with effect from the 1997-98 income year. Background The former section CB 4 (1)(k) of the Income Tax Act 1994 provided that non-profit bodies were eligible for a $1,000 income tax exemption. This section was re- pealed by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996, and section DJ 17 was enacted in its place. The repeal of section CB 4 (1)(k) and the enactment of section DJ 17 are a change in mechanism only and involve no change to the actual tax position of non-profit bodies. Generally, the income of a non-profit body is subject to income tax. Non-profit bodies can claim a deduction under section DJ 17 for the lesser of $1,000 or the amount that would be the net income of the body, in the absence of that section. Types of organisations which may be eligible to claim the tax deduction under section DJ 17 are: •Trade associations. •Progressive associations. •Political parties. •Social clubs (including those amateur sports bodies that do not qualify for an income tax exemption under section CB 4 (1)(h)).

For an organisation to qualify for the section DJ 17 deduction, the organisation must not be carried on for the profit or gain of any member, and its constituting document must prohibit the organisation from making any distribution whether by way of money, property, or otherwise to its members or persons associated with the members. Associated non-profit bodies are also eligible for the section DJ 17 deduction Section DJ 17 may also apply to bodies that are associ- ated with a national or principal non-profit organisation (referred to in the Ruling as “associated non-profit body/ies”). It is not possible to define exactly what an associated non-profit body is for the purposes of the Ruling, but examples are regional or district branches of a national office. The fact that an associated non-profit body shares its constituting document with other “aligned” or “group” organisations does not prevent the section DJ 17 deduction from applying to it, provided its constituting documents meet the relevant criteria set out in DJ 17 and it is able to demonstrate that it is a sepa- rately identifiable taxable entity. Whether an associated non-profit body can be identified as a separately identifiable taxable entity is a question of fact, and each case must be considered on its own facts. The Commissioner considers that an associated non- profit body will be a separately identifiable taxable entity if, for example: •It keeps separate financial statements; and •It keeps separate records of receipts and payments; and •Its activities are not just incidental to the national or principal body’s activities; and •It is situated in a geographical setting that is distinct from the national or principal body. In addition to these characteristics, section DJ 17 requires that: •The associated non-profit body is not carried on for the purposes of profit or gain to any proprietor, member, or shareholder; and •The constituting documents of the associated non- profit body prohibit the organisation from making any distribution, whether by way of money, property, or otherwise, to any proprietor, member, or shareholder of the organisation. Relationship between the “unit trust” and “qualifying trust” definitions Public Ruling - BR Pub 95/5A Note (not part of ruling): Public ruling BR Pub 95/5 (see TIB Volume Seven, No.5 \[November 1995\] at page 5) concerned, in part, the definition of “qualifying trust” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section 412(2) of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 amends section OB 1 and replaces the definition of “qualify- ing trust” with effect from the 1997-98 income year. Section 91G(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 states that where a taxation law that is the subject of a binding ruling is amended, or repealed in part only, in a manner that alters the way in which the taxation law applies, the ruling ceases to apply to the extent of, and from the effective date of, the amendment or partial repeal. This means that public ruling BR Pub 95/5 will not apply to unit trusts which are created in the 1997-98 income year and subsequent income years. It will apply to such trusts that are created in the 1996-97 income year. Public ruling BR Pub 95/5A replaces public ruling BR Pub 95/5 with effect from the 1997-98 income year. It is intended that the cessation of public ruling BR Pub 95/5 and its replacement by public ruling BR Pub 95/5A should have no practical effect on the application of the taxation law contained in the rulings to the relevant taxpayers. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 unless otherwise stated.

How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: Trusts that fall within both the definition of “qualifying trust” and the definition of “unit trust” in the Income Tax Act 1994 are excluded from the “trust rules”. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from the 1997-98 income year to the 1999-2000 income year. This Ruling is signed by me on the 8th day of December 1996. Jeffrey Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 95/5A from page 15 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusion reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 95/5A (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Ruling BR 95/5 (in TIB Volume Seven, No.5 (November 1995) at page 5 under the heading Relationship between the “unit trust” and “qualifying trust” definitions). The Ruling supersedes and replaces that earlier ruling with effect from the 1997-98 income year. Background Some taxpayers are unsure of the relationship between the unit trust and qualifying trust definitions. This ruling provides clarification. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 CF 34A DF 7166 HE 1211 HH 1 (8)226(10) HH 3 (5)227(6) OB 1211 OB 1226(1) OZ 1 “trust rules”227-233 Section OB 1 defines the terms “qualifying trust” and “unit trust”. Section OB 1 also defines “employee share purchase scheme” as meaning: a scheme approved for the time being by the Commissioner for the purposes of section DF 7. Section OZ 1 defines the “trust rules”. Broadly, these rules apply to qualifying trusts, non-qualifying trusts, and foreign trusts, but not to unit trusts. The definitions of “qualifying trust” and “unit trust” and a brief summary of their respective tax treatments are discussed below. Qualifying trust Section OB 1 defines a “qualifying trust” as: •With the exception of a superannuation fund, a trust in respect of which in all income years, commencing with the income year during which a settlement was first made on the terms of that trust until the income year in which the distribution is made: –No amount of trustee income was only non- resident withholding income; or –Neither section BD 1 (2)(c) nor section HH 4 (3B) have applied to the trustee of the trust to exclude from gross income any amount derived outside New Zealand, and all of the trustee’s obligations in respect of the trustee’s income tax liability have been satisfied: •Including a superannuation fund. Section BD 1 (2)(c) excludes an amount from a taxpay- er’s gross income if it is a foreign-sourced amount and the taxpayer is a non-resident when it is derived. Section HH 4 (3B) excludes an amount from a New Zealand resident trustee’s gross income if: 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) •That amount is foreign-sourced income; and •No settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year; and •The trust is neither: –a superannuation fund; nor –a testamentary trust or an inter vivos trust where any settlor of the trust died resident in New Zealand, whether in that income year or other- wise. The effect of a trust being a qualifying trust is, broadly, that, under section HH 3 (5), distributions from qualify- ing trusts other than beneficiary income are not gross income of the beneficiaries. Unit trust Section OB 1 defines a “unit trust” as: any scheme or arrangement, whether made before or after the commencement of this Act, that is made for the purpose or has the effect of providing facilities for the participation, as beneficiaries under a trust, by subscribers, purchasers, or contributors, in income and gains (whether in the nature of capital or income) arising from the money, investments, and other property that are for the time being subject to the trust; but does not include - (a)A trust for the benefit of debenture holders; or (b)The Common Fund of the Public Trustee or any Group Investment Fund established by the Public Trustee; or (c)The Common Fund of the Maori Trustee; or (d)Any Group Investment Fund established under the Trustees Companies Act 1967; or (e)Any friendly society registered under the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act 1982; or (f)Any superannuation fund; or (g)Any employee share purchase scheme; or (h)Any other trust of any specified kind that is declared by the Governor-General by Order in Council, not to be a unit trust for the purposes of section HE 1: Section HE 1 treats a unit trust as a company for tax purposes. The interests of the unit holders are deemed to be shares. The unit holders are deemed to be sharehold- ers, and the income derived by the trustee is deemed to be income derived by the unit trust. Distributions derived by unit holders are treated as dividends, subject to section CF 3 which excludes certain items from the definition of dividends. The dividends can have imputation credits attached. Application of the Legislation Relationship of unit trusts and qualifying trusts A unit trust could fall within the definition of qualifying trust. However, if an entity meets all the requirements of the definition of unit trust, it falls outside the trust rules and is treated as a unit trust for tax purposes. HH 1 (8) expressly excludes unit trusts from the application of the trust rules. To constitute a unit trust for tax purposes, an entity must meet the following requirements in the definition of unit trust: •The entity must be a trust. It cannot be in the form of a partnership or a joint venture (presuming it does not involve a trust), as in those entities management and control are in the hands of the member. In contrast, in a trust situation the management and control of the property settled are with the trustees. •The trust must have subscribers, purchasers, or contributors who are beneficiaries under the trust. In contrast, a family trust is not a unit trust because beneficiaries of a family trust do not subscribe, purchase, or contribute for their entitlement to distributions from the trust. •The trust must have more than one unit holder. The use of the plural when referring to “subscribers, purchasers, or contributors” in the definition supports this interpretation. The definition does not allow nominees for subscribers, purchasers, or contributors to be counted separately. A nominee is treated as the principal when ascertaining the number of unit holders in a unit trust. The use of nominees could in some circumstances circumvent the requirement for participation by more than one unit holder. If, for example, a subscriber and his or her nominees acquired all the units in a unit trust, there would be no real participation as, in substance, there is just one subscriber. •Unit holders must have a facility to participate in any income or gains arising from the investments that are the subject of the trust. For example, a subscriber for units that carry a nil return would not count for the purposes of the definition. Example Five individuals form a trust to pool their funds and make investments. An independent trustee holds the funds. The trust deed provides that each individual is a beneficiary who is entitled to participate in the income or gains arising from the investment of those funds. The entity is a unit trust as: •It is formed as a trust. •There is more than one contributor. •Each individual has contributed in his or her own right. •Each individual will participate in the income and gains arising from the funds that are subject to the trust. 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Financial planning fees: income tax deductibility Public Ruling - BR Pub 95/10A Note (not part of ruling): Public ruling BR Pub 95/10 (see TIB Volume Seven, No.7 \[January 1996\] at page 1) concerned sections BB 7 and BB 8 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section 6 of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 repeals and replaces part B of the Income Tax Act 1994, including sections BB 7 and BB 8, with effect from the 1997-1998 income year. Public ruling BR Pub 95/10 also concerned sections CB 1 - CB 15, EE 1, EF 1, and EH 1 - 9. These sections have all been amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996. Section 91G(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 states that when a taxation law that is the subject of a binding ruling is repealed, the ruling ceases to apply to the extent of, and from the effective date of, that repeal. Further, section 91G(2) states that where a taxation law that is the subject of a binding ruling is amended, or repealed in part only, in a manner that alters the way in which the taxation law applies, the ruling ceases to apply to the extent of, and from the effective date of, the amendment or partial repeal. This means that public ruling BR Pub 95/10 will not apply to fees for financial planning services which are incurred in the 1997-1998 income year and subsequent income years. It will apply to such fees incurred in the 1996-1997 income year. Public ruling BR Pub 95/10A replaces public ruling BR Pub 95/10 with effect from the 1997-1998 income year. It is intended that the cessation of public ruling BR Pub 95/10 and its replacement by public ruling BR Pub 95/10A should have no practical effect on the application of the taxation law contained in the rulings to the relevant taxpayers. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BD 2, CB 1 - CB 15, EE 1, EF 1, and EH 1 - EH 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the incurring by taxpayers of fees for financial planning services. “Fees” for financial planning services means planning fees, implemen- tation fees, and monitoring fees for the purposes of this Ruling. “Planning”, “implementation”, and “monitoring” services have the following meanings for the purpose of this Ruling. Planning services are the services provided by an adviser when the adviser plans an investor’s portfolio of investments. Planning services are often provided at the outset of the portfolio’s establishment, but can also be provided as part of the adviser’s ongoing service. Implementation services are the services provided by an adviser when the adviser implements an investor’s financial plan. Implementation services also include the services provided when a custodian implements the plan and an adviser charges the investor a fee. However, if an adviser’s fee in such a situation relates to monitoring services, the services are not implementation services. Monitoring services are the services provided by an adviser when the adviser monitors and evaluates the performance of an investor’s portfolio. Monitoring services include the collection of income from investments and the exchanging of foreign currency. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: Passive investors Passive investors are investors who are not speculative investors, nor in the business of investing. 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Planning services Taxpayers who are passive investors cannot deduct fees paid to financial advis- ers for planning services. Fees paid for planning are capital expenses and not deductible because of the operation of section BD 2 (2)(e). Fees paid for planning may also be not deductible for the further reason that they do not satisfy section BD 2 (1)(b). Implementation services Taxpayers who are passive investors cannot deduct fees paid to financial advis- ers for implementation services. Fees paid for implementation are capital ex- penses and not deductible because of the operation of section BD 2 (2)(e). For passive investors the deductibility of implementation fees is subject to the qualified accrual rules in sections EH 1 to EH 10. Monitoring services Passive investors can deduct fees paid for monitoring investments under section BD 2 (1)(b)(i), when those fees are incurred. However, to the extent that monitoring fees are “accrual expenditure”, the deduction of those fees will be affected by section EF 1. Thus the unexpired portion of any such expenditure must be included in the gross income of the passive investor for the income year. Business investors and speculative investors Speculative investors are investors who acquire an investment with the intention of selling it, or carry on or carry out an undertaking entered into or devised for the purpose of making a profit. Persons are in the business of investing when the nature of their activity, and their intention in respect of the activity, is sufficient to amount to a business. Taxpayers in the business of investing and taxpayers who are speculative inves- tors can deduct all planning, implementation, and monitoring fees, when in- curred, under section BD 2 (1)(b). For speculative investors, the deductibility of implementation fees is subject to the qualified accrual rules in sections EH 1 to EH 10. For business investors, the deductibility of implementation fees is subject to the qualified accrual rules in sections EH 1 to EH 10, and if the qualified accrual rules do not apply, the trading stock provisions of section EE 1. To the extent that fees are “accrual expenditure”, the deduction of those fees will be affected by section EF 1. Thus the unexpired portion of any such expenditure must be included in the gross income of the investor for the income year. Financial arrangement implementation fees For passive, speculative, and business investors, there is a special treatment for the deductibility of financial arrangement implementation fees. These fees must be dealt with under the qualified accruals rules. The distinction between passive, speculative, and business investors for such fees is often no longer important as the deductibility of the fees is provided for by statute. There are, however, some exceptions to the statutory deductibility of the fees when the distinction between passive, speculative, and business investors is still important. Implementation fees that are part of the “acquisition price” of the financial arrangement will be allowed as a deduction against income earned from the financial arrangement either: continued on page 20 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) •On the maturity, remission, or sale of the financial arrangement for cash basis holders; or •Over the life of the financial arrangement for non-cash basis holders. Implementation fees that are part of the acquisition price of the financial arrange- ment include: •Contingent fees to the extent that they are provided in relation to the financial arrangement; and •Non-contingent fees to the extent that they exceed 2% of the core acquisition price, and to the extent they are provided in relation to the financial arrange- ment. Non-contingent fees that are no more than 2% of the core acquisition price are deductible under the normal rules for deducting financial planning fees. In this case, the distinction between passive, speculative, and business investors is important. Fees incurred in deriving non-taxable or exempt income No deduction is available to any type of investor for fees to the extent that the fees are incurred in the production of non-taxable or exempt income. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to fees for financial planning services incurred within the 1997-98 and 1998-99 income years. This Ruling is signed by me on the 8th day of December 1996. Jeffrey Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 95/10A from page 19 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusion(s) reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 95/10A (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in BR Pub 95/10 (in TIB Volume Seven, No. 7 (January 1996) at page 1 under the heading Financial planning fees: income tax deductibility). The Ruling supersedes and replaces that earlier ruling with effect from the 1997-98 income year. Background What are financial planning fees? Financial advisers charge for services provided to their clients. In the Ruling these services are broken down into three components. Financial advisers may use different names for these component services. The tax treatment of the fees depends not on the name of the service, but on the nature of the service. To determine the correct tax treatment of a service, it is important to identify the exact service a financial adviser provides. In the Ruling the following terms refer to the range of services discussed below: •Planning •Implementation •Monitoring. 1. Planning Planning occurs when the investor seeks detailed advice from an adviser. This service may be provided when the investor contacts the adviser for the first time. The investor and adviser meet to establish the investor’s investment requirements and ability to meet those requirements. The adviser assesses the investor’s current financial position, which may include assessment of investments, savings objectives, cash requirements, and life and general insurance requirements. For corporate or trustee investors, factors assessed may differ. The adviser then prepares a plan including a range of investment proposals for the investor, and recommends how the investor’s goals can best be met. Planning services may also be provided as part of the financial adviser’s on-going service. Using information received from monitoring an investor’s portfolio, the financial adviser may recommend changes to the investor’s investments. The changes may be made to 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) bring the investor’s portfolio into line with the inves- tor’s goals and risk profile, to take advantage of better or new opportunities, or to take into account a change in the investor’s requirements. Some financial advisers may call a fee for this service a monitoring fee. In this situation this service is better described as a planning fee. Calculation of the fee charged for planning services varies between advisers. Many advisers charge a flat fee, irrespective of the complexity of the plan. Others charge fees based on the complexity of the plan. The fee may be based on the amount of time spent by the adviser, or it may be a percentage of the funds invested. Some advisers only charge planning fees when the investor adopts the plan. 2. Implementation Implementation is the service provided when an adviser places investments. Implementation may occur when a financial plan is first implemented, and when invest- ments are later bought and sold. Often financial advisers use another organisation (a “custodian”) to place investments. Advisers pass on the custodian’s implementation charge to the investor, either within their fee, or separately as a disbursement. Sometimes financial advisers charge investors for initial investments, but not for any later changes to the invest- ments. Other financial advisers do not charge separately for later implementation fees, and instead include charges for changes to investments in a global monitor- ing fee. If so, the fee paid for implementation will need to be separately identified for tax purposes. Without separately identifying the implementation fee included in the global fee it will not be possible to calculate the deductible and non-deductible portions of the global fee. Implementation fees include fees payable to investment fund managers for entry into the investment. Some financial advisers charge a large fee when an investment is first made, which equates to the value of a commission otherwise payable to the financial adviser by the fund manager of the investment. The financial adviser may prefer to recover fees from investors rather than through commission from fund managers to remain impartial. The tax treatment of such a charge depends on what services the financial adviser provides. A financial adviser may provide monitoring services for the fee, or simply charge the amount that would other- wise have been received by way of commission as an initial cost. If no services are provided, and the fee is an initial cost, the fee is for implementation services. 3. Monitoring Monitoring involves the adviser monitoring and evalu- ating the performance of the investor’s portfolio. Monitoring services include collecting data on the investor’s investments, and events and research material that have implications for the investor; and reporting to the investor on this data. The financial adviser may also evaluate performance of the investment portfolio (which includes performance of fund managers and the adviser) in terms of the inves- tor’s goals, and relay this information to the investor. Monitoring may include arranging the collection of income from investments and exchanging currency. Monitoring fees are usually charged as a percentage of the investment funds under the adviser’s management. For passive investors, monitoring is typically on an annual or semi-annual basis. For business investors, monitoring may be more regular. Types of investor The income tax treatment of planning, implementation, and monitoring services differs, depending on whether the investor is: •A passive investor •A speculative investor •In the business of investing. These types of investor are defined for the purposes of the Ruling, and are discussed in more detail below. When is an investor a passive investor? Investors are passive investors when they are not speculative investors or in the business of investing. Generally, investors are passive investors, as most investors are not in the business of investing and are not speculative investors. When is an investor a speculative investor? A speculative investor is someone who either: •Acquires an investment with the intention of selling it; or •Carries on or carries out an undertaking or scheme entered into or devised for the purpose of making a profit. Amounts derived in those circumstances are included in the investor’s gross income under sections BD 1 (1) and CD 4 and losses incurred are deductible under section BD 2 (1)(b)(i). Investors are not speculative investors simply because they would like to see their investment capital increase, or that they may sell their investment if the capital increases. Most passive investors fall within that description. An investor may be a speculative investor in relation to one investment and not in relation to another. An example might be an investor who has a number of financial arrangements and investments in unit trusts, and decides as a single transaction to buy some listed shares with the intention of selling them in the next month or so. Planning and implementation fees related to the unit trusts would not be deductible, but any fees to the extent that they related to the shares would be deductible. (For the deductibility of the fees relating to the financial arrangements, see the discussion under the continued on page 22 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) •If the taxpayer’s activity is merely a means of supple- menting an already adequate income, the taxpayer is unlikely to be in the business from which that supple- mentary income is derived. •If the taxpayer is in full-time employment and engages in a spare-time activity, the presumption will be against that spare-time activity being a business. •If the taxpayer is either unemployed or retired and is only engaged in moderate (investment) activity, the presumption is against that activity being a business. Ultimately, whether a person is in the business of investing will be a question of fact. In seeking to determine whether a taxpayer is in the business of investing, the Commissioner uses the criteria identified above from the Grieve and Stockwell decisions.

It denies a deduction for expenditure or loss to the extent that it is: heading Qualified accruals rules and implementation fees.) When is an investor in business? Section OB 1 defines “business” to include: any profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for pecuniary profit. Whether a taxpayer is in the business of investing is dependent on that taxpayer’s fact situation. The tests and criteria established by cases such as Grieve v CIR (1989) 6 NZTC 61,682 and CIR v Stockwell (1992) 14 NZTC 9,191 are relevant to this question. The leading “business” case in New Zealand is Grieve. In that case the Court of Appeal concluded that there are two aspects to the concept of a business: •The nature of the activity; and •The intention with which the taxpayer undertakes the activity. This approach was followed in Stockwell. The decision in Stockwell is useful in determining whether an individual is in the business of investing. In Stockwell the Court of Appeal discussed, as obiter dicta, the question of when a taxpayer is in business. The Court observed that the question of whether a taxpayer was in business for tax purposes depended on whether the activities undertaken by the taxpayer were sufficiently continuous and extensive to constitute being a business. That is a question of fact and degree and is dependent upon the taxpayer’s particular fact situation. In Grieve, Richardson J set out some factors relevant to the inquiry as to whether a taxpayer is in business. They were: •The nature of the taxpayer’s activities; and •The period over which the taxpayer engages in the activity; and •The scope of the taxpayer’s operations; and •The volume of transactions undertaken; and •The commitment of time, money, and effort by the taxpayer; and •The pattern of activity; and •The financial results achieved by the activity. These factors were reiterated by the Court of Appeal in Stockwell. The Court commented that the test is objec- tive rather than subjective. Taxpayers’ intentions are, therefore, evidenced by their activities (the extent and continuity), not by their own personal view of their activities. In Stockwell the Court of Appeal also pro- vided some observations or guidelines regarding the extent and continuity of activity required to constitute a business: •The fact that a taxpayer’s activity is sufficient to render his or her returns taxable under section 65(2)(e) (now section CD 4) does not mean that that activity is a business. from page 21 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) incurred in deriving exempt income under Part C (Income Further Defined), D (Deductions Further Defined) or F (Apportionment and Recharacterised Transactions), Section BD 2 (2)(e) prohibits the deduction of capital. It denies a deduction for expenditure or loss to the extent that it is: of a capital nature, unless allowed as a deduction under Part D (Deductions Further Defined) or E (Timing of Income and Deductions), Gross income Under section BD 1, an amount is gross income of a taxpayer if it is included in the taxpayer’s gross income under Parts C - I of the Act. The following income types are relevant to this item: •Business profits - section CD 3. •Personal property sales - section CD 4. •Interest, dividends, and annuities - section CE 1 (1)(a). •Benefits from money advanced - section CE 1 (1)(b). •Accruals income - section CE 1 (1)(c). Qualified accruals rules The qualified accruals rules in part EH provide rules for the timing and recognition of income derived and expenditure incurred in respect of financial arrange- ments. The “core acquisition price” needs to be deter- mined at the end of the life of a financial arrangement to determine the amount of income or expenditure arising from the financial arrangement that has not already been returned. The “acquisition price” is defined in section OB 1 to include any consideration provided “in relation to a financial arrangement”. Trading stock Under section EE 1 (8), the value of trading stock at the end of the income year is included in a taxpayer’s gross income, and under section EE 1 (9), the value of trading stock at the beginning of the year is allowed as a deduction to the taxpayer for that income year. Under section EE 1 (3), the value of trading stock is, at the taxpayer’s option, cost, market value, or replace- ment value. Application of the Legislation Passive investors - deductibility of fees Planning fees Planning fees are not deductible to passive investors because they are capital expenditure. In some situations, planning fees are not deductible for the further reasons that they are not deductible under the general deduct- ibility section, or because they relate to non-taxable or exempt income. The general deductibility section is section BD 2. Section BD 2 (b)(i) applies to passive investors, specula- tive investors, and business investors if the planning expenditure is incurred in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income. Section BD 2 (1)(b)(ii) does not apply to passive investors or speculative investors because it only applies to expenditure incurred in carrying on a business. Section BD 2 (2) contains the prohibitions on deduct- ibility. Section BD 2 (2)(e) prohibits the deduction of expenditure of a capital nature. “Capital” is not defined. The Courts have had to decide whether expenditure is capital in numerous cases. Often they examine various tests to decide whether expenditure has the features of capital, although they emphasise that tests are merely a guide and the particular facts of each situation will determine the matter. Also, a number of the tests have been developed to analyse the capital/revenue distinc- tion in the context of a business. The tests that examine business expenditure are not necessarily applicable to passive and speculative investors. Nonetheless, the tests serve to distinguish between expenditure connected with the profit-making structure and regular out-goings incurred as part of the normal operation of that struc- ture, so are of some relevance. A passive investor’s financial assets are capital assets of the investor. Any gain or loss of the investor, being the difference between the price the investor paid and the amount received on disposal, is not taxable or deduct- ible because it is capital, not income. The assets are capital in nature because they are the investor’s struc- ture from which income is derived. In deciding whether planning fees are capital or income, the question is whether the fees are incurred in relation to the capital assets, or in relation to the income that an investor derives from those assets. The Privy Council in BP Australia Ltd v FCT \[1965\] 3 All ER 209, cited with approval in various judgments of the New Zealand Court of Appeal, followed the approach of Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v FCT (1938) 61 CLR 337, who said that there were three matters to consider when determining whether expendi- ture is capital or income: •The character of the advantage sought. •The manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, (and in this and the preceding factor recur- rence may be relevant). •The means adopted to enjoy it. In BP Australia Ltd the Privy Council analysed the character of the advantage sought by the expenditure using a number of tests. The Privy Council considered: •The need or occasion which calls for the expenditure. •Whether the payments were paid out of fixed or circulating capital. •Whether the payments were of a once and for all nature producing assets or advantages which are of an enduring benefit. •How the sum in question would be treated on ordinary accounting principles. •Whether the sums were expended on the structure within which the profits were to be earned or as part of the income-earning process. continued on page 24 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) investor’s goals, and the adviser may recommend new investments. When that happens, the adviser’s new advice also relates to bringing into effect the investment strategy. The time that a plan is of value to an investor will vary. It will be unusual for a plan to be developed each year. Although aspects of the plan may change as the per- formance of a particular investment changes, or if the investor’s goals change, the plan is nonetheless some- thing of lasting value, rather than something that is a regular, recurring expense incurred in deriving invest- ment income. The test that examines whether expenditure relates to fixed or circulating capital is not usually relevant to a passive investor. “Fixed capital” and “circulating capital” are relevant terms to a business that has fixed plant and circulating capital that is turned over while making profits. They may also be terms relevant to a speculative investor who buys and sells assets that are circulated to derive a profit. A passive investor will usually retain investments for a reasonable period, and not turn them over to realise the gain in the investment. Usually, it will not be of much assistance to determine how the expenditure is treated on ordinary accounting principles. A passive investor will often not keep accounts in the way a business will. The other two considerations mentioned in Sun Newspa- pers are the manner in which the benefit obtained by the expense is used, relied upon, or enjoyed, and the method of payment. The benefit will be used as the investor’s on-going investment strategy. The advice forms the basis for investment of the investor’s capital assets. The method of payment is usually a one-off payment when a plan is first prepared. Further payments may also be made for planning advice if the adviser suggests modifications to the investor’s portfolio, or if the investor’s goals change. The method of payment suggests that planning fees are not regular payments for expenses related to the investor’s income. The discussion so far has focused on the prohibition for deduction of capital expenditure in section BD 2 (2)(e). For passive investors, fees for financial plans may also not be deductible because they fail the general deduct- ibility test under section BD 2 (1)(b)(i). The fees may not have the requisite connection with the investor’s gross income to satisfy the test for deductibility under section BD 2 (1)(b)(i). When the plan is developed, the investor may not have decided whether to implement the plan. The investor may have received other advice and see the plan as a possible method of capital asset reorganisation. There may not be a direct link between the plan and deriving gross income from investments taken out on the advice contained in the plan. If the investor has already put a plan in place, and receives further advice from an adviser to achieve new goals, then the necessary connection with the investor’s gross income may be present. However, as discussed above, the fees will not be deductible because they are capital in nature. The approach adopted by the Privy Council was to consider what the expenditure was calculated to effect. The first test mentioned in Sun Newspapers, and examined in BP Australia Ltd, was the character of the advantage sought. In the context of financial planning fees, the effect the investor wishes to achieve is a plan or strategy for investing his or her financial assets to achieve investment goals. The need or occasion for the expenditure is the investor’s decision to examine his or her financial assets, and to receive advice on whether these assets should be retained or disposed of for new assets. The investor incurs a planning fee for advice on whether assets should be sold, and which new assets or type of assets should be obtained. The advice received relates to the investor’s capital assets. An investor does not receive planning advice directly to increase income. The direct purpose of planning advice is to obtain advice on the best mix of investments to achieve the investor’s investment goals. The result the investor wishes to achieve may be to derive more income from his or her investments, or it may be another result. The investor may wish to reduce or increase the risk of a portfolio, or may wish to change investments to produce tax-paid returns on retirement. He or she may wish to change from intangible assets to property investments. Planning advice relates to the investor’s capital assets, which are the investor’s profit- earning structure, rather than to the profit-making process. Analysis of whether planning advice is capital or income may be similar to analysing whether fees for legal and other professional advice are capital or income. It may not always be possible to point to an enduring asset. As with professional advice, the test is to determine whether the expenditure is incurred in relation to the profit-earning structure, or the profit- making process. In Foley Bros Pty Ltd v FC of T (1965) 13 ATD 562, the full High Court of Australia held that in examining the matter to which legal fees related, “the true contrast is between altering the framework within which income producing activities are for the future to be carried on and taking a step as part of those activities within the framework”. The expenditure is incurred to achieve an enduring advantage. This test of capital is not whether expendi- ture results in a permanent, tangible asset (Kemball v C of T \[1932\] NZLR 1305, John Fairfax and Sons Pty Ltd v FC of T (1959) 101 CLR 30). The test is whether the expenditure is incurred to obtain an advantage or something of lasting value. The financial adviser provides a plan that becomes the investment framework for the investor. The plan is of continuing benefit to the investor because it forms the investor’s strategy. Using the investor’s goals, the adviser provides an approach to investment that takes into account those goals, and may identify particular investments that will enable those goals to be achieved. Over time, particular investments may no longer serve the purpose of achieving the from page 23 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) The link between gross income and planning fees also will not be present when investments taken out on the advice in a plan are tax-paid investments, e.g. insurance bonds. Fees paid for investments that do not lead to gross income are not deductible for any investor, even if the investor is in the business of investment or is a speculative investor. This point is discussed below under Fees incurred in gaining non-taxable or exempt income. Implementation fees Implementation fees are capital expenditure and not deductible by passive investors. Implementation fees are directly related to changing the structure of the investor’s income earning structure, and are not related to the income earning process. The effect achieved is that the investor obtains a new capital asset. The investment asset obtained as a result of the investor incurring an implementation fee will endure, because a passive investor does not buy and sell financial assets frequently and will hold the asset for a time. Implemen- tation fees are not regular or recurring expenses. In Case U53 87 ATC 351 the taxpayer paid a fee called a service fee that was calculated as a percentage of the value of units the investor bought in a unit trust. (The same unit trust was involved in Case U160 87 ATC 935.) The investment document stated that the service fee was for payment in advance for services to be rendered throughout the life of the fund. There was no description of the nature of the services outlined in the prospectus of the unit trust. The Tribunal in both cases held that the charges on the basis of a percentage of funds invested indicates that if any services were to be rendered, they would not be in the nature of manage- ment services, which were provided for elsewhere in the investment documents. The Tribunal in both cases held that the service fee was in reality part of the cost of the units and was a capital cost. On the basis of Case U53 and Case U160, fees that are an entry cost are non-deductible implementation fees. It will be a question of fact in each case whether fees are paid for monitoring services, or whether the fees are an implementation cost. An exception to the general position that implementa- tion fees are not deductible to passive investors relates to implementation fees that are part of the cost of “financial arrangements”. This exception is discussed under Qualified accruals rules. Monitoring fees Monitoring fees are deductible by passive investors under section BD 2 (1)(b)(i). These fees are paid for the adviser to monitor the performance of the investor’s investments, and to provide administrative services such as collection of income. These are management services that are part of the process of the investor earning gross income from investments. The services relate more to the returns from the investments than the investments themselves. Monitoring fees are often regular, on-going expenses. The investor does not receive an enduring advantage as a result of monitoring. To the extent that monitoring fees are “accrual expendi- ture”, the deduction of those fees will be affected by section EF 1. Thus the unexpired portion of any such expenditure will be included in the gross income of the passive investor for the income year. Example 1 Investor A is an investment adviser employed by Bank. He spends most of his day advising investors of their investment opportunities and implementing investments for them. Investor A and his wife have a young family and have recently bought a larger house. The extent of their personal investments is minimal. Besides Investor A’s membership of a superannuation scheme operated by Bank, Investor A and his wife have a few thousand dollars invested as a lump sum in a managed fund. They approached a financial adviser for advice on which fund to invest in. The continuity and extent of Investor A’s invest- ment activities make it unlikely that he is in the business of investing. His employment activities of investment advice do not have any bearing on his personal activities. They must be viewed separately. Investor A is a passive investor; only the monitor- ing fees are deductible. Example 2 Investor B is a retired bank manager. Throughout her professional career she has acquired a number of investments from which she has continued to derive both income and capital growth. Investor B uses the services of a financial adviser in managing her investments. While Investor B takes an interest in the performance of her investments, she leaves the majority of the work to her financial adviser. Investor B only undertakes a minimal amount of buying and selling. Except for some superannuation entitlements, Investor B derives all her income from these investments. Investor B is not in the business of investing. Although the investments represent the majority of her income, her activities lack sufficient extent and continuity to constitute a business of investing. Cooke P in Stockwell considered there would be a presumption against a taxpayer being in the busi- ness of investing when a retired person undertook merely modest investment activity. The fact that the investments represent a taxpayer’s primary source of income does not automatically make the activity the taxpayer’s business. Investor B is a passive investor; only the monitoring fees are deductible. continued on page 26 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) under Passive investors- implementation fees, form part of the cost of the investment for trading stock purposes. Unless the accruals rules take precedence, these imple- mentation fees are deductible when incurred pursuant to section BD 2 (1)(b)(ii). If the relevant investment is still on hand at year end and the taxpayer, when complying with section EE 1 (3), elects to value at cost price, the implementation fees form part of that cost. Effectively, then, the implementation fees are included in the investor’s gross income at the end of the year. Example 3 Investor C is an accountant, employed part-time by a major corporate. Three years ago Investor C inherited a substantial sum of money which she has put into a wide range of investments. She actively participates in managing her investments. She uses her tax knowledge and accounting expertise to analyse her investments’ performances on a regular basis. She engages the service of a financial adviser so that she can obtain independent, objective, third party advice (and to implement her investment strategies). Although Investor C derives a significant income from her employment as an accountant, the extent and continuity of her investment activities (and her active participation) should be sufficient for Inves- tor C to be considered to be in the business of investing. Investor C is a business investor and all fees are deductible. Qualified accruals rules and implementation fees Some investments are subject to the qualified accruals rules. The qualified accruals rules take precedence over any other rules in the Income Tax Act. The qualified accruals rules have specific provisions for the treatment of implementation fees. These provisions apply to all investors: passive, speculative, and business investors. The accruals rules apply to financial arrangements. “Financial arrangement” is a defined term in the Income Tax Act. Broadly, it includes debt instruments, and does not include shares or interests in unit trusts. Contingent implementation fees If implementation fees are contingent on the financial arrangement being implemented, the fees are part of the “acquisition price” of the financial arrangement and as such are subject to the accruals rules. The “acquisition price” is defined to include “the value of all considera- tion provided by \[the investor\] in relation to the finan- cial arrangement”. Implementation fees paid to finan- cial advisers or other organisations for their services in implementing financial arrangements are provided “in relation to the financial arrangement”. See TIB Volume Three, No. 4 (December 1991) at pages 5 and 6. Speculative investors Planning fees, implementation fees, and monitoring fees Speculative investors can deduct planning fees, imple- mentation fees, and monitoring fees under section BD 2H(1)(b)(i). Like investors in the business of investing, any difference between the cost of the invest- ment and the amount received on disposal of the investment is gross income or a deductible loss to speculative investors. Their investments are trading assets not capital assets. Therefore, fees incurred in relation to speculators’ investments are not incurred in relation to their capital structure. The timing of deductions for implementation fees for speculative investors is subject to the qualified accruals rules (discussed below). To the extent that fees are “accrual expenditure”, the deduction of those fees will be affected by section EF 1. Thus the unexpired portion of any such expenditure will be included in the gross income of the speculative investor for the income year. Investors in the business of investing - deductibility of fees Planning fees, implementation fees, and monitoring fees Investors in the business of investing can deduct planning fees, implementation fees, and monitoring fees under section BD 2 (1)(b)(i) or (ii). If an investor is in the business of investing, any difference between the cost of the investment and the amount received on disposal of the investment is gross income or a deductible loss. The investments are trading assets and not capital assets of the investor. Therefore, fees do not fail the test of deductibility for the reason that they relate to the investor’s capital profit-making structure. To the extent that fees are “accrual expenditure”, the deduction of those fees will be affected by section EF 1. Thus the unexpired portion of any such expenditure will be included in the gross income of the business investor for the income year. Planning fees For business investors, planning fees are deductible under section BD 2 (1)(b)(i) or (ii) as they have the necessary connection with the business investor’s gross income. Implementation fees The timing of deductions for implementation fees for business investors is subject to either the qualified accruals rules (discussed below), or the trading stock provisions. If the accruals rules apply, they take prec- edence over the rules applying to trading stock. Implementation fees that are part of the cost of an investment, such as the services in Case U53 discussed from page 25 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Category 1: cash basis holders A cash basis holder is a natural person for whom either the total value of all financial arrangements held by that person will not exceed $600,000, or the income derived in the year by the person from financial arrangements will not exceed $70,000. A further requirement is that the difference between the income that would be returned under the accruals rules, and the income returned as a cash basis holder, does not exceed $20,000. An investor who is a cash basis holder returns income and expenditure relating to financial arrangements as and when the income is derived and expenditure is incurred. Implementation fees that are part of the acquisition price, however, cannot be taken as a deduc- tion in the year they are incurred. Instead, when the investment matures, is remitted, or is sold the investor will get credit for the fees when he or she performs a “cash base price adjustment”. The cash base price adjustment compares all amounts received by the investor in respect of the investment with all amounts provided by the investor in relation to the investment. The amounts provided by the investor are the “acquisition price”. This calculation will usually mean a comparison of the amount returned at the end of the investment and interest received with the amounts provided and any direct costs of the investment. If the cash base price adjustment results in a positive amount, the amount is income to the investor. If the cash base price adjustment results in a negative amount, the amount is an allowable deduction. Because implementation fees are part of the acquisition price, they can be offset against income received from the financial arrangement. This has the effect of allow- ing a deduction for the fees on the maturity, remission, or sale of a financial arrangement. Accordingly, if an investor is a “cash basis holder”, he or she may deduct implementation fees, irrespective of whether the investor is a passive investor, in the busi- ness of investing, or a speculative investor. Category 2: non-cash basis holders If an investor is not a cash basis holder, he or she must return income and expenditure according to the rules set out in section EH 1. Section EH 1 (1) requires that for the purposes of calculating income and expenditure under sections EH 1 (2) to (6), regard must be had to the amount of consideration provided by the person. The accruals rules spread the difference between amounts received by the person and amounts provided by the person over the life of the financial arrangement. When implementation fees are part of the acquisition price of the arrangement, they will be one of the amounts provided by the person to be spread over the life of the arrangement. It is not technically accurate to say that the investor gets a deduction for implementation fees, spread over the life of the financial arrangement. Instead, allowing for implementation fees means the investor returns less income over the life of the financial arrangement. This has the same effect as a deduction spread over the life of the financial arrangement. Non-contingent implementation fees It is most likely that implementation fees will be contingent on the implementation of a financial plan. However, if implementation fees are not contingent on the implementation of the plan they are covered by specific rules: •If the non-contingent fees are no more than two percent (2%) of the “core acquisition price”, they are excluded from the accruals rules calculations, and their deductibility is tested under normal income tax rules. •If the non-contingent fees are greater than two percent (2%) of the “core acquisition price”, they are included within the accruals rules calculations to the extent that they exceed 2% of the core acquisition price. The remaining amount of fees (that is equal to 2% of the core acquisition price) is deductible or otherwise under normal income tax rules. Thus for non-contingent fees amounting to 2% or less of the core acquisition price of the financial arrangement, the distinction between passive, business, and specula- tive investors is important as the normal income tax rules of deductibility are again important. For non-contingent fees, to the extent that they exceed 2% of the core acquisition price of the financial ar- rangement, the discussion above relating to contingent fees is relevant. Example 4 Investor D is a cash basis holder who has invested in a number of financial arrangements on the advice of her financial adviser. Investor D is a passive investor. She paid a fee of 2% of the cost of the financial arrangements as a commission to her adviser. The fee was contingent on the financial arrangements being purchased. Investor D may not initially deduct the fee. The fee is a contingent fee, and included in the “acquisition price” of the financial arrangement as a direct cost of the investment. As a contingent fee, it is not deductible until a cash base price adjustment is made on the maturity, remission, or sale of the financial arrangement. At that time it will be allowed as an amount provided by the investor, to be offset against amounts received. If the fee charged was a non-contingent fee, then, to the extent that it was no more than 2% of the core acquisition price of the financial arrangement, it would be excluded from the accruals rules and tested according to normal principles. As such it would be non-deductible as Investor D is a passive investor. continued on page 28 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Example 5 As part of her retirement savings, Investor E makes monthly contributions to a fund manager. The contributions are invested in two funds. One is a tax paid growth fund, that is, no profits or gains are paid to investors. Instead, gains are retained and accumulated until the investor reaches a given age. The other fund returns tax paid receipts to the investor. That is, the fund pays tax on the accumu- lated income. Investor E receives no gross income from her investment. Section BD 2 (2)(b) prohibits the deduction of expenditure or loss incurred in deriv- ing exempt income. Therefore, none of the fees incurred are deductible. The following table is a summary of the income tax treatment of financial planning fees, excluding the impact of the qualified accrual rules on the deductibility of implementation fees. - - - - - - - - - - Types of Investors - - - - - - - - - - Fee TypePassiveSpeculativeBusiness Planning FeesNon-deductibleDeductibleDeductible Implement- ation FeesNon-deductibleDeductibleDeductible Monitoring FeesDeductibleDeductibleDeductible Fees incurred in earning exempt incomeNon-deductibleNon-deductibleNon-deductible Fees incurred in deriving non-taxable or exempt income Returns from investments are not taxable to the investor if the investment is taxed before the investor receives payment from the investment. An example is insurance bonds. Tax is paid on income earned on an insurance bond by the insurance bond fund. The other situation when returns from investments are not taxable to the investor is where the return is exempt income. Exempt income is provided for in sections CB 1 - CB 15. It will be unusual for investors to derive exempt income from investments. No deduction is available to the extent to which fees are incurred in the production of non-taxable or exempt income. Section BD 2 (1)(b) only allows a deduction for expenditure incurred in deriving the investor’s gross income, or for expenditure necessarily incurred by the investor in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the investor’s gross income. Also, section BD 2 (2)(b) denies a deduction for expenditure incurred in deriving exempt income. Therefore, where expenditure on financial planning fees produces non- taxable or exempt income, the fees cannot be deducted. from page 27 Dispositions where the transferor reserves a benefit or advantage in real property - income tax implications Public Ruling - BR Pub 96/2A Note (not part of ruling): Public ruling BR Pub 96/2 (see TIB Volume Seven, No.8 \[February 1996\] at page 10) concerned sections CE 1 (1)(e), EB 1 (1), EB 2, and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section 27 of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 amends section CE 1 (1), and sections 144 and 145 of that Act repeal and replace sections EB 1 (1) and EB 2, with effect from the 1997-1998 income year. Section 91G(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 states that when a taxation law that is the subject of a binding ruling is repealed, the ruling ceases to apply to the extent of, and from the effective date of, that repeal. Further, section 91G(2) states that where a taxation law that is the subject of a binding ruling is amended, or repealed in part only, in a manner that alters the way in which the taxation law applies, the ruling ceases to apply to the extent of, and from the effective date of, the amendment or partial repeal. This means that public ruling BR Pub 96/2 will not apply to dispositions of real property which are made in the 1997-98 income year and subsequent income years. It will apply to such dispositions made in the 1996-97 income year. Public ruling BR Pub 96/2A replaces public ruling BR Pub 96/2 with effect from the 1997-98 income year. It is intended that the cessation of public ruling BR Pub 96/2 and its replacement by public ruling BR Pub 96/2A should have no practical effect on the application of the taxation law contained in the rulings to the relevant taxpayers. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CE 1 (1)(e), EB 1 (1), EB 2, and OB 1 (definition of “lease” and “leasehold estate”) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the disposal by a taxpayer (transferor) of real property and the receipt of the property by another taxpayer (transferee), either subject to an interest still held by the transferor or subject to an obligation to grant an interest back to the transferor. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: Section CE 1 (1)(e) includes within a person’s gross income all rents, fines, premi- ums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from: •Any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land; or •The grant of a right to take profits from the land. If a transferor grants an interest in property to himself or herself, and later grants the remainder or reversion to another person (including the trustees of a trust), the interest kept by the transferor does not constitute gross income of the transferor under section CE 1 (1)(e). If a transferor grants a property interest to another person, subject to the trans- feree granting an interest back to the transferor, the transferee may derive gross income under section CE 1 (1)(e). The transferee will derive gross income if: •The transferee is indebted to the transferor and the value of the interest granted by the transferee is deducted from that indebtedness; or •The price the transferee pays for the property is reduced by netting off from the market value of the property the value of the obligation to grant an inter- est to the transferor; or •The transferor otherwise pays the transferee for the grant. The income of the transferor from this transaction will be equal to the reduction in indebtedness, the reduction in price, or the amount otherwise paid. If the value of interest granted by the transferee is not paid for, or is not used to reduce the price the transferee pays or the transferee’s indebtedness, the trans- feree does not derive gross income from the grant. If a transferor grants a property interest to another person, and the transferee grants a freehold interest to the transferor, such as a life estate or lease for life, section CE 1 (1)(e) does not apply. A freehold interest does not come within the requirement of section CE 1 (1)(e) that there be a lease, licence, easement, or profit. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to dispositions of real property made during the 1997-98 and 1998-99 income years. This Ruling is signed by me on the 8th day of December 1996. Jeffrey Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) commentary on page 30 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 96/2A This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 96/2A (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Ruling BR Pub 96/2 (in TIB Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) at page 10, under the heading Dispositions where the transferor reserves a benefit or advantage in real property - income tax implications). The Ruling supersedes that earlier ruling with effect from the 1997-98 income year. Background This commentary sets out the application of section CE 1 (1)(e) when a taxpayer disposes of real property and keeps or reserves interests in that property. The gift duty implications of such transactions are the subject of public binding ruling BR Pub 96/1. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 CE 165 EB 175 EB 280 OB 12 Under section CE 1 (1)(e), a person’s gross income includes: All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land. Application of the Legislation Section CE 1 (1)(e) deems a person’s gross income to include all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from: •Any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land; or •The grant of a right to take profits from the land. No income tax implications if an interest is kept If the transferor effectively keeps an interest in land prior to a disposition of the remainder to another person, section CE 1 (1)(e) does not apply. The owner of land (the transferor) has not derived a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue from a lease, licence, easement, or profit. Instead, the owner has simply kept an interest in the land. The transferee has also derived no income as he or she never owned the interest that the transferor kept. A transferor can grant himself or herself a life interest or lease over land, before disposing of the remainder or reversion to another person. However, it is not legally possible for a transferor to grant a licence to occupy to himself or herself. A licence is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and use it for a particular purpose. A licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. Example 1 Taxpayer A creates a life estate in a property, and then transfers the remainder interest to the trustees of his family trust. A’s house is worth $175,000. The value of the life estate is $60,000. The sale price for the remainder is $175,000 less the $60,000. The sale price is outstanding as an unse- cured debt owed by the trust to A. The Commissioner will not assess A for income tax under section CE 1 (1)(e) on the $60,000 value of the life estate. Section CE 1 (1)(e) has no applica- tion when a property owner keeps some part of his or her own property. Income tax implications when an interest is reserved If the transferor reserves an interest by receiving a grant of an interest from the transferee, section CE 1 (1)(e) generally applies. There are three parts to section CE 1 (1)(e): •There must be either a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue. •The income must be derived by a land owner. •The income must be derived from a lease, licence, easement, or profit. When the transferee is granting an interest to a transferor, the transferee is the land owner. Accord- ingly, it is the transferee who is at risk of being subject to income tax. Income that is “premiums or other revenues” For section CE 1 (1)(e) to apply there must be income from granting an interest back to the transferor. If a grant back to the transferor is for no consideration, section CE 1 (1)(e) will not apply (there may, however, be a gift duty effect). If: •The transferee is indebted to the transferor and the value of the interest granted by the transferee is deducted from that indebtedness; or •The price the transferee pays for the property is reduced by netting off from the market value of the property the value of the obligation to grant an interest to the transferor; or 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) •The transferor otherwise pays the transferee for the grant, the transferee may derive gross income if the other requirements (discussed below) of section CE 1 (1)(e) are met. The gross income derived from this transaction will be equal to the reduction in indebtedness, the reduction in price, or the amount otherwise paid. Under section CE 1 (1)(e), the value attributed to the interest granted by the transferee to the transferor is either a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue. A payment for the grant of a licence to occupy, or a lease, is included within the term “premiums, or other rev- enues”. The Court of Appeal in Romanos Motels Limited v CIR \[1973\] 1 NZLR 435 found that an amount paid for goodwill and a lease of a motel was included within the term “premiums, or other rev- enues”, notwithstanding that such a sum would nor- mally be considered a capital sum. In Capel v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,195 the High Court found that a goodwill payment was a capital sum, yet the payment was still taxable under the then equivalent to section CE 1 (1)(e). A payment for buying a licence to occupy, or a lease, would also normally be considered a capital sum. However, Romanos and Capel are authority for the proposition that such a payment is included within the term “premiums, or other revenues”. Derivation of premiums or other revenues The premium or other revenue is “derived” by the transferee (the land owner). When there is a grant to the transferor of the licence to occupy or lease, this results in a reduction of the debt owing by the transferee to the transferor. The reduction comes about because the licence to occupy or lease has value to the transferor and the transferee, and the amount the transferor should pay for the licence or lease is credited against the debt owing to the transferor. The reduction is an amount equal to the value of the interest granted to the owner. Although the transferee does not actually receive an amount of cash from the transferor, he or she does derive the income. Under section EB 1 (1), a person derives income, even where it has not been received, when an amount has been, for example, credited in account or otherwise dealt with in the person’s interest or behalf. A reduction of indebtedness is an example of this, and so the transferee “derives” the income. An- other example, is a netting off of obligations. Income derived from lease, licence, easement, or profit If the transferee grants the transferor a lease or a licence to occupy, and there is a sum attributable to that grant, the grant satisfies the requirement that the income is derived from any lease, licence, easement, or profit. Accordingly, the transferee is subject to income tax on an amount equal to the value of the sum attributable to the grant. Example 2 Taxpayer B has decided to transfer her family home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the house for the rest of her life. She transfers the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the sale is that the trustees grant B a licence to occupy. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $200,000. A valuer and actuary value the licence to occupy at $50,000. The sale price of the house is $200,000, which is reduced by $50,000 to $150,000 to take into account the value of the licence to occupy. The $150,000 is left owing by the trustees as a debt repayable on demand. The trust has derived gross income under section CE 1 (1)(e) for the value of the licence to occupy. However, if the lease is a lease for life, the trans- feree is not subject to income tax. Section OB 1 defines “lease” as any disposition by which a leasehold estate is created. “Leasehold estate” is also defined in section OB 1: it does not include a freehold estate. As a lease for life is a freehold estate, it is not a “lease” for the purposes of section CE 1 (1)(e). If the transferee grants a life estate to the transferor, the grant is not a lease, licence, easement, or profit. Instead, it is a grant of a freehold estate in land. Accordingly, the transferee is not subject to income tax. Example 3 C and D decide to transfer their home to a family trust. They wish to ensure that they have a right to occupy the house for the rest of their lives. They transfer the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the sale is that the trustees grant C and D life estates in the property. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $250,000. The life estates are worth $75,000. The sale price of the house is $250,000, which C and D leave owing as a debt, repayable on demand. The debt is reduced by $75,000 upon the grant of the life estates. The trust will not have derived gross income under section CE 1 (1)(e), because the grant of a life estate is not income derived from a lease, licence, easement, or profit. If the lease is not a lease for life, section CE 1 (1)(e) will apply in the same way as would occur with the grant of a licence, see Example 2 above. Spreading of income When a taxpayer derives income under section CE 1 (1)(e), section EB 2 (1) allows the person to apportion that income between the income year in which it is derived and up to five subsequent income years. 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Bad debts - writing of debts as bad for GST and income tax purposes Public Ruling - BR Pub 96/3A Note (not part of ruling): Public ruling BR Pub 96/3 (see TIB Volume Seven, No. 8 \[February 1996\] at page 13) concerned section DJ 1 (a)(iii) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section 100 of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 repeals and replaces section DJ 1 (a)(iii), with effect from the 1997-98 income year. Section 91G(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 states that when a taxation law that is the subject of a binding ruling is repealed, the ruling ceases to apply to the extent of, and from the effective date of, that repeal. This means that public ruling BR Pub 96/3 will not apply to income tax deductions and deductions from GST output tax which are claimed in the 1997-98 income year and subsequent income years in respect of debts written off as bad debts. It will apply to such deductions claimed in the 1996-97 income year. Public ruling BR Pub 96/3A replaces public ruling BR Pub 96/3 with effect from the 1997-98 income year. It is intended that the cessation of public ruling BR Pub 96/3 and its replacement by public ruling BR Pub 96/3A should have no practical effect on the application of the taxation law contained in the rulings to the relevant taxpayers. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references to the Income Tax Act are to the Income Tax Act 1994 as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 and all references to the GST Act are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. This Ruling applies in respect of section DJ 1 (a)(iii) of the Income Tax Act and section 26(1)(c) of the GST Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the writing off of a debt (or part of a debt) as a bad debt, and the claiming of an income tax deduction or a deduction from GST output tax for that debt (or part thereof). How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: A debt (or part of a debt) must be both bad and written off before any person can claim an income tax deduction or a deduction from GST output tax (assuming that other legislative requirements in the GST Act 1985 and the Income Tax Act are also satisfied). Debt must be “bad” Whether or not a debt (or part of a debt) is bad is a question to be determined objectively, rather than a question to be determined by the subjective opinion of any particular individual. The objective test that any person should ask himself or herself in deciding whether or not a debt is bad, is whether the facts would indicate to a reasonable and prudent business person that, on the balance of probabilities, it is unlikely that the debt will be paid. If the facts indicate to a reasonable and prudent business person that, on the balance of probabilities, it is unlikely that the debt will be paid, then the debt is bad at that point in time and may then be written off. Events following the writing-off may result in additional information which could indicate that a debt 33 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) (or part of a debt) previously written off as bad is no longer bad. However, this does not mean that the debt was not bad at the time of the writing-off, and does not require any change to the income tax return or GST return in which the bad debt deduction was claimed. Of course, any recovery of any part of the debt previously claimed as a bad debt deduction must be returned in the period recovered. At the time of deciding whether a debt is bad, a person will need to have suffi- cient information to enable a reasonable and prudent business person to form the view that it is unlikely that the debt will be paid. The facts that need to be gathered depend on the circumstances surrounding any particular case. While no factor is decisive in itself, factors that are likely to be relevant in most cases are: •The length of time a debt is outstanding - the longer a debt is outstanding, the more likely it is that a reasonable and prudent business person would con- sider the debt to be bad. •The efforts that a taxpayer has taken to collect a debt - the greater the extent to which a person has tried (unsuccessfully) to collect a debt, the more likely it is that a reasonable and prudent person would consider the debt to be bad. •Other information obtained by a creditor - a creditor may have obtained particular information about a debtor, e.g. through business or personal networks, that would be a factor in leading a reasonable and prudent business person to conclude that a debt is bad. For example, a creditor may know that the debtor is in financial difficulties and has defaulted on debts owed to other creditors. A debtor does not need to be insolvent for a debt to be bad (although this will often be the case). A debt may still be bad even though a person is taking action to recover the debt. Recovery action may be taken for a number of reasons, even though a reasonable and prudent business person would think it unlikely that the debt will be recovered. A person cannot make a deduction by way of a provision for doubtful debts (being an estimate of the amount of debts that will become bad in the future). Bad debts are individually identifiable debts rather than a general provision. Debt must be “written off” A bad debt must be written off by authorised persons in accordance with the accounting and record keeping systems maintained by a taxpayer. In all cases the records kept by a taxpayer must comply with the record keeping require- ments contained in the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the GST Act. If a taxpayer maintains a debtors ledger, the balance in the debtors ledger for the individual debtor must be reduced by the amount of the bad debt. An entry in a general ledger recognising the debt as bad does not also have to be made for the debt to be written off for income tax and GST purposes. If a debtors ledger is not maintained, action must be taken that shows that the business accounting system treats the debt as bad. Particular examples of debts accepted by the Commissioner as having been written off are: •If a taxpayer’s only records of debts are copies of invoices issued, placing the invoice in a “bad debts” file, indicating on the invoice whether all or part of the invoiced amount is bad is sufficient. continued on page 34 34 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) •If a taxpayer’s only records of debts are copies of invoices and copies of state- ments of account issued from a duplicate account book, marking the copy of the final statement sent out “bad debt” (indicating the amount of the debt that is bad) is sufficient. Alternatively, it would also be sufficient for the taxpayer to place the relevant invoice in a “bad debts” file indicating on the invoice whether all or part of the invoiced amount is bad. Merely claiming a deduction from output tax in a GST return does not amount to the writing-off of a bad debt. In all cases, the taxpayer must cease to recognise the debt as an asset for account- ing purposes. There is no requirement that a debt must be written off and claimed as a bad debt deduction in the income year or GST taxable period in which the debt becomes bad. However, when a bad debt deduction is claimed, the necessary accounting entries must physically have been made, or necessary action taken as the case may be, before the end of the income year or GST taxable period in which the bad debt is claimed. Writing-off cannot be backdated. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to income tax deductions and deductions from GST output tax claimed in the 1997-98 and 1998-99 income years. This Ruling is signed by me on the 8th day of December 1996. Jeffrey Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 96/3A from page 33 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 96/3A (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Ruling BR 96/3 (in TIB Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) at page 13 under the heading Bad debts - writing off debts as bad for GST and income tax purposes). The Ruling supersedes and replaces that earlier item with effect from the 1997-98 income year. Background The Income Tax Act and the GST Act allow deductions for bad debts for taxpayers and/or registered persons if certain criteria are met. Criteria common to both Acts are the requirements that a debt must be both bad and written off before any deduction can be made. The Ruling sets out the test to apply when deciding whether or not a debt is “bad” and what is a sufficient “writing-off” of a bad debt.

However, notwithstanding section BD 2 (1)(b), section DJ 1 (a) prohibits the deduction of bad debts, except 35 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) when and to the extent that a number of criteria are satisfied. Section DJ 1 (a)(iii) sets out one of these criteria, namely that the debt must be proved, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, to have been actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year. Other section DJ 1 (a) criteria (in summary form) that must also be satisfied are: •If the debt is an amount owing in respect of a finan- cial arrangement and the accruals rules apply to the taxpayer for the financial arrangement, the deduction must be allowed under section EH 5 (see below); and •If the debt is not an amount owing in respect of a financial arrangement to which the accruals rules apply, the bad debt must not be a loss of capital subject to section BD 2 (2)(e); and •If: –The taxpayer is a company; and –The debt is owed by a company (“the debtor”); and –The amount giving rise to the debt is taken into account in calculating a loss (“the resultant loss”) incurred by the debtor or any other com- pany funded (directly or indirectly) by the debtor; and –Any one or more amounts have been allowed under section IG 2 or section 191A of the Income Tax Act 1976 as a deduction to the taxpayer (or to any other company which is at any time in the income year in which the resultant loss is incurred in the same group of companies as the taxpayer), in any income year commencing on or after 1 April 1993 and preceding the income year in which the bad debt is written off, in respect of the resultant loss, - the loss must exceed the aggregate of the amounts so allowed as a deduction. Section EH 5 Section EH 5 deals with amounts written off as bad debts in respect of financial arrangements. The main type of arrangement, in relation to bad debts, that is excluded from the definition of “financial arrangement” in section OB 1, is a short term trade credit. This is not a financial arrangement because it is an “excepted financial arrangement” (see paragraph (d) of the definition of “excepted financial arrangement” in section OB 1). “Short term trade credit” is defined in section OB 1 as: ...any debt for goods or services where payment is required by the vendor within 63 days after the supply of the goods or services: Arrangements entered into before the introduction of the accruals rules are also excluded from the definition of “financial arrangement”. Revenue bad debts Section EH 5 (1) permits a person to deduct an amount written off as a bad debt in respect of a financial arrangement. Section EH 5 (1) will only apply in limited circumstances to a cash basis holder. This is because section EH 5 (1) only applies when and to the extent that: •A person derives gross income in respect of the financial arrangement under: –Section EH 1 - one of the methods of calculating accrual income; or –Section EH 3 (3) - the adjustment required in any year when a person ceases to be a cash basis holder; or –Section EH 4 - the base price adjustment calcu- lated in the year a financial arrangement matures or is transferred; or –Section EH 6 - the post facto adjustment for financial arrangements which have the effect of defeating the intent and application of the accrual regime; and •The amount written off is attributable to that gross income. Capital bad debts Section EH 5 (2) provides for the deduction of the capital or principal element of a financial arrangement in certain circumstances. Section EH 5 (2) allows a person a deduction for an amount written off as a bad debt in respect of a financial arrangement (not being an amount deductible under section EH 5 (1)) when: •The person carries on a business which comprises holding or dealing in such financial arrangements and the person is not associated with the person owing the amount written off (see section OD 7 for test of association); or •The financial arrangement is a trade credit and the person carries on the business of dealing in the goods or services for which the trade credit is a debt. “Trade credit” is defined in section OB 1 to mean any debt for goods and services, other than a short term trade credit. Security payments Under section EH 5 (3), when a person receives a security payment for a loss and a deduction is not otherwise allowable for the loss, the person is allowed a deduction for the loss up to the amount of the security payment. Bad debts recovered Under section CE 1 (1)(d), amounts received by a person on account of a bad debt for which a deduction has previously been allowed to the person are included as gross income of the person. continued on page 36 36 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) whether the facts would indicate to a reasonable and prudent business person that, on the balance of prob- abilities, it is unlikely that the debt will be paid. This objective test was outlined by Barber DJ in Case N69 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,541 on page 3,548: Naturally, the debts in question must be “bad” to be written off as bad in terms of s. 106(1)(b). This is a question of fact. Generally, an application of that criterion will not be difficult as the debtor will be insolvent. However, the debtor does not need to be insolvent for the debt to be bad. It is only necessary that there be a bona fide assessment that the debtor is unlikely to make payment of the debt. If there is a clear understanding or arrangement that there be long term credit, and if the taxpayer believes that the terms of the credit will be met, then the debt cannot be treated as bad because it is merely a situation of deferred payment. In my view, as well as the need for the writing off to be made bona fide, the circumstances must indicate to a reasonable and prudent business person that, on the balance of probability, the debt is unlikely to be recovered. This is an objective test. The creditor taxpayer may, of course still hope for recovery and is quite entitled to institute recovery procedures. It is not necessary to have taken recovery or legal steps. ... It does not follow from the taxpayer hoping for or seeking recovery that a debt is not bad. However, usually, when a debt is assessed as bad, in terms of the type of criteria I have outlined, hopes or efforts of recovery will be futile. The test was cited with approval by Justice Doogue in the High Court decision of Graham v CIR, Edwards Graham Ltd & Edwards v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,107, 12,111. A similar test to that outlined by Barber DJ was outlined by Justice Tompkins in the High Court decision of Budget Rent A Car Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,263, 12,269: The term “bad debt” is not defined in the Act. It, therefore, should be given its normal commercial meaning. It is a question of fact to be determined objectively. A debt becomes a bad debt when a reasonably prudent commercial person would conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid in whole or in part by the debtor or by someone else either on behalf of the debtor or otherwise. Taxpayer’s opinion A debt is a bad debt if a reasonable and prudent busi- ness person would think that the debt is bad. A taxpayer in business is, in all likelihood, a reasonable and prudent business person. In most instances, the taxpay- er’s opinion will suffice. However, the Commissioner also recognises that taxpayers have a financial interest in claiming that a debt is bad. Writing off a debt as bad entitles a taxpayer to: •A deduction in calculating income for income tax purposes, worth up to 33 percent of the debt: •A GST deduction from output tax of the tax fraction of the debt. Because of this, the Commissioner may inquire into the decision to treat a debt as bad in the course of tax audits. from page 35 Legislation - Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Section 26 of the GST Act is the main provision applying to bad debts for GST purposes. Section 26 applies to registered persons who account for GST on an invoice or hybrid basis. It also applies to registered persons who account for GST on a payments basis when the relevant supply is by way of a hire purchase sale or a door to door sale. Section 26 allows a registered person to make a deduc- tion from output tax for that portion of the amount of tax charged in relation to a supply as the amount written off as a bad debt bears to the total consideration for the supply. To claim the deduction, the registered person must satisfy a number of criteria. Section 26(1)(c) sets out one of these criteria, namely that the registered person must have written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person. The other criteria (in summary form) that must also be satisfied are that the registered person must have: •Made a taxable supply for consideration in money (from which the bad debt arose); and •Furnished a return in relation to the taxable period during which the output tax on the supply was attributable, and properly accounted for the output tax on the supply. A proviso is effective if goods are supplied under a hire purchase agreement to which the Hire Purchase Act 1971 applies. In this case the registered person makes a deduction from output tax of the tax fraction (being the tax fraction applicable at the time the hire purchase agreement was entered into) of that portion of the amount written off as a bad debt as the cash price bears to the total amount payable under the hire purchase agreement. There is also a special provision for registered persons who supply contracts of insurance relating to earth- quakes, wars, and fires (see section 26(1A)). Bad debts recovered Under section 26(2), when any amount for which a deduction from output tax has properly been made is wholly or partly recovered, output tax must be returned on that amount (to the extent of the recovery) in the taxable period in which it is wholly or partly recovered. Application of the Legislation Debt must be “bad” A debt must be “bad” before it can be written off and before any deduction can be claimed for that debt. The question of whether a debt is bad is a question of fact. In evaluating the facts, the Commissioner will apply an objective test. The objective test that will be applied is 37 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Taxpayers may, therefore, wish to document and retain evidence in relation to their decisions to treat debts as bad to show that they made reasonable decisions. Documentation may include noting down the informa- tion from which the decision was made that the debt was bad, and keeping copies of any correspondence relating to the debt. Information required The amount of information required to decide whether a debt is bad depends on the particular circumstances of each case. If the amount involved is small, a reasonable and prudent business person is likely to make limited enquiries and take limited recovery action. Particular knowledge or information obtained by a taxpayer may also reduce the need for enquiry. Recovery action A creditor is likely to have taken recovery action in most cases before a deduction for a bad debt is made. It is through taking recovery action that most creditors will form an opinion as to whether a debt is bad. While recovery action is being taken, a debt can only be considered bad to the extent that a reasonable and prudent business person would consider, on the balance of probabilities, it unlikely that the debt will be paid. In some instances, taking recovery action may carry with it the reasonable expectation of recovery of some part of the amount involved. However, this will not always be the case. The decision to take recovery action and the extent of that action will depend on the circum- stances surrounding any particular case. In some cases, the creditor may take only limited recovery action because enough information is held to form a reasonable view that the debt is bad. The amount of information needed depends on the circumstances. Conversely, the creditor may take recovery action even when a reasonable view has been formed that the debt is bad. There are a number of reasons why the creditor might take recovery action, even when it is believed that it is unlikely that the debt will be recovered. This may be the case, for example, when the creditor has a policy of pursuing debtors to a certain extent to discourage customers defaulting on debt. Provision for doubtful debts Persons in business who provide credit often find it prudent to make some provision for the likelihood that some of their debtors will not pay. This allowance is generally calculated by estimating a percentage on the basis of past history, and applying that percentage to the total amount of debts owed to the business at balance date. Bad debts are individually identifiable debts that are unlikely to be recovered (in practical terms). The provision for doubtful debts is an estimate of the amount that will become bad debts in the future. The Income Tax Act and the GST Act do not allow any deduction for provisions for doubtful debts. Debts which are partially bad In some cases there may be no reasonable expectation that the debt will be fully recovered, but there may be a reasonable expectation of partial recovery. In this case the part that the creditor has no reasonable expectation of recovering is a bad debt. Examples of when a debt is/is not bad Example 1 A supplier has supplied goods on credit to Mr B. Mr B owes the supplier $2,000 for the goods. The supplier knows that Mr B has left town, and that mail addressed to him is returned marked “Gone No Address”. In this case it is reasonable to assume that the debt will not be recovered. The money owed by Mr B is a bad debt. Example 2 C owes $100,000 to a company. The credit control- ler for the company has considered the likelihood of default on every loan currently owing to the com- pany. The credit controller has estimated the likelihood of default for C to be five percent and wants to know if the company can consider $5,000 of that loan (5% of the $100,000 owing) to be a bad debt. Making an estimate of the likelihood of default on debts is not sufficient for a debt (or a percentage thereof) to be bad. It is not reasonable to assume that the debt is bad. Example 3 A local dairy has supplied $10 worth of bread and cigarettes to Mrs D on credit. Mrs D used to call into the shop every other day, but has not called into the shop for eight weeks and the $10 is still owing. Given the small amount owing, it is reasonable for the dairy to make no further enquiries. On the basis of the information that the dairy has, it can be assumed that the money is unlikely to be recovered. It is a bad debt. However, if the sum involved was larger, it may be reasonable to expect the dairy to make some further enquiry. Example 4 A solicitor has done work for Mr O and billed him for $1,700. The solicitor is on the Board of Trustees of the school attended by Mr O’s children. Further- more, several of the solicitor’s other clients and business associates deal with Mr O on a regular basis. The solicitor has sent out a number of reminder bills because the bill is four months overdue, but has had no response. Several of the solicitor’s friends and associates have mentioned that Mr O is in financial difficulty and has had one continued on page 38 38 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) A debt is not normally deductible. It does not become a deductible debt if and when it becomes a bad debt. It becomes a deductible debt, if it has been incurred in the production of assessable income, when it is written off. It is the writing off that converts the debt into a deductible debt. It follows that the crucial time is the time of the writing off, not the time the debt becomes a bad debt. It also follows that the income year referred to in s 106(1)(b) is not the year the debt became bad. In my view, the income year referred to is the year during which the bad debt was “actually written off”. There is no provision in the Act that requires the bad debt to be written off in the year the debt became bad. Had that been the intention of the legislature, it would have said so ... Barber DJ in the Taxation Review Authority discussed the requirement to write off bad debts in Case N69 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,541. Barber DJ said on page 3,547: I consider it elementary that the writing off of a debt as bad requires something more than the mere recognition by the taxpayer, or one or more of its executives, that a debt is unlikely to be paid. It could be reasoned that only a decision of the taxpayer to write off a debt is needed, subject to the debt being bad. However, I consider that, in terms of sec 106(1)(b), book-keeping steps must also be taken to record that the debt has been written off. Desirably, the steps would comprise a directors’ resolution, if the taxpayer is a corporate, and appropriate book-keeping entries. However, it would be adequate for a responsible officer or executive of a corporate or business to merely make the appropriate book-keeping entries if he or she has that authority. An unincorporated sole trader or small unincorporated business would not, of course, have a directorate so that book entries by the trader or his or her manager will suffice. In my view, it is not possible to write off a debt as bad without the making of authorised journal entries in the books of account of the business. In all cases, taxpayers must be able to clearly show that a bad debt has been written off. If debtors ledgers are maintained, the writing-off will be able to be clearly shown by the appropriate book-keeping entries having been made in the debtors ledger by authorised persons. If debtors ledgers are not maintained (generally where the business operations are small and the accounting systems unsophisticated), other action must be taken that shows that the business systems treat the debt as bad. In all cases the business records kept by the taxpayer must comply with the requirements of section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and section 75 of the GST Act. The necessary writing-off must take place before the end of the income year or GST taxable period in which the bad debt deduction is claimed. Sometimes it may be difficult from a practical point of view to make all the necessary accounting entries before the end of the income year or GST taxable period. It is, therefore, important to review all debts before the end of an income year or GST taxable period to ensure that any bad debts can be deducted in that year or GST taxable period. Writing-off cannot be back dated. The writing- off must be in the income year or GST taxable period for which the bad debt is claimed. of his vehicles repossessed. The solicitor’s office clerk has noted that Mr O’s name has been cited in the Gazette several times over recent months in respect of Court action for unpaid debts. It is reasonable for the solicitor to characterise Mr O’s debt as a bad debt. Example 5 A debtor of Mr F is a company in liquidation. Mr F has given the liquidator notice of a debt of $10,000 owed for goods and services supplied. Mr F is an unsecured creditor. The liquidator has held a meeting of creditors. Mr F attended the meeting and received formal notice of the outcome of the meet- ing. The liquidator has stated that unsecured creditors will probably receive something between 45 and 50 cents in the dollar. It is reasonable for Mr F to assume that $5,500 of the total debt is bad. Mr F is entitled to write off that part of the debt that is bad and claim a deduc- tion for income tax and GST purposes. At a later date, Mr F receives a letter from the liquidator, who advises that the estimate of the likely recovery has been revised. It is now expected that unsecured creditors will be paid between 70 and 75 cents in the dollar. This does not affect the answer given above. Also, it has no effect on Mr F’s GST return or income tax return if Mr F has claimed a deduction for the bad debt. If at any stage Mr F receives payment of any part of the 55 cents in the dollar written off, Mr F must: •Include it as gross income in the income tax return for the year in which it is received (this will give rise to an income tax liability unless there are losses to offset against it, and may give rise to a provisional tax liability, depending on the taxpayer’s circumstances); and •Account for GST on the amount recovered in the same proportion as Mr F was allowed a deduction from output tax when the bad debt was written off. Debt must be “written off” The Income Tax Act and the GST Act allow taxpayers and/or registered persons deductions for bad debts written off. It is not enough that a debt is bad: the bad debt must also be written off. Writing off the bad debt is important because this will fix the time at which the deduction can be made. Note that there is no require- ment that a debt be written off in the year it becomes bad. As Justice Tompkins in the High Court decision of Budget Rent A Car Ltd v CIR (supra) on page 12,271 stated: from page 37 39 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Accounts kept by taxpayers Most taxpayers in business keep double-entry accounts. If a person keeps double-entry accounting records, the bad debt must be struck out of the records on which the double-entry accounts are based. Generally, this means that the balance in the debtors ledger for the individual debtor must be reduced by the amount of the bad debt. In cases where a taxpayer does not keep double-entry accounting records and/or does not keep a debtors ledger, the person must write the debt off according to the form of records used. This means that however the person records the debt owing, the record showing the amount owed by the bad debtor must illustrate that the creditor has no reasonable expectation of getting payment for the amount of the bad debt. For example, if the only record of debtors is a copy invoice book, it is acceptable to write across the copy invoice “BAD DEBT”, with the date and a brief note of the reason (e.g. “Bankruptcy notice in newspaper”). Keeping records for credit control or other purposes For a variety of reasons, a creditor may keep a separate record of bad debts written off. For example, the records may be necessary if the creditor should ever have the opportunity of collecting the debt in the future, or the creditor may want to keep a record of problem custom- ers to avoid future difficulties. As long as these records are quite separate from the accounting base records they will not affect the write- off. If the creditor ceases to recognise the debt as an asset for accounting purposes by removing it from the accounting base records, it is written off. More than one set of accounts Some businesses have more than one set of accounts. For example, a company may prepare: •Financial accounts for financial reporting purposes to satisfy the requirements of the Companies Act 1955 or 1993; and •Management accounts as a basis for management decision-making and control. The sets of accounts may be prepared in quite different ways. For example, there are statutory requirements set out in the Financial Reporting Act 1993 for preparing financial reports that are not required when preparing management accounts; and management accounts may be prepared on the basis of estimates for some elements in order to provide very quick reports. When the different sets of accounts rely on the same underlying debtor records, there is no problem. As long as the creditor ceases to recognise the debt as an asset for accounting purposes by removing it from the accounting base records, it is written off. However, if the debt is still recognised as an asset in the underlying records, it is not written off. If the different sets of accounts rely on different underly- ing debtor records (which is very rare), the creditor should refer to the accounts that are relied on to repre- sent the firm’s financial position. For a company, these will be the accounts that are used to satisfy the compa- ny’s financial reporting obligations under the relevant Companies Act. Examples of when a bad debt is/is not written off General facts The following facts apply to all the following examples: •The taxpayer’s income tax balance date is 31 March. •The only question is whether a debt has been written off. All other criteria are satisfied. •The debt is for goods and services supplied for money. •The supply has been included in the taxpayer’s gross income for income tax purposes. In the examples where the taxpayer is a GST registered person, the following additional facts apply: •GST returns are filed on a two-monthly invoice basis. •The supply has been included in a GST return. Example 1 The taxpayer maintains a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. The debtors ledger is written up on 31 March 1996. The entries written up include the journal entry writing off the bad debt. The bad debt is deductible in the year ending 31 March 1996. Example 2 The taxpayer maintains a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. The debtors ledger is written up on 1 April 1996. The entries written up include the journal entry writing off the bad debt. The bad debt is deductible in the year ending 31 March 1997. Example 3 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is registered for GST. There is no indication on her underlying debtor records to show the status of the debt. She has claimed a deduction from output tax for the bad debt in her GST return for the taxable period ending 31 January 1996. That return was prepared in February 1996. The taxpayer is not entitled to the deduction from GST output tax. She is not allowed a deduction for the bad debt in the income year ending 31 March 1996. Claiming the deduction from output tax for GST purposes is not a sufficient writing-off of the bad debt. continued on page 40 40 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) The taxpayer’s income tax return for the year ending 31 March 1996 includes the profit and loss statement and a “tax reconciliation statement” showing the difference between the accounting income and the amount she believes to be income for income tax purposes. The tax reconciliation statement includes a deduction for the bad debt. The taxpayer is not allowed a deduction for the bad debt. Although the debt has been written off in the underlying accounting records, she has not ceased to recognise the debt as an asset for accounting purposes. Example 7 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. His only records of debts owing are copies of invoices and statements issued. In February 1996 the taxpayer became aware that a debt was bad. He stopped sending out state- ments for the debt and took no other action on it. In particular, he sent out no statements on the account in February and March 1996. The taxpayer contin- ued to send out statements on all the other debts owing, including overdue accounts. The taxpayer keeps carbon copies of the statements of account in the duplicate account book from which the state- ments for issue are prepared. The taxpayer has tagged the final statement sent out in respect of the debt, marking it “bad debt”. The taxpayer is allowed a deduction for the bad debt in the year ending 31 March 1996. The cessation of statements of account, recorded by their absence in the duplicate account book, and the tagging of the final statement, amount to writing off the debt in his accounting system. Example 4 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. The taxpayer’s only records of debts owing to her are copies of invoices she has issued. She has placed the invoice for the debt in question in a file marked “BAD DEBTS” in February 1996. The taxpayer is allowed a deduction for the bad debt in the year ending 31 March 1996. Example 5 The taxpayer maintains a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. She wrote up the debtors ledger on 31 March 1995. The entries written up include a journal entry writing off a bad debt. The taxpayer’s accountant prepares her accounts in June 1995. In the course of preparing the accounts, the accountant makes a general ledger entry recognising the bad debt as a result of the debtors ledger entry made by the taxpayer on 31 March 1995. The bad debt is deductible in the year ending 31 March 1995. That is because the underlying accounting record of the debt was altered to recog- nise the bad debt on 31 March 1995. Example 6 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. Her only records of debts owing are copies of invoices issued. On 15 March 1995 she placed the invoice for the debt in question in a file marked “BAD DEBTS”. The amount of trade creditors in the taxpayer’s balance sheet as at 31 March 1996 includes the bad debt. The taxpayer’s profit and loss statement for the year ending 31 March 1996 includes as income the sale that has become a bad debt. The profit and loss statement does not recognise any expense for bad or doubtful debts. from page 39 Debt forgiveness in consideration of natural love and affection Public Ruling - BR Pub 96/4A Note (not part of ruling): Public ruling BR Pub 96/4 (see TIB Volume Seven, No.10 \[March 1996\] at page 14) concerned sections BB 9, EH 4 (6), and GD 11 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section 6 of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 repeals and replaces section BB 9, and section 257 of that Act repeals and replaces section GD 11, with effect from the 1997-98 income year. Section 91G(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 states that when a taxation law that is the subject of a binding ruling is repealed, the ruling ceases to apply to the extent of, and from the effective date of, that repeal. This means that public ruling BR Pub 96/4 will not apply to the 1997- 98 income year and subsequent income years, but will apply to the 1996-97 income year. Public ruling BR Pub 96/4A replaces public ruling BR Pub 96/4 with effect from the 1997-98 income year. It is intended that the cessation of public ruling BR Pub 96/4 and its replacement by public ruling BR Pub 96/4A should have no practical effect on the application of the taxation law contained in the rulings to the relevant taxpayers. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 41 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections EH 4 (6), GD 11, and BG 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the forgiveness of an amount owing under a debt by a natural person in consideration of natural love and affection. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: Section EH 4 (6) allows relief for debtors (issuers) from income tax under the accruals rules. Section EH 4 (6) allows relief when an amount under a debt is forgiven by a natural person in consideration of natural love and affection. It does not apply when an amount is forgiven by a company. Section EH 4 (6) can apply to: •A debt forgiveness between near relatives, such as father and child, brother and sister, husband and wife, and de facto parents; and •A debt forgiveness by testamentary disposition; and •A debt forgiveness by a trust settlor or creditor to a family trust, being a fixed trust where the creditor has or would have had a relationship of natural love and affection with all of the trust beneficiaries, other than residual or default beneficiaries; and • A debt forgiveness by a trust settlor or creditor to a family trust, being a discretionary trust where the creditor has or would have had a relationship of natural love and affection with all, or all the primary, trust objects or potential beneficiaries; and •A partial debt forgiveness; and •A conditional debt forgiveness (where the debt is not forgiven until the condi- tions are fulfilled), provided that, in each case, the requirements of the section are satisfied. The Commissioner considers that the section does not apply to: •A debt forgiveness to a company (including a family company); or •A debt forgiveness by a trustee to the trust beneficiaries; or •A debt forgiveness that forms part of a tax avoidance arrangement in terms of a provision such as section GD 11 or section BG 1. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to amounts of debts forgiven in the 1997-98 and 1998-99 income years, and applies to taxpayers with standard, early, or late balance dates for these years. This Ruling is signed by me on the 8th day of December 1996. Jeffrey Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) commentary on page 42 42 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 96/4A This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 96/4A (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Ruling BR Pub 96/4 (in TIB Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) at page 14 under the heading Debt forgiveness in consideration of natural love and affection). The Ruling replaces and supersedes that earlier ruling with effect from the 1997-98 income year. Background The relevant provisions of the accruals rules are sections EH 1 to EH 10. Base price adjustment calculations for financial ar- rangements are contained in section EH 4. The base price adjustment is effectively a “wash up” calculation of all income or expenditure under a financial arrange- ment upon the maturity, transfer, or remission of that arrangement. Generally, under section EH 4, any principal, interest, or other amount payable on a financial arrangement that is “remitted” is gross income to the issuer. If the debt is remitted, the issuer is the debtor. This is illustrated by the examples below. Example 1 Creditor lends Debtor $50,000 repayable in two years with $10,000 interest. In the second year of the loan, however, Debtor is in financial difficulties. Creditor agrees to accept $50,000 with no interest in full and final settlement of Debtor’s obligations. The $10,000 interest is accordingly remitted in the second year. Debtor, however, claimed an income tax deduction for $5,000 of the interest in the first year (on an accruals basis). Assume Creditor is not a cash basis holder. Debtor’s base price adjustment in the second year effectively results in the recapture of her income tax deduction of $5,000. She has derived gross income of $5,000. Her gross income is calculated as fol- lows: a + (b - c) =$50,000 - ($50,000 + $5,000) =- $5,000 (income). (A negative result is income for an issuer). For Creditor, the holder of the financial arrange- ment, a bad debt deduction for the $5,000 forgiven would be available if the requirements of section EH 5 (1) were satisfied prior to the remission. Example 2 Assume that Creditor made the loan under Example 1 and that Debtor had claimed an income tax deduction of $5,000 in the first year (on an accruals basis). Assume, however, that after the first year, Debtor’s financial difficulties lead the parties to agree that only $40,000 of principal and $10,000 of interest would be repaid in the second year’s full and final settlement. If the balance of the interest ($5,000) were deductible by Debtor in the second year, she would have gross income of $5,000 under the base price adjustment. This is because the deductible interest in that year would partly offset her taxable remission income of $10,000. Debtor’s base price adjustment would be: a - (b + c) =$40,000 + $10,000 - ($50,000 + $5,000) =- $5,000 (income). Creditor could only claim a deduction for the remission under section EH 5 (2) if she satisfied the requirements of that subsection prior to the remis- sion. Creditor would only be entitled to a bad debt deduction if she carried on a business of holding or dealing in such financial arrangements and was not associated with Debtor.

It replaces, without material amendment, the former section 64F(7B) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 64F(7B) applied to debt forgiveness from 1 October 1987. Before 1 October 1987, section 64F(7A) applied to forgiveness by testamentary disposition, and section 64F(7) applied to other forgiveness. The terms and effect of those two subsections differ from sections 64F(7B) and EH 4 (6). Section EH 4 (6) applies to both testamentary and other debt forgiveness. 43 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Section EH 4 (6) Section EH 4 (6) states: Where an amount owing under a debt (including any amount accrued and unpaid at the time of the forgiveness) is forgiven by a natural person in consideration of natural love and affection, the amount forgiven shall, for the purposes of the qualified accruals rules, be deemed to have been paid when the amount is forgiven. Application of the Legislation Requirements of section EH 4 (6) In summary, for section EH 4 (6) to apply: •There must be an amount owing. •It must be owing under a debt. •It may include any amount accrued and unpaid. •It must be forgiven. •It must be forgiven by a natural person. •It must be forgiven in consideration of natural love and affection. The following discusses some of the requirements of the subsection. Debt Section EH 4 (6) only applies when there is “an amount owing under a debt”. It is not available for forgiveness of all types of “financial arrangement” that may be subject to the accruals rules. “Financial arrangement” as defined in section OB 1 is a very broad term. For example, it includes sell-back and buy-back arrange- ments, debt defeasances, and assignments of income. None of these is, in itself, a debt. “Debt” is not defined in the Act. Accordingly, the expression is given its ordinary or common meaning. In legal terms a “debt” is understood to be a liquidated money demand or something recoverable in court by action for debt. A debt is a certain sum due from one person to another, either by record (e.g. court judgment) or in writing. Forgiven An amount under a debt must be “forgiven” for section EH 4 (6) to apply. The expression “forgiven” does not necessarily mean the same thing as “remitted” (as defined for accruals rules purposes in section EH 4 (9)(c)). “Remitted” includes a wider range of events that are not necessarily forgiveness. These events could include when the issuer has been released from making payments by operation of statute (e.g. the Insolvency Act 1967) or lapse of time (e.g. become statute barred). “Forgiven” is not defined in the Act. The expression must be given its ordinary or common meaning. That is the giving up of any claim to restitution or remedy for an obligation. That forgiveness must be a positive act by the creditor (holder) as opposed to a consequence of the operation of statute or the lapse of time. Such forgiveness is normally evidenced by a deed or other document. Partial forgiveness The Commissioner considers that section EH 4 (6) can apply to a partial debt forgiveness. The subsection applies in broadly the same way as to a full debt forgive- ness. It deems the amount forgiven to be paid for the purposes of the base price adjustment calculation. A difference, however, is that a partial debt remission does not trigger a base price adjustment, unless it accompa- nies maturity or transfer of the financial arrangement. Conditional forgiveness If a forgiveness is conditional, it does not occur until the conditions are fulfilled. Accordingly, the Commissioner considers that the amount conditionally forgiven is not deemed paid under section EH 4 (6) until the conditions are fulfilled. Natural person The person forgiving the debt (the creditor or holder) must be a “natural person”. The expression “natural person” is a legal term. Its meaning is not altered by the Act. It is a human being as opposed to an artificial person (such as a company): Pharmaceutical Society v London & Provincial Supply Assn. (1880) 5 A.C. 857, 869-870. This item sets out the Commissioner’s interpretation of “natural person” for deceased persons and for trusts settled by natural persons. In consideration of natural love and affection This requirement of the subsection confines it to family and other private transactions. It does not apply to business or commercial arrangements. The phrase “in consideration of natural love and affection” is another legal concept. It is not further defined in the Act. Natural love and affection is generally considered to subsist between near relatives, such as father and child, brother and sister, and husband and wife. The Commis- sioner considers that natural love and affection can equally subsist within families with married or de facto married parents. Except as discussed below in relation to trusts, the Commissioner considers that section EH 4 (6) requires that the natural love and affection exist between the creditor and the debtor. The Commissioner considers that in some cases it would be possible for natural love and affection to be present outside the strict married or de facto married family. For example it could be present between life- long friends (although not ordinary friends or col- leagues). Inland Revenue does not propose to publish detailed rules or guidelines on the degree of relationship neces- sary to establish natural love and affection. This ques- tion can only be considered on a case by case basis. continued on page 44 44 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) A forgiveness to a company or other non-natural person is not in consideration of natural love and affection. Debt is deemed paid If the requirements of section EH 4 (6) are satisfied, the amount of the debt forgiven is deemed paid. This includes any amount accrued and unpaid on the debt. This consequence is deemed for all purposes within the qualified accruals rules. The main provisions when this deemed payment is relevant are sections EH 4 (base price adjustment) and EH 5 (bad debts). Broadly, the effect for the issuer or debtor is that no taxable remission arises on a base price adjustment. For the holder or creditor, no bad debt deduction is available under section EH 5 because the amount forgiven is deemed paid. Also, any interest or accruals income forgiven is taxable to the holder, for the same reason. Example 3 Assume that the forgiveness is as in Example 1. Assume, however, that Creditor and Debtor are closely related (sisters) and that the requirements of section EH 4 (6) are satisfied. Debtor has claimed a $5,000 interest deduction in the first year. In the second year, rather than $5,000 of gross income as in Example 1, Debtor’s base price adjustment would result in expenditure of $5,000. This is the balance of the interest remitted that is deemed paid. Her calculation would be: a - (b + c) =($50,000 + $10,000) - ($50,000 + $5,000) =$5,000 (expenditure). (The amount deemed paid, $10,000, is added into item ‘a’). Creditor is required over the two years to return the $10,000 of interest remitted as gross income under the accruals rules. No bad debt deduction is avail- able for the remission as it is deemed paid. Example 4 Assume that the forgiveness is as in Example 2. Assume, however, that Creditor and Debtor are closely related (sisters) and that the requirements of section EH 4 (6) are satisfied. Rather than $5,000 of gross income as in Example 2, Debtor’s base price adjustment would result in expenditure of $5,000. This is the balance of the interest paid. The $10,000 of debt remitted is not taxable to Debtor, as Debtor is deemed to have paid it. Debtor’s calculation would be: a - (b + c) =($50,000 + $10,000) - ($50,000 + $5,000) =$5,000 (expenditure). Creditor is assessed on the $10,000 interest re- ceived. She is not entitled to a bad debt deduction for the remission as it is deemed paid. Testamentary dispositions and trusts Taxpayers and advisers have asked Inland Revenue to set out the Commissioner’s interpretation of section EH 4 (6) for testamentary dispositions and trusts. Testamentary dispositions The question has arisen as to whether a deceased taxpayer can be a “natural person” for section EH 4 (6) purposes. For example, can section EH 4 (6) apply to a debt forgiveness by will when the other requirements of that provision are present? The Commissioner considers that the deceased can be a “natural person” and that section EH 4 (6) can apply. This is because, under section 24 of the Wills Act 1837 (UK), in relation to the property of the deceased, a will speaks and takes effect from the time immediately prior to the deceased’s death. (The Wills Act 1837 (UK) has been incorporated into New Zealand law). Accordingly, the Commissioner considers that section EH 4 (6) will apply to a testamentary debt when its requirements would have been satisfied immediately prior to the deceased’s death. Family fixed trusts The issue has also arisen of whether the forgiveness of debt to a trust may satisfy section EH 4 (6). The situa- tion envisaged is when a trust settlor or creditor is a natural person. He or she has natural love and affection for the trust beneficiaries. The trust is a fixed trust (i.e. the trust deed sets out the share or interest that each beneficiary is to take) for beneficiaries. The trust owes the settlor or creditor a debt. The creditor forgives the debt to the trust. The Commissioner considers that the subsection can apply, provided that all the requirements are satisfied. The Commissioner considers that it is necessary to “look through” the trust from the creditor to the benefi- ciaries in determining whether there is natural love and affection. The presence or absence of that state between the creditor and the trustee, in his or her private capac- ity, is irrelevant. Similarly, the presence or absence of that state between the trustee and the beneficiaries is irrelevant. The state must exist, or have existed, between the natural person creditor and all of the trust’s beneficiar- ies (subject to the comments below about certain residual or default beneficiaries). Family discretionary trusts The position is less clear for discretionary trusts when the class of beneficiaries includes persons for whom the settlor or other creditor has natural love or affection. For the reasons outlined above, the Commissioner considers that the subsection can apply when either all, or all of the primary, trust objects or potential benefici- aries are persons for whom the creditor has or would have had natural love and affection. from page 43 45 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Family trusts with certain residual or default beneficiaries A related question is whether the subsection applies if a fixed trust has certain residual or default beneficiaries for which the settlor does not have natural love and affection. For example, it is common for family trusts to have charities and similar bodies as residual beneficiar- ies. The Commissioner considers that this would not preclude the subsection from applying. The Commis- sioner considers that it will usually be sufficient if the creditor has, or would have had, natural love and affection for the primary beneficiaries of the trust. Section EH 4 (6) will not apply when a charity or other person unrelated to the person forgiving is a primary beneficiary. Similarly, the subsection will not apply when family members are not the obvious focus of a discretionary trust deed. Inland Revenue does not propose to publish guidelines on the distinction between primary and minor beneficiaries. If necessary, this issue can be considered on a case by case basis. Example 5 Son owes Father a debt of $10,000. Father dies, and his will provides for the debt to be forgiven. Section EH 4 (6) applies and Son is deemed to have paid the debt to Father for accruals purposes. Example 6 Mother has established a trust, with her children as beneficiaries as to one-third each. The residual beneficiary, if the other beneficiaries pre-decease, is a charity for the promotion of musical education. Mother has sold her business assets to the trust for a debt back owed by the trust of $100,000. Mother forgives the $100,000 debt in consideration of natural love and affection of the beneficiaries. Section EH 4 (6) applies and the trustee is deemed to have paid the debt for accruals purposes. The existence of the residual beneficiary does not prevent the subsection applying. Example 7 Prior to his death, the deceased established a family discretionary trust for his children. He lent the trust money to pay for an overseas trip by his children. His will provided for the loans to be forgiven. Section EH 4 (6) applies and the trustee is deemed to have paid the debt for accruals purposes. Situations where section EH 4 (6) does not apply The Commissioner considers that section EH 4 (6) is not applicable when: •The party that owes the debt which is forgiven is a company. This includes a family company or close company. In the Commissioner’s view, a person can never have natural love and affection for a company or other artificial person. The Commissioner has considered submissions that focus upon the similari- ties between family companies and family trust arrangements. However, there is a clear legal distinc- tion between these chosen vehicles, in that a company has separate legal personality from its shareholders. Accordingly, any relationship between the creditor and the shareholders is irrelevant. •A trustee forgives a debt owed by the trust beneficiar- ies. This is irrespective of a trustee’s natural love and affection for the beneficiaries. The trustee’s natural love and affection arises in his or her personal capacity. It would be improper for the trustee to forgive a debt in consideration of his or her natural love and affection for the beneficiaries. The trustee could only forgive in accordance with his or her duties as trustee (as set out in the trust deed). At least in the statutory context of section EH 4 (6), the Commissioner considers that a trustee acting in his or her capacity as trustee is not a natural person. The settlor’s natural love and affection for the beneficiar- ies would also be irrelevant as the forgiveness would be by the trustee. •The debt forgiveness forms part of a tax avoidance arrangement in terms of a provision such as section GD 11 or BG 1. For example, an individual taxpayer owes a bank an amount under a debt which she cannot pay in full. The individual pays what she can, and the bank, in turn, transfers the balance of the debt to the taxpayer’s spouse for nominal consideration. The spouse forgives the balance supposedly within section EH 4 (6). In these circumstances the Commis- sioner might invoke an anti-avoidance provision such as section BG 1. 46 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Bay of Plenty Co-operative Fertiliser Company Ltd’s offer to Southfert Co-operative Ltd shareholders Product Ruling - BR Prd 96/40 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section HH 3 (5), the definition of “beneficiary income” in section OB 1, section EH 1 and section EH 4. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is that pursuant to the offer document dated 29 August 1996 (“Offer Document”) to Southfert Co-operative Limited (“Southfert”) sharehold- ers, Bay of Plenty Co-operative Fertiliser Company Limited (“BOP”) offers to purchase all the ordinary shares of $1.00 each of Southfert. Each Southfert shareholder who accepts the above offer will receive as considera- tion for the Southfert shares sold to BOP: •Initially, one fully paid BOP share for every two Southfert shares sold to BOP; and •Additional fully paid BOP shares in the 1996/97, 1997/98 and 1998/99 sea- sons for each tonne of fertiliser purchased by the particular Southfert share- holder (“deferred consideration”). Instead of issuing the BOP shares in pro- gressive stages, BOP will issue BOP shares in respect of the deferred consid- eration immediately to the Southfert/BOP Fertiliser Trust Company Limited (“Trustee”) which will hold the BOP shares on trust (“the Trust”) pending release to the Southfert shareholders in successive seasons. At the end of each of the three seasons following settlement, BOP will notify the Trustee of the amount of BOP shares which should be provided as deferred consideration, and the Trustee will transfer the relevant BOP shares to those persons. If the Trustee has insufficient shares to satisfy the payment of the deferred con- sideration, BOP may issue further shares to the Trustee. Alternatively, BOP may issue shares directly to the Southfert shareholders or pay an amount of cash to the Southfert shareholders equal to the value of the BOP shares constituting deferred consideration which BOP or the Trustee is obliged to provide in terms of the offer. Terms and conditions of BOP shares issued The BOP shares initially issued to the Southfert shareholders will be non-voting and not be entitled to receive any distributions (as defined in section 2 of the Companies Act 1993), bonus issues, cash issues or any other benefit provided to BOP shareholders prior to 31 May 1999. However, the Southfert shareholders will be entitled to receive all rebates or other distributions based on the volume of trading between the holder of the share and BOP. The BOP shares transferred to the Trust will be non-voting and will not carry any rights to receive dividends, rebates or distributions of any nature whatso- ever. After 31 May 1999, all the BOP shares issued in respect of the Southfert shares (the BOP shares initially issued to the Southfert shareholders and the deferred consideration) will become pari passu with all other ordinary BOP shares be- cause they will carry the same rights as all other ordinary BOP shares. 47 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Terms and conditions of the Trust Pursuant to the trust deed dated 29 August 1996 between BOP and the Trustee, BOP will pay the expenses of the Trustee, although the Trustee will not be remu- nerated. The Trust will not provide any consideration for the transfer of shares from BOP. It will also not receive any consideration when it distributes the BOP shares to the Southfert shareholders. The Trust will not derive any income for the time it holds the BOP shares. The Southfert shareholders will not have any rights or interests in the BOP shares held by the Trust except as expressly set out in clause 3 of the trust deed (which relates to the tonnage of fertiliser purchased). BOP will not have any rights to, or interests in the BOP shares held by the Trust or any other asset of any nature held by the Trust. If there are surplus BOP shares remaining in the Trust after the deferred consid- eration obligations have been discharged, those shares will be cancelled or extin- guished for nil consideration to the Trustee. Other facts of the Arrangement and relevant information are as set out in the: •Offer Document dated 29 August 1996; and •Trust deed dated 29 August 1996 between BOP and the Trustee; and •Application for this product ruling dated 12 August 1996. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is made on the assumptions that: •The transactions between BOP and the Southfert shareholders are at arm’s length; and •BOP will provide a service for the benefit of the Trust at less than market value being the payment of the administration fees of the Trust; and •BOP is a resident for New Zealand tax purposes; and •The lowest price that BOP and the Southfert shareholders who accept BOP’s offer would have agreed upon for the Southfert shares being sold, at the time that the agreement for sale and purchase of the Southfert shares is entered into on the basis of full payment to the Southfert shareholders at the time at which the Southfert shares are transferred to BOP, is equal to the value of all BOP shares which are required to be provided to those Southfert shareholders pursuant to the terms of the offer (the BOP shares initially issued to the Southfert shareholders and the deferred consideration). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The distributions of BOP shares from the Trust to the Southfert shareholders (in their capacity as beneficiaries) will not be assessable for income tax pursu- ant to section HH 3 (5) and the definition of “beneficiary income” in section OB 1; and •The price of the Southfert shares is the value of the BOP shares which are required to be provided by BOP under the terms of the offer (the BOP shares initially issued to the Southfert shareholders and the deferred consideration); and •No accrual expenditure or income under section EH 1 or EH 4 will arise to the Southfert shareholders from the “financial arrangement” (as defined in sec- tion OB 1) that is created by the Arrangement. continued on page 48 48 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) from page 47 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 5 December 1996 to 31 March 2001. This Ruling is signed by me on the 4th day of December 1996.

We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 Tax treatment of United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund pensions Section CB 9 (e): Income exempted from income tax by another Act: A taxpayer is an ex-employee of the United Nations and the recipient of a United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF) pension. She has asked whether the pension is exempt from New Zealand income tax under section CB 9 (e). Section CB 9 (e) exempts from tax: Income expressly exempted from income tax by any other Act, to the extent of the exemption so provided. The Act that the taxpayer believes exempts her from tax is the Diplomatic Privi- leges and Immunities Act 1968. Section 9 of that Act allows the Governor Gen- eral to make regulations exempting staff of international organisations, such as the United Nations, from New Zealand tax. Regulations made under the pred- ecessor to the 1968 Act, and still in force because of section 20(d) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1924, provide for certain exemptions for staff of the United Nations (there are also regulations covering staff of other United Nations agen- cies such as the World Health Organisation). However, the regulations (such as regulations 11 to 14 of the Diplomatic Privi- leges (United Nations) Order 1959) only exempt current employees of the United Nations from tax. They do not exempt ex-staff members from tax on pensions in respect of past service, particularly if those pensions are paid not by the United Nations but by the UNJSPF. Accordingly, the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1968 and the Orders made under that Act (or its predecessors) do not apply to make the pensions exempt from tax. This means it is necessary to determine if the pension is taxable in New Zealand. The pension is taxable in New Zealand and it is taxable for the following reasons. A non-resident contributory superannuation scheme, like the UNJSPF, is a unit trust as defined in the Income Tax Act 1994. As such it is deemed to be a com- pany for tax purposes. Distributions from a unit trust are treated as dividends for tax purposes. Therefore, the pension payments are assessable distributions from a unit trust. Generally, distributions from superannuation funds are ex- empt from income tax to the beneficiaries. However, the UNJSPF is not a “super- annuation fund” as defined in section OB 1, so the exemption cannot apply to them. The UNJSPF is not a “superannuation fund” because the fund is not registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. Furthermore, the foreign investment fund (FIF) income tax rules apply to the UNJSPF, unless an exemption to the FIF regime applies. Exemptions that could possibly apply, depending on the precise terms of the UNJSPF’s constituent documents and the circumstances of the recipient, include the employment- related foreign superannuation scheme exemption, the qualifying foreign private annuity (QFPA) exemption, or the exemption for interests of no more than 50 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) $20,000. For more detail on the FIF regime, and the exemptions, see our booklet Foreign Investment Funds (IR 275B). For more details on the QFPA exemption see the appendix to TIB Volume Eight, No.5 (September 1996). If an FIF regime exemption applies, it merely means that the FIF regime (including its reporting requirements) does not apply. It does not mean there is a general income tax exemption. Pensions from the UNJSPF will still be taxed as an assessable distri- bution from a unit trust. 51 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Challenging the validity of an assessment by judicial review proceedings Case:New Zealand Wool Board v CIR Keywords:Validity of assessment, objection proceedings, judicial review Summary:The Objector was unable to challenge the validity of the Commissioner’s assess- ment by judicial review, as an assessment had been issued, and an objection filed, which was clearly destined for the High Court. The Objector first had to exhaust the objection process in order to challenge the correctness and validity of the assessment. Facts:The Objector invested $100 million in redeemable preference shares, and treated all dividends received as exempt income under section 63 of the Income Tax Act 1976. The Commissioner issued an amended assessment and the Objector ob- jected challenging both the correctness of the assessment and its validity. The Objector challenged the validity of the assessment and applied for judicial re- view in the High Court. The Commissioner informed the court that the objection would be disallowed. Decision:The Court held when an assessment has been made, a taxpayer challenging the validity of that assessment should use the statutory objection procedure; follow- ing Golden Bay Cement Co Ltd v CIR. The Court held when no assessment has been made, the statutory objection procedure will not be available, and therefore, the taxpayer may seek judicial review; following BNZ Finance Ltd v Holland & Nash. The Court found in the present case that an assessment had been made, and an objection lodged, and the objection proceedings were clearly destined for the High Court where, as a matter of common sense, they would be consolidated with the judicial review proceedings. Therefore, the Court held that the Objector first had to exhaust the objection process in order to challenge the correctness and validity of the assessment. Ability to lead evidence on the Commissioner’s actions and procedures Case:High Court Auckland M 245/96 Act:Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 - section 24 Keywords:Taxation Review Authorities powers, challenge to validity Summary:The High Court found that the Objector was entitled to lead evidence necessary to enable the TRA to deal with the matter in the manner for which the Objector 52 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) contends. The TRA does not attack the method by which the Commissioner reaches his decision, rather it reaches its own decision as to an appropriate assessment. Facts:This case concerned an appeal to the High Court regarding the Objector’s ability to cross examine and lead evidence on the Commissioner’s actions and proce- dures. Decision:The High Court held that the TRA has all the powers of the Commissioner (at s 32 of ITA 1976) and may receive any evidence, whether normally admissible or not. Therefore, it can make any assessment which the Commissioner is empow- ered to make, and can hear the taxpayer’s case without examining the process which led to the Commissioner’s assessment. In reaching its own decision as to the appropriate assessment to be made the TRA can cure any defects that may have existed in the Commissioner’s assessment. Therefore, the High Court held that a challenge to process is effected, not by attacking the method by which the Commissioner reached his decision, but by calling the evidence necessary to enable the TRA to make a correct decision. Amended assessments of group companies disallowing deductions for loss setoffs Case:Hotdip Galvanisers (Christchurch Limited) v CIR Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 191(5), (7A), (7B), and 188(4) Keywords:Group companies, loss setoffs Summary:The Commissioner determined that interest deductions in respect of a loss com- pany were remitted under section 188(4) of the Income Tax Act 1976. The Court found that the Commissioner was entitled to issue amended assessments to group companies disallowing the deduction for loss setoffs. Facts:Three companies formed a specified group for the purposes of section 191(5). For two income years losses incurred by one of the companies were offset against profits of the other two companies. A receiver was appointed to the loss com- pany. The receiver paid a substantial sum of money to the debenture holders, but they made no appropriation between principal and interest. The Commis- sioner determined that some of the loss company’s interest deductions were to be treated as being either remitted or cancelled under section 188(4). The Com- missioner issued an amended assessment disallowing the deduction for the loss setoffs. Decision:The Court held that section 191(7B) provides that any deduction of a loss in- curred by another company in a group in calculating income shall be deemed a deduction to which sections 188(4), (5) and (6) apply. Therefore, the Commis- sioner was authorised to apply s 188(4) and issue amended assessments in re- spect of the group companies. The Court held that the presumption in Clayton’s case applied so that where a debt is paid and no appropriation is made it is presumed that the sum paid is in relation to the first debit item applied. The presumption did not require there to be competing claimants of equal priority to which the money could be appropri- ated. The Court held that the Commissioner had authority to alter the companies’ assessments as the first debt incurred was principal, so the interest was not paid off when the company was struck off. As liability for that interest was later cancelled the deduction in respect of the loss setoffs could not be allowed. 53 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Profits from the sale of shares Case:Rangatira Limited v CIR Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 65(2)(a) Keywords:Profits from the sale of shares, assessable income Summary:The Privy Council found that the Objector’s profits from the sale of shares were not assessable under section 65(2)(a). The Court of Appeal should not have disturbed the High Court’s finding of fact unless it was shown to be wrong, and in this case the decision at first instance could have gone either way. Facts:The Objector is an unlisted public company. From early on its majority share- holders were charitable trusts. Over a period of years the Objector consistently invested on a long-term basis in shares. Shares were disposed of from time to time and profits made but the Commissioner accepted that these were of a capital nature at least until 1983. Following this date there was evidence of a new and more speculative policy with respect to the sale of shares. Over the follow- ing seven years either 41 or 51 sale transactions had occurred, depending on the calculation method used. The Commissioner assessed the Objector on profits from the sale of shares and securities which had been acquired on or after 1 April 1983. The High Court found largely in favour of the Objector. The Commissioner appealed and the Court of Appeal found the transactions to be assessable under section 65(2)(a) with the exception of the 1986 year which was out of time for assessment. Decision:The Privy Council held that whether a particular business consists of or includes the buying and selling of shares from profit depends entirely upon the evidence produced as to the nature of the business activity. However, the Privy Council held that an appellant Court should not disturb a finding of fact unless it is shown to be wrong. Therefore, the Court of Appeal should not have disturbed the finding of the trial judge in this case as the deci- sion at first instance could have gone either way. 54 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) Booklets available from Inland Revenue This list shows all of Inland Revenue’s information booklets as at the date of this Tax Information Bulletin.

Background From 1 April 1996, United Kingdom social security pensions (UK pensions) were paid directly to UK pensioners in New Zealand. From 1 April 1997 there will be a special banking option which allows New Zealand recipients of overseas pensions to elect to have their overseas pension paid into a special New Zealand bank account. The overseas pension will be drawn down by the New Zealand Income Support Service, which in turn will pay these pensioners an amount equivalent to the full rate of New Zealand superannuation (NZS) or veteran’s pension to which they are entitled. The subsequent tax-related amendments were added to the bill through Supplementary Order Paper no. 199, released on 15 July 1996. Key features •A new paragraph has been added to section CB 5 to exempt overseas pensions from tax. This ensures that double taxation does not occur when a pension is derived and when the equivalent amount of NZS is paid. The exemption does not extend to the equivalent NZS paid out under the special banking option. •The definitions of “New Zealand superannuation” and “veteran’s pension” have been amended to add a reference to the equivalent NZS paid under the special banking option. This enables PAYE to be deducted. Application date The amendments will apply from a date to be appointed by the Governor General by Order in Council. 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) Distributions from group investment funds Sections CF 2 (3) and OB 1, Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction Distributions from group investment funds (GIFs) are to be taxed in the same way as distributions from compa- nies and unit trusts. An amendment has been made to the anti-avoidance provision in the definition of “avail- able subscribed capital”, to reduce its ambit. The amendments were added to the bill through Supple- mentary Order Paper no. 199, released on 18 June 1996. Background Section CF 2 (3) Since 1983 it had been government policy that (except for the trust treatment referred to below) distributions by GIFs to investors were treated in the same way as distributions from companies and unit trusts, so that the tax system did not favour investors in GIFs over inves- tors in other types of managed funds. This company treatment applied except in respect of distributions from certain amounts invested into GIFs by super funds, estates and some trusts (the “protected amount”). An amendment to section CF 2 (3) in 1992 had the unintended effect of narrowing the scope of that section too far. Available subscribed capital In general, if shares are issued by a company or unit trust (including a GIF), available subscribed capital (ASC) will be equal to the amount of consideration received for those shares or units. However, the ASC definition included an anti-avoidance provision that meant that if consideration for the issue of shares or units was in the form of shares, the ASC was increased only by an amount equal to the underlying ASC of the shares contributed, not their market value. Only ASC can be returned tax-free to shareholders on a redemption of units (other than on a winding-up). Therefore if a GIF issues units and receives shares in consideration, the pool of ASC available for redemptions could be significantly less than it would have been if the ASC had increased by the market value of the shares contributed. If units are being redeemed on a regular basis that pool might, therefore, run out more quickly, which means that redemption proceeds would be taxable dividends. Key features Section CF 2 (3) has been amended to provide that, to the extent that an investor’s interest is not a protected amount (as defined in the Act), any payment to or transaction with an investor is taxable under the divi- dend rules. The fund is treated as if it were a company and the investor as if it were a shareholder. Other provisions of the Act relating to dividends, such as the imputation provisions, also apply, so that any such dividend could have imputation credits attached. The anti-avoidance provision has been amended so that its application is limited to transactions where, immedi- ately after the transaction, there is a commonality of shareholding of 10% or more between the issuing company and the company whose shares are contributed. Application date These amendments apply from 3.00 pm, 10 June 1996, when the changes were announced by the Acting Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue. Unit trusts and group investment funds Section CF 3 (1) (b) (i) (D), Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction An amendment removes from the pro rata brightline tests all redemptions of units in unlisted trusts (unit trusts and group investment funds) made in accordance with the “slice rule”. This corrects an anomaly that occurs if slice rule redemptions are treated as pro rata redemptions. Background The amendment was required as a result of amendments contained in the Income Tax Act 1994 Amendment (No.4) 1995, which introduced the new tax regime for unlisted trusts (as defined in section CF 3 (14)) . From 1 April 1996 unit trusts and group investment funds have the option of issuing units subject to either the ordering or the slice rules. Ordering rule units are redeemed first from available subscribed capital, with no tax consequences until available subscribed capital runs out. On the other hand, slice rule units involve a distribution of reserves as well as available subscribed capital. Any amount returned in excess of the capital attributable to the redeemed units is assessable as a dividend. Because unit trusts and group investment funds (in relation to category A income) are treated as companies, it was appropriate to subject redemptions of units to the pro rata brightline tests. These tests provide that if there 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) is a pro rata redemption of shares that constitute less than 10 percent, or in some cases 15 percent, of the total value of the company, the entire proceeds are deemed to be dividends. However, units issued subject to the slice rule are likely to be in a class of their own. This means that whenever they are redeemed they will be pro rata redemptions, subject to the brightline tests, and subject to tax even on the amount which would otherwise be available sub- scribed capital returned. It is unlikely that investors in unit trusts and group investment funds will systematically redeem units in lieu of dividends. Therefore, to solve this problem, redemptions of slice rule units have been removed from the pro rata brightline tests. Key features Section CF 3 (1)(b)(i)(D) of the Income Tax Act 1994 has been replaced with a new section that excludes all amounts distributed upon the redemption of units in an unlisted trust from the brightline tests if the redemption is subject to section CF 3 (1)(b)(iv)(A), known as the slice rule. Units that are redeemed subject to the “ordering rule”, section CF 3 (1)(b)(iv)(b), will still be subject to the brightline tests. A new section CF 3 (1)(b)(i)(E) has been added for those ordering rule redemptions that are not pro-rata redemptions. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 1996. FBT - Healthcare and life insurance Section CI 1, Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The Income Tax Act 1994 includes as fringe benefits employer contributions to a sickness, accident or death benefit fund for the benefit of employees, employer-paid specified insurance premiums and employer contribu- tions to an insurance fund of a friendly society for the benefit of employees. An amendment has corrected an anomaly whereby these contributions and payments also came under the definition of “monetary remuneration” in certain circumstances, and so were subject to double taxation. Background When the sickness, accident or death benefit fund contribution and life insurance premium payment provisions were added to the definition of “fringe benefit” in 1990 and 1991, by the insertion of sections CI 1 (e) and CI 1 (f), these contributions and payments were inadvertently exposed to double taxation. Fringe benefits are precluded from being caught in both the definition of “fringe benefit” and of “monetary remuneration” by the provisions of section CI 1 (o). However, at the time sections CI 1 (e) and (f) were added, section CI 1 (o) was not extended to the benefits to which these sections relate. The amendment has corrected this by ensuring that these benefits will not be classed as fringe benefits, to the extent to which they are monetary remuneration. During passage of the bill the issue was raised as to when a superannuation contribution is subject to FBT and when is it subject to specified superannuation contribution withholding tax (SSCWT). This issue is addressed in TIB Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994), at page 1. Key features Section CI 1 of the Act has been amended to ensure that employer contributions to a sickness, accident or death benefit fund for the benefit of employees, employer-paid specified insurance premiums, and employer contribu- tions to an insurance fund of a friendly society for the benefit of employees, are either subject to fringe benefit tax (FBT) or monetary remuneration, depending on the nature of the provision of the benefit. Application date As the Inland Revenue Department’s policy has been to apply the legislation as though there were no overlap between monetary remuneration and FBT, the amend- ment applies from the date of enactment, 2 September 1996, without disadvantaging taxpayers. 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) Exclusions from FBT Section CI 1 (ia), (la), OB 1, Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction Two further specific exclusions from fringe benefit tax (FBT) have been included in the Income Tax Act 1994. The exclusions relate to employee share purchase plan (ESP) loan benefits and tax assistance given to employ- ees. The exclusions allow certain fringe benefits to be provided to employees without incurring FBT because employees would have been able to get a deduction had they actually incurred the expense. Background Some situations have been identified where the payment of FBT on the benefits which are the subject of the FBT exclusions provided for in this amendment would result in overtaxation. The problem arises if an employee would have been entitled to a tax deduction for the expenditure incurred on the provision of the fringe benefit. In most cases this can be avoided by structuring the provision of the fringe benefit in a different way. The exclusions remove the need to restructure the provision of these benefits. Key features Two specific exclusions have been included in the fringe benefit definition in section CI 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994: •an exclusion for loan benefits if the sole purpose of the loan is to enable the employee to acquire shares in the employer under an ESP; •an exclusion for assistance with the tax affairs of the employee to the extent that the assistance relates to the preparation of the tax return. A new definition is introduced in section OB 1 for the purposes of the loan benefit exclusion. Under that definition an “employee share loan benefit” is a loan which meets the following requirements: •The sole purpose of the loan for the period the loan is outstanding and the exclusion is used is to enable the employee to acquire shares or rights, or options to shares, in the employer (or an associate of the em- ployer) under an ESP. •The loan is used for that purpose only. •The shares, rights or options must be beneficially owned by the employee at all times during the cur- rency of the loan. •A condition of the loan is that it must be repaid in full if the employee ceases to be the beneficial owner of any of the shares, rights or options. •The company issuing the shares, rights or options is not a qualifying company. •The employer and employee are not associated persons. •The company issuing the shares, rights or options maintains a dividend paying policy during the currency of the loan. •The ESP is not an employee share scheme under section DF 7. An exclusion for assistance with the tax affairs of the employee will be available only if the assistance relates to the preparation of the tax return and that expenditure would have been deductible to the employee. Application date The exclusion for ESP loan benefits will apply to the FBT return period which includes 2 September 1996, the date of enactment. The exclusion for tax assistance given to employees will apply from 2 September 1996. Non-cash benefits to shareholder employees and associated persons Sections CI 2A, GC 15 (3), Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction Amendments have been made to the fringe benefit regime as it was unclear whether certain non-cash benefits derived by employees who are also shareholders should be taxed as dividends or fringe benefits. The amendments remove this uncertainty. They also clarify the treatment of non-cash benefits received by a person associated with two or more other persons. They provide that when fringe benefit tax (FBT) would apply for one associated person, and the dividend rules would apply for another associated person, the FBT rules apply. Background The intention of the fringe benefit regime is to tax non- cash benefits which are derived through an employee’s employment for the employee’s private use. When the employer is a company and the employee is a share- holder, non-cash benefits may also be treated as divi- dends. The interaction between the fringe benefit and 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) dividend regimes is somewhat confusing as each regime is subject to the other. This causes difficulty determin- ing which regime certain benefits should be subject to, or whether they are subject to tax at all. Section CI 2A clarifies this situation by providing that company employers can elect whether these benefits are subject to the fringe benefit or deemed dividend rules. When a company does not so elect, the benefits will only be subject to FBT. Also, an intention of both the fringe benefit and divi- dend regimes is to tax non-cash benefits when received by associated persons. Conflicts arise when a person who receives a non-cash benefit from a company is associated with two or more other persons, one of whom is an employee and another is a shareholder but not an employee of that company. Under current legislation, again, it is not clear to which regime, if any, the non- cash benefit is subject. Section GC 15 (3) provides that non-cash benefits are deemed to be fringe benefits subject to FBT when received by a person associated with two or more other persons, and the benefits would be subject to FBT in the hands of one of those persons. Key features Shareholder employee Section CI 2A is inserted to provide that: •When non-cash benefits are granted to shareholders who are also employees, employers have an option to elect whether the benefits will be treated as fringe benefits or dividends. •When an employer does not make an election then the non-cash benefits are deemed to be fringe benefits. The election option is also available to the trustee of an investment trust when the employee is a shareholder of that trust. The election option is only applicable to non-cash benefits which come within the “any other benefit” provision in paragraph (h) of the definition of “fringe benefit” (such as discounted goods). The flowchart below illustrates the decision process of section CI 2A Associated persons Section GC 15 (3) deals with the situation when a person who receives a non-cash benefit is associated with two or more other persons: •if the benefit in the hands of one of those persons would be subject to FBT; and •the benefit in the hands of any other one of those persons would be subject to the deemed dividend rules; then the non-cash benefit is deemed to be derived by the person in the capacity as an employee, and is deemed to be a fringe benefit subject to FBT. Late election Section CI 2A (4) requires employers who wish make an election to notify the Commissioner of this election in writing within the time allowed for filing an FBT return following the end of the respective FBT period. Given that these provisions were not assented to until 2 September 1996 section CI 2A (5) was provided to allow quarterly FBT payers to make an election by 23 September 1996 in respect of the quarter ending 30 June 1996. Application dates The amendments will apply from 21 May 1996, the date of introduction of the legislation. Is employer a company or a trustee of a trust? Situation is outside scope of section CI 2A Is recipient an employee or associated with an employee? Is recipient a shareholder or associated with a shareholder? Is recipient also a shareholder in his/her own right? Is benefit a non-cash benefit subject to section CI 1 (h)? Is benefit a dividend under section CF 2? Has company elected under deemed dividend regime? Benefit is outside both regimes Benefit comes within deemed dividend regime Benefit comes within fringe benefit tax regime YES NO NO NO NO NO NO NO YES YES YES YES YES YES Non-cash benefits - determining tax treatment 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) Introduction Amendments expand the rules which allow superannua- tion funds (“member funds”) which invest in another superannuation fund (“master trust”) to elect that the master trust deduct the expenditure that the member funds have incurred. Member funds may carry forward expenditure for deduction by the master trust in a later income year if the latter cannot deduct the expenditure in a particular income year because it has insufficient balance of assessable income. Background The previous legislation allowed member funds to elect that the master trust deduct certain expenditure incurred by the member funds in the year the expenditure was incurred. However, the master trust had to have suffi- cient balance of assessable income to absorb that expenditure. Not provided for were situations where the master trust was in a tax loss or simply did not have sufficient balance of assessable income to enable all of the expenditure to be deducted. The amendments are intended to rectify that anomaly. Key features Amendments to section DI 3 of the 1994 Act and section 228 of the 1976 Act provide for member funds to carry forward undeducted expenditure to a later income year. They then provide for the member funds to elect for that undeducted expenditure to be deducted by the master fund in that later income year if the balance of the assessable income of the master fund extends to some or all of the expenditure. If not all that undeducted expenditure can be deducted in the later income year, a member fund will be able to carry forward the remain- ing undeducted expenditure until it is deducted. The member fund wishing to elect to have the master trust deduct the undeducted expenditure in later income years must have invested in the master trust in the year the expenditure was incurred and continue to invest in the master trust when the expenditure is deducted. Application date The amendment to the Income Tax Act 1994 is applica- ble from 1 April 1995. The equivalent amendment to the Income Tax Act 1976 is applicable from 1 April 1990. Expenditure incurred by superannuation funds Sections DI 3 (3)-(8) and 228 (2D)-(2I), Income Tax Act 1994 Depreciation of leasehold improvements Section EG 1A, Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The depreciation rules have been amended to address a deficiency that prevented a lessee claiming depreciation on land improvements erected by the lessee but owned by the lessor. The amendment provides that when a lessee of land incurs expenditure in erecting fixtures, or making improvements to the land, and they are owned by the lessor under land law principles, the lessee will be entitled to depreciate them. The amendment applies also to structures erected by holders of a licence to occupy land. The lessor (in the case of a lease) and grantor of the licence (in the case of a licence to occupy) will not be able to depreciate the structures. Background The new depreciation regime provides that a taxpayer must own an asset in order to depreciate it. If a lessee of land erects improvements on the land, and these are owned by the lessor, the lessee will be unable to depreci- ate the improvements. This amendment deems the lessee to own the improve- ments, enabling the lessee to depreciate them. At the expiry of the lease, the lessee will either demolish or remove the fixtures or improvements, or will abandon them with or without payment. For depreciation pur- poses, the lessee will cease to own the property upon expiry of the lease and, therefore, the depreciation recovered/loss on sale provisions will operate. Key features Section EG 1A of the Income Tax Act 1994 provides that: •When a lessee of land incurs expenditure in erecting a structure on the land, and this is owned by the lessor under land law principles, the lessee is deemed to own the structure. For the purposes of this amendment, “lessee” includes the holder of a licence to occupy land. •When a lessee of land who has depreciated a structure transfers its interest in the lease to a new lessee who “purchases” the structure, the new lessee is deemed to own the structure. •The lessor will be unable to depreciate the structure during the term of the lease. After the lease has expired, the lessor will be able to depreciate it only if, on the expiry of the lease, the lessor pays the lessee for it. “Lease” includes a licence to occupy and “lessor” includes the grantor of a licence to occupy. 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) continued on page 8 •On expiry of the lease, the lessee is deemed to have disposed of the fixture or improvement. Sections 108 and 117 of the Income Tax Act 1976 have also been amended to include these provisions. Application date The amendments apply from the 1993/94 income year. It is understood that lessees have in practice been claiming depreciation since that time, so the amend- ment will legitimise these deductions. In certain circumstances, a lessor may have been eligible to claim a depreciation deduction in relation to a structure erected by a lessee. The amendment will not affect depreciation deductions claimed by lessors for the 1993-94 and 1994-95 income years in tax returns filed by 21 May 1996 - the date of introduction of the bill. Depreciation of goods purchased subject to a reservation of title clause Section EG 1B, Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The depreciation legislation has been amended to correct a problem that arises if depreciable property is purchased subject to a reservation of title clause. The amendment will enable a purchaser who has possession of the property to depreciate it before title passes to the purchaser. Background The amendment applies to the purchase of depreciable goods under a contract which reserves title to the goods to the vendor until the purchase price is paid, but which provides for the purchaser to obtain possession of the goods before payment. The depreciation legislation provides that only a taxpayer who owns property may depreciate it. There- fore a purchaser cannot claim depreciation on property sold subject to a reservation of title clause until title to the property passes to the purchaser. The purchaser may nevertheless be using the property in its business and should be able to depreciate it. Key features •Section EG 1B of the Income Tax Act 1994 provides that a taxpayer who has purchased goods subject to a reservation of title clause is deemed to own the goods until title actually passes to the taxpayer or the goods are repossessed. •The vendor of the property will not be able to depreci- ate the property while the purchaser is deemed to own it. (It is, in any event, more likely that the property is trading stock to the vendor.) •An amendment to section EG 19 provides that if the vendor repossesses the goods, they will be deemed to have been disposed of by the purchaser for cost less the net amount paid to the vendor under the contract. The “net” amount paid to the vendor refers to amounts paid by the purchaser to the vendor less amounts refunded to the purchaser. Assume, for example, the purchase price of an asset is $10,000 and the purchaser has paid $5,000 towards the property. The vendor repossesses the asset and refunds $3,000 to the purchaser. The purchaser is deemed to dispose of the asset for $8,000. Sections 108 and 117 of the Income Tax Act 1976 have also been amended to incorporate these changes. The new section EG 1B does not apply to hire purchase assets as there are already specific provisions governing the depreciation of such assets. Application date The amendments apply from the 1993-94 income year - the date of introduction of the new depreciation legisla- tion. It is understood that, in practice, purchasers have depreciated assets prior to title passing. The amend- ments legitimise such deductions taken since 1993. Short-term trade credits and the accrual rules Sections EH 10, OB 1 and OZ 1, Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction For purposes of the accrual rules, taxpayers will be allowed to treat certain short-term trade credits as financial arrangements, provided notice in writing is given to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Notice must be given within the time required to furnish a tax return for the income year to which the election is to apply. The election, which is revocable in writing, may be made in respect of all short-term trade credits or any class of short-term trade credit which a taxpayer defines, either by reference to the term of the credit or the currency in which it is denominated, or a combina- tion of the two. 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) from page 7 The definition of short-term trade credit has also been amended to include certain short-term trade credits arising from invoices for periodic supplies. Background Previously, short-term trade credits were excepted financial arrangements for the purposes of the accrual rules. Other trade credits are financial arrangements, and any income or expenditure arising in relation to them must, therefore, be brought to tax on an accruals basis. If a taxpayer treats all trade credits in the same way for accounting purposes, there are compliance costs in- volved in reversing out short-term trade credits for tax purposes. To enable taxpayers to elect to treat short- term trade credits as financial arrangements is a compli- ance cost initiative which reflects a recommendation of the Valabh Committee on Operational Aspects of the Accruals Regime. The previous definition of short-term trade credit referred to payment being required within 63 days from the date of supply. However, certain utilities, such as electricity and telephone rental, are supplied on a continuous basis but invoiced periodically, with pay- ment required within a certain number of days from the date of invoice, rather than the date of supply. If payment is required within 63 days from the date of invoice, even if that is more than 63 days from the date of supply, these credits are now included in the defini- tion of short-term trade credits. Key features A new section, EH 10, has been added to the Income Tax Act 1994. Taxpayers can elect to treat certain short- term trade credits as financial arrangements for pur- poses of the accrual rules. This election can be revoked in writing during an income year, but the revocation will have effect only on short-term trade credits created from the start of the subsequent income year. Taxpayers can elect by class of short-term trade credit, by reference to either the term of credit, or the currency of the arrangement, or a combination of the two. The definition of short-term trade credit in section OB 1 has been amended to include any continuous supply of goods or services invoiced periodically, for which payment is due less than 63 days after the date of invoice. Application date These amendments apply from the date of enactment, 2 September 1996. Thin capitalisation: rules for determining New Zealand group Section FG 4 (10)-(14D), FG 10 (3), Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction A number of amendments have been made to address deficiencies in the originally enacted rules for determin- ing a taxpayer’s New Zealand group under the thin capitalisation rules. The amendments do not involve any significant policy change, and apply retrospectively to the beginning of the 1996-97 income year, the original application date for the thin capitalisation rules. Background The thin capitalisation regime applies where a non- resident uses excessive debt to fund its New Zealand- based operations. A company is said to be thinly capitalised if its New Zealand group debt percentage exceeds both 75%, and 110% of the group debt percent- age of its worldwide group. The New Zealand group debt percentage is calculated on a consolidated basis for the members of a taxpayer’s New Zealand group. Identifying the New Zealand group is a two-step process which requires: •the identification of a taxpayer’s New Zealand parent; and •an election by that parent to determine whether the members of the group are to be determined using 50% or 66% as the threshold for determining control (and thereby the members of the group) on a tier-by-tier basis. A number of deficiencies were identified in the original rules for determining a taxpayer’s New Zealand group. The amendments address these deficiencies, and improve the precision of the rules for identifying a taxpayer’s New Zealand parent, and the members of a taxpayer’s New Zealand group. Key features •To prevent the thin capitalisation regime being circumvented, the New Zealand group determined in relation to one taxpayer will be the New Zealand group for all members of that group. •The New Zealand group includes all companies for which control can be traced on a tier-by-tier basis from a given top tier company (the New Zealand parent) using, at the New Zealand parent’s option, a greater than 50% or 66% or greater control threshold. •If a non-resident controls two separate chains of New Zealand companies, the non-resident has the option to include both of those chains in a single New Zealand group. 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) continued on page 10 The definition of a New Zealand group is built around three fundamental concepts: •The group will contain those companies for which control can be traced on a tier-by-tier basis from the taxpayer’s New Zealand parent company. •At the election of the New Zealand parent company, the threshold for tier-by-tier control will be based on either greater than 50% control or an alternative 66% threshold. •The New Zealand group will be consistent for all companies in that group (if, in relation to any tax- payer, Co ‘A’ is in the same New Zealand group as Co ‘B’, the New Zealand group for Co ‘A’ will be the same New Zealand group that applies for Co ‘B’). It is this last requirement for consistency between members of the New Zealand group that has resulted in the detailed rules in section FG 4 (10) to determine the taxpayer’s New Zealand parent. The New Zealand parent is identified in relation to a number of taxpayers, and is required to make consistent grouping elections for all companies for which it is the New Zealand parent (section FG 4 (14B)). Outline of process for determining a taxpayer’s New Zealand group The rules for determining a taxpayer company’s New Zealand group are contained in section FG 4(12) to (14D). The process to be followed in determining the New Zealand group is broadly as follows: 1.Identify the taxpayer’s New Zealand parent (section FG 4(10)). 2.The New Zealand parent elects whether to use “greater than 50%” or “66% or greater” as the threshold for determining control on a tier-by-tier basis (section FG 4 (12) - (14)). The election applies consistently for all companies for which the New Zealand parent of the taxpayer is the New Zealand parent (section FG 4 (14B)). 3.The members of the taxpayer’s New Zealand parent’s New Zealand group (which may or may not include the taxpayer) are then identified (section FG 4 (12)-(14)). 4.If the taxpayer is not included in the New Zealand group of its New Zealand parent, the taxpayer’s New Zealand group will include all companies to which control can be traced on a tier-by-tier basis from either the taxpayer or any other company from which control of the taxpayer can be traced on a tier- by-tier basis (section FG 4 (14C)). 5.If the same non-resident person has a 50% or greater ownership interest in two or more New Zealand groups determined under the process outlined above, an election can be made to join some or all of those groups as a single New Zealand group (section FG 4 (14D)). Identifying the taxpayer’s New Zealand parent (section FG 4 (10)) The rules for identifying a taxpayer’s New Zealand parent are designed to identify the top-tier company in a chain of companies controlled by a non-resident person. The New Zealand parent can be the taxpayer, or some other New Zealand resident company from which ownership can be traced on a tier-by-tier basis. The main rules for identifying a taxpayer’s New Zea- land parent are contained in section FG 4 (10)(b). These rules aim to identify the top-tier New Zealand resident company in the chain of companies containing the taxpayer as the New Zealand parent. However, the taxpayer will be its own New Zealand parent if: •it is a non-resident; or •persons not resident in New Zealand hold aggregate direct ownership interests in the taxpayer of 50% or greater (section FG 4 (10)(a)). The taxpayer will also be its own New Zealand parent if the rules in section FG 4 (10)(b) fail to identify any New Zealand parent (section FG 4 (10)(c)). In the unlikely event that section FG 4 (10)(b) identifies more than one New Zealand parent, section FG 4 (10)(d) and (e) contain tie-breaker tests. In the first instance, the New Zealand parent will be the one for which the aggregate direct ownership interests held by non- residents in that company multiplied by the New Zealand parent’s ownership interest in the taxpayer (disregarding interests held only by virtue of the associ- ated persons rules in section FG 2(2)) produces the highest value (section FG 4 (10)(d)). As a last resort, the company incorporated first will be the New Zealand parent (section FG 4 (10)(e)). In the following diagram, Taxpayer Co is not the New Zealand parent under paragraph (a), as it is resident in New Zealand and non-resident persons do not have aggregate direct ownership interests of 50% or greater in the company. Who is Taxpayer Co’s New Zealand parent? Taxpayer Co NR Co NZ Co 2 NZ Co 1 NZ Co 3 100% 100% 100%100% Under paragraph (b)(i), the New Zealand parent could be any of NZ Co 1, NZ Co 2, or NZ Co 3, as all three companies are resident in New Zealand. 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) from page 9 Paragraph (b)(ii) identifies only NZ Co 1 as the New Zealand parent. NZ Co 2 and NZ Co 3 also have ownership interests in Taxpayer Co under section FG 2 (2), because the interests of associated persons (NZ Co 1) are ordinarily aggregated in calculating ownership interests. However, para- graph (b)(ii) states that interests held by associated persons are not aggregated when determining a taxpayer’s New Zealand parent. The conditions of paragraph (b)(iii),(iv) and (v) are also met for NZ Co 1, so NZ Co 1 will be the New Zealand parent of Taxpayer Co. In the following diagram, Taxpayer Co is not the New Zealand parent under paragraph (a), as it is resident in New Zealand and non-resident persons do not have aggregate direct ownership interests of 50% or greater in the company. Who is Taxpayer Co’s New Zealand parent? Taxpayer Co NR Co NZ Co 2 NZ Co 1 100% 100% 100% Under paragraph (b)(i), the New Zealand parent could be either NZ Co 1 or NZ Co 2, as both companies are resident in New Zealand. Paragraph (b)(ii) also does not identify a single New Zealand parent, as both NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2 hold an ownership interest in Taxpayer Co. However, paragraph (b)(iii) identifies only NZ Co 1 as the New Zealand parent, as no non-resident person holds a direct ownership interest in NZ Co 2. The conditions of paragraph (b)(iv) and (v) are also met for NZ Co 1, so NZ Co 1 will be the New Zealand parent of Taxpayer Co. In the following diagram, Taxpayer Co is not the New Zealand parent under paragraph (a), as it is resident in New Zealand and non-resident persons do not have aggregate direct ownership interests of 50% or greater in the company. Who is Taxpayer Co’s New Zealand parent? Taxpayer Co NR Co 1 NZ Co 2NZ Co 1 80% 100% 100% 20% NZ Co 3 NR Co 2 100% Under paragraph (b)(i), the New Zealand parent could be any of NZ Co 1, NZ Co 2, or NZ Co 3, as all three companies are resident in New Zealand. Paragraph (b)(ii) also does not identify a single New Zealand parent, as all three companies hold an ownership interest in Taxpayer Co. Paragraph (b)(iii) narrows the choice of companies as New Zealand parent to NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2, as they are the only companies in which a non-resident person holds a direct ownership interest. Paragraph (b)(iv) then applies to identify the New Zealand parent of Taxpayer Co as NZ Co 1, as there is no non-resident person who holds a 50% or greater ownership interest in both NZ Co 2 and Taxpayer Co. The condition of paragraph (b)(v) is also met for NZ Co 1, so NZ Co 1 will be the New Zealand parent of Taxpayer Co. In the following diagram, Taxpayer Co is not the New Zealand parent under paragraph (a), as it is resident in New Zealand and non-resident persons do not have aggregate direct ownership interests of 50% or greater in the company. Who is Taxpayer Co’s New Zealand parent? Taxpayer Co NR Co NZ Co 2 NZ Co 1 80% 100% 100% 20% Under paragraph (b)(i), the New Zealand parent could be either NZ Co 1 or NZ Co 2, as both companies are resident in New Zealand. Paragraph (b)(ii) also does not identify a single New Zealand parent, as both companies hold an ownership interest in Taxpayer Co. Both companies also meet the criteria in paragraph (b)(iii), as a non-resident person holds a direct ownership interest in each of them. Paragraph (b)(iv) also does not identify a single New Zealand parent, as NR Co holds a 50% or greater ownership interest in all three of NZ Co 1, NZ Co 2 and Taxpayer Co. Paragraph (b)(v) identifies NZ Co 1 as Taxpayer Co’s New Zealand parent, as NZ Co 1 satisfies all the conditions in paragraph (b)(i) to (iv) and holds a direct ownership interest in NZ Co 2. Election by New Zealand parent A New Zealand parent can elect to determine members of a New Zealand group using either a “greater than 50%” or a “66% or greater” control threshold. If an election is not made, the New Zealand parent is deemed to have elected to apply the 66% or greater threshold (section FG 4 (14A)). 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) The “greater than 50%” control threshold replaces the “GAAP group” approach in the originally enacted regime. The original GAAP test required a judgment to be exercised in some instances over whether one company was actually controlled by another company. By applying the explicit “greater than 50%” test in- stead, the need to apply judgment over whether a company can or should be included in a New Zealand group has been eliminated. This removes the possibility of a dispute arising between taxpayers and Inland Revenue over the appropriate exercise of judgment under GAAP. The New Zealand parent makes elections under the thin capitalisation rules for all companies for which it is identified to be the New Zealand parent under section FG 4 (10). Elections made by the New Zealand parent for the purposes of determining a taxpayer’s New Zealand group must be made consistently for all compa- nies for which it is the New Zealand parent (section FG 4 (14B)). Thus if the New Zealand parent elects to adopt the 66% or greater control test, that 66% thresh- old must be used for all companies for which the company is the New Zealand parent. The purpose of requiring consistent elections is to ensure the effect of the thin capitalisation rules cannot be circumvented by making inconsistent elections between companies in a New Zealand group. The effect is that members of a New Zealand group defined in relation to one taxpayer will also be the members of the New Zealand group defined in relation to any other member of that group. Application of greater than 50% control test in relation to New Zealand parent (section FG 4(13)) Using the greater than 50% threshold, a company will be included in the New Zealand parent’s New Zealand group if greater than 50% direct control can be traced on a tier-by-tier basis from the New Zealand parent to the company. Example 5 In the following diagram, which companies will be included in NZ Parent’s New Zealand group? NZ Co 3 NZ Parent NZ Co 2 NZ Co 1 20% 100% 100% 40% NZ Co 1 is included in NZ Parent’s New Zealand group because NZ Parent holds a “greater than 50%” direct ownership interest in NZ Co 1. NZ Co 2 is included in NZ Parent’s New Zealand group because “greater than 50%” direct ownership interests can be traced on a tier-by-tier basis from NZ Parent and NZ Co 1, both of which are included in NZ Parent’s New Zealand group. NZ Co 3 is also included in NZ Parent’s New Zealand group because a direct ownership interest of greater than 50% can be traced from NZ Co 2, which is a member of NZ Parent’s New Zealand group. Thus the New Zealand group of NZ Parent will include NZ Parent, NZ Co 1, NZ Co 2 and NZ Co 3. Application of 66% or greater control test in relation to New Zealand parent (section FG 4 (14)) Using the 66% or greater threshold, a company will be included in the New Zealand parent’s New Zealand group if 66% or greater direct control can be traced on a tier-by-tier basis from the New Zealand parent to the company. Example 6 In the following diagram, which companies will be included in the New Zealand group of NZ parent? Taxpayer Co NZ Parent NZ Co 1 20% 100% 40% NZ Co 1 will be included in the New Zealand group of NZ Parent, as NZ Parent holds a 66% or greater direct ownership interest in NZ Co 1. However, NZ Co 2 will not be included in the New Zealand group, as only a 60% direct ownership interest can be traced from companies included in NZ Parent’s New Zealand group (ie, NZ Parent and NZ Co 1). Tracing from non-resident when applying 66% or greater control test (section FG 4 (14)(b)) As well as tracing control from the New Zealand parent when applying the 66% or greater control test, reference may be made to direct interests held by a non-resident person if: •that non-resident person holds a 50% or greater ownership interest in both the taxpayer and the New Zealand parent; and •a company that would have been included in the New Zealand group of the New Zealand parent if the greater than 50% threshold was applied is not in- cluded when applying the 66% or greater threshold. continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) from page 11 Example 7 The following diagram is the same as example 6, except that NR Co holds a 100% ownership interest in both NZ Parent and Taxpayer Co. Which compa- nies will now be included in the New Zealand group of NZ Parent? Taxpayer Co NR Co NZ Co 1 NZ Parent 20% 100% 100% 40% 40% Because Taxpayer Co would be included in the New Zealand group of NZ Parent if the greater than 50% threshold was applied, and NR Co holds a 50% or greater ownership interest in both NZ Parent and Taxpayer Co (“the taxpayer”), direct ownership interests held by NR Co are also considered in determining the New Zealand group under the 66% or greater threshold. Taxpayer Co would therefore be included in the New Zealand group of NZ Parent, as 66% or greater direct ownership interests in Taxpayer Co are held in aggregate by NZ Parent, NZ Co 1 and NR Co. Taxpayer not included in NZ group of New Zealand parent (section FG 4 (14C)) It is possible that the taxpayer will not be a member of the New Zealand group of its New Zealand parent. In this case, section FG 4 (14C) applies to determine the taxpayer’s New Zealand group. The effect of the rule in section FG 4(14C) is to: •exclude any member of the New Zealand group of the New Zealand parent from the taxpayer’s New Zealand group; and •trace to higher-tier and lower-tier companies for which the greater than 50% or 66% or greater control test is met on a tier-by-tier basis. Consider, for example, two arbitrary companies - Company A and Company B. For them to be included in a New Zealand group under section FG 4 (14C), there must be some company (company A, company B, or some third company) from which control can be traced on a tier-by-tier basis (applying the appropriate threshold) to include both company A and company B in the same group. (If such a company exists, that company will also be included in the New Zealand group with company A and company B.) It is important to note that section FG 4 (14C) does not redefine the New Zealand parent of the taxpayer. This means that the election made by the New Zealand parent for which of the control thresholds applies continues to apply to the determination of a taxpayer’s New Zealand group under section FG 4 (14C). Example 8 In the following diagram, NZ Parent has elected to apply the 66% or greater control threshold. Which companies will be members of Taxpayer Co’s New Zealand group? NZ Co 2 NZ Parent Taxpayer Co NZ Co 1 60% 100% 100% Using the 66% or greater threshold, Taxpayer Co will not be included in the New Zealand group of NZ Parent. Section FG 4 (14C) therefore applies to trace 66% or greater direct interests up and down the chain from Taxpayer Co. NZ Co 1 is not included in the New Zealand group of Taxpayer Co because there is no company from which 66% or greater control can be traced on a tier by tier basis to include both NZ Co 1 and Taxpayer Co in the same group. However, NZ Co 2 will be included in the New Zealand group of Taxpayer Co. This is because a company exists (in this case, Taxpayer Co) from which 66% or greater control can be traced on a tier-by-tier basis to include both Taxpayer Co and NZ Co 2 in the same group. Example 9 In the following diagram, NZ Parent has elected to apply the 66% or greater control threshold. Which companies will be members of Taxpayer Co’s New Zealand group? NZ Co 1 NZ Co 2Taxpayer Co 80% 100% NZ Parent 60% Using the 66% or greater threshold, Taxpayer Co will not be included in the New Zealand group of NZ Parent. Section FG 4(14C) therefore applies to trace 66% or greater direct interests up and down the chain from Taxpayer Co. Taxpayer Co, NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2 will be in- cluded in the New Zealand group of Taxpayer Co. This is because a company exists (NZ Co 1) from which control can be traced on a tier-by-tier basis to include all three companies in the same group. 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) Elections to group multiple chains of companies (section FG 4 (14D)) If the same non-resident person holds a 50% or greater ownership interest in companies of more than one New Zealand group determined under the preceding rules, an election can be made to include any or all of those groups in a single New Zealand group. One effect of this is to allow groups to be traced down a chain through a 50% ownership link. For such an election to be made, it is necessary for the New Zealand parents of all of the groups looking to become a single New Zealand group to each make the same election to group. This ensures that consistency is maintained, and therefore that all members of the larger group have the same New Zealand group as each other. Example 10 In the following diagram, can NZ Co 2 be included in the New Zealand group of NZ Parent and NZ Co 1? NZ Co 2 NZ Co 1 NR Co NZ Parent 100% 100% 50% NZ Co 1 and NZ Parent will be included in the same New Zealand group regardless of whether the greater than 50% or the 66% or greater test is applied. Prima facie, NZ Co 2 will not be in the same New Zealand group as NZ Co 1 and NZ Parent since neither the greater than 50% nor the 66% or greater control threshold is met. However, because the same non-resident person (NR Co) holds a 50% or greater ownership interest in NZ Co 2 and each of the members of NZ Parent’s New Zealand group (NZ Parent and NZ Co 1), NZ Parent can elect to include NZ Co 2 in its New Zealand group. Example 11 In the following diagram, which companies can become members of the same New Zealand group under section FG 4 (14D)? NZ Co 2NZ Co 1 NR Co NZ Parent 100%100%100% Each of NZ Co 1, NZ Co 2 and Taxpayer Co will be its own New Zealand parent. Under the rules in section FG 4 (12)-(14C), the New Zealand group for each of the companies will include only itself. Thus before the application of section FG 4 (14D), NZ Co 1, NZ Co 2 and Taxpayer Co will form three separate New Zealand groups. Section FG 4 (14D) allows a New Zealand parent to elect to include other companies in a taxpayer’s New Zealand group if the same non-resident person holds a 50% or greater ownership interest in both those other companies and the taxpayer. Applied in relation to Taxpayer Co, Taxpayer Co (as its New Zealand parent) could elect that either or both of NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2 also be included in its New Zealand group. However, such an election would only be effective if reciprocal elections were made by NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2. Thus if Taxpayer Co elected to include NZ Co 1 in its New Zealand group, NZ Co 1 would have to elect to include Taxpayer Co in its New Zealand group. Similarly, if Taxpayer Co elected to include NZ Co 2 in its New Zealand group, NZ Co 2 would have to elect to include Taxpayer Co in its New Zealand group. If Taxpayer Co elected to include both NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2 in its New Zealand group, NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2 would have to elect to include each other in their respec- tive New Zealand groups, as well making the reciprocal elections in relation to Taxpayer Co referred to above. Special rule where 66% threshold applied (section FG 4 (14D)(d)) Where the New Zealand parent elects to apply the 66% or greater control threshold, a special rule applies to ensure the New Zealand parent cannot ‘pick and choose’ the members of its New Zealand group. The rule states that the New Zealand parent cannot elect to include a company in a New Zealand group under section FG 4 (14D) if: •another company has a direct ownership interest in the company to be included in the New Zealand group under section FG 4 (14D); and •that other company is not included in the New Zealand group after the application of section FG 4 (14D), but would have been included if the greater than 50% threshold had applied instead. This rule is intended to ensure that two companies in a chain of companies cannot be included in the same New Zealand group by virtue of the election available under section FG 4 (14D) if some company interposed in the chain between the two is not also included in that New Zealand group. Example 12 In the following diagram, New Zealand Parent has elected to apply the 66% threshold for determining members of its New Zealand group. Can it take advantage of section FG 4(14D) to include NZ Co 2 in its New Zealand group? continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) from page 13 NZ Co 2 NZ Co 1 NR Co NZ Parent 60% 60% 50% The same non-resident person (NR Co) holds a 50% or greater ownership interest in both NZ Parent and NZ Co 2, thereby meeting the conditions of section FG 4 (14D)(b) for an election to be made. If such an election was made, the New Zealand group of NZ Parent would include NZ Parent and NZ Co 2. However, there is a company interposed between NZ Parent and NZ Co 2 which has a direct owner- ship interest in NZ Co 2. If the greater than 50% threshold applied, NZ Co 1 would be included in NZ Parent’s New Zealand group. The direct ownership interest held by NZ Co 1 in NZ Co 2 would therefore preclude NZ Parent electing to include NZ Co 2 in its New Zealand group under section FG 4 (14D). If NZ Parent were to elect to apply the 50% control threshold instead, NZ Co 1 would be included in its New Zealand group under the normal application of section FG 4 (13). Section FG 4 (14D) could then be applied to also include NZ Co 2 in NZ Parent’s New Zealand group. The members of NZ Parent’s New Zealand group would then be NZ Parent, NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2. Example 13 In the following diagram, New Zealand parent has elected to apply the 66% threshold for determining members of its New Zealand group. Can it take advantage of section FG 4 (14D) to include NZ Co 2 in its New Zealand group? NR Co NZ Parent NZ Co 2 NZ Co 1 50% 10% 60% 10% The main difference between this example and the previous one is that NZ Co 1 would still not be included in the New Zealand group of NZ Parent, even if the greater than 50% threshold was applied instead of the 66% or greater threshold. The rule in section FG 4 (14D)(d), therefore, does not apply to preclude NZ Parent electing to include NZ Co 2 in its New Zealand group. Miscellaneous amendments A cross-referencing error in section FG 4(17) has been corrected. Section FG 4(18) has been repealed, as it replicated the effect of section FG 4(16)(b). A minor consequential amendment has also been made to section FG 10(3). Application date The amendments apply from the start of the 1996/97 income year. Transfer pricing Section GD 13 (4), (12), Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The transfer pricing rules have been amended to ensure that, if an arm’s length amount is substituted under section GD 13(4): •the liability of a New Zealand company to deduct non- resident withholding tax (NRWT) from a non-cash dividend paid to its non-resident parent is not af- fected; and •the liability of a New Zealand company to make a dividend withholding payment (DWP) deduction in respect of fixed rate shares held in a foreign subsidi- ary is confirmed. Background Previously, if the arm’s length amount was substituted for the actual amount of consideration under section GD 13 (4), the obligation of the taxpayer to make a withholding or a deduction was also based on that arm’s length amount. This was intended to ensure that DWP would be deducted if an arm’s length dividend is substituted in respect of fixed rate shares held by the New Zealand company in a foreign subsidiary. However, section GD 13 (4), as originally enacted, created an anomalous result if a non-cash dividend arose from a supply made by a New Zealand subsidiary company to its foreign parent for a less than arm’s length amount. This was because the substitution of the arm’s length amount applied for the purposes of the subsidiary’s obligation to deduct NRWT. The obligation of the subsidiary to deduct NRWT from that dividend was, therefore, removed, even though the dividend was still derived by the parent under section CF 2 (1)(c). It was not intended that section GD 13 (4) would have this effect. A further difficulty was that, while section GD 13 (4) required DWP to be deducted by the taxpayer based on a substituted arm’s length amount, section GD 13 (12), as previously drafted, stated that the substitution of an 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) arm’s length amount had no effect on the obligation of the taxpayer to make such a deduction. It was not intended that section GD 13 (12) apply to the obligation of the taxpayer to deduct DWP. Section GD 13 (4) and (12) have, therefore, been amended to reflect that the obligation of the taxpayer to make a withholding or a deduction based on the arm’s length amount substituted under section GD 13 (4) applies only for DWP purposes. Any liability of the taxpayer to deduct NRWT will continue to be based on the actual consideration, rather than the amount substi- tuted under section GD 13 (4). Key features The liability of a New Zealand company to deduct NRWT from a non-cash dividend paid to its non- resident parent is preserved if an arm’s length amount is substituted under section GD 13 (4) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The liability of a New Zealand company to make a DWP deduction if an arm’s length dividend is substi- tuted in respect of fixed rate shares held by the New Zealand company in a foreign subsidiary is confirmed. Application date The amendments apply from the start of the 1996-97 income year, to coincide with the application date of the new transfer pricing regime. New Zealand superannuation surcharge specified exemption Section JB 4 (1), Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction An amendment ensures that recipients of the previously frozen rate of New Zealand superannuation who now receive the married person rate because their spouse does not qualify for superannuation may continue to claim the single surcharge exemption level. The single surcharge exemption level will be frozen at $4,160 for the 1996-97 income year. This change ensures that superannuitants who received the frozen rate of New Zealand superannuation are not disadvantaged as a result of the expiry of the frozen rate and its removal from the First Schedule of the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990. Another amendment corrects a legislative oversight which occurred in 1991, whereby recipients of the previously frozen rate of New Zealand superannuation were not entitled to claim the single surcharge exemp- tion level. This was not the intended policy. These changes will not affect returns already filed by superannuitants. Background In 1988 the policy changed in relation to the eligibility criteria for New Zealand superannuation, whereby married superannuitants could claim only the married person rate. Married superannuitants who had previ- ously claimed the single rate because their spouse did not qualify for New Zealand superannuation had their entitlement frozen at the single rate of $183.93 a week. The idea was that recipients of the frozen rate would move to the married person rate when the latter ex- ceeded the former. By April 1996 the married person rate ($184.33 a week) exceeded the frozen rate ($183.93 a week) The Tax Reduction and Social Policy Bill (recently enacted in five separate Acts) removed the frozen rate from the First Schedule of the Social Welfare (Transi- tional Provisions) Act 1990 because the rate became redundant from 1 April 1996. Superannuitants who previously received the frozen rate now receive the higher married person rate of New Zealand superannua- tion. Moving recipients of the frozen rate to the married person rate of new Zealand superannuation implies that they will also move from the single person surcharge exemption level to the married person surcharge exemption level. This can, in some circumstances, restrict an individual recipient to a lower surcharge exemption than he or she was able to claim while in receipt of the frozen rate. The standard married couple joint surcharge exemption level ($6,240 as at 1 April 1996) is higher than the single person exemption ($4,160 as at 1 April 1996) and advantages a superannuitant who has a spouse with little or no income. However, if the younger spouse has significant income, that income is offset against the couple’s joint exemption until the older superannui- tant’s exemption is reduced to a minimum. The mini- mum married person exemption ( $3,120 as at 1 April 1996) was lower than the minimum exemption of $4,160 that was granted to recipients of the frozen rate. This amendment ensures that superannuitants previ- ously receiving the frozen rate may continue to claim the single surcharge exemption level as a minimum. However, that amount will be frozen at $4,160 for the 1996-97 income year. With the enactment of the Taxation (Superannuitant Surcharge Reduction) Act 1996 the surcharge specified exemption levels have been substantially increased with effect from 1 April 1997. This results in the minimum married person surcharge exemption level exceeding the frozen sur- charge exemption level. From 1 April 1997, all married superannuitants will receive the minimum married surcharge exemption level. continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) from page 15 Key features Section JB 4 (1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is amended to ensure that recipients of the previously frozen rate who have now transferred to the married person rate can still claim the single surcharge exemp- tion level. This ensures that recipients of the frozen rate are not subject to an increased surcharge liability as a result of their moving to the married person rate. The surcharge exemption level for these recipients will be frozen at $4,160 ($80 per week) for the 1996-97 income year. The surcharge exemption level for the 1997-98 income year and subsequent income years will transfer from the frozen exemption level to the mini- mum married person exemption level as this exemption level will exceed the frozen exemption level. Section 336E (1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 1976 and section JB 4 (1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 are amended to correct a legislative oversight dating back to 1991, when the surcharge legislation was re-introduced, whereby the previous provisions relating to the single surcharge exemption level for recipients of the frozen rate were omitted. The Inland Revenue Department has previously allowed recipients of the frozen rate to claim the single sur- charge exemption level in accordance with the policy intent of the legislation, although it lacked the necessary legislative authority. Therefore recipients of the frozen rate have not been disadvantaged. •Frozen rate of New Zealand superannuation - Applies to superannuitants whose spouse did not qualify for New Zealand superannuation before 10 October 1988, and still does not qualify. The rate of superannuation was frozen at $183.93 a week until such time as the married person rate exceeded this rate. •Married person rate of New Zealand superannua- tion - This is the rate which applies to individual married superannuitants when they both qualify in their own right. The rate was $184.33 a week (before tax) as at 1 April 1996. •Minimum married person surcharge exemption level - As at 1 April 1996 the married couple joint exemption level was $6,240 a year. Each spouse receives a minimum exemption level of $3,120 a year. However, if one spouse does not use up her or his exemption level the excess can be transferred to the other spouse. This means that a spouse can have a minimum exemption level of $3,120 or a higher amount up to a maximum of $6,240 depending on whether the other spouse earns additional income (other than New Zealand superannuation). •Single person surcharge exemption level - The exemption level which applies to recipients of the single rate of New Zealand superannuation. This is the level below which no surcharge is payable by these recipients. As at 1 April 1996 the exemption level was $4,160 a year. Application date The amendment to freeze the surcharge exemption level applies from the beginning of the 1996/97 income year. However, in effect the frozen surcharge exemption level will apply only to the 1996/97 income year. The amendment to correct the legislative oversight will apply retrospectively from 1 April 1991. Low income rebate and the veteran’s pension Section KC 1, Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The low income rebate has been amended to enable recipients of a veteran’s pension to claim the low income rebate on income from interest, dividends, royalties, rents and a trust. This will put them on a par with recipients of New Zealand superannuation with respect to the low income rebate. Background Veterans who qualify for a veteran’s pension can choose between receiving the veteran’s pension or New Zealand superannuation. The rates paid for both benefits are the same. Recipients of a veteran’s pension are exempt from the New Zealand superannuitant surcharge. Previously, recipients of a veteran’s pension were unable to claim the low income rebate on their passive income. This disadvantaged them relative to recipients of New Zealand superannuation, who are able to claim the rebate on their passive income. The low income rebate for the 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99 income years has been amended. The amend- ments were necessary to reflect the changes to the rebate resulting from the Government’s tax reduction package contained in the Income Tax Act 1994 Amendment Act 1996. Key Features This amendment to section KC 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 will enable recipients of a veteran’s pension to claim the low income rebate on their income from interest, dividends, royalties, rents and a trust, as well as their pension income. Application date The amendment will apply from the income year beginning 1 April 1996. 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) continued on page 18 Non-refundable tax Sections MD 2 (5), MD 3 (4), NH 4 (2), and NH 5 (5), Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The imputation and dividend withholding payment (DWP) rules have been amended to remove an anomaly that prevents the Commissioner of Inland Revenue from applying non-refundable overpaid tax towards tax liabilities for previous income years. An identical amendment has also been made to the policyholder credit account regime (PCA) for persons who are life insurers. Background Under the imputation and DWP rules, the Commis- sioner may refund overpaid tax only to the extent of the credit balance in a company’s memorandum account. The PCA regime contains similar rules for persons who are life insurers that operate memorandum accounts. At present, the Commissioner is required to credit any non- refundable overpayment towards tax liabilities that arise in the year of the refund entitlement, or subsequent income years. This creates potential difficulties when the Commis- sioner reassesses a taxpayer for an earlier income year and is not able to set off any non-refundable overpaid tax against any reassessed liability. The taxpayer is required to make an additional payment to satisfy the reassessed liability. Key features The imputation, PCA, and DWP rules have been amended to allow non-refundable overpaid income tax or dividend withholding payments to be credited towards liabilities that arise for both earlier income years and future income years. Each of the regimes that have been amended has different commencement dates. For this reason, the liabilities against which non-refundable overpaid tax may be applied are as follows: •in the case of the imputation and the DWP rules, against reassessments for income years after 1 April 1988; Section LE 3 holding companies Section LE 3 (6), (10), Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction An amendment corrects an error in the credit ordering rules for calculating the minimum income tax liability of a section LE 3 holding company. Background Section LE 3 (10) establishes that a section LE 3 holding company will have a minimum income tax liability for an income year at least equal to the amount of supplementary dividends it receives. The minimum income tax liability for section LE 3 holding companies was established as a revenue-protection measure to eliminate the potential for income tax deferral if a supplementary dividend is derived by a section LE 3 holding company with tax losses. It was intended that the minimum income tax liability be determined before allowing for any refundable credits (such as resident withholding tax and foreign investor tax credits), but after allowing for non-refundable credits (such as foreign tax credits and imputation). However, the original drafting of section LE 3 (10) incorrectly reversed the ordering of the credits. The amendment has now rectified this problem. Following the amendment, section LE 3(10) works in practice as follows: Step 1:A section LE 3 holding company will calculate its actual tax liability after claiming imputation and foreign tax credits to which it is entitled. Step 2:If this liability is less than the amount of supplementary dividends received by the company for the year, section LE 3 (10) oper- ates to establish the company’s tax liability to be the amount of those supplementary divi- dends. Step 3:The liability determined in step 2 is reduced by the amount of any refundable credits (eg, resident withholding tax, dividend withholding payment credits, foreign investor tax credits arising from dividends paid by the company). A typographical error in section LE 3 (6) has also been corrected. Key features A section LE 3 holding company’s minimum income tax liability is established after allowing for non- refundable credits, but before allowing for refundable credits. Application date The amendment applies to dividends paid on or after 12 December 1995. 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) from page 17 •in the case of consolidated group companies which operate under the DWP rules, against reassessments for income years beginning from the 1993-94 income year; and •in the case of the PCA rules, against reassessments for income years after 1 April 1990. Application date The amendments come into force on 1 April 1997 and apply from that date to any non-refundable overpayments of income tax or dividend withholding payments made before that date, and not already credited by the Commissioner against other tax liabili- ties. They will also apply to overpayments made after that date. Example Assume a company with a nil imputation credit account (ICA) balance paid a fully imputed divi- dend on 28 February 1996. This placed the compa- ny’s ICA in debit balance. Before 31 March 1996, the company made a voluntary tax payment to clear the debit balance. Shortly after 31 March 1996, the company entered into a tax loss situation and was not eligible for a refund of that voluntary payment because it did not have a credit balance in its ICA. In June 1997, the company is reassessed for the 1995 income year and has to pay additional income tax for that year. The Commissioner will apply the voluntary tax payment made in 1996 towards the tax liability for the 1995 income year. Imputation effect of FITC-related refunds Section ME 5 (1)(e), Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction An amendment ensures that a double debit will not arise to a company’s imputation credit account (ICA) if a breach of shareholder continuity occurs between the payment of a dividend and the receipt of the related refund of the foreign investor tax credit (FITC). Background When the new FITC regime was enacted in December 1995, section ME 5 (1)(e) was amended to ensure that a refund of tax resulting from a foreign investor tax credit (FITC) will always give rise to a debit in the company’s imputation credit account, notwithstanding that a debit may already have arisen by virtue of a breach in share- holder continuity. This amendment was necessary to ensure that if a company used the FITC mechanism to obtain a refund of tax paid before the continuity breach, it would not place the company in a better position than it would have been in had it attached normal imputation credits to the dividend, instead of paying a supplemen- tary dividend. However, the amendment did not give the correct result if the shareholder continuity breach occurred between the payment of the dividend and the receipt of the FITC-related refund. This is because the FITC-related refund is correctly attributable to tax paid before the continuity breach. The amendment ensures that in such circumstances, a further debit to the ICA will not arise. Key feature A double debit to a company’s imputation credit account will not occur if a breach of shareholder continuity occurs between the payment of a dividend and the receipt of the FITC-related refund. Application date The amendment applies from 12 December 1995 (the same application date as the previous amendment to section ME 5 (1)(e)). Correction of cross-reference error Section MG 15 (1)(d), Income Tax Act 1994 An amendment updates a cross-reference in section MG 15 (1)(d). Section MG 15 (1)(d) of the Income Tax Act contained a cross-reference to paragraph (h) of that subsection. The reference to paragraph (h) was a technical error, and should have been a reference to paragraph (i), which contains a link to the shareholder continuity rules for consolidated groups. The amendment applies from the date of enactment, 2 September 1996. 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) continued on page 20 NRWT on non-cash dividends Section NG 2 (2), NG 9 (1), Income Tax Act 1994 NRWT rate on DWP-credited dividends Section NG 2 (1)(a), (4), Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The rate of non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on dividend withholding payment (DWP) credited divi- dends has been reduced from 30% to 15%. The amend- ment has been made to reduce compliance and adminis- tration costs. Background The international tax reforms enacted in December 1995 removed the boundary between investors resident in treaty and non-treaty countries on fully imputed dividends for NRWT purposes. This amendment now also removes the boundary for DWP-credited dividends, to reduce compliance and administration costs. The lower 15% rate of NRWT applies to a dividend to the extent it is fully DWP-credited. The amount of the dividend fully DWP-credited is equal to the amount of DWP credit attached to the dividend divided by the company tax rate (section NG 2(4)). The amendment contemplates that the lower 15% rate of NRWT can apply to partially DWP-credited dividends to the extent they are fully credited. Example A company pays a cash dividend of $67.00, and attaches DWP credits of $20.00. How is the amount of NRWT on the dividend calculated? Cash dividend$67.00 DWP credit$20.00 Amount of dividend liable for NRWT$87.00 Fully DWP-credited portion ($20.00 + 0.33)$60.61 NRWT @ 15% (section NG 2(1)(c))$ 9.09 Uncredited portion of dividend ($87.00 - $60.61)$26.39 NRWT @ 30% (section NG 2(1)(a))$ 7.92 NRWT liability$17.01 (Note: If New Zealand has a double taxation agreement with the country of residence of the recipient of the dividend, the NRWT rate on the uncredited portion of the dividend will generally be reduced to 15% (section BB 11).) Key feature The NRWT rate on dividends has been reduced from 30% to 15% to the extent full DWP credits are attached. Application date The amendment applies to dividends paid on or after 2 September 1996. Introduction The amendments ensure that: •no deduction of NRWT is required under section NG 9 from non-cash dividends to the extent they are fully imputed; and •to the extent the non-cash dividends carry sufficient dividend withholding payment credits, NRWT need not be accounted for. Background The international tax reforms enacted in December 1995 introduced a new section NG 2 (1)(b)(ii), which provided that fully imputed non-cash dividends derived by non-resident investors on or after 12 December 1995 are subject to a zero percent NRWT rate. However, there was a conflict between this provision and section NG 9(1), which required NRWT on those same divi- dends to be deducted at a 30% rate (reduced to 15% in most cases if the investor is resident in a treaty country). The Commissioner of Inland Revenue made a determi- nation under section NG 10 that all persons were relieved from the obligation to comply with section NG 9 (1) in respect of non-cash dividends which were fully imputed and accordingly subject to a zero percent NRWT rate under section NG 2(1)(b)(ii). This amend- ment achieves this effect legislatively in section NG 9. When the imputation and dividend withholding pay- ment regimes were enacted in 1988, it was not possible to attach imputation or dividend withholding payment credits to a non-cash dividend. This ceased to be the case from 1 April 1992 following an amendment to the definition of “dividend” in former section 394A of the Income Tax Act 1976. However, when the amendment was made to section 394A, a consequential amendment was not made to the then section 313 (now section NG 9) to reflect the ability of companies to pay credited non-cash dividends. Section NG 9 (1) has now been redrafted to ensure the correct treatment of credited non-cash dividends. 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) from page 19 Section NG 9 (1) contains two formulae for determining the NRWT on a non-cash dividend. Which of the formulae apply depends on whether the non-cash dividend is a taxable bonus issue or not. The section expressly does not apply to the extent the non-cash dividend is fully imputed (meaning a zero percent rate of NRWT will apply to that portion of the dividend). If the non-cash dividend is not a taxable bonus issue, the NRWT liability is calculated using the formula in section NG 9 (1)(a): \[a/(1 - a) x b\] + (c x d) where- ais the NRWT rate in section NG 2(1)(a), being 30% (reducible under an applicable double taxation agreement); bis the amount of the dividend to the extent it is neither fully imputed nor fully DWP credited; cis the NRWT rate in section NG 2(1)(c), being 15%; dis the extent to which the dividend is fully DWP credited. If the dividend is a taxable bonus issue, the NRWT liability is calculated using the formula in section NG 9(1)(b): (a x e) + (c x f) where- ais the NRWT rate in section NG 2(1)(a), being 30% (reducible under an applicable double taxation agreement); eis the amount of the dividend to the extent it is neither fully imputed nor fully DWP credited; cis the NRWT rate in section NG 2(1)(c), being 15%; fis the extent to which the dividend is fully DWP credited. Essentially, the two formulae achieve the following effect: •A 15% rate applies to the extent full DWP credits are attached. •To the extent that neither DWP nor imputation credits are attached, a 30% rate of NRWT applies (which may be reduced to generally 15% under an applicable double taxation agreement). This portion of the dividend is also required to be grossed up by the amount of NRWT imposed on that portion of the dividend if the dividend is not a taxable bonus issue. A further modification has been made to ensure that where DWP credits are attached to a non-cash dividend, those credits can be taken into account by the payer of the dividend in determining the amount of NRWT to be deducted. Before the amendment, section NG 9 (2) required the payer to deduct an amount of NRWT from a non-cash dividend calculated under section NG 9 (1). However, the liability calculated under section NG 9 (1) was determined without reference to the amount of DWP credits attached to the dividend, and which would have reduced the liability to deduct under section NG 2 (2) if the dividend were a cash dividend instead. An amendment has been made to section NG 2 (2) so that the amount of DWP credits attached to a dividend are taken into consideration in determining both the liability of the recipient of the dividend to pay NRWT and the obligation of the payer to deduct NRWT from the dividend. By making section NG 2 (2) apply for all of the NRWT rules, rather than merely for section NG 2 (1) as previously, the offsetting of DWP credits now flows through to the obligation to deduct NRWT from a DWP-credited non-cash dividend under section NG 9. Example A company pays a non-cash dividend (not a taxable bonus issue) of $134.00 to an investor resident in a country with which New Zealand has a double taxation agreement which prescribes a maximum NRWT rate on dividends of 15%. The dividend has imputation credits of $16.50 and DWP credits of $33.00 attached. What is the NRWT liability on the dividend? The extent to which the dividend is fully imputed is calculated using the formula in section NG 2(3): $16.50 x (1 - 0.33)/0.33 = $ 33.50 The extent to which the dividend is fully DWP- credited is calculated using the formula in section NG 2(4): $33.00/0.33 = $100.00 The extent to which the dividend is neither fully imputed nor fully DWP-credited is therefore: $134.00 + $33.00 - $33.50 - $100.00 = $33.50 (The DWP credit is included in the amount of dividend liable for NRWT but not the imputation credit (definition of “dividend” for NRWT rules in section OB 1).) The NRWT liability is determined under the formula in section NG 9(1)(a) as follows: \[a/(1-a) x b\] + (c x d) =\[0.15/0.85 x $33.50\] + 0.15 x 100.00 =$20.91 Section NG 2 (2) then reduces the liability to pay and the obligation to deduct NRWT from the dividend by the amount of the DWP credits at- tached. As the DWP credits of $33.00 exceed the NRWT liability on the dividend, there is no obliga- tion on the payer to deduct NRWT from the divi- dend. The recipient of the dividend can seek a refund of the excess DWP credits of $12.09 from Inland Revenue under section LD 9. 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) Key features Section NG 9 (1) does not apply to non-cash dividends to the extent they are fully imputed. Section NG 2 (2) provides that to the extent the non- cash dividends carry sufficient dividend withholding payment credits, NRWT need not be accounted for. Section NG 9 (1) has been specifically amended to provide that items in the formulae only deal with the portion of the dividend which is not fully imputed. Application date The amendment applies retrospectively to dividends paid on or after 12 December 1995, the date from which the zero percent NRWT rate for fully imputed non-cash dividends applies. FDWP and formerly non-resident companies Section NH 1 (2)(b), Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The amendment clarifies that if a non-resident company becomes resident in New Zealand, the foreign dividend withholding payment (FDWP) rules will apply to subsequent dividends paid by that company to the extent that it has retained earnings on becoming New Zealand resident. Background Section NH 1 (2)(b) (formerly section 394ZL(2)(b)) was enacted to ensure that the FDWP regime could not be avoided if a foreign company became a New Zealand resident before paying a dividend to its New Zealand resident shareholders. A literal interpretation of the previous provision sug- gested that the FDWP regime would not apply if a formerly foreign company pays a dividend that exceeded the amount of its retained earnings at the time of becoming resident. This was not the policy intention, which is that dividends should be subject to FDWP to the extent of a company’s pre-resident retained earn- ings. The section has, therefore, been amended to reflect correctly its policy intention. Key features If a non-resident company becomes resident in New Zealand, the FDWP regime will apply to subsequent dividends paid by that company to the extent of its retained earnings at the time of becoming resident in New Zealand. Application date The amendment applies from 21 May 1996. Removal of redundant administrative positions Section OB 1, Income Tax Act 1994 Sections 2(1) and 30, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Sections 6, 81 (1)(b), 110, 118, 228 and 229 (4) - (6), Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction A series of amendments has been made to the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to remove redundant references to the positions of “Dis- trict Commissioner”, Deputy Commissioner” and “Regional Controller” , and to update a section refer- ence to take account of the April 1995 legislative changes. Background The Inland Revenue Acts previously contained refer- ences to the positions of “District Commissioner”, Deputy Commissioner” and “Regional Controller”. These references were generally repealed with effect from 1 April 1995. Since then, however, further refer- ences have been located and have now been removed. Following the April 1995 legislative changes, section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which established the office of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, was repealed and in its place three new provisions were enacted. A new section 6A now establishes the office of the Commissioner. As a consequence, section 228(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which deems the Commissioner to be appointed under the old section 6, has been updated to refer to section 6A. Key features •All redundant references have been removed and, where appropriate, replaced with a reference to an “ ... officer of the Department”. •A further minor amendment ensures a correct refer- ence to the Commissioner’s appointment. •A new definition of “Officer of the Department” has been inserted into the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 1995, the date of the changes to the affected administrative positions. 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) Portable New Zealand superannuation and the veteran’s pension Section OB 1, Income Tax Act 1994 Section 2, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction The tax exemption for portable New Zealand superan- nuation and the veteran’s pension has been extended to those paid under bilateral social security agreements made under section 19 of the Social Welfare (Transi- tional Provisions) Act 1990. Previously, the tax exemp- tion applied only to portable benefits paid to pensioners in countries with whom no bilateral social security agreement exists. Background Portable New Zealand superannuation and veteran’s pensions paid to pensioners living in countries with whom New Zealand has no bilateral social security agreement are tax-exempt. However, such benefits paid under bilateral social security agreements were not. This difference in legal status was an oversight, and the Department of Social Welfare (DSW) have not been withholding tax. Legislative amendments have now aligned the law with DSW’s practice by extending the exemption to all portable New Zealand superannuation and veteran’s pensions. The amendments treat all portable pensions equally and are consistent with New Zealand’s double tax agreement negotiation policy of securing sole taxation rights of pension income for the recipients’ country of residence. Key features The definitions of “portable New Zealand superannua- tion” and “portable veteran’s pension” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 are amended to add a reference to section 19 of the Social Welfare (Transi- tional Provisions) Act 1990. The definitions of “portable guaranteed retirement income”, “portable national superannuation”, “portable New Zealand superannuation” and “portable veteran’s pension” in section 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976 have been amended to add a reference to section 19 of the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990 to complete the retrospective effect to 1 April 1990. Application date The amendment applies retrospectively to 1 April 1990, the date that section 19 of the Social Welfare (Transi- tional Provisions) Act came into force. Non-deduction salaries Section OB 2(4), Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction Section OB 2 (4) of the Income Tax Act 1994 has been amended so that a close company for the purposes of section OB 2 continues to include all companies with 25 or fewer shareholders, until 1 April 1998. Background Section OB 2 allows a close company, under certain circumstances, to pay remuneration to shareholder employees without deduction of PAYE. Such remunera- tion is generally known as non-deduction salary. Subsection (4) of section OB 2 defines the term “close company”, for the purposes of the section, as including a company with 25 or fewer shareholders. Before the amendment, this extended definition had application until 1 April 1997. The extended definition was a result of consultation on the Taxation Reform (Binding Rulings and Other Matters) Bill in 1995. During the consultation several issues were raised concerning the differences between the practical application of section OB 2 compared to the legislation. Therefore it was agreed that Inland Revenue would carry out a review of the section, to be completed by 1 April 1997. Consideration of the definition of “close company” for the purposes of the section is part of the review. However, the review may not be completed, nor the legislation enacted, by this date. Therefore the current extended definition of “close company” for the purposes of section OB 2 will continue to include all companies with 25 or fewer shareholders, until 1 April 1998. By this time the review should have been completed and any necessary legislation enacted. 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) References to non-standard income years Section OF 2, Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction A reference to non-standard income years in section OF 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 has been updated to include reference to the definition of “supplementary dividend” in section OB 1. Background References to income years in Part LE (which contains the foreign investor tax credit (FITC) regime) already include non-standard accounting years. This was achieved by inserting a reference to Part LE in section OF 2, which lists those provisions for which income year references include non-standard accounting years, at the time Part LE was enacted on 12 December 1995. The definition of “supplementary dividend” in section OB 1, which is used only for FITC purposes, also contains an income year reference. Section OF 2 has now been amended to also include a reference to the supplementary dividend definition. Key features The income year reference in the definition of “supple- mentary dividend” in section OB 1 includes non- standard accounting years. Application date The amendment applies to dividends paid on or after 12 December 1995, the application date of new Part LE. Record-keeping provisions of gift-exempt bodies Section 32 , Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction A discretionary provision to allow records of gift- exempt bodies to be kept in a language other than English has been inserted in section 32 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). This will ensure consistency within the provisions of the TAA and with those in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) which govern the keeping of business and tax records. Key feature The amendment will give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the discretion to authorise gift-exempt bodies to keep records in a language other than English. Background The TAA and the GST Act contain various record- keeping provisions which require that records be kept in the English language. Three of these provisions include a discretion which allows the Commissioner, on appli- cation in writing, to permit records to be kept in a language other than English. However, section 32 of the TAA, which deals with the records of gift-exempt bodies, requires that their records be kept in English and has no discretionary provision. (The term “gift-exempt bodies” is defined in section 3(1) of the TAA, but in general terms is a collective definition encompassing certain specifically named donee organisations and funds, and other income tax exempt charitable and non-profit bodies and community groups.) There is no sound policy reason why any gift-exempt body should not be able to apply for an exception to the requirement to keep records in English. It is also inconsistent that an organisation can apply to keep records in a language other than English for the pur- poses of section 75 of the GST Act, but if that organisa- tion is a gift-exempt body it must keep income tax records in English. Application date The amendment will apply from the income year beginning 1 April 1996. 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) Student Loan Scheme - special repayment deduction rate certificates Section 21, Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Introduction An amendment allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to issue a special repayment deduction rate certificate for an amount in excess of the borrower’s estimated repayment obligation for the income year. Background Before the amendment the Commissioner could only issue a special repayment deduction rate certificate for the estimated amount of the borrower’s repayment obligation for the income year. The change is designed to encourage borrowers to make voluntary repayments of their Student Loan debts by making it easier for them to do so. Key features At the request of a borrower, the Commissioner will issue a special repayment deduction rate certificate for any amount in excess of the borrower’s estimated repayment obligation for that income year. An applica- tion may be made before or during the income year. Application date The amendment applies from the date of enactment, 2 September 1996. GST - double dipping, input tax deductions for dwellings Introduction Amendments correct drafting errors to the application dates of two changes made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) by the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1995 (GST Amendment Act). The changes were to close a loophole that enabled “double dipping” and to stop input tax deductions being claimed for dwellings that are used principally as private residences. When these changes were made, it was intended that late claims would not be allowed but that registered persons who had committed themselves to a contract but had been unable to claim because the return for the period in which the claim arose had not been furnished, would not be disadvantaged by the retrospective nature of the original amendments. Explanations of the original amendments are on pages 31 and 32 of TIB Volume Seven, No. 9. Background Two changes made to the GST Act by the GST Amend- ment Act were effective from the date of the announce- ment of the change by the previous Minister of Revenue. On 21 June 1995 Hon Wyatt Creech announced that an amendment would be enacted to close a loophole that allowed double dipping. On 11 August 1995 he an- nounced a change to ensure that an input tax deduction could not be claimed for a dwelling unless the dwelling itself was used for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. When the bill effecting these changes was introduced, the amendments applied not only to supplies made on or after the date of the announcements, but also to supplies made before the announcements, if a return in which the claim was made had not been furnished at the date of the relevant announcement. The application date for each amendment was modified by the Finance and Expenditure Committee. It was intended that registered persons who had acquired goods under a contract that was unconditional, but who had been unable to make a claim because the return for the period in which the claim arose had not been furnished at the time of the announcement, would not be disadvantaged by the retrospective nature of the amend- ment. The wording of the original amendment did not achieve this. Key features The amendments correct two drafting errors contained in the GST Amendment Act. The errors relate to the application dates for the amendments that were made in that Act to close a loophole that enabled “double dipping” \[section 2(5)\] and to stop input tax deductions being claimed for dwellings that are used principally as private residences \[section 3(3)\]. The amendments give effect to the intention that the previous changes would apply from the date on which each amendment was announced by the previous Minister of Revenue, other than for registered persons who would be making future claims (not late claims) for goods acquired under a contract that became uncondi- tional before the relevant announcement date. Application date The amendments apply from the application dates of the original changes: 21 June 1995 for double dipping and 11 August 1995 for input tax credits for dwellings. 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) Introduction An amendment has been made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) to ensure that insurance subrogation payments are subject to GST. (These are payments made by a third party to an insurer in respect of a liability owed by the third party to an insured party who has been indemnified by the insurer.) Background The following diagram illustrates the relationships involved when a third party makes a subrogation payment to an insurance company. Third Party Insured Insurance company Indemnity payment Liability for insured’s loss Subrogation payment Exercise of right of subrogation Claims GST deduction under section 20(3)(d) Accounts for GST output tax under section 5(13) (if registered and loss incurred in course of taxable activity) The insured has incurred a loss, in relation to which it has then received an indemnity payment from the insurance company. Assuming the insured is GST registered and the loss has been incurred in the course of carrying on a taxable activity, the insured will have accounted for GST, under section 5(13) of the GST Act, on receipt of the indemnity payment. The insurance company will have claimed a GST deduction under section 20(3)(d) on making the indemnity payment. Subsequently, the insurance company has exercised its right of subrogation and claimed against the third party because of the third party’s liability for the insured’s loss. (The right of subrogation is the right that an insurer has to receive the benefit of any rights and remedies which an insured party may have against a third party, in respect of any loss for which the insurer has indemnified the insured party.) In response, the third party has made a subrogation payment to the insurance company. The underlying rationale for levying GST on the insurance subrogation receipt is that: (a)the insurer has claimed a GST deduction under section 20(3)(d) for the indemnity payment made to the insured; and (b)the subrogation receipt has decreased the net cost of the claim to the insurer; therefore (c)the amendment prevents the insurer from making a double recovery of the GST element from both the section 20(3)(d) deduction and the third party who has made the subrogation payment. Key features The amendment provides that if: •an insurer receives an insurance subrogation payment; and •the insurer has previously claimed a deduction when making an associated indemnity payment; the amount received (excluding any aggravated and exemplary damages) is subject to GST output tax. As stated, the underlying policy rationale for levying GST on a subrogation receipt is to prevent an insurer from making a double recovery of the GST element of amounts paid to indemnify an insured. The amendment is, therefore, restricted in its application to insurers who have previously been allowed a deduction under section 20(3)(d) of the GST Act. Any amount attached to an insurance subrogation payment as a consequence of delayed payment is subject to GST output tax. Such an amount may be commonly referred to as interest (this includes court awarded interest). A third party making an insurance subrogation payment is able, where they meet the necessary conditions set out in the GST Act, to claim an input tax credit. Application date The amendment applies from the introduction of GST, 1 October 1986, except if: •a registered person has not accounted for output tax on receipt of an insurance subrogation payment, if the last day for furnishing the return for the taxable period to which the output tax was attributable was before the date of introduction of the legislation, 21 May 1996; or •a registered person had a live objection before the date of introduction of the legislation, 21 May 1996, in respect of the payment of output tax on the receipt of an insurance subrogation payment. Insurance subrogation payments that fall within these two categories are not subject to GST. GST treatment of insurance subrogation payments Section 5(13B), Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) Taxation (Superannuitant Surcharge Reduction) Act 1996 Sections JB 4 and NI 5, Income Tax Act 1994 Section 33A, Tax Administration Act 1994 Correction of cross-references to the Customs and Excise Act 1996 Section 12, GST Act 1985 Introduction Legislative amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1986 (GST Act) have been made to correct cross- references made in the fifth schedule of the Customs and Excise Act 1996 (CE Act). (Also see the item Customs and Excise Act 1996 in this TIB for consequential amendments to the GST Act as a result of the enactment of the CE Act.) Background Section 12 of the GST Act provides that GST is payable on imports made under or in breach of the Customs Act 1966. The Customs Act 1966 has since been reformed by the CE Act. The fifth schedule of the CE Act consequentially redrafted section 12 of the GST Act to reflect the new provisions of the CE Act. However, the redraft con- tained incorrect cross-references to the GST Act. In particular, the fifth schedule provided that sections 112, 113, 114, 116 and 117 of the CE Act were to apply to section 12(4)(c) of the GST Act. However, it was sections 111, 112, 113, 115 and 118 of the CE Act that should have applied. Further, in the redrafted section 12(4)(d) of the GST Act, section 119 instead of section 117 was specified. Key features Sections 111, 112, 113, 115 and 118 of the CE Act apply to section 12(4)(c) of the GST Act. This corrects the previous list of sections 112, 113, 114, 116 and 117. In redrafted section 12(4)(d) of the GST Act, section 119 instead of section 117 will apply. Application date The amendments will apply from the date the CE Act came into force, 1 October 1996. The New Zealand superannuitant surcharge thresholds have been raised significantly. The increases allow a couple’s gross income (New Zealand superannuation \[NZS\] plus other income) to be about 10 percent above the gross average ordinary-time wage before the sur- charge applies. Background The New Zealand superannuitant surcharge, a form of targeting, imposes a surcharge of 25 cents in the dollar on a superannuitant’s “other income” above a certain threshold. This has the effect of clawing back part or all of the NZS received. The amount clawed back cannot exceed the net NZS (gross NZS less tax payable as if NZS was the last income taxed) received by the super- annuitant. The targeting of NZS has been adjusted so that the cut- in point for the surcharge occurs when a couple’s total income (NZS plus other income) is about 10 percent above average ordinary-time earnings. The threshold for a single superannuitant retains the same relationship to the threshold for a couple as at present. These amendments supersede the second stage of the increase in the New Zealand superannuitant surcharge exemption thresholds that was to come into effect from 1 July 1997 as part of the Tax Reduction and Social Policy programme. Key features The increased New Zealand superannuitant surcharge thresholds are shown in the table below. Increased Surcharge Thresholds SurchargeEstimated thresholds ofthreshold of total other incomeincome (incl NZS) Couple$15,444 p.a.$34,934 p.a. ($297/week)($671.80/week) Single$10,296 p.a.$23,307 p.a. (living alone)($198/week)($448.21/week) 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.11 (December 1996) The amendments: •Reduce the estimated percentage of New Zealand superannuitants who are subject to the surcharge from about 25% to about 14%. •Reduce or eliminate the surcharge paid by well over 100,000 superannuitants. •Amend the circumstances under which a superannui- tant is not required to file an annual tax return (by the increase in the thresholds) accordingly. •Amend the surcharge codes used by superannuitants to have the surcharge deducted from source deduction payments (other than NZS). Application date The amendments take effect from 1 April 1997 for the 1997-98 and subsequent income years. Customs and Excise Act 1996 Introduction The Customs and Excise Act 1996 came into effect on 1 October 1996. The Act replaced the Customs Act 1966 and consequentially amended the Customs Act references in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act). Background Under the previous legislation, sections 12, 13 and, where applicable, 42 of the GST Act were deemed to be one of the Customs Acts. These sections relate to the imposition of GST on imports, the imposition of GST on goods liable to excise duty and supplied at “in bond” prices, and the recovery of tax respectively. Other sections of the GST Act refer to the Customs Act, in particular the zero-rating provisions in section 11. The Customs Act 1996 has been replaced with the Customs and Excise Act 1996. Therefore the references in the GST Act to the Customs Act have been amended accordingly. Key features The Customs and Excise Act 1996 has amended the following provisions of the GST Act to substitute references to the Customs and Excise Act 1996 for references to the Customs Act 1996, and to reflect changes in terminology in the Customs and Excise Act 1996: •section 1(3); •section 2, definition of “input tax”; •paragraphs (a), (aa), (ac), (ad), (ae) and (b) of subsec- tion 11(1); •section 11(1A); •section 11(1D); •section 11(2)(ca); •section 12; (see also page XX) •section 79(1)(b). Section 13 of the GST Act has been repealed and sections 1(3), 20(3) and 22 amended to reflect this. Section HK 18 (2) and the definition of the “input tax” in section OB 1 in the Income Tax Act 1994 have also been amended accordingly. Application date The amendments to the GST Act apply from 1 October 1996, the application date of the Customs and Excise Act 1996.

Tags (security) - Depreciation Determination DEP21 In TIB Volume Eight, No.6 (October 1996) we pub- lished a draft general depreciation determination for security tags and security systems used in the retail sector as part of the electronic security systems used to help prevent shoplifting. We received a submission suggesting that further investigation was required into the proposed rate for the security systems. Because of this the Commissioner has now issued the determination to cover the security tags only. It may be cited as “Determination DEP21: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 21”. The determination is reproduced below. The new depreciation rate is based on the estimated useful life set out in the determination below and a residual value of 13.5% of cost. General Depreciation Determination DEP21 This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP21: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 21”. 1. Application This determination applies to taxpayers who own the asset class listed below. This determination applies to “depreciable property” other than “excluded depreciable property” for the 1995/96 and subsequent income years. 2.

Jeff Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) Plant trolleys - draft depreciation determination We have been advised that there is currently no general depreciation rate for plant trolleys. These trolleys are used in the horticultural industry and are leased to growers for use in the selection of plants in nurseries and subsequent transport to retail outlets. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general deprecia- tion determination which will insert a new asset class “Plant Trolleys” with an estimated useful life of 5 years and a general depreciation rate of 33% D.V. and 24% S.L., under the “Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” Industry Category. The draft determination is reproduced below. The proposed new depreciation rate is based on the esti- mated useful live (“EUL”) set out in the draft determi- nation below and a residual value of 13.5%. Exposure Draft - General Depreciation Determination DEPX This determination may be cited as “Determination DEPX: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number X”. 1.

Any foreign person who is filing a US tax return or refund claim must have an Individual Taxpayer Identifi- cation Number (ITIN). All previously issued temporary numbers became invalid on 1 January 1997. When you include an ITIN on any US tax returns you file after 31 December 1996, your return will be proc- essed more promptly and you will receive any refund due more quickly. Key features Any non-US individual who does not have and cannot get a US Social Security number, and who meets any of the following conditions, must get a US ITIN: 1.The individual is required to file a US tax return 2.The individual is claimed as a dependent of a US person on his or her US tax return 3.The individual is the spouse of a US person who elects to file a joint US tax return 4.The individual is claimed as a spouse for an exemp- tion on a US tax return 5.The individual is filing a US tax return only to claim a refund These people need not apply for an ITIN: •US citizens •Anyone who already has or can get a US Social Security number ITINs are for tax purposes only and do not entitle the recipient to Social Security Benefits. Non-US citizens who gain approval to work in the United States will still be entitled to receive a Social Security number. To get an ITIN, fill in a Form W-7 and file it with two forms of positive identification. For information on where to get Form W-7, what identification is accept- able and how to file the form, contact the US Consulate in Auckland - phone (09) 303 2724. You can also contact the Internal Revenue Service’s phone enquiry line in Sydney (00 61 2 9373 9194). Calls are answered on Tuesdays and Thursdays, 8.30 am to 4.00 pm (Australian time); at other times messages can be left on the machine. Alternately, you can download Form W-7 from the IRS World Wide Web site at http://www.irs.ustreas.gov. The IRS needs approximately six weeks to process an ITIN application, plus postage time from Philadelphia (where applications are processed) to you. Application date The new regulations apply from 1 January 1997. The US Internal Revenue Service will continue to accept returns without an ITIN, but refunds will be frozen until the individual taxpayer has obtained an ITIN. 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) Binding rulings This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995). You can order these publications free of charge from any Inland Revenue office. Lease surrender payments - income tax treatment Public Ruling - BR Pub 97/1 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BB 4 (a) and CE 1 (1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the receipt of a lease surrender payment by a landlord from a tenant when the landlord, who is in the business of leasing property, agrees to accept the early termination of the lease. For the purposes of this Ruling, and for the avoidance of doubt, the term “business of leasing” has the same meaning as the term “business of renting”, and means the business of letting property for a rent. The business of leasing property need not be the sole activity nor the princi- pal activity of the person, however it must be sufficient to of itself amount to a business. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: •Section BB 4 (a) includes within a taxpayer’s assessable income all profits or gains from any business. •A lease surrender payment received by a landlord in the business of leasing property is assessable income as a profit or gain from any business. •A lease surrender payment is not assessable income under section CE 1 (1)(e). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to payments received by such a landlord between 1 March 1997 and 30 September 1997. This Ruling is signed by me on the 14th day of January 1997. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) Lease surrender payments - income tax treatment Public Ruling - BR Pub 97/1A This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 3 and CE 1 (1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the receipt of a lease surrender payment by a landlord from a tenant when the landlord, who is in the business of leasing property, agrees to accept the early termination of the lease. For the purposes of this Ruling, and for the avoidance of doubt, the term “business of leasing” has the same meaning as the term “business of renting”, and means the business of letting property for a rent. The business of leasing property need not be the sole activity nor the princi- pal activity of the person, however it must be sufficient to of itself amount to a business. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: •Section CD 3 includes within a taxpayer’s gross income any amount derived from any business. •A lease surrender payment received by a landlord in the business of leasing property is gross income as an amount derived from any business. •A lease surrender payment is not gross income under section CE 1 (1)(e). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to payments received by such a landlord between 1 March 1997 and 31 March 2000. This Ruling is signed by me on the 14th day of January 1997. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Commentary on Public Rulings BR Pub 97/1 and 97/1A This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Rulings BR Pub 97/1 and 97/1A. The Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 amended a large number of sections in the Income Tax Act 1994. It has done this, in the main, by repealing those provisions and replacing them with new amended provisions. The new provisions take effect from the start of each taxpay- er’s 1997-98 income year (i.e. from 1 April 1997 for standard balance date taxpayers). Given that the repealed provisions will no longer apply from the start of each taxpayer’s 1997-98 income year, the Commissioner has produced two Rulings. BR Pub 97/1 applies for the period from 1 March 1997 to 30 September 1997. BR Pub 97/1A applies for the period from 1 March 1997 to 31 March 2000. For example, if a taxpayer has a standard balance date, i.e. 31 March 1997, BR Pub 97/1 will apply to that taxpayer for the period from 1 March 1997 to 31 March 1997. From 1 April 1997 the new provisions take effect 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) and BR Pub 97/1A will apply to that taxpayer for the period from 1 April 1997 to 31 March 2000. The commentary refers to the Income Tax Act 1994 as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996. In particular, it refers to section CD 3 (previously section BB 4 (a)) and to the concept of “gross income” (previously in the context of these rulings “assessable income”).

Section CE 1 (1)(e) includes within a person’s gross income: All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land. Surrender payment as gross income For a receipt to be “gross income” under section CD 3 it must be “derived from any business”. To be “gross income” derived from any business, the courts have found that the amount must be a revenue amount. If the amount is a capital amount it will not be gross income of the landlord, as it will not be derived “from any business”. Gross income of a landlord If a landlord is in the business of leasing property, the receipt by the landlord of a lease surrender payment is an amount derived from the landlord’s business, and as such is a revenue receipt taxable under section CD 3. The receipt of a lease surrender payment, in the hands of a landlord in the business of leasing, is an act per- formed in what is truly the carrying on, or carrying out, of a business. It is not a capital receipt. This is an application of the general principle in Californian Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 and adopted in other cases. In Californian Copper Syndicate the taxpayer bought a mining concession for the purpose of exploiting it so that the syndicate could resell it at a profit. The syndi- cate never intended to work the property to derive income from mining operations. Although the transac- tion was an isolated transaction, nevertheless the profit was income as an act done in what is truly the carrying on of a business. The judgment in Californian Copper Syndicate draws a distinction between an act done in what is truly the carrying on of a business (revenue and gross income) and the mere realisation or change of investment (capital and not gross income). Case law on lease surrender payments There are no New Zealand authorities and few decisions from other analogous jurisdictions on the income tax treatment of the receipt of a lease surrender payment. However, support for the Commissioner’s view comes from the United Kingdom case of Greyhound Racing Association (Liverpool) Ltd v Cooper (1936) 20 TC 373 and a series of Canadian cases such as Monart Corpora- tion v Minister of National Revenue \[1967\] CTC 263. In both cases amounts paid to a landlord for early cancellation of a lease were assessable. In Greyhound Racing Association (Liverpool) Ltd a lease surrender payment paid by a licensee was assess- able income in the hands of the licensor. The licensor had a lease of a greyhound racing track. The lease was for 14 years. The licensor licensed use of the track to another company for nine years. Two years into the term of the licence the licensee went into voluntary liquidation and paid the licensor a surrender payment to terminate the licence. A new licence was executed as part of the settlement with a new company. The surren- der payment was based on the difference between the old rent and the new rent over the term of the new licence agreement. The Commissioner assessed the licensor for the sum of the surrender payment. The licensor appealed. The assessment was confirmed by Lawrence J who was of the view that use of the track did not create a new capital asset, and that the only asset in existence was the track and equipment. Use of that asset did not realise the original capital asset. His Honour’s view was that (page 378): The sum of £15,640 was nothing more than a lump sum payment in place of future rents similar to the payments in question in Short Bros Ltd v Commissioners of Inland Revenue, 12 TC 955, and similar cases. In Monart the taxpayer owned a large building in Montreal, Canada. A tenant occupying 10% of the lettable floor area of the building gave notice of its intention to end its tenancy, notwithstanding that the lease had six years to run. The taxpayer accepted a payment of $75,000 to cancel the lease for the remain- ing six years of its term. The amount was assessed as income of the taxpayer. The taxpayer objected, claiming the payment was to compensate for a diminution in value of the building as a result of the tenant leaving, such a diminution being a capital loss. The Court found that the receipt was assessable income of the taxpayer. It found that: •The amount was paid to the taxpayer for damages suffered due to the early termination of the lease, and such a termination was a normal incident in the 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) activities of a landlord in the business of renting properties; and •The lease rights surrendered by the taxpayer did not represent a loss of an enduring asset, and the taxpay- er’s method of conducting business was designed to cope with such a loss as a normal incident of the business; and •The compensation was received in substitution for future profits surrendered. The Monart decision was the latest of a series of Canadian cases that found lease surrender payments to be assessable. Included in the series of cases were Hill and Hill v MNR (1960) 24 Tax ABC 382 (payments for cancellations of leases assessable to the recipient landlord); Grader v MNR \[1962\] CTC 128 (monthly payments for the cancellation of a lease of theatre premises assessable to the recipient landlord); and Industrial Leaseholds Limited v MNR (1966) 40 Tax ABC 350 (payment for the early cancellation of a lease assessable to the recipient landlord). In the Hill and Hill case the Tax Appeal Board adopted the distinction proposed by Lord President Cooper in CIR v Fleming & Co (Machinery) Ltd \[1952\] SLT 147; (1951) 33 TC 57; between: (a) the cancellation of a contract which affects the profit- making structure of the recipient of compensation and involves the loss by him of an enduring trading asset \[a capital receipt\]; and (b) the cancellation of a contract which does not affect the recipient’s trading structure nor deprive him of any enduring trading asset, but leaves him free to devote his energies and organisation released by the cancellation of the contract to replacing the contract which has been lost by other like contracts \[an income receipt\]. The Board was of the view that the receipt of a lease surrender fell within the second category and hence was an income receipt. (Fleming is discussed below under the heading “case law on termination of agency con- tracts”.) In the Industrial Leaseholds case, the landlord owned only one building which was rented to one company for a term of 20 years. After five years the tenant wanted to terminate the lease and paid the landlord $7,525 for accepting the lease surrender. The Tax Appeal Board adopted the Fleming distinction, and concluded that the payment was of a revenue nature, coming within the second category set down in Fleming. At page 358 of the case the Board said that the payment was not related to “extraordinary commercial contracts” of the type in Van den Berghs Ltd v Clark \[1935\] AC 431. (Van den Berghs was a case of the same type as CIR v Thomas Borthwick (1992) 14 NZTC 9,101 (CA). Thomas Borthwick is discussed below under the heading “Case law where a receipt was not assessable”). The conclusion that a landlord’s receipt of a lease surrender payment is assessable to the landlord is not inconsistent with the non-deductibility of such surrender payments established in the Court of Appeal case of CIR v McKenzies NZ Ltd (1988) 10 NZTC 5,233. In that case a tenant paid money to the landlord of one of the buildings it rented, to accept a surrender of the lease. The Court found the payment was not deductible because it was a capital expense. The character of a payment for assessability and deductibility purposes has to be tested in the hands of each taxpayer, and a sym- metrical result is not guaranteed; see for example Christchurch Press Company Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206. For a tenant, a lease surrender payment will often be non-deductible for the reasons set out in McKenzies. For a landlord in the business of leasing property, a lease surrender payment will be assessable as a business profit. Case law on termination of agency contracts Some guidance on the question of whether a lease surrender payment is a capital or revenue receipt may also be gained from considering cases concerning compensation for termination of agency contracts. Indeed, in the Canadian lease surrender payment cases discussed above, agency cases such as Fleming were applied by the courts. There is an analogy between receiving a lease surrender payment (compensation for terminating a lease) and receiving compensation for termination of an agency contract. In Kelsall Parsons & Co v CIR \[1938\] SC 238; (1938) 21 TC 608 the taxpayers carried on business as commis- sion agents for the sale in Scotland of the products of various manufacturers, and entered agency agreements for that purpose. One particular agency was cancelled two years into a three year term. The taxpayers were paid £1,500 compensation. The taxpayer argued the sum was a capital amount, whereas the Commissioners argued the sum was a revenue amount. The Court of Session (First Division) agreed with the Commissioners that the sum was a revenue amount. At page 619 of the Tax Cases report, Lord President Normand said: It was a normal incident of a business such as that of the Appellants that the contracts might be modified, altered or discharged from time to time,...In parting with the benefit of the contract, moreover, the Appellants were not parting with something which could be described as an enduring asset of the business. The contract would have been terminated in any event as at the 30th September, 1935. The judge concluded, at page 621: In my opinion the agency agreements entered into by the Appellants, so far from being a fixed framework, are rather to be regarded as temporary and variable elements of the Appellant’s profit-making enterprise. Lord Fleming was of the view that (page 622): One would suppose that it would be an ordinary incident of their business that such agreements might be altered or terminated from time to time. In the same way, a lease is not a fixed asset of the landlord, but a temporary and variable element of the landlord’s profit-making enterprise. It is an ordinary incident of their business that such agreements might be altered or terminated from time to time. 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) However, as discussed above, landlords who derive lease surrender payments do so not from the mere fact that they have a business, but from the current operations of the business, that is, from the leasing activities they carry on. That is, it is an ordinary incident of the business activity of the landlord. This conclusion is not inconsistent with either of the two cases discussed next. In these two cases the relevant court found certain payments to be capital, but each case is distinguishable from the case of a landlord receiving a lease surrender payment. In Westfield Limited v FCT 91 ATC 4234, the taxpayer was a company in the business of designing, construct- ing, letting, and managing shopping malls. It purchased some land which it subsequently sold, making a large profit. The Federal Commissioner sought to assess the profit as income. The Full Federal Court found it was not income as the profit was not a profit in the course of the taxpayer’s ordinary carrying on of its business. The Court expressed its decision to be an application of the principle in FCT v The Myer Emporium Ltd 87 ATC 4,363. At page 4242 the Court said: In a case where the transaction, which gives rise to the profit, is itself a part of the ordinary business (e.g. a profit on the sale of shares made by a share trader), the identification of the business activity itself will stamp the transaction as one having a profit-making purpose. Similarly, where the transac- tion is an ordinary incident of the business activity of the taxpayer, albeit not directly its main business activity, the same can be said. The profit-making purpose can be inferred from the association of the transaction of purchase and sale with that business activity...It can not be said, in the present case, that resale of land was part of the ordinary business activity at all, or, for that matter, a necessary incident of that business activity. That business activity was rel- evantly the construction of shopping centres, their leasing or management, either on the appellant’s own land, on the land of others, or on joint venture land. (Emphasis added.) Westfield differs from the lease surrender situation because the Full Federal Court found that the transac- tion that gave rise to the profit was outside the ordinary course of business, whereas with a landlord the deriva- tion of a lease surrender payment is within the ordinary ambit of the landlord’s business, being the leasing of property. The cases discussed under the heading “case law on lease surrender payments” provide support for receipt of a lease surrender payment being within the ordinary course of the landlord’s business, as do the cases discussed above under the heading “case law on termination of agency contracts”. In Thomas Borthwick, the taxpayer gave up a valuable asset (a marketing contract) in return for payment of a cash settlement amount. The amount was found to be a capital receipt and non-assessable. The Court of Appeal considered that the marketing contract formed part of the capital structure of the taxpayer’s business. It was the framework which provided the means of making profits from a particular area. Without the contract they could not run a part of their business. This is distin- guishable from a landlord letting a property, as the lease In Fleming the taxpayers had been agents of a company in respect of Scottish sales for over 45 years. The agency was terminated in 1948, and the taxpayer was paid a sum of compensation. To decide whether the receipt was a capital or revenue receipt, Lord President Cooper proposed to classify cases according to whether it involved (page 61 of the Tax Cases report): (a) the cancellation of a contract which affects the profit- making structure of the recipient of compensation and involves the loss by him of an enduring trading asset \[a capital receipt\]; and (b) the cancellation of a contract which does not affect the recipient’s trading structure nor deprive him of any enduring trading asset, but leaves him free to devote his energies and organisation released by the cancellation of the contract to replacing the contract which has been lost by other like contracts \[an income receipt\]. The appropriate classification for a lease surrender payment is paragraph (b). The cancellation and surren- der of the lease leaves the landlord free to devote energy and organisation to replacing the cancelled lease with a new lease. In Fleming Lord Russell distinguished between a case where the rights and advantages surrendered are such as to destroy or materially cripple the whole structure of the taxpayer’s profit-making apparatus \[capital receipt\], or whether the benefit does not represent the loss of an enduring asset \[income receipt\] (page 63 of the Tax Cases report). Applying this test again favours a lease surrender payment being a revenue receipt, as cancel- ling a lease does not destroy or materially cripple the landlord’s business, but leaves the landlord with the asset and the need to lease it out again. In Wiseburgh v Domville (Inspector of Taxes) \[1956\] 1 All ER 754 (CA) the taxpayer was a manufacturer’s agent. One agency was terminated for which a sum of £4,000 was paid as compensation. In deciding the sum was a revenue receipt and assessable Lord Evershed MR accepted (page 759) that the loss of the agency was an incident of the taxpayer’s business, it did not destroy the business, and was not the loss of an enduring capital asset. The same analysis can be applied to a lease surrender payment received on cancellation of a lease. Case law where a receipt was not assessable In CIR v City Motor Service Limited; CIR v Napier Motors Limited \[1969\] NZLR 1010, the Court of Appeal interpreted the words “from any business” in a pred- ecessor section to CD 3. Turner J said, at page 1017: I think I do no more than reach his \[the lower court judge’s\] conclusion using other words when I say that in my opinion in the words “from the business” of the company something more is meant than merely “as a result of the fact that the company was carrying on this business”. I think that from the business must mean from the current operations of the business. The distinction between capital accretions and revenue operations runs all through the law of income tax. 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) over the property, on extinguishment, does not lead to a loss of business structure, but just a loss of a particular use of the business structure. Although the lease no longer exists, the lease asset does and the landlord can lease the asset to a new tenant. In terms of the test quoted above from Fleming the Thomas Borthwick case falls into paragraph (a), whereas the lease cancellation and surrender payment situation falls into paragraph (b). A case deciding that a lease surrender payment was not assessable was the Australian decision in Case U99 87 ATC 602. The lessee of business premises paid the lessor a sum to cancel the lease. The Commissioner treated the sum as assessable income. The lessor objected. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal upheld the objection and found that the sum was a capital amount. Relevant factors were: •There was no discussion between the parties on how the lease surrender sum was calculated; •It was not part of the taxpayer’s business to trade in leaseholds; •The property of the lessor was difficult to lease after the existing lease was cancelled; and •The lessee received an advantage from ridding itself of an onerous asset (the lease). In view of the authorities discussed above, we do not believe Case U99 is good authority in New Zealand. Submissions received Some submissions received by Inland Revenue on an exposure draft of this item have disagreed with the interpretation set out above. In particular, some com- mentators have argued that a lease surrender payment has a capital character and should not be treated as assessable income of the landlord. These commentators argue that the Thomas Borthwick principle applies to such a payment and that it is an extinguishment of a valuable asset and hence capital. Alternatively, they argue in terms of the California Copper principle that the receipt of a lease surrender payment is not a receipt in the ordinary course of the landlord’s business. Case U99 was also mentioned in support of the submission favouring a capital character. For the reasons discussed in some detail above the Commissioner does not accept these alternative views and considers that the ruling and commentary more correctly represent the proper interpretation of the law. Example 1 Landlord A owns a number of commercial proper- ties, and is in the business of leasing them. She leases one building to Tenant. Landlord A and Tenant execute a lease for 15 years at a rental of $50,000 per annum: the rental being reviewable every five years. The lease provides for one right of renewal for a further 15-year period. Five years into the lease Tenant’s business outgrows Landlord A’s building. Tenant moves the business to another property. Tenant offers to pay Landlord A $200,000 if she will accept a surrender of the lease by Tenant, and the cancellation of all Tenant’s obligations under the lease. Landlord A agrees, the lease is cancelled, and Tenant pays Landlord A the $200,000. Under section CD 3, the amount is gross income of Landlord A. Section CE 1 (1)(e) In the case of a lease surrender payment section CE 1 (1)(e) potentially applies. That section includes “premiums or other revenues” derived by a land owner “from any lease” within the landowner’s gross income. The words “premiums or other revenues” are potentially wide enough to include a lease surrender payment. However, in the Commissioner’s view, the words “from any lease” imply that the premiums or other revenues arise from a lease that will continue in existence after the payment is made. The words do not cover a situation where the lease is terminated on payment of the surren- der payment. Accordingly, section CE 1 (1)(e) does not apply. There is support for this view in obiter dicta of Richardson J in McKenzies at page 5,235, where His Honour said that premiums paid or received on the surrender of a lease are not dealt with in a predecessor section to section CE 1 (1)(e). When a landlord’s activity amounts to a business The leading case on the test and criteria for whether a business exists is Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682. In Grieve, Justice Richardson noted there were two factors in deciding if there was a business: first, whether the taxpayer had an intention to make a profit; second, the nature of the activities carried on. He went on to set out the following factors relevant to the inquiry as to whether a taxpayer is in business: •The nature of the taxpayer’s activities. •The period over which the taxpayer engages in the activity. •The scope of the taxpayer’s operations. •The volume of transactions undertaken. •The commitment of time, money, and effort by the taxpayer. •The pattern of activity. •The financial results achieved by the activity. Ultimately, whether a landlord is in business is a question of fact. In seeking to determine whether a landlord is in business the Commissioner uses the criteria identified above from the Grieve decision. (More recently the question of whether a business existed or not arose in Slater v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,453. The High Court examined, discussed, and approved Grieve and the tests proposed in that case.) A taxpayer who is in doubt as to whether or not a leasing activity amounts to a business should contact a 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) a business of renting property. In light of subsequent case law, particularly Case F111 in New Zealand, this decision must be doubted. In Kennedy Holdings & Property Management Pty Ltd v FCT 92 ATC 4918 the taxpayer co-owned a building which it rented out. It paid its lessee a sum of money to surrender the lease and sought to deduct the sum. The deduction was denied by the Commissioner, and the Federal Court (NSW) upheld the Commissioner’s assessment. The Court found the taxpayer was not carrying on a business. At page 4, 921 Hill J said: The applicant and its co-owner own one property which they lease out and from which they derive rental income. The freehold held in co-ownership is, in such circumstances, the income producing entity, structure or organisation for the earning of the rental income of the co-owners. The freehold is the profit-making structure. Again, there must be some doubt as to the persuasive- ness of this case in New Zealand. However, it may be seen as an example of a case where a company owning one building, in respect of which it is not required to undertake a lot of work, is not in the business of renting property, as suggested above. It also raises the possibil- ity that a company may own a building for the purposes of renting, and yet not be in the business of leasing property, contrary to some of the trends identified above. Example 2 Landlord B is retired and owns two properties, a family home and another house which is rented to an architect for use as an office. The rent from the rental property is direct credited to Landlord B’s bank account. Landlord B has no day to day in- volvement with the tenant or the building, and only very rarely needs to arrange for repairs and mainte- nance to be carried out. The tenant has tenanted the building for five years, and has a further five-year lease over the building. Landlord B is not in the business of renting as, in terms of the Grieve tests, the scope of her operations, the volume of transac- tions undertaken, the commitment of time, money, and effort by the taxpayer, the pattern of the activ- ity, and so on, all do not suggest her renting amounts to a business. Example 3 Landlord C is in full-time employment but also owns six houses which he rents out to tenants. Prior to renting out a house, Landlord C totally renovates it. Thereafter, Landlord C carries out any repairs that may be required. He undertakes advertising for new tenants, collection of rents, and associated duties. Landlord C is in the business of renting on the strength of both Case F111 and the Grieve test. Unlike Landlord B, the nature of Landlord C’s activities, the scope of the operations, the volume of transactions undertaken, and the commitment of time, money, and effort all suggest a business exists. tax adviser or the local Inland Revenue office. Case law on whether a landlord’s activity amounts to a business There are a number of cases on whether the leasing of property for rents amounts to a business. In L D Nathan Group Properties Ltd v CIR (1980) 4 NZTC 61,602 the taxpayer was the property owning subsidiary of the group. Davison CJ said that the deriving of rents by a company such as the taxpayer was income from a business. This confirms the approach in Smith v Anderson (1880) 15 Ch D 258, CIT v Hanover Agencies Limited \[1967\] 1 All ER 954 (PC), and American Leaf Blending Co Sdn Bhd v Director- General of Inland Revenue \[1978\] 3 All ER 1185 (PC) that companies involved in leasing will readily be held to be in the business of property leasing. However, this classification is not limited to company taxpayers. For example, in Case F111 the taxpayer owned two houses and a block of five flats. She collected the rents, inter- viewed tenants and did some of the maintenance and repair work. The TRA was of the view that the taxpayer was in business as a landlord. From these cases, it would appear that ownership of a number of buildings is likely to mean the taxpayer is in the business of property leasing. Owning just one building can also mean the taxpayer is in the business of property leasing if the requirements of the building mean the landlord is actively and regularly involved with the property (for example, negotiating new leases, maintenance, renovations etc.). It is also possible that owning a single building will not mean the landlord is in the business of property leasing (for example, when the landlord does not need to have much involvement with the day to day running of the property, or there are rarely new lessees, maintenance, or renovation work). It is interesting to note that the cases suggest that the threshold to be a business is lower when the landlord is a company than when the landlord is an individual or individuals. There are two Australian cases discussed below which found the renting of property did not amount to a business. To the extent these cases are inconsistent with the cases discussed above, they should be ignored as these authorities, being Privy Council and New Zealand High Court and TRA cases, are more persuasive au- thorities in a New Zealand court. In Case 24 (1944) 11 TBRD 85 the taxpayer owned three properties which returned rental income of over £10,000. The taxpayer employed a manager who collected and banked rents, attended to repairs and supervised them, and controlled the caretaker and cleaners. However, the taxpayer personally carried out the management of his rent-producing properties and directed policy, attending to the financial arrangements and made decisions regarding repairs. He employed an accountant to prepare accounts. The Board of Review (in a 2-1 decision) found that the taxpayer did not have 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd - demutualisation process does not of itself create tax liability for shareholders Product Ruling - BR Prd 96/37 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section BB 4 (a), (c) and (d) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the demutualisation of the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd (“Colonial”) whereby policyholders of Colonial receive shares and options in Colonial Limited. Policyholders will be asked to vote on a proposal under which Colonial will demutualise. If demutualisation is approved, policyholders will receive shares and options in Colonial Limited in exchange for relinquishment of their mem- bership rights in Colonial. The Directors of Colonial will fix an “implementation date” at which time shares and options will be issued by Colonial Limited to policyholders of Colonial. This is expected to occur in December 1996. Policy- holders will relinquish their membership rights in Colonial prior to the time the shares and options are issued. These membership rights principally include: •The right to attend, speak and vote at meetings of Colonial; and •A contingent right to receive a share of any surplus assets on a winding up of Colonial. These rights: •Are not represented by a separate chose in action, such as a share; and •Are embedded in the insurance policies which are held by policyholders; and •Cannot be separately traded by policyholders. Specifically, the Arrangement will be implemented by the following steps: •Policyholders will vote and agree to a Scheme of Arrangement to demutualise Colonial; •In December 1996 the Scheme of Arrangement to demutualise Colonial will be approved by the Supreme Court of Victoria; •In accordance with the Scheme of Arrangement: –Colonial’s Articles of Association will be amended permitting Colonial to issue shares and options; –Colonial’s Articles of Association will also be amended resulting in extin- guishment of the policyholders’ ownership rights; –Colonial will issue 100% of its share capital to Colonial Holding Company (Number 2) Pty Limited; –Colonial Holding Company (Number 2) Pty Limited will issue all shares in itself to Colonial Holding Company Pty Limited; –Colonial Holding Company Pty Limited will issue all shares in itself to Colonial Limited; 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) –Colonial Limited will issue shares and options to policyholders, or to the Colonial Foundation Trust on behalf of unconfirmed members; –Policyholders who wish to receive cash rather than shares will have the shares sold on their behalf by Colonial at the time of listing; •Listing will occur in Australia and New Zealand as early as practicable in 1997. Listing will occur after the shares and options are issued to eligible policyholders or the Colonial Foundation Trust. Demutualisation will proceed without any action by policyholders, apart from their agreement to the demutualisation proposal by way of vote. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the assumption that: •The proposed demutualisation proceeds in a manner that is not materially different to the Arrangement as described above. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: The demutualisation process (being the vote and agreement by Colonial policy- holders to the Scheme of Arrangement and the steps that follow from this as set out in the description of arrangement above that result in the issue of Colonial Limited shares and options to the policyholders or to the Colonial Foundation Trust) will not of itself: •Mean that shares and options received by policyholders will be acquired for the purpose of sale or other disposition as contemplated by the second limb of section BB 4 (c). •Constitute an undertaking or scheme entered into or devised for the purpose of making a profit as contemplated by the third limb of section BB 4 (c). •Be sufficient to constitute a business for the purposes of section BB 4 (a) or the first limb of section BB 4 (c). •Mean that shares and options, or proceeds from the sale of shares and op- tions, will be income derived from any other source under section BB 4 (d). •Alter the account on which membership rights are held by policyholders. That is, the demutualisation process will not, of itself, mean that membership rights held by a policyholder on capital account prior to the demutualisation will become a revenue account item as a result of the demutualisation poten- tially giving rise to assessable income under section BB 4 (a), (c), or (d). This Ruling sets out how the Commissioner will apply the specified Taxation Laws in relation to the demutualisation process itself and should not be taken, in any way, as a ruling on: •The assessability of any income arising from the conversion of membership rights for shares and options in Colonial Limited; or •The assessability of any proceeds from the sale of any shares and options in Colonial Limited. The answer to either of the above issues will depend on the facts of any particu- lar case. 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 2 December 1996 to 31 March 1999.

The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the demutualisation of the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd (“Colonial”) whereby policyholders of Colonial receive shares and options in Colonial Limited. Policyholders will be asked to vote on a proposal under which Colonial will demutualise. If demutualisation is approved, policyholders will receive shares and options in Colonial Limited in exchange for relinquishment of their mem- bership rights in Colonial. The Directors of Colonial will fix an “implementation date” at which time shares and options will be issued by Colonial Limited to policyholders of Colonial. This is expected to occur in December 1996. Policy- holders will relinquish their membership rights in Colonial prior to the time the shares and options are issued. These membership rights principally include: •The right to attend, speak and vote at meetings of Colonial; and •A contingent right to receive a share of any surplus assets on a winding up of Colonial. These rights: •Are not represented by a separate chose in action, such as a share; and •Are embedded in the insurance policies which are held by policyholders; and •Cannot be separately traded by policyholders. Specifically, the Arrangement will be implemented by the following steps: •Policyholders will vote and agree to a Scheme of Arrangement to demutualise Colonial; •In December 1996 the Scheme of Arrangement to demutualise Colonial will be approved by the Supreme Court of Victoria; •In accordance with the Scheme of Arrangement: –Colonial’s Articles of Association will be amended permitting Colonial to issue shares and options; 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) –Colonial’s Articles of Association will also be amended resulting in extin- guishment of the policyholders’ ownership rights; –Colonial will issue 100% of its share capital to Colonial Holding Company (Number 2) Pty Limited; –Colonial Holding Company (Number 2) Pty Limited will issue all shares in itself to Colonial Holding Company Pty Limited; –Colonial Holding Company Pty Limited will issue all shares in itself to Colonial Limited; –Colonial Limited will issue shares and options to policyholders, or to the Colonial Foundation Trust on behalf of unconfirmed members; –Policyholders who wish to receive cash rather than shares will have the shares sold on their behalf by Colonial at the time of listing; •Listing will occur in Australia and New Zealand as early as practicable in 1997. Listing will occur after the shares and options are issued to eligible policyholders or the Colonial Foundation Trust. Demutualisation will proceed without any action by policyholders, apart from their agreement to the demutualisation proposal by way of vote. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the assumptions that: •The proposed demutualisation proceeds in a manner that is not materially different to the Arrangement as described above; and •Colonial Limited will not be a “life insurer” as defined in section OB 1 at the time of issuing the shares and options to policyholders. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: The issue of the shares and options in Colonial Limited to those policyholders eligible to receive the shares and options, or to the Colonial Foundation Trust on behalf of policyholders eligible to receive the shares and options, as a result of the demutualisation does not constitute a “claim” as defined in section OB 1. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 2 December 1996 to 31 March 1999. This Ruling is signed by me on the 2nd day of December 1996.

It is included with the above product rulings at the request of Colonial. There will be no tax consequences for most policyhold- ers upon the receipt of shares on the demutualisation of Colonial. In particular, shares received as part of the demutualisation process and the proceeds of the first sale of those shares, or alternatively the receipt of the cash value of the share entitlement in respect of a policy, will not ordinarily generate assessable income in the hands of a policyholder if: •the policy was taken out for personal or family reasons. This includes the assignee of such a policy where the assignee is a relative or family trust; or •the policy was taken out over the life or well-being of an employee or business principal of the business (corporate or otherwise); or •the policy was taken out to protect personal earnings or business income in the event of disablement or trauma of an individual; or •the policy was taken out over the life or well-being of a member, or a group of members, of a New Zealand registered superannuation scheme by the trustees of the scheme. The on-distribution of shares by trustees to members will not give rise to taxable income in the members’ hands; or •the policy is an accident and disability or trauma policy taken out for the purposes of providing a lump sum, or non-earnings related payment in the event of the disablement or trauma of an individual. However, there may be tax consequences for those policyholders whose business activities mean that they deal in insurance policies or are otherwise ordinarily taxable on such receipts, or any policyholders who demonstrate that they acquired shares for the purpose of sale or other disposal. In addition, if a person acquires further shares with the purpose of resale, any profit on the sale of those shares will be taxable. The views expressed in this non-binding statement represent the Commissioner’s policy in relation to the demutualisation of Colonial. Relevant policyholders should note that the treatment of the shares issued (or their cash equivalent) will not affect the tax status of the proceeds of any claim paid under a policy. MJ Carr National Manager, Corporates 20 June 1996 Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the assumptions that: •The proposed demutualisation proceeds in a manner that is not materially different to the Arrangement as described above; and •The policyholders will relinquish their membership rights in Colonial prior to Colonial Limited issuing shares and options in itself to policyholders. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: The issue of shares and options in Colonial Limited to those policyholders eligi- ble to receive shares and options as a result of the demutualisation will not be assessable as a dividend under section CF 1.

Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 unless other- wise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 61, section 63, and the definitions of “gift” and “disposition of property” in section 2(2) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the demutualisation of the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd (“Colonial”) whereby policyholders of Colonial receive shares and options (both securities hereinafter referred to as “shares”) in Colonial Limited. Policyholders will be asked to vote on a proposal under which Colonial will demutualise. If demutualisation is approved, policyholders will receive shares in Colonial Limited in exchange for relinquishment of their membership rights in Colonial. The Directors of Colonial will fix an “implementation date” at which time shares will be issued by Colonial Limited to policyholders of Colonial. This is expected to occur in December 1996. Policyholders will relinquish their mem- bership rights in Colonial prior to the time the shares are issued. These member- ship rights principally include: •The right to attend, speak and vote at meetings of Colonial; and •A contingent right to receive a share of any surplus assets on a winding up of Colonial.

Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the assumption that: •The proposed demutualisation proceeds in a manner that is not materially different to the Arrangement as described above. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The voting by Colonial policyholders and the subsequent extinguishment of their voting rights and other ownership or proprietary rights, will not consti- tute a “disposition of property” as defined in section 2(2). Therefore, the voting and subsequent extinguishment will not be a “gift” as defined in section 2(2) and cannot be a dutiable gift by the policyholders to any person under section 63. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 18 December 1996 to 31 March 1999. This Ruling is signed by me on the 18th day of December 1996. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) DB Group Ltd’s share cancellation - payments to shareholders do not constitute a dividend Product Ruling - BR Prd 96/43 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CF 2 (1) and CF 3 (1)(b). 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the cancellation of three of every four fully paid shares in DB Group Limited (“DB Group”). For every share cancelled $0.60 will be distrib- uted to shareholders. The Arrangement is also a reduction to DB Group’s share premium account of $278,034,000 and a matching credit to the accumulated losses account. The shares to be cancelled are ordinary and fully paid shares and the cancellation will not alter the proportionate voting interest of any shareholder in DB Group. DB Group will distribute $181,500,000 which is $0.60 for every ordinary and fully paid share cancelled. The dividend payments since 1985 are: Financial YearInterimFinal 19852,571,0003,334,000 19863,333,0004,075,000 19879,481,00010,872,000 198810,245,00019,596,000 198919,971,00024,896,000 199014,180,00017,295,000 199114,707,00017,746,000 1992-- 1993-- 1994-- 19956,089,000 19966,089,000February 1997 A special dividend of $338,428,000 was paid in June 1989. Difficult trading conditions and large amounts of debt were the reason why no dividend payments were made from 1992 to 1994, and only a final dividend was paid during 1995. DB Group intends to continue paying both an interim and a final dividend each year. The next dividend is due to be paid in February 1997. The company expects the amount will be $8,067,000. The board of DB Group does not contemplate any issue of shares following the capital reduction. The purpose of the cancellation is to return excess cash, that has built up through the sale of a number of assets, to shareholders. This excess cash is surplus to DB Group’s present and likely future requirements. The purpose of the cancella- tion is also to give the company a debt to equity ratio and a share capital which is more commercially desirable. The following are the facts for the purposes of determining the available sub- scribed capital per share cancelled. Available subscribed capital - Variable a DB Group existed before 1 July 1994. Transitional capital amount - Variable j The aggregate amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994 is 150,837,492. 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) Amounts paid up by way of bonus issue after 31 March 1982 and before 1 Octo- ber 1988 are: April 1984 2,420,017 August 1985 4,115,878 November 1986 487,674 April 1987 724,154 August 1987 3,873 August 1987 1,716 November 1987 267,712 April 1988 1,219,381 April 1988 100,976 June 1988 753 September 198822,231,485 September 1988 2,034,529 The cancellation will occur after April 1997 and before August 1997. Therefore, the following bonus issues occurred more than 10 years before the cancellation: April 19842,420,017 August 1985 4,115,878 November 1986 487,674 April 1987724,154 No bonus issues during the period 31 March 1982 and before 1 October 1988 were paid up by way of application of any amount of qualifying share premium. Two bonus issues were made after 1 October 1988. The amounts of paid up capital are: December 1988 15 April 19892,237,573 The bonus issue of April 1989 was a taxable bonus issue. The total amount to be excluded from the aggregate amount of paid up capital is 25,860,440. Variable j for the purpose of determining transitional capital amount is 124,977,052. Transitional capital amount - Variable k The total amount of share premium paid to the company before 1 July 1994 is 407,087,000. No amounts of share premium were applied to pay up share capital in the company. The total amounts of share premium which arose with respect to the issue of shares in one company as consideration for the acquisition of shares in any other company 312,893,369. Variable k is 94,193,631 Transitional capital amount - Variable l The number of shares ever issued before 30 June 1994 is 307,674,321. Transitional capital amount - Variable m The number of shares on issue at the close of 30 June 1994 is 307,674,321. Transitional capital amount The transitional capital amount is 219,170,683 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) Available subscribed capital - Variable b The aggregate amount of consideration received by the company on or after 1 July 1994 and before the time of the cancellation for the issue of shares is 84,436,913. None of this consideration was received in any of the circumstances listed in paragraphs (b)(v) to (b)(xii) of the definition of available subscribed capital in section OB 1. No further shares will be issued before the cancellation. Available subscribed capital - Variable c There have been no amounts distributed upon the acquisition, redemption, or cancellation of shares on or after 1 July 1994. No amounts will be distributed upon the acquisition, redemption, or cancellation of shares before the cancella- tion. Available subscribed capital per share cancelled The available subscribed capital is 219,170,683 + 84,436,913 - 0 which is 303,607,596. The number of shares to be cancelled is 302,508,836. The available subscribed capital per share cancelled is $1.00. DB Group intends to distribute $0.60 for every ordinary and fully paid share cancelled. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the assumptions that: •The amount distributed to shareholders ($181,500,000) will be more than 15 percent of the market value of all shares at the time that DB Group first notifies shareholders of the proposed cancellation. •DB Group intends to continue paying both an interim and a final dividend each year. •The next dividend will be paid in February 1997. The company expects the amount will be $8,067,000. •The board of DB Group does not contemplate any issue further issue of shares. •The cancellation will occur after 30 April 1997 and before 1 August 1997. •No further shares will be issued before the cancellation. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The distribution to shareholders of $0.60 for every ordinary and fully paid share cancelled is excluded from the term “dividends” under section CF 3 (1)(b). •The reduction to the share premium account will not constitute “dividends” under section CF 2 (1). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 April 1997 to 30 September 1997. This Ruling is signed by me on the 10th day of December 1996. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) Bay of Plenty Co-operative Fertiliser Co Ltd’s offer to Southfert Co-operative Ltd’s shareholders Product Ruling - BR Prd 96/48 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section HH 3 (5), the definition of “beneficiary income” in section OB 1, section EH 1 and section EH 4. The Arrangement to which this Ruling Applies The Arrangement is that pursuant to the offer document dated 29 August 1996 (“Offer Document”) to Southfert Co-operative Limited (“Southfert”) sharehold- ers, Bay of Plenty Co-operative Fertiliser Company Limited (“BOP”) offers to purchase all the ordinary shares of $1.00 each of Southfert. Each Southfert shareholder who accepts the above offer will receive as considera- tion for the Southfert shares sold to BOP: •Initially, one fully paid BOP share for every two Southfert shares sold to BOP; and •Additional fully paid BOP shares in the 1996/97, 1997/98 and 1998/99 sea- sons for each tonne of fertiliser purchased by the particular Southfert share- holder (“deferred consideration”). Instead of issuing the BOP shares in pro- gressive stages, BOP will issue BOP shares in respect of the deferred consid- eration immediately to the Southfert/BOP Fertiliser Trust Company Limited (“Trustee”) which will hold the BOP shares on trust (“the Trust”) pending release to the Southfert shareholders in successive seasons. At the end of each of the three seasons following settlement, BOP will notify the Trustee of the amount of BOP shares which should be provided as deferred consideration, and the Trustee will transfer the relevant BOP shares to those persons. If the Trustee has insufficient shares to satisfy the payment of the deferred con- sideration, BOP may issue further shares to the Trustee. Alternatively, BOP may issue shares directly to the Southfert shareholders or pay an amount of cash to the Southfert shareholders equal to the value of the BOP shares constituting deferred consideration which BOP or the Trustee is obliged to provide in terms of the offer. Terms and conditions of BOP shares issued The BOP shares initially issued to the Southfert shareholders will not be entitled to receive any distributions (as defined in section 2 of the Companies Act 1993), bonus issues, cash issues or any other benefit provided to BOP shareholders prior to 31 May 1999. However, the Southfert shareholders will be entitled to receive all rebates or other distributions based on the volume of trading between the holder of the share and BOP. The BOP shares transferred to the Trust will be non-voting and not carry any rights to receive dividends, rebates or distributions of any nature whatsoever. After 31 May 1999, all the BOP shares issued in respect of the Southfert shares (the BOP shares initially issued to the Southfert shareholders and the deferred 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) consideration) will become pari passu with all other ordinary BOP shares be- cause they will carry the same rights as all other ordinary BOP shares. Terms and conditions of the Trust Pursuant to the trust deed dated 29 August 1996 between BOP and the Trustee, BOP will pay the expenses of the Trustee, although the Trustee will not be remu- nerated. The Trust will not provide any consideration for the transfer of shares from BOP. It will also not receive any consideration when it distributes the BOP shares to the Southfert shareholders. The Trust will not derive any gross income for the time it holds the BOP shares. The Southfert shareholders will not have any rights or interests in the BOP shares held by the Trust except as expressly set out in clause 3 of the trust deed (which relates to the tonnage of fertiliser purchased). BOP will not have any rights to, or interests in the BOP shares held by the Trust or any other asset of any nature held by the Trust. If there are surplus BOP shares remaining in the Trust after the deferred consid- eration obligations have been discharged, those shares will be cancelled or extin- guished for nil consideration to the Trustee. Other facts of the Arrangement and relevant information are as set out in the: •Offer Document dated 29 August 1996; and •Trust deed dated 29 August 1996 between BOP and the Trustee; and •Application for this product ruling dated 12 December 1996. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is made on the assumptions that: •The transactions between BOP and the Southfert shareholders are at arm’s length; and •BOP will provide a service for the benefit of the Trust at less than market value being the payment of the administration fees of the Trust; and •BOP is a resident for New Zealand tax purposes; and •The lowest price that BOP and the Southfert shareholders who accept BOP’s offer would have agreed upon for the Southfert shares being sold, at the time that the agreement for sale and purchase of the Southfert shares is entered into on the basis of full payment to the Southfert shareholders at the time at which the Southfert shares are transferred to BOP, is equal to the value of all BOP shares which are required to be provided to those Southfert shareholders pursuant to the terms of the offer (the BOP shares initially issued to the Southfert shareholders and the deferred consideration). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The distributions of BOP shares from the Trust to the Southfert shareholders (in their capacity as beneficiaries) will not be gross income pursuant to section HH 3 (5) and the definition of “beneficiary income” in section OB 1; and •The price of the Southfert shares is the value of the BOP shares which are required to be provided by BOP under the terms of the offer (the BOP shares 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) initially issued to the Southfert shareholders and the deferred consideration); and •No accrual expenditure or gross income under section EH 1 or EH 4 will arise to the Southfert shareholders from the “financial arrangement” (as defined in section OB 1) that is created by the Arrangement. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 5 December 1996 to 31 March 2000. This Ruling is signed by me on the 20th day of December 1996. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Challenging the validity of an assessment by judicial review proceedings Case:New Zealand Wool Board v CIR - Court of Appeal Keywords:Validity of assessment, objection proceedings, judicial review Summary:This is an appeal against the High Court’s decision to grant the Commissioner’s application for a stay of judicial review proceedings. The Objector’s appeal was successful. The orders made in the High Court were quashed and the Commis- sioner’s application for a stay was dismissed. Facts:The Objector invested $100 million in redeemable preference shares. In its in- come tax returns it treated the dividend income received as exempt from tax under section 63 of the Income Tax Act 1976. The Commissioner audited the Objector and amended its assessments for the 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993 income tax years, having invoked section 99 of the Act. The Objector objected to the 1990 amended assessment, challenging both the validity of the assessment and the correctness of it. The Objector applied for judicial review in the High Court. The Commissioner applied to stay the judicial review proceedings until the objection process had been exhausted. This was granted by the High Court. Decision:Richardson P, who gave the majority decision, recognised that if and when the objection becomes the subject of a case stated proceeding it may be appropriate to consolidate it with the judicial review proceedings and it should only be in exceptional cases that judicial review be heard separately and ahead of the objection proceedings. However the possibility of consolidation is hard to predict in this case because there has been no case stated proceeding yet. Also, there have been such long delays since the judicial review proceeding was filed and served (5 February 1996) that there is no justification for making the Objector defer its judicial review proceedings. The objection to the 1990 amended assess- ment was still being considered by the Commissioner which would lead to further delays still. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal quashed the orders made in the High Court and the Commissioner’s’ application for a stay of the Objector’s judicial review proceeding was dismissed. Onus on taxpayer to show intelligible basis for apportionment Case:Barron Fishing Limited v CIR Keywords:Apportionment Summary:A taxpayer who wishes to deduct part of a lump sum payment from his or her assessable income in any income year must provide sufficient evidence to estab- 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) lish that at least a minimum quantifiable sum is deductible under section 104 of the Income Tax Act 1976. To do this the taxpayer must put before the Court evidence from which the Court can reasonably assess the proportion of the sum which is deductible under section 104. Facts:The Objector is a company engaged in the business of fishing. An agreement was reached between the Objector and another company, Townsend and Paul Lim- ited (“TPL”) that if the Objector could obtain permits for the vessel “the West- erner”, the two companies should enter into a partnership. The Objector’s princi- pal shareholder obtained the permit on 16 May 1985 in his own name. The Objector and TPL agreed on 1 August 1985 that TPL would buy the Westerner and a quota entitlement for $325,000. The partnership deed was signed and dated 5 September 1985. In early September 1986 the name on the permit was changed over to the part- nership name. However in October 1986 the principal shareholder again had the fishing permit relating to the westerner issued in his own name. TPL brought proceedings to dissolve the partnership and the Objector offered to settle the dispute by making a lump sum unapportioned payment of $325,000 to TPL. This was accepted by TPL and a deed of settlement was signed on 18 March 1988, deeming the partnership dissolved as at 31 March 1987. The deed recorded that upon payment to it of $325,000, TPL was to transfer all interests in the assets of the partnership, including the interest in the Westerner and the fishing quota, to the Objector. The Commissioner disallowed the objector’s claim for a deduction of $318,848 paid to TPL under the deed of settlement. Decision:Justice Doogue in the High Court followed the case of Buckley and Young stating that the taxpayer must be able to point to some intelligible basis upon which a positive finding can be made that a defined part of a total sum is deductible. The taxpayer must provide sufficient evidence to establish that at least a minimum quantifiable sum is deductible under section 104 of the Income Tax Act 1976. To do this the taxpayer must put before the Court evidence from which the Court can reasonably assess the proportion of the sum of $325,000 which is attributable to capital under section 106 (1)(a) of the Act, and the portion which is deductible under section 104. There was insufficient evidence to enable the Court to enter into apportionment so the Court was unable to find that the $325,000 represented anything other than payment for the capital assets of the partnership. The Commissioner was correct in disallowing the Objector’s claim for a deduction of $318,848 paid to TPL under the deed of settlement. Assessability of a lump sum payment received upon leaving employment Case:Case TRA 95/72 Keywords:Employment income, long service payment Summary:The Objector had received a lump sum payment for long service upon leaving his employment with a bank. The TRA held the payment was of a type that the taxpayer would receive only on retiring from his or her employment. The pay- ment is therefore not assessable under section 65(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Facts:The Objector was an employee with a bank for some 28 years. This employment was terminated on 17 July 1992 for health reasons. The Objector received a long term service payment under the terms of his employment contract which pro- vided certain criteria for the receipt of the payment. The Objector received $35,170 as a long service payment. The bank deducted PAYE tax of $10,093.79, leaving the Objector with a net amount of $25,076.21. The Objector queried the 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) tax treatment of the lump sum with Inland Revenue, and was subsequently refunded the PAYE paid in by the bank. After reviewing the file again, Inland Revenue advised the Objector that the long service payment had been correctly taxed by the bank and that the payment was fully assessable. Decision:Judge Willy relied on the recent decision in Case TRA 95/82 which dealt with a virtually identical provision in a bank contract which he described as being "on all fours" with the contract in the present case. Judge Willy agrees that prima facie, the type of payment received by the Objector comes within the definition of “monetary remuneration” as defined in section 2 and therefore, prima facie, appears to be assessable under section 65(2)(b). However, the payment comes within the type of payment described in section 68(2) and is therefore deemed not to be assessable income unless it comes within one of the exceptions in section 68(2), the relevant one which is section 68(5)(d). Section 68(5)(d) would only exclude the payment made to the Objector if it had been calculated with respect to any right or entitlement not dependent on the occurring of the retirement (whether that right or entitlement related to any accumulated leave of absence which the employee might have taken in respect of any past service of the employee). The payment in this case and Case TRA 95/82 was dependent on the Objector’s retirement but was not a right or entitle- ment at that time. Accordingly the lump sum payment was a retirement payment from the contin- ued contract for services. It was therefore not assessable income under section 65(2)(b) because it was deemed not to be assessable under section 68(2). Assessability of lump sum payment received upon leaving employment Case:Case TRA 95/10 Keywords:Retiring leave, redundancy, monetary remuneration Summary:The Objector left employment with a company after nearly 44 years of service and received a lump sum payment. He contended that part of the payment was “retiring leave” and was deemed not to be assessable income under section 68(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976. The Court held there was an early retirement com- ponent to the lump sum payment which was severable from the redundancy aspect and, as it complied with the criteria of section 68(2), it was exempt from tax. Facts:The Objector was employed as a security advisor for the company. He had been employed by that line of employers for nearly 44 years. In 1993 he was asked to take voluntary severance as his position was considered surplus to requirements. The Objector elected to take voluntary severance with early retirement. He was treated to a retirement dinner and received accolades for his long service. He received a lump sum payment on his departure on 8 October 1993. Part of that payment was identified as “retiring leave” and the Objector contends that por- tion should not be taxed as a redundancy payment. Decision:Judge Barber agreed that the Income Tax Act uses the reason for termination of employment to determine whether the tax concession in section 68(2) for retire- ment is available and that the terminology used by the parties is not decisive. But the Objector in this case had made a deal with the company whereby he not only achieved the usual redundancy payment on the basis he was being made redundant, but he retained a retirement payment on the basis that he had been allowed to sever his employment ahead of redundancy as a voluntary redun- dancy combined with an early retirement package. Judge Barber decided the early retirement payment was severable, in that con- text, from the redundancy aspect and it was exempt from tax accordingly under section 68(2). 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.1 (January 1997) Due dates reminder February 1997 5Large employers: PAYE deductions and deduction schedules for period ended 31 January 1997 due. 7Provisional tax and/or Student Loan interim repay- ments: first 1998 instalment due for taxpayers with October balance dates.

Aquariums - Depreciation Determination DEP22 In TIB Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) at pages 2 and 3, we published a draft general depreciation determination for aquariums. No submissions on the draft determination were received, and the Commis- sioner has now issued the determination. The determination is produced below, and may be cited as, “Determination DEP22: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination No.22”. The new depreciation rate is based on an estimated useful life (“EUL”) as set out in the determination and a residual value of 13.5% of cost.

Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act 1994. This determination is signed by me on the 11th day of February 1997. Jeff Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Student Loan scheme - interest rates and repayment threshold for 1997-98 On 19 December 1996 the Minister of Education announced the interest rates and the repayment threshold for the Student Loan scheme for the year starting on 1 April 1997. The total interest rate will be 8.2 percent. This is made up of the base interest rate of 5.9 percent and the interest adjustment rate of 2.3 percent. The repayment threshold for the 1997-98 income year will be $14,560. 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.2 (February 1997) Use of money interest rates from February/April 1997 New use of money interest rates for all revenues and duties were announced by the Minister of Finance and Revenue on 21 January. The rate for overpayments of tax is 7.1% per annum and the rate for underpayments of tax is 13.9% per annum. The rates apply from 7 February 1997 for provisional tax and from 1 April 1997 for all other revenues and duties. Two-way interest rules apply to all revenues and duties from the 1997-98 income tax year. The use of money interest rates have been calculated under a new process which is designed to be consistent and transparent. They will be reviewed regularly to ensure that they reflect the underlying market rates. The formula for calculating interest on overpaid tax is based on the latest available monthly average Reserve Bank 90 day bank bill rate series less 100 basis points. The formula for calculating interest on underpaid tax is based on the latest available monthly average Reserve Bank business base lending rate series plus 200 basis points. The provisional tax interest rates have also been amended from 7 February 1997, so that they will reflect the use of money interest rates applying from that date: 7.1% per annum for tax overpayments and 13.9% per annum for tax underpayments. This is a change from the old rates of 8.2% per annum for tax overpayments and 13.8% per annum for tax underpayments, reflecting the shift in the underlying market rates since the old provisional tax interest rates were set. Interest received from Inland Revenue on overpayments will be assessable, and interest paid on underpayments may be deductible for taxpayers in business. The new rates apply to the following revenues and duties: •Accident Compensation levies - including employer and earner premium •cheque duty •Child Support deductions (by employers) •credit card transaction duty •dividend withholding tax (on ordinary dividends) •Family Support •foreign dividend withholding payment accounts •fringe benefit tax •gaming machine duty •gift duty •goods and services tax •income tax •lottery duty •non-resident withholding tax (on interest and divi- dends) •PAYE deductions (including Student Loan scheme repayments) •qualifying company election tax •resident withholding tax (on specified dividends) •specified superannuation contribution withholding tax •stamp duty •totalisator duty 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.2 (February 1997) Binding rulings This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995).

Trans Power’s services in connection with AC Hedge contracts not exempt as financial services for GST purposes Product Ruling - BR Prd 97/3 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 3 and 14 of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies Background With effect from 1 October 1996 the wholesale electricity market commenced. Instead of generators such as ECNZ and Contact simply setting the prices, a market mechanism has been put in place whereby loads can place bids for de- mand, and generators offer to supply, in each half hour with a single clearing price being established. The market allows participants (generators such as ECNZ and Contact, electric- ity wholesalers, local electricity companies and certain large consumers), to- gether with traders and speculators, to buy and sell electricity, the price being determined by supply and demand. Physical electricity is traded in this market 24 hours prior to delivery and bids and offers can be changed up to four hours prior to the real delivery time. For- ward energy price contracts issued by major players, e.g. ECNZ, will quote prices hedged at the two principal “nodes” or off-take points - Benmore and Haywards. These fluctuating spot prices contrast sharply with the existing “smoothed” electricity market. A major reason for this will be the varying costs of delivery of electricity through the grid to the various take off points, or “nodes”. Electricity can be lost along the way, or various factors can constrain supply, e.g. the Cook Strait cable. Thus, the variable cost of delivering electricity will be different at various off-take places in New Zealand, from the prices quoted at the principal nodes (Benmore and Haywards). The Arrangement The Arrangement is Trans Power entering into, and administering, hedge facility agreements (“AC Hedge contract”) with participants. continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.2 (February 1997) Trans Power has established a secondary market for hedging against future changes in variable electricity transmission costs. This is a voluntary market open to all market participants. It is not restricted to those buying or selling physical electricity. It provides a hedge against the variable transmission prices ahead of the electricity being dispatched into the grid. The AC Hedge contract is a contract for payment of the difference between the ratio of prices at a nominated off-take node and the reference node in that island (Benmore or Haywards). It is not an electricity supply contract. What is hedged is the nominated (entered) ratio between the two prices, not the difference in electricity price. The contract does not affect the delivery of any physical electricity. The market is open to persons such as pure financial specula- tors who are not directly involved in the physical supply or purchase of electric- ity. In operating the AC Hedge contracts, Trans Power (as well as being the hedge counter party) is responsible for calculating the amount (“Difference Amount”) payable on the maturity of each hedge contract. It must account to each counterparty, and oversee payment on a monthly reconciliation. It monitors and clears any trading in the hedges between approved participants. These functions are set out in the AC Hedge contract itself. Trans Power also makes relevant information available to the market place. Clause 8 of the AC Hedge Contract provides for assignment of the contract. The express written consent of Trans Power must be obtained before the assignment can take place. The Securities Commission has recently authorised Trans Power as a “dealer” in futures contracts in relation to the AC Hedges. This means that Trans Power can deal in or buy and sell the hedges, on behalf of others, as well as being a direct party. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the assumption that: •The AC Hedge contract market does not constitute an “authorised futures exchange” as that term is defined by the Securities Amendment Act 1988. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The services provided by Trans Power in respect of the entering into and settlement of AC Hedge contracts do not constitute the supply of financial services pursuant to section 3(1). Accordingly, they are not exempt supplies pursuant to section 14(a) of the Act. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from 1 November 1996 until 30 September 1999. This Ruling is signed by me on the 22nd day of January 1997. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) from page 3 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.2 (February 1997) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Forestry block sold early – cessation of activity for GST purposes? Case:TRA No. 95/43 Decision date:16 December 1996 Act:Goods and Services Act 1985 – section 51(1)(c) Keywords:Cessation of activity Summary:The TRA found that the objector’s activity ceased prematurely, so the registra- tion threshold was breached solely as a consequence of cessation and within the provisions of section 51(1)(c) of the GST Act. Consequently the objectors were not liable to be registered in respect of the activity. Facts:The objector trust owned a block of rural land. Part of it was rented out for grazing and the remainder was developed as a forestry block. The turnover from the forestry block did not require GST registration. However, the land was subsequently subdivided and the forestry block was sold. The value of this supply exceeded $30,000. The Commissioner then held the trust liable to register under section 51 (1) of the GST Act, even though the sale lead to the cessation of the forestry activity. Decision:The TRA ruled that the correct way of approaching the factual issue was to inquire whether or not the objectors did in fact close down or substantially reduce a business which would have otherwise run its course beyond the date of the closure or substantial permanent reduction. The Authority considered these questions: •What was the business of the trustees? •Did they cease that business prematurely? His Honour was satisfied that the sale of the forestry block occurred at a time significantly earlier than had originally been intended when the forestry activity was first undertaken. As a consequence and despite the fact that the supply in question was always the objective of the activity the proviso to section 52(1) applied to the objector. Loss offset in group of companies Case:Golden Bay Cement Company Limited v CIR Decision date:11 December 1996 Act:Income Tax Act – Section 191 (8) Keywords:Offsetting profits and losses continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.2 (February 1997) Summary:The Court held that section 191(8) does not provide a third and independent method (to subsections (5) and (7)) by which losses can be offset against profits. The Court concluded that section 191(8) is merely procedural and provides a method of assessment which will take into account the offsetting allowed by subsections (5) and (7). Facts:The objector had four wholly owned subsidiaries and constituted a “specified group” for the purposes of section 191. In 1984 the objector applied on behalf of the group to be jointly assessed under section 191(8), to which the Commissioner agreed. In the 1987 tax year three of the subsidiaries showed profits totalling $19,387,191. The objector and the remaining subsidiary showed losses of $9,801,568. A joint assessment was made offsetting the profits and losses. During the following tax year there was a change in the objector’s shareholding. The Commissioner issued an amended joint assessment which disallowed the offsetting of losses against profits within the group. The taxpayer objected to the amended assessment and commenced proceedings for judicial review to challenge the validity of the amended assessment. The Court of Appeal rejected the judicial review claim. The objector appealed following the High Court decision upholding the Com- missioner’s amended assessment. Decision:The Court held that section 191(8) does not provide a third and independent way by which losses can be offset against profits between the companies in a group. It is merely an available method of assessment. It will achieve, by single joint assessment, the same tax liability as would follow from individual assess- ments, allowing losses to be offset to the extent that they qualify under section 191(5) or 191(7). The Court stated that it would be surprising if subsection (8) was intended to enable losses to be offset against the profits of other members of the group with- out being made subject to the same restriction as subsections (5) and (7). The Court concluded, following the appellants submissions on the legislative history of the provisions, that the legislative history provided no basis for de- parting from the interpretation suggested by the words themselves in section 191(8), and particularly by the second part of that subsection which shows that the total liability of the companies in the group was to be the same as if individu- ally assessed. This is reinforced by the express application of subsection (7A) to subsections (5) and (7) but not to subsection (8). FBT on vehicles used by employees of earthmoving company Case:TRA No. 95/068 Decision date:17 December 1996 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 – section 336N (1) Keywords:Fringe benefit tax Summary:The TRA concluded that employees’ travel to and from their homes was in fact business related travel between worksites. The objectors were therefore not liable for fringe benefit tax on use of the vehicles. Facts:The objector partnership carried on an earth moving and transport business. It provided three employees with utility vehicles and one employee with an Escort van which the employees garaged at their homes. The employees used those from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.2 (February 1997) vehicles for travel between their homes and the work sites at which they were operating as well as for general business purposes. Decision:During the hearing the TRA took the view that as a prerequisite to the issue, the employees had to be deriving a benefit in the nature of private use or enjoyment of the vehicle. The case came to be decided on this point. The TRA focused on a number of additional work activities that the employees were expected to carry out from their homes. This involved some book work such as writing dockets and keeping diary notes for various jobs. His Honour held that the three employees were in effect expected to operate and manage the employer’s business direct from their homes. In addition the drivers in question were all part of an emergency team and available to carry out emergency work. Accordingly, his Honour concluded that the employees’ travel to and from their homes was business related between worksites. Timeshare purchase - GST input deduction Case:TRA No. 94/94 Decision date:17 January 1997 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 – section 57(2)(a) Keywords:Timeshare complexes Summary:The TRA held that the objector husband and wife partnership was not entitled to a GST input refund on the purchase price of a title-based timeshare. Facts:The objectors were registered for GST as a result of operating a takeaway food business. They purchased a unit in a timeshare complex consisting of 35 units and recreational, restaurant/bar and conference facilities. The units were subdi- vided under the Unit Titles Act 1972 and then cross-leased to reflect the shareowners’ time limited interest in the unit. The objectors purchased a stratum estate in freehold as to an undivided 7/52 share in a particular unit and acces- sory unit and an estate in leasehold in a shared ownership period for 7 shared ownership period weeks per year. The occupation and rental agreement entitles the objectors to seven weeks’ accommodation per year in the complex, or alternatively they may share in the rental profits from the whole rental operation of the hotel under an entitlement formula. In most of the years the objectors have used a combination of these two options. The complex is run by an accommodation partnership which is registered for GST. This partnership was made up of the current group of timeshare owners. The accommodation partnership returns output tax and claims input credits on all rental activity carried out by a management company on the partnership’s behalf. The partnership makes either a net profit or loss which is transferred to the capital accounts of its partners, including the objectors. Individual units are owned by the individual partners, not by the partnership. The objectors do not lease or license the property to the partnership. Decision:When the objectors purchased the timeshare their main or primary purpose was to acquire an investment. It was acquired for the purpose of making taxable supplies, namely letting commercial hotel premises to the public. However, when the objectors purchased the timeshare they became members of the accommodation partnership and as such under section 57(2)(a) of the Goods continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.2 (February 1997) and Services Tax Act 1985 they could not be registered in relation to the opera- tion of the timeshare. The supply of the timeshare is deemed by section 57(2)(b) to be made by the accommodation partnership. His Honour noted that the solution for the objectors was that the accommoda- tion partnership should claim the acquisition input under section 57(2)(c) and then pass it back to the objectors as part of their annual profit as a partner in the accommodation partnership. from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.2 (February 1997) Booklets available from Inland Revenue This list shows all of Inland Revenue’s information booklets as at the date of this Tax Information Bulletin.

National standard costs for specified livestock – 1997 Under the authority of section EL 4 (1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 the Governor-General has declared the national standard costs for specified livestock for the year starting on 1 April 1996 (the 1996-97 income year). The costs allow farmers to value their livestock under the national standard cost option for the 1996-97 income tax year. Farmers using the scheme apply the national standard costs to stock bred on the farm or immature animals on hand at the beginning of the year, while stock purchased is valued at their purchase price. The average of these costs is applied to the stock on hand at year’s end to derive the closing value of live- stock on hand. In announcing the values Revenue Minister, the Rt. Hon. W F Birch, said the average production costs for sheep, beef cattle, goats, and pigs have all fallen slightly compared with the previous year. Costs for rising 1 year dairy cattle have decreased more than other livestock classes. This was due to the average number of homebred calves raised on farms being higher than in the previous survey year. The larger number reduces the per head cost of this class of animal. The costs for deer have increased which reflects the improving income from this sector being channelled back into on-farm costs which increases the cost of producing the rising 1 year animals. The national average market values of livestock, which farmers use to value livestock under the herd scheme, will be released in May this year after a national survey of market values taken at 30 April. The national standard costs for the 1996-97 income year are as follows: National Kind ofCategory ofstandard livestocklivestockcost $ SheepRising 1 year 15.00 Rising 2 year 8.80 Dairy CattlePurchased bobby calves128.00 Rising 1 year413.00 Rising 2 year 72.40 Beef CattleRising 1 year125.00 Rising 2 year 73.70 Rising 3 year male non-breeding cattle (all breeds) 73.70 DeerRising 1 year 48.90 Rising 2 year 23.90 Goats (MeatRising 1 year 11.50 and Fibre)Rising 2 year 7.20 Goats (Dairy)Rising 1 year 80.70 Rising 2 year 13.20 PigsWeaners to 10 weeks of age 72.00 Growing pigs 10 to 17 weeks of age 56.70 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997) Plant Trolleys - Depreciation Determination DEP23 In TIB Volume Nine, No. 1 (January 1997), we pub- lished a draft general depreciation determination for Plant Trolleys as used in the horticultural industry. These trolleys are leased to growers for use in the selection of plants in nurseries and subsequent transport to retail outlets. No submissions were received, and the Commissioner has now issued the determination. The determination is reproduced below and may be cited as, “Depreciation DEP23: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 23”. The new deprecia- tion rate is based on an estimated useful life (“EUL”) as set out in the determination and a residual value of 13.5% of cost. General Depreciation Determination DEP23 This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP23: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 23”. 1. Application This determination applies to taxpayers who own the asset classes listed below. This determination applies to “depreciable property” other than “excluded depreciable property” for the 1995/96 and subsequent income years. 2.

These machines are used in the civil contracting industry, chiefly in the installation of pipes (water or gas) or cables (telecommunication or electri- cal) underground, without having to dig ditches. We received no submissions, so the Commissioner has now issued the determination. It is reproduced below, and may be cited as, “Determination DEP24: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination No. 24”. The new depreciation rate is based on an estimated useful life (“EUL”) as set out in the determination and a residual value of 13.5%.

This determination is signed by me on the 10th day of March 1997. Jeff Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997) FBT prescribed interest rate reduced to 10.0% The prescribed interest rate used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low interest employment-related loans has been decreased to 10.0% for the quarter starting on 1 January 1997. This rate will continue to apply to subsequent quarters until any further adjustment is made. This reduction from 11.1% reflects the recent fall in market interest rates. Mulchers (commercial) - draft provisional depreciation determination We have been made aware that there is currently no depreciation rate for commercial mulching machines of the type used at land fill and forestry sites for composting green waste. The Commissioner proposes to issue a provisional depreciation determination which will set the asset class for these machines. The draft determination is repro- duced below. The determination will set a new deprecia- tion rate of 40% DV for the asset class “Mulcher (Commercial)”. The proposed new depreciation rate of 40% DV is based on an estimated useful life (“EUL”) of 4 years and a residual value of 13.5% of cost.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995).

GST: Subdividers’ payments of financial contributions to local authorities as a condition of the grant of a resource consent Public Ruling BR Pub 97/2 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 2(1) (definition of “consideration”), 8(1), 10(2), and 20(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the charging by local authorities of financial contributions to persons who wish to develop subdivisions (“subdividers”), such contributions being in return for the supply of a resource consent by the local authority to the subdivider. The power for local authorities to levy such financial contributions is granted under the Resource Management Act 1991. This Ruling does not apply to fees charged for the processing of resource consent applications by the local authority. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The supply of a resource consent by a local authority to a subdivider, in return for the payment of a financial contribution by that subdivider, is sub- ject to GST. •GST must be returned by the local authority, whether the financial contribu- tion is paid in monetary consideration or non-monetary consideration. •The subdivider may make an input tax deduction for the GST charged on the supply of the resource consent by the local authority, if registration and invoice requirements are met. •If a financial contribution is paid in non-monetary consideration by a subdivider who is a registered person, that subdivider must charge GST on the supply of the non-monetary consideration. The local authority may make an input tax deduction on receiving such a supply, when registration and invoice requirements are met. continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997) This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 97/2 (“the Ruling”). Background When property is subdivided, demand increases for services provided by the relevant local authority. Existing services may need to be improved, or new facilities provided. Local authorities levy financial contributions on subdividers to cover the cost of providing these services. The authority to levy financial contributions is provided for in the Resource Management Act 1991. Financial contributions are one condition that may be attached to the grant of a resource consent for a subdivision. A financial contribution includes money, land, works, services, or any combination of these. The most com- mon services for which contributions are required are the provision of roads, water supply, drains, and reserves. These services are not part of a local authority’s normal business of providing services, which is funded by rates. A local authority assesses the impact of the subdivision on the services it provides in the course of its normal business, and evaluates the amount of financial contri- bution required for each increased service. Sometimes a subdivider provides works, or land for a reserve or other purpose, instead of a cash contribution. The Ruling does not cover supplies pursuant to the operation of law except in the context of a condition imposed for the supply of a resource consent by a local authority. Legislation Section 8 charges GST on the supply of goods and services (other than an exempt supply) in New Zealand by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. The value of a supply is determined by section 10(2), which states: Subject to this section, the value of a supply of goods and services shall be such amount as, with the addition of the tax charged, is equal to the aggregate of, - (a)To the extent that the consideration for the supply is consideration in money, the amount of the money: (b)To the extent that the consideration for the supply is not consideration in money, the open market value of that consideration. “Open market value” is defined in section 4: (1)For the purposes of this section- (a)The term “similar supply”, in relation to a supply of goods and services, means any other supply of goods and services that, in respect of the characteristics, quality, quantity, functional components, materials, and reputation of the goods and services first men- tioned, is the same as, or closely or substantially resembles, that supply of goods and services: (b)The open market value of a supply shall include any goods and services tax charged pursuant to section 8(1) of this Act on that supply. (2)For the purposes of this Act, the open market value of any supply of goods and services at any date shall be the consideration in money which the supply of those goods and services would generally fetch if supplied in similar circumstances at that date in New Zealand, being a supply freely offered and made between persons who are not associated persons. (3)Where the open market value of any supply of goods and services cannot be determined under subsection (2) of this section, the open market value shall be the consideration in money which a similar supply would generally fetch if supplied in similar circumstances at that date in New Zealand, being a supply freely offered and made between persons who are not associated persons. (4)Where the open market value of any supply of goods and services cannot be determined pursuant to subsection (2) or subsection (3) of this section, the open market value shall be determined in accordance with a method approved by the Commissioner which provides a sufficiently objective approximation of the consideration in money which could be obtained for that supply of those goods and services. (5)For the purposes of this Act the open market value of any consideration, not being consideration in money, for a supply of goods and services shall be ascertained in the same manner, with any necessary modifications, as the open market value of any supply of goods and services is ascertained pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section. “Consideration” is defined in section 2: “Consideration”, in relation to the supply of goods and services to any person, includes any payment made or any act The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 June 1997 to 30 April 2000. This Ruling is signed by me on the 6th of March 1997. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 97/2 from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997) described as not being voluntary, this does not prevent them being “consideration” for a supply of goods and services. Invoice The local authority should state the amount of the consideration, including the open market value of any non-cash consideration, on the invoice. Amount to return The local authority should return output tax based on the amount of consideration received, including non- cash consideration. The subdivider, if registered, can claim an input tax deduction of the same amount if they have a tax invoice. Non-monetary consideration If a subdivider pays the financial contribution by providing works or land, the contribution is still “con- sideration” and subject to GST, calculated by reference to the value of supply rules in section 4 and section 10(2)(b). The value of the consideration is the open market value of the works or land. The open market value includes GST. In this situation there will always be two supplies, one to the subdivider of the resource consent and the other to the local authority of the land or works. The supply of the land or works by the subdivider will be subject to GST if the subdivider is a registered person, as it will be a supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. If no cash payment changes hands and a pure barter arrangement has taken place, the value of the land or works and the value of the consent will be the same. The subdivider will get an input tax deduction for the GST on the resource consent (if it has a tax invoice) and pay output tax on the supply of the land or works. The local authority will get an input tax deduction on the supply to it of the land or works (if it has a tax invoice and is registered) and pay output tax on the supply of the resource consent. The supplies must be accounted for by both parties in their respective GST returns, notwithstanding the net effect being no GST liability or refund from the transaction for either party. If the subdivider pays a financial contribution with land or works and a sum of money, the consideration for the supply of the resource consent is the amount of the money plus the open market value of the land or works. The subdivider is entitled to an input tax deduction for the GST imposed on the resource consent if it is regis- tered and has a tax invoice. In these circumstances, the local authority is required to account for output tax on the total amount of consideration received for the supply of the resource consent. The subdivider’s supply of land is a taxable supply subject to GST for the reasons discussed above. The local authority may claim an input tax deduction on the supply of the land if it is registered and has a tax invoice. This input tax deduction is equal to the portion of the financial contribution paid for in non-monetary consideration. or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services, whether by that person or by any other person; but does not include any payment made by any person as an unconditional gift to any non-profit body: Section 20(3) allows a registered person to make input tax deductions on supplies of goods and services made to that registered person, subject to the different rules set out in the paragraphs in section 20(3). Application of the Legislation Consideration The Commissioner’s view is that subdividers provide financial contributions in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of a resource consent by a local authority to the subdivider of the subdivision. The supply of a resource consent is a supply of services. The contributions are “consideration”, as defined, for goods and services and so are subject to GST. The definition of “consideration” includes payments made “in respect of, in response to, or for the induce- ment of,” a supply of goods and services. Financial contributions are in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the services performed by local authori- ties when a resource consent is issued. Local authorities calculate the amount of a contribution as the cost of the services they must provide because of the subdivision. If a subdivider does not pay the contribution, the local authority will not approve the subdivision plan, the subdivision will not go ahead, and the local authority will not perform the services. The focus here is not on the goods and services the local authority supplies with the funds generated from the financial contribution, but on the supply of the resource consent with conditions attached. The use of the funds is quite separate from what the funds are consideration for, namely the resource consent. Another person benefits from the supply It makes no difference that the person paying the financial contribution is usually not the person who receives the long-term benefit of the goods and services provided by the local authority. (That long-term benefi- ciary being the resident or residents who ultimately buy the property.) The subdivider receives the supply of a resource consent, and it is that which determines the GST treatment of the financial contribution. The subdivider has no choice The financial contribution is subject to GST, despite the subdivider having no choice but to pay it if the subdivi- sion is to proceed. The definition of “consideration” includes payments made in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of goods and services. If this degree of connection exists between a payment and goods and services, the payment falls within the definition of “consideration”. The definition of “consid- eration” also includes payments which are not volun- tary, so to the extent the financial contributions can be continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997) cover all goods and services such as roads, drain- age, street lighting, and reserves. The total for financial contributions is therefore $30,000, exclu- sive of GST. Council should add GST of $3,750 onto the $30,000, making a GST inclusive total of $33,750 invoiced to Subdivider A. Subdivider A can claim an input tax deduction of the $3,750 GST charged. Example 2 (The following example does not purport to estab- lish any preferred valuation method for valuing non-monetary consideration, and should not be seen as doing so.) Subdivider B (a registered person) wishes to divide a block of land into 20 individual sections. Council requires a financial contribution of $1,500 for each section created, together with a contribution of one of the newly-formed sections. The total of financial contribution is therefore $30,000 (exclusive of GST) plus one section of land. The open market value of the section is $50,000 (including GST). Council should add GST of $3,750 onto the finan- cial contribution of $30,000, making a GST inclu- sive total of $33,750 invoiced to Subdivider B. The Council should also return GST of $5,555.55 on the contribution of the section of land, as the value of supply is the open market value of $50,000. There- fore, the Council should return a GST total of $9,305.55 on supplies of $83,750. Subdivider B can claim an input tax deduction for the $9,305.55 of GST. Subdivider B should return GST of $5,555 on the supply of the land to the Council, as it is a taxable supply. The Council can claim an input tax deduc- tion for the $5,555 GST. Assessability of payments under the Employment Contracts Act for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings Public Ruling - BR Pub 97/3 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BB 4 (b), BB 4 (d), NC 2, and the defini- tion of “monetary remuneration” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is: •The making of a payment to an employee or former employee for humilia- tion, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings under section 40(1)(c)(i) of the Em- ployment Contracts Act 1991; or Submissions received Some submissions received by Inland Revenue on an exposure draft of this item have disagreed with the interpretation set out above. One commentator did not agree that non-monetary consideration (such as land or works) could be consideration for a supply of a resource consent. However, section 10(2)(b) is clear that non- monetary consideration can be consideration for a supply. Another commentator disagreed that financial contribu- tions were paid by a subdivider for a supply by a local authority. He considered such contributions were fundamentally in the nature of a tax imposed by the local authority pursuant to statutory powers. The better view is that the supply of the resource consent by a local authority is a supply subject to GST. The statutory powers which enable financial contributions to be imposed, do so in the context of conditions that may be attached to a resource consent. In return for satisfying such conditions a resource consent will be granted. A resource consent is a valuable property right enabling the subdivider to do acts which would otherwise be illegal, the supply of it for consideration is subject to GST. The direct benefit received by the subdivider distinguishes the supply from the payment of taxes. We have made 1 June 1997 the starting date for the Ruling’s application to assist any local authorities who may have to revise their systems as a result of the Ruling. Examples Example 1 Subdivider A wishes to divide a block of land into 10 individual sections.

How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •Payments that are genuinely and entirely for compensation for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings under section 40(1)(c)(i) of the Employ- ment Contracts Act 1991 are not “monetary remuneration” in terms of the definition in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Consequently, such payments are not assessable to the employee under section BB 4 (b). •Such compensation payments are not income from any other source under section BB 4 (d). •There is consequently no liability under section NC 2 for employers or former employers to deduct PAYE from these payments.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Commentary on Public Rulings BR Pub 97/3 and 97/3A This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Rulings BR Pub 97/3 and 97/3A (“the Rulings”). The Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 amended a large number of sections in the Income Tax Act 1994. It has done this mainly by repealing those provisions and replacing them with new amended provisions. The new provisions apply from the start of each taxpayer’s 1997-98 income year (i.e. from 1 April 1997 for stand- ard balance date taxpayers). Because the repealed provisions will no longer apply from the start of each taxpayer’s 1997-98 income year, the Commissioner has produced two rulings. BR Pub 97/3 applies for the period from 1 April 1997 to 30 September 1997, and BR Pub 97/3A applies for the period from 1 April 1997 to 30 September 2000. For example, if a taxpayer has a standard 31 March balance date, BR Pub 97/3A will apply to that taxpayer for the period from 1 April 1997. BR Pub 97/3 will apply from 1 April 1997 to those taxpayers with late non-standard balance dates whose 1996-97 income year has not yet ended. BR Pub 97/3A will apply to those taxpayers when their 1997-98 income year starts. The commentary refers to the Income Tax Act 1994 as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996. In particular, it refers to sections CD 5 and CH 3 (previously sections BB 4 (d) and BB 4 (b)) and to the concept of “gross income” (previously in the context of these Rulings “assessable income”). from page 9 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997) Legislation Cross-reference table Income TaxIncome TaxIncome Tax Act 1994 1 Act 1994 2 Act 1976 CD 5BB 4 (d)65(2)(1) CH 3BB 4 (b)65(2)(b) NC 2NC 2338 OB 1OB 1 “monetary“monetary remuneration”remuneration” def’n in para (a)def’n in para (a) 1.as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 2.prior to amendment by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 Background The Employment Contracts Act 1991 provides for a number of remedies when an employee has a personal grievance against a current or former employer. This includes compensation for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to the feelings of the employee. The Employment Contracts Act also establishes special- ist institutions with exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the rights of parties to employment contracts: the Employment Tribunal and the Employment Court. The Employment Tribunal has jurisdiction to provide mediation assistance in matters brought before it and to adjudicate on personal grievances. Section 27(1) of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 defines “personal grievance” as: For the purposes of this Act, “personal grievance” means any grievance that an employee may have against the employee’s employer or former employer because of a claim- (a)That the employee has been unjustifiably dismissed; or (b)That the employee’s employment, or one or more condi- tions thereof, is or are affected to the employee’s disad- vantage by some unjustifiable action by the employer (not being an action deriving solely from the interpretation, application, or operation, or disputed interpretation, application, or operation, of any provision of any employ- ment contract); or (c)That the employee has been discriminated against in the employee’s employment; or (d)That the employee has been sexually harassed in the employee’s employment; or (e)That the employee has been subject to duress in the employee’s employment in relation to membership or non- membership of an employees organisation. Section 40 of the Employment Contracts Act provides a number of remedies for the Tribunal or Court when the Tribunal or Court determines that an employee has a “personal grievance”: (a)The reimbursement to the employee of a sum equal to the whole or any part of the wages or other money lost by the employee as an employee as a result of the grievance: (b)... (c)The payment to the employee of compensation by the employee’s employer, including compensation for - (i)Humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to the feelings of the employee; and (ii)Loss of any benefit, whether or not of a monetary kind, which the worker might reasonably have been expected to obtain if the personal grievance had not arisen: The Ruling considers whether such payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to the feelings of the employee are “monetary remuneration”. Paragraph (a) of the definition of “monetary remuneration” in section OB 1 states: “Monetary remuneration” ...means any salary, wage, allow- ance, bonus, gratuity, extra salary, compensation for loss of office or employment, emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employ- ment or service of the taxpayer;... Section CH 3 states that “all monetary remuneration derived by a person is gross income”. Section CD 5 also states that “the gross income of a person includes any amount that is included in gross income under ordinary concepts”. Application of the Legislation If payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings, under section 40(1)(c)(i) of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 are “monetary remuneration”, they would be included under section CH 3 as gross income. They would be included in the calculation of “net income” under section BC 6 and would consequently form part of “taxable income” as calculated under section BC 7. Section OB 1 defines “monetary remu- neration” to include any “other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer...”. Payments under section 40(1)(c)(i) of the Employment Contracts Act are a benefit in money. The issue is, therefore, whether these payments are made “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of” the recipient. The meaning of “in respect of or in relation to” The phrase “in respect of or in relation to” is capable of having a very wide meaning. For example, in Shell New Zealand Limited v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303, the Court of Appeal was dealing with certain lump sum payments made by Shell to employees who transferred at the request of Shell. The Court discussed the defini- tion of “monetary remuneration”. The case concerned the part of the definition of “monetary remuneration” which says: ... emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer. continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997) Stephen J also discussed the meaning of the phrase “in respect of”, noting at pages 553-554 that it was capable of describing relationships over a very wide range of proximity, and went on to say: Were the phrase devoid of significant context, it could, I think, be taken to be descriptive of the relationship between the present indebtedness owed to the State Government Insurance Office and the subject matter of workers’ compen- sation. However a context does exist which is in my view sufficient to confine the operation of s 292(1)(c) to bounds too narrow to be of service to the appellant. In TRA Case R34 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,190, certain payments were made to a New Zealand distributor by its overseas parent in relation to repairs which had to be made to cars sold to the New Zealand subsidiary and then sold to dealers. The issue was whether the pay- ments were zero-rated. The definition of “considera- tion” in section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 was relevant. Part of the definition of “considera- tion” states: ...any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services ... The TRA stated at page 6,200 that: A sub-issue is whether the reimbursing payment from the overseas manufacturer (MC) was made “in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of” the repair work in the sense required by the definition of “consideration” in s 2 of the Act. ... Although the definition of consideration creates a very wide potential link between a payment and a particular supply it is, in any case, a matter of degree, commonsense, and commercial reality whether a payment is direct enough to have the necessary nexus with a service, i.e, whether the link is strong enough. Not all payments to employees are “monetary remuneration” While it is true that an employee would not receive a payment under section 40(1)(c)(i) of the Employment Contracts Act if he or she were not an employee, it would seem clear that this type of “but for” approach to “in respect of or in relation to” is not universally applied in the context of employment, and that not all payments to employees which have a connection with their work are within the definition of “monetary remuneration”. In Fraser v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,356, at page 12,363, Doogue J in the High Court said: There is no dispute that the words “emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer” are words of the widest possible scope: see Shell New Zealand Ltd v C of IR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303 at p 11,306, and Smith v FC of T 87 ATC 4883; (1987) 164 CLR 513; (1987) 19 ATR 274. Mr Harley does, however, submit, correctly, that it does not follow that all payments made are necessarily income and refers, for example, to reimbursement payments. In Shell, McKay J highlighted the fact that the pay- ments in that case were both: McKay J, delivering the judgment of the Court, said at page 11,306 that: The words “in respect of or in relation to” are words of the widest import. Although McKay J acknowledged that the payments in Shell were not made under the contract of employment in that case, this did not mean that the employees received the payment outside the employee relationship. The learned Judge had earlier referred to the fact that the payments were not expressly provided under the employees’ written employment contracts but were made pursuant to Shell’s employment policy as a matter of discretion. They were still made “because he or she is an employee”. Other cases have also stressed the width of the words “in respect of or in relation to”. In the Queens Bench case of Paterson v Chadwick \[1974\] 2 All ER 772, Boreham J considered the meaning of the phrase “in respect of” in relation to discovery, and adopted the comments of Mann CJ in the Australian case Trustees, Executors & Agency Co Ltd v Reilly \[1941\] VLR 110, where the learned Chief Justice said: The words “in respect of” are difficult of definition but they have the widest possible meaning of any expression intended to convey some connection or relation in between the two subject-matters to which the words refer. Similarly, in Nowegijick v The Queen \[1983\] CTC 20 at page 25, the Supreme Court of Canada described the phrase “in respect of” as “probably the widest of any expression intended to convey some connection between two related subject-matters”. Context may affect the meaning However, many cases have demonstrated that the meaning to be given to the phrase “in respect of or in relation to” may vary according to the context in which it appears. In State Government Insurance Office v Rees (1979) 144 CLR 549, the High Court of Australia considered the meaning of the phrase “in respect of” in determin- ing whether the debt due to the Government Insurance Office fell within section 292(1)(c) of the Companies Act 1961-1975 (Q.) as “amounts ... due in respect of workers’ compensation under any law relating to workers’ compensation accrued before the relevant date”. The Court held that amounts which could be recovered by the Government Insurance Office from an uninsured company pursuant to section 8(5) of the Workers’ Compensation Act 1916-1974(Q.) for money paid to workers employed by the uninsured company were not amounts due “in respect of” workers’ compen- sation under the Companies Act. At page 561 Mason J observed that: ... as with other words and expressions, the meaning to be ascribed to “in respect of” depends very much on the context in which it is found. from page 11 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997) •made to the recipients because they were employees; and •paid to compensate for the loss incurred by the employee in having to relocate in order to take up a new position with the employer. Many cases have concluded that, in appropriate circum- stances, amounts received were not income, or assess- able, even though paid by an employer to an employee. In FC of T v Rowe (1995) ATC 4,691, for example, the taxpayer was employed as an engineer for the Livingston Shire Council. As a result of a number of complaints against him he was suspended. An inquiry was commenced, and he incurred legal costs as a result of engaging counsel to defend himself against dismissal during the course of the inquiry. The taxpayer was cleared of any charges of misconduct but was dismissed a year later. The taxpayer claimed his legal costs as a deduction. Although the Council refused to reimburse the taxpayer for his legal costs, the Queensland govern- ment subsequently made an ex gratia payment. The Full Federal Court considered, amongst other things, whether the ex gratia payment constituted assessable income. By majority, the Court concluded that the payment was not assessable under section 25(1) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 as income in accordance with ordinary concepts, nor was it assessable under section 26(e) of that Act as being compensation “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to” any employment. Accordingly, Burchett and Drummond JJ (with Beaumont J dissent- ing) held that the payment was not assessable. Burchett J held that the payment was not a reward for the taxpayer’s services but was a recognition for the wrong done to him. The payments were not remunera- tion but a reparation, and they were not sufficiently related to the performance of income-earning activities. On the same reasoning, it was too remote from the employment to be caught by section 26(e). Further, the payment was not assessable under section 26(e) because the employer/employee relationship between the Coun- cil and the taxpayer was merely part of the back- ground facts against which the ex gratia payment was made. Other cases relating to wartime service have also shown that payments made to present or former employees for reasons unconnected with their service as an employee will not necessarily be assessable income on a “but for” basis. In Louisson v Commissioner of Taxes \[1943\] NZLR 1, at page 9 Myers CJ and Northcroft J said of payments made by an employer to a former employee who had enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in World War II: In our opinion, such payments were personal gifts to each of the employees coming within the description in the resolution - gifts made simply as an acknowledgment of personal appreciation of the sacrifice made in the service of the Country by persons whose employment with the company has ceased and who are under no engagement to return to that employment. Similarly, in the Australian case of FCT v Dixon (1954) 5 AITR 443, the taxpayer received payments from his prior employer topping up his military pay. It would appear from the judgment that the Australian Commis- sioner argued that even a slight relationship to employ- ment was sufficient to satisfy the test in section 26(e) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 \[which made assessable certain sums granted to the taxpayer “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment...”.\]. This argument was rejected by Dixon CJ and Williams J, who stated at page 446 that: We are not prepared to give effect to this view of the opera- tion of s.26(e) ...There can, of course, be no doubt that the sum of £104 represented an allowance, gratuity or benefit allowed or given to the taxpayer by Macdonald, Hamilton and Company. Our difficulty is in agreeing with the view that it was allowed or given to him in respect of, or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment of, or services rendered by him ...We are not prepared to give s.26(e) a construction which makes it unnecessary that the allowance, gratuity, compensation, benefit, bonus or premium shall in any sense be a recompense or consequence of the continued or contemporaneous existence of the relation of employer and employee or a reward for services rendered given either during the employment or at or in consequence of its termina- tion. In the same case, at page 450, McTiernan J stated that: The words of paragraph (e) are wide, but, I think, not wide enough to prevent an employer from giving money or money’s worth to an employee continuing in his service or leaving it, without incurring liability to tax in respect of the gift. The relationship of employer and employee is a matter of contract. The contractual relations are not so total and all embracing that there cannot be personal or social relations between employer and employee. A payment arising from those relations may have no connexion with the donee’s employ- ment. These principles have also been applied by the courts in cases involving contracts for services. In Scott v FCT (1969) 10 AITR 367, Windeyer J in the High Court of Australia, considered the meaning of the words “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment of or services rendered by him” in section 26(e) of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936-1961. The case concerned a solicitor who received a gift of £10,000 from a grateful client. Windeyer J stated at page 374 that the meaning of the words of the legislation “must be sought in the nature of the topic concerning which they are used”. Windeyer J at page 376 referred to a passage from the judgment of Kitto J in Squatting Investment Co Ltd v FCT (1953) 5 AITR 496, at 524, where Kitto J (speaking of certain English cases) said: The distinction these decisions have drawn between taxable and non-taxable gifts is the distinction between, on the one hand, gifts made in relation to some activity or occupation of the donee of an income-producing character ... and, on the other hand, gifts referable to the attitude of the donor person- ally to the donee personally. continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997) payment, to compensate for the employer’s failure to give adequate notice of redundancy, was assessable as “monetary remuneration”. However, the result in that case turned substantially on the objector’s evidence as to the receipt being in the nature of “extra wages”. Barber DJ stated at page 1,455 that: The objector himself related the $7,009.52 to extra holiday pay and sick leave. ... At the end of his cross- examination he said that it was “really a bonus” and he regarded $7,009.52 as “extra wages”. The character of the payment must be of a revenue nature. It is not a payment in the nature of capital. I consider that it is clearly within the definition of monetary remuneration in sec 2. There is also the later TRA decision in Case L92 (1989)11 NZTC 1,530, where Barber DJ again consid- ered the definition of “monetary remuneration”. This case also concerned an employee who was made redun- dant and an employer who did not comply with the requirement to give adequate notice. Barber DJ held that the payment came within the definition of “mon- etary remuneration” and was assessable income. How- ever, the Authority did not consider any cases (other than his own previous decision in Case L78 ) on the correct characterisation of receipts for tax purposes, but rather concentrated upon the need to interpret “mon- etary remuneration” in a “wide manner” and the fact that the amount was received as compensation for loss of employment. Such compensation is specifically referred to in the definition of monetary remuneration. Recognising that it was possible for some receipts of a capital nature of a capital nature to be assessable income under a specific provision, Barber DJ at page 1,537 stated: In this case, the words in sec 2 “compensation for loss of office or employment, emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money” must surely cover not only a revenue type of payment such as a payment for lost wages, but also any other form of compensation for loss of employment. It may also be relevant to observe that both of these TRA decisions concerned settlements under the Indus- trial Relations Act 1973. This earlier legislation made no specific and separate provision for compensation payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. It is also thought that payments of the type under consideration in this Ruling are to be distinguished from those considered in American cases such as the Commissioner v Schleier 95-USTC 50,309. In that case, the United States Supreme Court held that certain punitive damages were assessable to the recipient employee. However, apart from the differing statutory context in the United States Internal Revenue Code, these damages were punitive because they related to a deliberate breach of the Age Discrimination in Employ- ment Act and that Act does not provide for a separate recovery of compensatory damages for pain and suffer- ing or emotional distress. The New Zealand Court of Appeal in Air New Zealand Ltd v Johnston \[1992\] Adopting this as a general principle, his Honour held that the £10,000 was not given or received as remunera- tion for services rendered and it did not form part of the taxpayer’s assessable income. The nature and context of the payments Looking at the nature and context of payments contem- plated by section 40(1)(c)(i), it is strongly arguable that they do not intrinsically result from the employee and employer relationship. It is true that if the employee were not an employee then there would be no entitle- ment to receive the payment, but payments under section 40(1)(c)(i) of the Employment Contracts Act for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings are not compensation for services rendered or for actions that occur in the normal course of the employment relation- ship. They are based on the existence of a personal grievance. Provisions for such compensation can be seen as being included in the Employment Contracts Act because the sometimes unequal power of the parties to the employ- ment contract means that such personal grievances may be likely to occur in that setting. It is noteworthy that the Human Rights Act 1993 also includes provisions for dealing with discrimination and sexual harassment of employees, even though that is not “employment legislation” at all. It is also possible to analyse a breach of the terms of the employment contract giving rise to the personal griev- ance (and the subsequent compensation) as literally being outside the employment contract because of the breach of the terms of the contract. Payments of compensation under section 40(1)(c)(i) of the Employment Contracts Act differ markedly from the situation in Shell v CIR. In that case at page 11,306, McKay J said: It is true ...that the payment is not made under the contract of employment....It is nevertheless paid to an employee only because he or she is an employee, and is paid to compensate for the loss incurred in having to change the employee’s place of residence in order to take up a new position in the com- pany. (Emphasis added) Thus, in the Shell case, the employees received the payments as employees, and in order to compensate for the loss sustained as a result of the employment-related relocation. In the ordinary course, the Commissioner considers genuine payments under section 40(1)(c)(i) to be too remote from the employment relationship to be within the definition of monetary remuneration. The Commis- sioner considers that the employment relationship in such instances is merely part of the background facts against which the compensation payments are made. The payments are not made “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer”. At first glance, it may be thought that this approach conflicts with the outcome in Case L78 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,451, where Barber DJ held that an ex gratia from page 13 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997) 1 NZLR 159 seemingly rejected the view that humilia- tion type payments to employees are punitive in nature rather than compensatory. In that case Cooke J held at page 168 that “the emphasis evidently placed by the Labour Court on the punitive aspect does justify, in my opinion, a radical interference with their award.” The award of $135,000 was replaced with one of $25,000, made up of $15,000 for future economic loss and $10,000 for injury to feelings under the Industrial Relations Act 1973. Income from any other source Compensation payments genuinely made under section 40(1)(c)(i) of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 are not “gross income under ordinary concepts” under section CD 5 . Unlike the statutory definition of “monetary remuneration”, section CD 5 can only apply when the payments received are “income” according to ordinary concepts. Although the legislation does not define “gross income under ordinary concepts”, a great number of decided cases have variously identified the concept by reference to such characteristics as periodicity, recurrence, and regularity, or by its resulting from business activities, the deliberate seeking of profit, or the performance of services. Nor do capital receipts form part of “gross income” unless there is a specific legislative provision to the contrary. It is clear that payments under section 40(1)(c)(i) will not generally be made periodically or regularly, or generally recur. Nor as we have seen above, are they compensation for services. And by analogy with common law damages, they are of a capital nature. This point is acknowledged by Barber DJ in Case L92, where he stated at page 1,536 that: I appreciate only too well that it is possible to interpret the evidence as showing that the $7,179.30 was formulated as a payment in the nature of common law damages for human hurt and breach and unfairness... I appreciate that the latter concepts are akin more to payments of capital than to wage revenue. Out of court settlements Sometimes, an employee and an employer negotiate a settlement out of court. The settlement agreement may state that the payment is for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. In return for the employee surren- dering his or her rights under the Employment Con- tracts Act, the employer will agree to pay a sum of money. There should be no difference in the tax treat- ment of the payments dependent on whether or not the parties use the Tribunal. A payment can be for humilia- tion, loss of dignity, or injury to the feelings of the employee whether the Tribunal is involved or not. Shams The Ruling will not apply to payments which are akin to sham payments. A sham is a transaction set up to conceal the true intention of the parties and is inher- ently ineffective. The nature of a sham was discussed by Diplock LJ in Snook v London and West Riding Invest- ment Ltd \[1967\]1 All ER 518 at 528 where he stated: I apprehend that, if it has any meaning in law, it means acts done or documents executed by the parties to the “sham”, which are intended by them to give to third parties or to the court the appearance of creating between the parties legal rights and obligations different from the actual legal rights and obligations (if any) which the parties intend to create. Richardson J, in the New Zealand case of Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154, stated that the “essential genuineness of the transaction is challenged” in a sham situation. It is noteworthy that, in the recent Taxation Review Authority decision, Case S 96 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,603, Judge Barber stated at page 7,606: Of course, seemingly excessive allocations to compensation for feelings injury should be reopened by the IRD. If the parties to an agreement agree to characterise or describe payments as being for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings when they are in reality for lost wages, this transaction would be a sham which would be open to challenge by the Commissioner. This would be so regardless of whether the payment was made as a result of an out of court settlement or an order representing the agreement of the parties sealed by the Employment Tribunal in its mediation function. Fur- ther, as provided by section 18 of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 and section 136(16) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the onus of proof in a hearing regarding the assessability of any such payment would be on the taxpayer. Bank of New Zealand’s Capital Guaranteed Growth Fund Ltd Product ruling – BR Prd 97/11 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of the definitions of “approved issuer”, “financial arrangement”, “interest” and “money lent” in section OB 1, the definition of continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997) “associated persons” in section OD 7, sections FC 1, NG 2 and NG 6, and section 86G of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the issue of certain capital guaranteed growth notes and related transactions. Bank of New Zealand (“BNZ”) has established BNZ Capital Guaranteed Growth Fund Limited (“FundCo”), a vehicle which will issue notes to investors, the return on which is linked to the futures market. FundCo is a wholly owned subsidiary of BNZ. In addition, repayment of an amount, at least equal to the initial capital invested on subscription of the notes, is guaranteed by BNZ. The structure of the notes issued by FundCo is as follows: (a)Issue of Notes: FundCo will issue a series of notes to investors. Each note will represent an agreement to sell, on a cash settled basis, to the investor, on a specified future date, a stated proportion of FundCo’s assets on that date (“FundCo Agreements”). The notes will constitute debt securities under the Securities Act 1978. Accordingly, FundCo will appoint a trustee and enter into a trust deed for the benefit of noteholders, as required by the Securities Act. (b)Termination: On the termination date, instead of physical delivery of FundCo’s assets in settlement of all outstanding notes, there will be a cash settlement of each note equal to the value of the specified proportion of the assets being purchased. Noteholders will be able to call for early settlement, and settlement may also occur on the occurrence of certain events. (c)Variable Payments: During the term of the notes, progress payments (“FundCo Variable Payments”) are to be made to investors based upon a fixed percentage of the increase in value of the net assets of AHL Guaranteed Trading (NZ) Limited (“TradeCo”) (see (g) below). Restrictions may be placed on payments which would reduce the value of the original invest- ment. (d)Capital Guarantee Fund: FundCo uses a proportion of the amount received on issue of the notes to invest in a deposit with BNZ. On maturity, the value of the deposit will at least be equal to the aggregate amount subscribed by the investors on the original issue of the notes. This amount is guaranteed to be repaid to investors by BNZ (the “capital guaranteed amount”). (e)Futures Market: FundCo makes an investment of the balance of the amount received on issue of the notes (i.e. after investing in the deposit and meeting certain expenses) by way of an agreement for sale with TradeCo (“TradeCo Agreement”). TradeCo is owned by 3 trustees of a trust established for New Zealand charitable purposes. TradeCo makes investments in the futures market (see (h) below). The TradeCo Agreement provides for a sale of all of TradeCo’s assets, with settlement at a stated time, being 10 years after entry into the agreement (subject to FundCo’s right to call for early settlement and settlement on the occurrence of certain events). (f)Cash Settled Sale: Instead of physical delivery of TradeCo’s assets on settle- ment, there will be a cash settlement of the agreement equal to the value of the assets of TradeCo. It is not intended that TradeCo’s assets will be physi- cally delivered to FundCo except in the event of a default by TradeCo to make the cash settlement payment. The cash proceeds will form part of the assets of FundCo subject to the settlement referred to in paragraph (b). (g)Variable Payments: During the term of the notes progress payments are to be made by TradeCo to FundCo based upon a fixed percentage of the in- crease in value of TradeCo’s net assets (thereby enabling FundCo to make from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997) the payments described in paragraph (c) to investors during the term of the agreements). (h)Futures Investments: TradeCo uses the moneys received by it under the agreement for sale with FundCo to invest in futures, foreign exchange and derivative contracts. This investment will be managed by E D & F Man Investment Products under an Investment Management Agreement. The principal futures broker will be E D & F Man International, appointed under an Introducing Broker Agreement. (i)Guarantee: TradeCo will enter into a guarantee agreement with BNZ under which BNZ will agree to guarantee repayment of the capital guaranteed amount. Assumption This Ruling is based on the assumption that the FundCo Agreements are not held by an associated person of FundCo, as defined in section OD 7. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the Assumption above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The FundCo Agreements will be “financial arrangements” as defined in section OB 1 and will not constitute debentures to which section FC 1 applies; •The amounts invested under the FundCo Agreements will constitute “money lent” as that term is defined in section OB 1; •The FundCo Variable Payments and amounts paid to investors on settlement in excess of the amount invested will constitute “interest” as that term is defined in section OB 1; •The FundCo Agreements will be able to be registered by an approved issuer as registered securities under section 86G of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971; •Where FundCo is an approved issuer under section NG 6, payments made by FundCo which constitute interest for tax purposes and are derived by non- residents, will be subject to non-resident withholding tax at the rate of 0% pursuant to section NG 2. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies from 7 February until 30 September 1997. This Ruling is signed by me on the 7th day of February 1997.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Product binding rulings – updating under Taxation (Core Provisions) Act As you can see, Product Rulings 91/11 and 97/12 above differ only in the Acts they are issued under and the application dates. In the near future we expect to be updating a number of previously-issued product rulings to take into account the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996. However, rather than republishing the entire text of these updated rulings, we will simply list their titles and numbers, plus any changes to the application dates. If any readers require the full text of an updated ruling, it will be available on request from Adjudication & Rulings in our National Office. We will provide more information as the rulings are updated. 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997) Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Input tax deductions for finance lease financiers and the appropriate method for section 21 adjustments Section 21 - Adjustments: A taxpayer has asked how public ruling BR Pub 96/11 (see page 4, TIB Volume Eight, No.10) applies in a situation when the taxpayer has two activities: one being the activity of financing the purchase or lease of goods by way of finance leases, and the other the activity of making taxable supplies. The taxpayer is concerned that the part of the ruling that denies input tax deductions (when GST is incurred by a finance lease financier on “general business goods and services”) may apply to both the finance lease activity and the activity of making taxable supplies. It is the intention of the ruling to isolate the finance lease activity of such a tax- payer so that the ruling will only apply to that activity. The public ruling defines a “finance lease financier” as a person whose business includes a substantial activity (which need not be the principal activity of the person) of financing customers’ purchase or lease of goods by way of finance leases. The arrangement to which the ruling applies is the “incurring of GST on goods and services acquired for the business of financing” by finance lease financiers. This includes GST incurred on goods the financier buys which are the subject of the finance lease, as well as GST on all other goods and services ac- quired by the financier. These other goods and services are described as “general business goods and services” in the ruling. In the section explaining how the taxation laws apply to the arrangement, the ruling goes on to state that “GST incurred on ‘general business goods and serv- ices’ acquired by a finance lease financier will not be deductible as ‘input tax’ because the principal purpose of acquiring such goods and services will be for making exempt supplies”. The taxpayer who has made the inquiry has an activity of financing the purchase or lease of goods by finance leases (so as to be a “finance lease financier” as defined), but also has another activity involving the making of taxable supplies. She is concerned that the ruling does not distinguish the two activities. It appears that as she is a “finance lease financier”, GST incurred on “general business goods and services” acquired in either of her activities may be subject to the public ruling, not just GST on “general business goods and services” acquired in the finance lease activity. The taxpayer has asked three questions: 1.If the two activities are operated separately, does the ruling mean that GST incurred on “general business goods and services” acquired in either of the two activities is non-deductible as input tax? 2.If the two activities are operated together, and the finance leasing activity is the minor activity, does the ruling’s prohibition of deductibility of input tax still apply? 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997) 3.If the two activities are operated by separate companies, grouped for GST purposes, does the ruling apply? Question 1: Separate activities When a taxpayer has two separate activities, one of finance leasing and one of making taxable supplies, the ruling is intended to apply only to GST incurred on “general business goods and services” acquired for the finance leasing activity and not the other activity of making taxable supplies. The deductibility of GST on inputs into the activity of making taxable supplies is not affected by the ruling. This is suggested in the Arrangement part of the public ruling which reads: The Arrangement is the incurring of GST on goods and services acquired for the business of financing, by finance lease financiers who enter into finance leases with customers to finance the purchase or lease of goods...(Emphasis added.) The public ruling applies only to the GST relating to the activity of finance leasing, not GST relating to non-finance lease activities a taxpayer may carry on in addition to finance leasing. Question 2: Activities operated together When a taxpayer operates the activities of making supplies of finance leasing and making taxable supplies as one activity, the deductibility of GST will de- pend on the application of the “principal purpose” test to the overall activity. (This assumes that direct attribution of inputs to specific supplies is not possible. If it is possible to directly attribute, that should be done.) If the principal purpose of acquiring the “general business goods and services” is for making taxable supplies, and the exempt supplies of finance leasing are only a subsidiary purpose to that principal purpose, the GST will be deductible as “input tax”. Any adjustments for exempt application will be made under section 21(1). The public ruling does not cover section 21(1) adjustments, but some of the concepts in the ruling may be useful when making such an adjustment. If the principal purpose of acquiring the “general business goods and services” is to make exempt supplies of finance leasing, and the taxable supplies are a sub- sidiary purpose to that principal purpose, the GST will not be deductible as “input tax”. Any adjustments for taxable application will be made under section 21(5). The ruling relates to section 21(5) adjustments for the taxable side of fi- nance lease activity (that is, the activity of selling or leasing goods). The applica- tion of inputs to the making of taxable supplies in the non-finance lease activity could also use the section 21(5) adjustment methods in the public ruling. Question 3: Section 55 grouping When the taxpayer operates the activities of making supplies of finance leasing and making taxable supplies within separate companies, grouped under sec- tion 55 of the Act, the principles of the ruling will still apply to the GST incurred in the finance lease activity. In the Arrangement part of the ruling is the follow- ing statement: A finance lease financier is most likely to be a finance company. It is not intended that the term cover persons who, as an adjunct of their business of selling goods, undertake the provision of finance to customers to encourage sales. However, the term is intended to cover a company whose business consists largely of financing the purchase or lease of goods when that company is in a group of companies for GST purposes. This is notwithstanding the deeming provisions of section 55(7). The taxpayer has asked what this statement means for grouping purposes, and in particular whether it means the provisions of section 55(7) do not apply. continued on page 22 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997) The statement further describes the persons to whom the ruling applies. It notes that people who sell goods, and finance some sales as an incident of that activity of selling goods, will not be subject to the ruling. However, when a company is a finance lease financier, and is grouped for GST purposes, the fact of grouping will not mean that the activity of finance lease financing is considered incidental to the selling of goods by other group members, such that the principles of the ruling will not apply. Although the activity of the financing company will be deemed to be carried on by the “representative member” of the group (section 55(7)(da)), that activity is still subject to the principles of the ruling. However, the phrase “notwithstanding the deeming provisions of section 55(7)” is not in- tended to establish anything other than this. In particular, it does not purport to override or ignore those provisions. from page 21 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Judicial review – assessment under appeal Case:Miller and Others v CIR Decision date:23 January 1997 Keywords:Judicial review, assessment, appeal Summary:In a second judgment on an application for judicial review the Court found that neither the Commissioner nor the TRA could supersede an assessment under appeal by an assessment made on an inconsistent basis. The Court found that there were firm assessments against both the company and the associated indi- vidual, and consequently, both assessments could be maintained until the appeal on one was known. Facts:The plaintiffs issued proceedings against the Commissioner seeking judicial review of the decision to issue amended assessments against each of them in relation to their former shareholdings. The plaintiffs sought declarations under section 8 of the Judicature Amendment Act 1972 that the Commissioner should not take any further action consequential on the exercise of his statutory power of assessment and should not institute or continue with any civil or criminal proceedings in connection with any matter to which the application for review related until the final determination. Decision:In a second judgment on an application for judicial review the High Court dealt with issues left undetermined by an interim judgment dated 8 November 1996. The Court found that where there is an assessment in relation to a company, and another in relation to an associated person deeming the same income to be income to both, and there is no request for a case stated, the use of section 99 to make a reassessment of the associated person involves an application of sec- tion 99(4) deeming the income to be received by the associated person and not the company. The earlier assessment in relation to the company is superseded, and a concurrent complementary reassessment of the company is not necessary. His Honour considered that where there is a request for a case stated or a case is before the TRA the Commissioner cannot act inconsistently with the assumption of control by the Authority. The judge applied BASF (1995) 17 NZTC 12,136 and distinguished MacNab (1984) 6 NZTC 61,710. Consequently, the Court held that the assessment under appeal could not be superseded by an assessment made on an inconsistent basis. However, his Honour confirmed that it is possible to have two inconsistent assessments (for two different taxpayers) provided these are made prior to a request for a case stated: Canterbury Frozen Meats \[1984\] 2 NZLR 681. Furthermore, the Court found that after an abatement of a case stated (as a result of removal of a company from the Register) the Commissioner could issue an amended assessment against an associated person. continued on page 24 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997) His Honour held that there were firm assessments against both the company and the associated individual and consequently, both assessments could be main- tained until the appeal on one was known. GST – supply of taxis to relief drivers Case:TRA No. 96/046 Decision date:5 February 1997 Act:Goods and Services Act 1985 – section 6(3)(b) Keywords:Taxi drivers, self-employed contractors, output tax Summary:The TRA held that the objector’s business and taxable activity was the supply of taxis to relief drivers and not the supply of taxi services to the public. His Hon- our found that the taxi service to the public could not be imputed to the objector because the relief drivers were self-employed. Consequently, the objector was not liable to pay GST on all fares received by the relief drivers. Facts:The objector was the owner of three taxis and was GST registered. The objector engaged relief drivers who were treated as self employed contractors. A verbal contract was entered into and the drivers split takings 50/50 with the objector after fuel costs were deducted. The objector calculated output tax on his 50% share of the takings only. The Commissioner assessed the objector for output tax on the total takings from the three taxis. The Commissioner contended that there was an employer/employee relationship between the objector and the relief drivers, and the fares earned by the taxis were taxable supplies made by the objector in the course of his taxable activity and were subject to output tax. Decision:The TRA held that the objector’s business and taxable activity was the supply of taxis to relief drivers and not the supply of taxi services to the public. The taxi service to the public was conducted by the relief drivers and could only be imputed to the objector if the drivers were employees of or agents for the objec- tor. The TRA agreed with the Commissioner that if the drivers were employees of the objector then the commission retained by the drivers would properly be regarded as salary and wages constituting an exempt supply in terms of s 6(3)(b) of the GST Act. In that case the objector would have been liable to pay GST on all fares received. However, his Honour found that a contract for services existed and the relief drivers were self-employed. Consequently, the objector was not liable to pay GST on all fares received by the relief drivers. GST registration – open market rental Case:TRA No. 96/126 Decision date:30 January 1997 Act:Goods and Services Act 1985 - section 51(4)(b) Acts Interpretation Act 1924 – section 25(j) Keywords:GST registration, open market rental Summary:The TRA held that the market rental of the property in question exceeded the registration threshold. Consequently, the Commissioner by virtue of s 51(4)(b) from page 23 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997) had the power to register the objector for GST and by virtue of s 25(j) of the Acts Interpretation Act to amend the registration date. Facts:A farm was leased by the objector company to an individual (“the father”) and subsequently to a farming partnership comprising the father and his son. The son purchased the farm from the objector on 1 April 1993. The objector company was not GST registered and the rental charged to the partnership was below the GST registration threshold. The son claimed a second- hand goods input credit of $98,333.33. The Commissioner obtained a valuation of the open market rental of the prop- erty which was substantially in excess of the registration threshold. The Commis- sioner registered the objector for GST as from 1 February 1994 and later amended the date of registration to 1 October 1986. Decision:The TRA preferred the Commissioner’s evidence as to the property’s open market rental and found that a deduction for weed control costs should not be taken off the stock unit price (the rental is based on the stock unit price and the number of stock) as it is already taken into account. His Honour further found that rates could form part of the consideration for supply and should be added to rental to ascertain the value of the lease supplied. Furthermore, weed and pest control costs imposed on the lessee under a lease were found to constitute consideration for the supply of the lease in determining the value of the supply and whether it exceeds the registration threshold. The TRA held that the Commissioner had properly re-exercised his determina- tion of the date of registration. Section 25(j) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1924 gave the Commissioner power under s 51(4)(b) to exercise the power as often as necessary to correct an error or omission notwithstanding that the power is not in general capable of being exercised from time to time. Marketing and selling of timeshare holidays – not zero-rated Case:Malololailai Interval Holidays NZ Ltd v CIR Decision date:11 February 1997 Act:Goods and Services Act 1985 - section 11(2)(b) Keywords: Marketing and selling time-shares, zero-rated, input tax credit Summary:The Court held that the objector was entitled to GST input tax credits as the marketing and selling of time-share holidays by another company was not directly in connection with the land or any improvement thereto and should not be zero rated in terms of s 11(2)(b). Facts:The objector is a GST registered company in the business of selling time-share holidays. Under a “timeshare holiday” agreement, purchasers acquire a right to occupy an accommodation unit at the Malololailai Lagoon Resort. Accent Holidays Limited (“AHL”) a GST registered company with shareholders in common with the objector was responsible for the marketing and sale of the timeshare holidays. Proceeds from the sale of a “timeshare holiday” were paid into a trust account, and upon AHL’s authority were forwarded to the objector. AHL charged the objector commission fees. The objector claimed input tax credits on the marketing and selling services supplied by AHL while all “timeshare holiday” sales were zero-rated. The Com- missioner disallowed the input tax credit on the basis that the supplies by AHL should have been zero-rated under section 11(2)(b). continued on page 26 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997) Decision:The Court held that the marketing and selling of the time-shares by AHL was not “directly in connection with the land or any improvement thereto” as re- quired by s 11(2)(b). His Honour found the contractual transaction between the objector and the purchaser of an interval holiday fell within the description. The Court held that the marketing and sale of the timeshare holidays was one step removed from the direct transaction between the objector and the pur- chaser. Consequently, the Court held that the objector company was entitled to GST input tax credits as the services provided by AHL were not zero-rated. from page 25 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997) Booklets available from Inland Revenue This list shows all of Inland Revenue’s information booklets as at the date of this Tax Information Bulletin.
