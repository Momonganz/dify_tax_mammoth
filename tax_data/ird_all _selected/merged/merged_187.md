Clauses from the Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2024 • 35- Section RD 10 amended (Amounts of tax for PAYE income payments) • 36- Section RD 17 amended (Payment of extra pay with other PAYE income payments) • 38 -Schedule 2 amended (Basic tax rates for PAYE income payments) 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 3 Student Loans The student loan repayment rate (standard deduction rate) for all New Zealand-based borrowers is 12%. For a student loan borrower, the following student loan deductions are made: • For main employment income, a deduction of the standard deduction rate from the gross income over the pay period repayment threshold ($464 per week) should be made. • For secondary employment income, a deduction of the standard deduction rate from the gross income should be made. Other areas to note for student loans: Unused Repayment Threshold Special Deduction Rate (URT SDR): • If a borrower has more than one employer at the same time, and gross income from main employment is below the pay period repayment threshold, the borrower can apply to IR for an URT SDR to have the “unused” portion of the pay period threshold allocated to secondary employers. • For an URT SDR, the borrower is still required to use a “SL” repayment code (unless they also have a tailored tax code, in which case “STC” is the code to be used). • Depending on the amount of unused repayment threshold, the Student Loan deduction rate advised on the certificate could be anything from 0% to 11%. Repayment Deduction Exemption (RDE): • Borrowers who are studying full-time and expect their income for the year to be under the annual repayment threshold are eligible to apply for an RDE. • For the period of time an RDE is in effect, the borrower is exempt from having Student Loan deductions made from their salary and wages and does not have to use an “SL” repayment code. Therefore, the Student Loan deductions are 0%. Commissioner deductions (SLCIR): • In the EI, the ‘SLCIR deductions’ field should be used for Commissioner deductions. • Commissioner deductions are extra deductions and may be required if the Student Loan standard deductions were less than the amount that should have been deducted. • IR will notify the borrower and employer if Commissioner deductions are required to be made. • Notification will specify the amount to be recovered, and the percentage to be deducted until that amount has been reached. • The maximum rate will be 5% on gross income (over the pay period repayment threshold) for primary employment earnings. • For secondary income this will be 5% on the gross payment of salary or wages. Example: How to calculate the compulsory extra deductions Employer receives a student loan compulsory extra deduction notice for their employee (who is using the M SL tax code) asking them to make the extra deductions at 5% of gross earnings over the pay period repayment threshold. The formula for calculating compulsory extra deductions is: Compulsory extra deduction = (gross earnings – pay period repayment threshold) x 5.00% 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The employee is paid weekly so their deductions for November 2024 will be as follows: Week Gross earnings Student loan compulsory extra deduction Calculation Note: truncate gross earnings to whole dollars 1 $875.90 $20.55 ($875 - $464) x 5.00% = $20.55 2 $960.00 $24.80 ($960 - $464) x 5.00% = $24.80 3 $425.35 $0.00 Gross earnings less than repayment threshold so no compulsory extra deduction required 4 $956.80 $24.60 ($956 - $464) x 5.00% = $24.60 Voluntary deductions (SLBOR): • In the EI, the ‘SLBOR deductions’ field should be used for voluntary deductions. • Borrower deductions are extra deductions that can be requested by employees wishing to pay more towards their Student loan. • The amount, or percentage, to be deducted is determined by the borrower. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4 KiwiSaver No changes are required to existing paper or electronic Employment Information returns as the existing field Net KiwiSaver Employer Contributions will be used to record the total of voluntary and compulsory employer contributions. KiwiSaver members can make a contribution of 3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10% of their wages. They may change their contribution rate at any time by advising their employer. The default contribution rate is 3% if no rate is elected. 4.1 Employers who must contribute to member savings Employers with employees who contribute to KiwiSaver schemes and/or complying funds must make Compulsory Employer Contributions (CEC). For KiwiSaver purposes, CEC must start from: • the first pay after an employee starts new employment, or • the first pay after the employer receives notice from IR or the employee that they have become a member of a KiwiSaver scheme. The minimum Compulsory Employer Contribution for pay periods commencing on or after 1 April 2013 is 3%. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4.2 Employers who need not contribute to member savings Employers do not need to contribute to KiwiSaver and Complying Funds as well as other schemes if an employee belongs to several schemes (if certain requirements are met). An employee who belongs to a Registered Superannuation Scheme (RSS) or Complying Fund may also join a KiwiSaver scheme. Employers are not required to make compulsory contributions if they already contribute to a scheme on behalf of the member (if certain conditions are met). To avoid employers being forced to contribute more than once, any employer contribution to an RSS, Complying Fund or KiwiSaver scheme may qualify as compulsory employer contributions if, as per section 101D(5) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006: 1. employer superannuation contributions (the contributions) are made to a registered superannuation scheme (the contributions scheme); and the contributions scheme was registered before 17 May 2007, or the contributions scheme is one (a succeeding scheme) for which there is, due to all relevant members transferring to the succeeding scheme by virtue of section 9BAA of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989, a prior registered superannuation scheme (a prior scheme) and that prior scheme or another prior scheme for the contributions scheme were registered before 17 May 2007; and the employer provided access for employees generally to the contributions scheme or a prior scheme for the contributions scheme before 17 May 2007; and the employee is - 1. employed by the employer before 1 April 2008, and the employer makes or has agreed with the employee to make employer superannuation contributions for the employee before 1 April 2008 to the contributions scheme or a prior scheme for the contributions scheme; or 2. covered by a collective agreement that is in force before 17 May 2007 and expires after 1 April 2008 3. someone who has had contributions paid or credited to the contributions scheme or a prior scheme for the contributions scheme by a previous employer, and those contributions met the requirements described in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 above. Employer contributions which satisfy the paragraphs above, must also vest completely in the employee no later than 5 years after the employee joins the contributions scheme. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Employer contributions to an RSS scheme, which meets the requirements listed above, count towards the compulsory employer contribution, even if the scheme does not have similar lock- in rules to Complying Funds or KiwiSaver schemes. This policy prevents an employer being forced to contribute twice, once because an employee belongs to an RSS, which requires employer contributions and a second time because the same employee joins a KiwiSaver scheme or complying fund. If an employee is a member of a defined benefit scheme, their employer is not liable to pay CEC for that or any other scheme that employee may belong to. The table below summarises employer obligations where employees belong to several superannuation schemes: Contribution Type CEC implications Defined Benefit Fund If an employee is a member of a defined benefit scheme, there are no CEC obligations in regards to that employee Registered Superannuation Scheme No CEC requirements for these but contributions to RSS can offset other CEC liabilities. See formula below Complying Fund CEC applies KiwiSaver Scheme CEC applies CEC = (payment of gross salary or wages x CEC rate) – other contributions 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4.3 Definition of Salary and Wages for KiwiSaver purposes 4.3.1 Gross salary and wages The definition of gross salary and wages for KiwiSaver purposes includes: • bonuses • commissions • gratuities • overtime payments, and • any other remuneration of any kind. The following payments to employees are specifically excluded from the definition of salary and wages for KiwiSaver purposes, and as such an employer contribution is optional. • Redundancy payments • Reasonable employer provided accommodation or accommodation allowances • Actual costs reimbursed for allowances or expenses relating to living outside New Zealand • Payments made under the Voluntary Bonding Schemes administered by the Ministry for Primary Industries, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Education. • Employee Share Schemes Gross base salary and wages are used to determine the amount of employer deductions and compulsory employer contributions (CECs) for members of a complying fund scheme. Refer to the Glossary section of the KiwiSaver Employer Guide for the full definition of gross salary and wages. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 13 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4.3.2 KiwiSaver - Employees under 18 and over 65 New and existing employees under 18 can only join KiwiSaver by choosing and contacting directly a KiwiSaver scheme provider. Once an employee under 18 is accepted by the scheme provider and the employee has nominated their employer, lR will notify their employer and request they start deducting the employee KiwiSaver contributions. IR will provide the contribution rate for the employee, their name and IRD number. New and existing employees 65 and over can join KiwiSaver by choosing and contacting directly a KiwiSaver scheme provider or join by completing a KS2 KiwiSaver deduction form with their employer. The KS2 form will indicate the rate of deductions from an employee’s salary/wage. Deductions of employee KiwiSaver contributions are based on the following: • For under 18 or over 65 employees, employers need to deduct employee contributions. • Employers are not required to make CECs on behalf of employees under 18 or over 65. • Any KiwiSaver employer contributions made to employees under 18 or over 65 are voluntary employer contributions. Note: With the removal of the tax credit for children under the age of 18, they are now liable for PAYE deductions and if they are an existing KiwiSaver member, they are also required to have KiwiSaver employee contributions. If you have an employee who turns 18 while working for you, you do not need to take any additional action unless specifically requested by the employee, though you are required to begin making CECs on their behalf if they are a member. 4.3.3 CEC Validations The following validation will occur in Inland Revenue systems and if failed, will cause the employer’s EI return to be queried unless there is an existing arrangement to overlook specific CEC validations: • If the employee is making KiwiSaver or complying fund deductions, the compulsory employer contributions must be at least 3% of the employee’s gross income. The amount shown on the EI will always be the employer's contribution less any tax withheld (i.e. the net amount). 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5 Calculation Details This section provides the table of tax codes (immediately below in section 5.1) and the details of the calculations required for specific tax codes (section 5.2 onwards).

If the NSW tax code is used, then the EI line for the employee cannot contain: • KiwiSaver contributions • Student Loan Repayments As a non-resident the worker is not eligible to enrol in KiwiSaver, nor are they subject to student loan repayments. Child Support payments can be deducted. The flat rate of 10.5% also applies to extra pay. This is applicable to PAYE income payments made from 01 April 2016 for non-resident seasonal workers with the NSW tax code. For example: Mike contracted as fruit packer for ten weeks at $25/hour with NSW tax code. His final gross pay on the tenth week is $1,000 with $800 being the 8% holiday pay. Mike will receive net earnings of $703.20 holiday pay on top of his final pay. This is based on 10.5% tax rate and 1.60% ACC earners levy deducted which is $96.80. If Mike’s employer applied the normal extra pay rate rules of 17.5% then Mike would have only received net earnings of $647.76 based on a deduction of $152.24. Please note: Non-resident seasonal workers under the recognised seasonal employer (RSE) rules have a tax code of NSW for the first month of a period of employment in New Zealand After the first month of employment, then the usual rules for tax codes apply as per Tax Administration Act 1994 section 24B PAYE tax codes. If the employee hasn’t provided a completed IR330 within that first month then the no-notification rate should apply until they provide the tax code declaration. Note: that it is also legally possible for the Commissioner to advise the employer which tax code should be used, after that first month period has passed. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 22 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Sequence Task Associated Rules 1 Calculate employee’s pay amount for pay period. 2 Truncate pay period amount to whole dollars, $457.89 becomes $457. 3 Calculate amounts to be deducted.

Student loan deductions will take into consideration the repayment threshold – the flat rate will be on income above the repayment threshold. The tailored tax code/special deduction rate certificate (IR 23) shows a figure to deduct PAYE at the rate of XX cents per dollar. (XX =>rate on certificate) This amount includes earner’s levy of 1.60%. Note: The tailored tax code/deduction rate can only be used if the certificate covers the period (or parts of the period) 01/04/2024 to 31/03/2025 or longer. Special tax rates, including for schedular payments (tax code WT), can be an amount from zero to 100 cents per dollar. Where the person also has a student loan the certificate will provide the deduction rate to deduct student loan deductions. This will be anything from 0% – 12%. Where the employment is the main employment, the rate will apply to income above the pay period repayment threshold, e.g. $464 per week. Where the income is from secondary employment the threshold will not apply. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 29 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.9.1 Schedular Payment Provisions Student loan deductions, KiwiSaver deductions and contributions and the ACC Earners’ Levy do not apply to schedular payments (tax code WT). Most contractors can elect their own WT tax rate (no lower than 10%), which means they will not need to apply for a tailored tax code. However, there may be scenarios where the WT rate needs to be lower than 10% so a tailored tax code certificate will still be necessary.

Multiply pay period amount by the PAYE rate on IR 23. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 30 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.9.2 Special Deduction Rate (SDR) and Tailored Tax Codes (STC) A borrower may have a special deduction rate (SDR) applied to their salary or wage income. This can be used where the borrower is in hardship, or where they have more than one job and earn under the pay period repayment threshold in their main job. A SDR is any standard deduction rate less than 12 cents in every dollar. No SDR can be greater than 12 cents in every dollar. A borrower wanting deductions of more than 12 cents in every dollar should be using SLBOR – see 3.2 above. The SDR cannot be applied retrospectively. Borrowers will be provided with a Special Deduction Rate certificate which they provide to their employer. The certificate will continue to advise which tax code/SL repayment code (e.g. S SL) the employer should use, the rate at which the SL deductions are to be made, and the period that the SDR should apply to. The SDR will be a whole percentage only (e.g. 3% or 3 cents in the dollar), calculated to two decimal places (e.g. $0.03). The Special Deduction Rate Certificate may or may not require the pay period threshold to be used. For some tax codes the correct treatment can be inferred- e.g. "M SL" and "S SL" codes provide sufficient information as to whether or not the threshold is to be used. If the employee’s tailored tax code certificate expires and employer has not received either a replacement tailored tax code certificate or a new IR330/330C the employee tax rate would revert to the tax code specified on the previous IR330/IR330C provided to the employer. Where the employee has not previously provided an IR330/IR330C, then the employee would be placed on the No Notification tax rate until such time as an IR330/IR330C or tailored tax code certificate is provided. Special deduction rate and SLCIR – If an SDR is granted to a borrower, the Commissioner will cancel any SLCIRs that a borrower may have, regardless of employer. Special Deduction Rate and SLBOR – If a borrower currently has an SDR rate of 8 cents in every dollar for their secondary employment and also has additional deductions using the SLBOR repayment code of a set amount of $20.00 a week, the borrower would have standard deductions using a SL repayment code (e.g. S SL) at 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 31 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the rate of 8 cents in every dollar, and in addition has an extra $20 deducted for student loan using the SL repayment code SLBOR. Borrowers can continue to apply for a tailored tax code in respect of income tax. Where the borrower is entitled to reduced income tax and SL deductions, a Tailored Tax Code Certificate will be issued. The certificate will continue to advise employers to use the tailored tax code, the rate at which income tax should be deducted, the rate for SL deductions, and the period that the certificate should apply to. The following examples show what happens when a borrower has a Tailored tax code or Special Deduction Rate. Example One The borrower has been granted a tailored tax code due to hardship and has reduced SL and tax rates for the full year. The tailored tax code is valid from 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025, with tax at a flat 20% rate and SL deductions at 8 cents in every dollar. The tailored tax code certificate will state: • that the applicable period is the whole year (1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025) • that the STC tax code must be used • that the amount of tax will be calculated at 20% of earnings • that SL deductions will be calculated at 8 cents in every dollar, but note: o if this is the borrower’s main income SL deductions will be 8 cents in every dollar above the repayment threshold, which is 8 cents in every dollar of earnings in excess of $464 per week. o if this is their secondary employment, then SL deductions will be 8 cents of every dollar. o the certificate will state which of these scenarios applies. Example Two A borrower applies for a Special Deduction Rate (SDR) for their secondary employment, because they have an unused repayment threshold from their main employment. They do not currently have a reduced rate for tax. The SDR certificate will state: • that the SDR period is from 1 July 2024 to 30 September 2024 • that the tax code is S SL (or appropriate secondary employment SL) tax code • that SL deductions will be at the rate of 8 cents in every dollar (must be for every dollar of earnings as this is secondary income). In addition, the SDR certificate will state: 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 32 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • that from 1 October 2024 to 31 March 2025 the tax code will be SSL (or other secondary employment SL code) • that SL deductions will be at the rate of 12 cents in every dollar of earnings (must be for every dollar as this is secondary income). Example Three A borrower has an SDR in place for their second job, applicable from 1 July 2024 to 30 September 2024. They then apply for a reduced tax rate for that job. The original Special Deduction Rate certificate (see example two above) will be replaced with a Tailored Tax Code certificate. In this example the Tailored Tax Code certificate applies from 2 August 2024. The tailored tax code certificate would state - • for the period 2 August 2024 to 30 September 2024: o the tax code will be STC o tax will be calculated at the rate of 18 cents in every dollar of earnings o SL deductions will be at the rate of 8 cents in every dollar (as this is secondary employment it will be 8 cents of every dollar earned, and the certificate will make this clear). • for the period 1 October 2024 – 31 March 2025: o the tax code will be STC o tax will be calculated at rate of 18 cents of every dollar o SL deductions will be at the standard rate of 12 cents of every dollar (as this is secondary employment it will be 12 cents of every dollar earned, and the certificate will make this clear). 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 33 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example: Special Deduction Rate (certificate) Student loan special deduction rate certificate Inland Revenue PO Box 39050 Lower Hutt 5010 Date of issue: 15 March 2024 Telephone 0800-999-999 IRD Number 123-456-789 Certificate number DLN number This certificate is valid from 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025. Dear: ABC Employer For your employee James Smith, IRD number 123-456-789, you are authorised to: From 1 April 2024 to 30 June 2024 • use tax code SSL • make student loan deductions at the special deduction rate of 8 cents in each dollar of gross income. From 1 July 2024 to 31 March 2025 • use tax code SSL • make student loan deductions at the standard deduction rate from each dollar of gross income. This replaces any other student loan special deduction rate or repayment deduction exemption certificate we have issued previously for the same period for the above employee. Your employee must give you a new certificate when this one expires. If they do not, you will need to make student loan deductions at the standard deduction rate from each dollar of gross income. Please keep this certificate with your employee's wage records.

A borrower who is a full-time student, earning above the pay period repayment threshold, but below the annual repayment threshold, may be eligible to be exempt from SL repayment deductions. This means they do not also use the SL repayment code in combination with their tax code. The exemption cannot be applied retrospectively. If the borrower is exempt, Inland Revenue will provide the borrower with an exemption certificate, which they provide to their employer(s). The certificate will advise that they are not required to have SL deductions, which tax code (e.g. M instead of MSL) they should use, and the period for which the exemption will apply. The certificate will also provide instructions as to which tax code should be applied when the exemption ceases – e.g. MSL. Refer: Employer’s guide IR335 – page 8. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 35 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.10 Employee Share Schemes (ESS) Employers are able to tax benefits of an employee share scheme as an extra pay. It is not compulsory to do so, and employers can choose to withhold PAYE on an employee-by- employee basis and on a benefit-by-benefit basis for each employee. Note: When using the Employment Information return (EI) with the header record indicator HEI2, the taxable value of the benefit is to be shown in the Employee Share Scheme field. ESS benefits are to be shown on the EI except in the following circumstances; • share benefit arises from an exempt employee share scheme; or • the employer has elected not to make deductions from a share benefit provided to a former employee. The value of an ESS benefit is included as income for the purposes of: • Student loan deductions, • Child support payments, and • Working for Families tax credits However, ESS benefits are not liable for: • KiwiSaver deductions or employer contributions • the ACC Earners’ Levy The value of the ESS benefit is determined on the share scheme taxing date. The share scheme taxing date is the earlier of the date when: • the benefits are either transferred to a non-associated person or cancelled; or • the employee owns the shares as any other shareholder would without the terms of employment affecting the status of the ownership or value. Unless a share scheme beneficiary first transfers their share scheme benefits to a non- associate, or the company cancels them, the share scheme taxing date is when: • there is no material risk that beneficial ownership of the shares will change, or that the shares will be required to be transferred or cancelled; • the employee is not entitled to be compensated for a fall in the value of the shares; and • there is no material risk that there will be a change in the terms of the shares affecting their value. Example 1: - Simple vesting period Acme Limited (Acme) transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trust to hold for their employee, Alice. Alice only receives the shares from the trust if she stays employed by Acme for at least 3 years and she receives no benefit from or ownership of the shares if she leaves before 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] then. As the risk that Alice will leave the employment of Acme within the 3 years is material the share scheme taxing date is the date that Alice reaches 3 years employment with Acme. Example 2: - Vesting subject to misconduct Acme Limited transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trust to hold for their employee, Bob. Bob receives the shares 3 years after they are transferred to the trust as long as he is not dismissed for serious misconduct in this time. Bob will still be entitled to the shares if he ceases employment with 3 years as long as the employment is not ceased due to serious misconduct, so the share scheme taxing date is the date the shares are transferred to the trust as there is little risk that Bob will lose his entitlement to the shares. The taxable value of the ESS benefit must be reported based on the 20 th day after the share scheme taxing date. There are two methods an employer can use to determine when the taxable value of ESS benefit needs to be reported. Option 1 • If the 20th day falls between the 1st and 15th of a month the information must be reported treating the 15th as the payday. • If the 20th day falls between the 16th and the end of a month the information must be reported treating the last day of the month as the payday. Option 2 The employer can treat the 20th day as the payday and report the value of the ESS benefit to us more regularly. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 37 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 3 – Employee Share Scheme ESS (employer deducts PAYE) Treat the ESS benefits as lump sum payments, also known as extra pay. You do not need to deduct KiwiSaver or pay ACC Earners’ Levy. If your employee agrees, you can sell some shares to pay any tax owing. The employee has a tax code of M SL and receives a 4-weekly salary of $3,500.00. They contribute to KiwiSaver at 3% and have an ESCT rate of 17.5%. The ESS benefit (extra pay) is $2,500, and the gross earnings for the last four weeks were $3,500 – The last four weeks’ income $3,500 x 13 = annual income $45,500 The total earnings $45,500 + extra pay $2,500 amounts to $48,000 The tax rate applied to the extra pay is 17.5% 17.5% \* $2,500 = $437.50 Completing the EI (with header record indicator HEI2): Employee Tax Code M SL Gross earnings and/or schedular payments $3,500.00 Prior period gross adjustments $0.00 Earnings and / or schedular payments not liable for ACC Earners’ Levy $2,500.00 Lump sum (extra pay) indicator 0 PAYE / tax $1,030.58 1,021.98 Prior period PAYE adjustments $0.00 Child support deductions $0.00 Student loan deductions $497.28 SLCIR deductions $0.00 SLBOR deductions $0.00 KiwiSaver deductions $105.00 Net KiwiSaver employer contributions $86.63 ESCT deducted $18.37 Tax credits for payroll donations $0.00 Family tax credits $0.00 Employee Share Scheme $2,500.00 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 4 – Employee Share Scheme (ESS) (employer does not deduct PAYE) The employee has a tax code of M SL and receives a 4-weekly salary of $3,500.00. They contribute to KiwiSaver at 3% and have an ESCT rate of 17.5%. The ESS benefit (extra pay) is $2,500, but the employer has chosen not to deduct PAYE, so no calculation is necessary for PAYE or Student Loan. Completing the EI (with header record indicator HEI2): Employee Tax Code M SL Gross earnings and/or schedular payments $3,500.00 Prior period gross adjustments $0.00 Earnings and / or schedular payments not liable for ACC Earners’ Levy $2,500.00 Lump sum (extra pay) indicator 0 PAYE / tax $593.08 $584.48 Prior period PAYE adjustments $0.00 Child support deductions $0.00 Student loan deductions $197.28 SLCIR deductions $0.00 SLBOR deductions $0.00 KiwiSaver deductions $105.00 Net KiwiSaver employer contributions $86.63 ESCT deducted $18.37 Tax credits for payroll donations $0.00 Family tax credits $0.00 Employee Share Scheme $2,500.00 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 39 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.11 Extra pay (Lump Sum) - Primary income Note: 1. The extra pay payment calculation applies to the rates codes EDW and CAE and ND. 2. The employee can notify their employer to choose a higher tax rate. Refer to section RD 10(2). PAYE and Student Loan calculations 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 40 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Extra pay (Lump Sum) – PAYE calculations – Primary Income Sequence Task Associated Rules 1 Determine Tax code 2 Calculate Student Loan deduction. Tax code = M SL, ME SL, or STC 2.1 Calculate pay for pay period, including normal pay and extra pay Include lump sum payments which are paid as annual or special bonuses, retiring or redundancy payments, gratuities or back pay. Exclude non-taxable amounts. This amount (normal pay plus extra pay) is referred to as “pay for the pay period” below. 2.2 Truncate pay for the pay period (ie before Student loan deduction) amount to whole dollars, $457.89 becomes $457. 2.3 Calculate student loan deductions. No special deduction rate certificate. If the pay for the pay period is less than student loan pay period repayment threshold, then the deduction is $0.00. If the pay for the pay period is more than the student loan pay period repayment threshold the calculation is: pay for the pay period minus the SL repayment threshold x 12%. If the borrower is on a tailored tax code the threshold may or may not apply - this will be clarified on the certificate. If a borrower has provided a special deduction rate certificate. If the pay for the pay period is less than student loan pay period repayment threshold, then the deduction is $0.00. If the pay for the pay period is more than student loan pay period repayment threshold the calculation is: pay for the pay period minus the SL repayment threshold x SDR rate. NB If the extra pay amount is not paid at the same time as the normal pay and the pay for the pay period cannot be calculated then multiply the entire extra pay amount by the appropriate student loan deduction rate. Eg 12% or SDR rate 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 41 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Sequence Task Associated Rules 2.3.1 Tailored Tax Code (STC) If a bonus is paid to an employee who has a tailored tax code, deduct tax at the rate shown on the certificate. For retiring or redundancy payments deduct tax at the tailored tax code rate (excluding ACC Earners’ Levy). The payment should be marked as “Earnings not liable for ACC Earners’ Levy” on the EI to avoid the ACC Earners’ Levy being forwarded to ACC. For example, a tailored tax code rate of 24% would be deducted at 22.40% (24%-1.60%) for retiring or redundancy payments. 2.4 Truncate amount to whole cents e.g. $45.789 becomes $45.78. If tax is calculated using a tailored tax code rate, sequence ends at this step. 3 Calculate PAYE 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 42 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Sequence Task Associated Rules 3.1 Calculate annualised income then add extra pay amount Identify the value of the PAYE income payments made in the four weeks prior to, and inclusive of the day on which the extra pay is paid. Note: Do not include any other amounts of extra pay that may have been made in that 4- week period. If in the four weeks prior, the employee was paid: - Four one-weekly pays – total of the four pays and multiply by 13 - Two fortnightly pays – total of the two pays and multiply by 13 - One four-weekly pays - multiply the amount by 13 - One monthly pay - multiply the amount by 12 In other circumstances, add all PAYE income payments made to the employee in the four weeks prior and multiply by 13. This amount is the annualised income. Add the amount of the extra pay to the annualised income to get the grossed-up amount. Example Pay period weekly at $1,000 per week with an extra pay of $500 included with the latest pay In the past four weeks (inclusive of this pay) the employee has had four weekly pays totalling $4,000 (exclude this extra pay $500). Multiply this by 13 X $4,000 = $52,000 Then add the extra pay $500 The Grossed-up amount = $52,500 Note: When a payment is made outside the normal pay cycle, the 4-week period ends on the day the payment is made. 3.2 Drop cents from the grossed-up amount (truncate to whole dollars), e.g. $14,000.90 becomes $14,000. 3.3 Determine Tax rate 3.4 If the employee has elected to have extra pays deducted at a higher rate, the tax rate is either 17.5%, 30%, 33% or 39% whichever they have elected. 3.5 If the grossed-up amount is greater than $180,000. Tax rate is 39%. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Sequence Task Associated Rules 3.5a If the grossed-up amount is greater than $70,000 but less or equal to $180,000. Tax rate is 33%. Note: They can elect to deduct at 39%. 3.6 If the grossed-up amount is greater than $48,000 but less or equal to $70,000. Tax rate is 30%. Note: They can elect to deduct at 39% or 33%. 3.7 If the grossed-up amount is greater than $14,000 but less than or equal to $48,000. Tax rate is 17.5%. Note: They can elect to deduct at 39%, 33% or 30%. 3.8 If the grossed-up amount is less than or equal to $14,000. Tax rate is 10.5% Note: They can elect to deduct at 39%, 33%, 30% or 17.5%. 3.9 If tax rate was 10.5%. Record a flag showing extra pay deducted at the lowest rate. This would require a tick on the printed EI and a ‘1’ on the electronic file. 3.10 Calculate tax amounts to be deducted. 3.11 Multiply the extra pay amount by the tax rate determined. From step above– will be 10.5%, 17.5%, 30%, 33% or 39%. Do not round this figure. 4 Calculate ACC Earners’ Levy. 4.1 If the extra pay is redundancy, retirement allowance or Employee Share Scheme benefit. ACC Earners’ Levy is $0.00. 4.2 If the grossed-up amount does not exceed $142,283 ACC Earners’ Levy is the extra pay multiplied by 1.60%. 4.3 If the annualised income does not exceed $142,283, and the grossed-up amount exceeds $142,283 ACC Earners’ Levy is $142,283 minus the annualised income, multiplied by 1.60%. Please refer to example 1 below. Do not round this figure. 4.4 If the annualised income exceeds $142,283 ACC Earners’ Levy on the extra pay is $0.00. Please refer to example 2 below. 5 Calculate total tax to be deducted. 5.1 Add ACC Earners’ Levy and tax deducted. Do not round this figure. 5.2 Truncate amount to whole cents. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 44 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 1 If a bonus payment is $15,000.56 and the gross earnings for the last four weeks were 10,000: The last four weeks’ income $10,000 x 13 = annualised income $130,000. The total earnings $130,000 + bonus $15,000.56 = grossed up amount $145,000.56 The maximum ACC Earners’ Levy threshold is $142,283 The bonus payment means the grossed-up amount is in excess of ACC Earners’ Levy threshold, therefore: ACC Earners’ Levy on the lump sum is to be calculated as follows - ($142,283 - 130,000) x 1.60% = $196.52 In this example the tax to be deducted from the lump sum would be at 33% since the grossed- up amount exceeds $70,000 giving $4,950.18 (15,000.56 lump sum amount) \*33% applicable rate) + ACC Earners’ Levy $196.52= $5,146.70 Note: Cents are not removed from bonus payment and final figure will not be rounded. Example 2 – If a bonus payment is $15,000 and the gross earnings for the last four weeks were $15,000 - The last four weeks’ income $15,000 x 13 = annualised income $195,000. The total earnings $195,000 + bonus $15,000 = grossed up amount $210,000. The maximum ACC Earners’ Levy threshold is $142,283. The annualised income is in excess of the ACC Earners’ Levy threshold, so the bonus payment is not liable for ACC Earners’ Levy In this example the tax to be deducted from the lump sum would be at 39% since the grossed- up amount exceeds $180,000 giving $5,850 (15,000.00 lump sum amount) \*39% applicable rate) + ACC Earners’ Levy $0 = $5,850 Example 3 – If a redundancy payment is $70,000, a final pay leave payment is $15,000 and the gross earnings for the last four weeks were $5,000 – The last four weeks’ income of $5,000 x 13 = annualised income of $65,000 The total earnings are $65,000 + $70,000 extra pay + $15,000 extra pay = grossed up amount of $150,000 The $70,000 redundancy payment is not liable for ACC Earners’ Levy Portion of grossed up amount liable for ACC Earners’ Levy is $80,000 The maximum ACC Earners’ Levy threshold is $142,283 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 45 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The grossed-up amount which is liable for ACC is below the ACC Earners’ Levy threshold, therefore: ACC Earners’ Levy on the lump sum is to be calculated as follows – $15,000 x 1.60% = $240.00 In this example the tax to be deducted from the total lump sum would be at 33% since the grossed-up amount of $150,000 ($65,000 + $15,000 + $70,000) exceeds $70,000. This amounts to $28,050 ($85,000 total lump sum amount\*33% applicable rate) + ACC Earners’ Levy $240.00 = $28,290.00 Note: Cents are not removed from bonus payment and final figure will not be rounded. Example 4 – Extra pay is paid outside the standard pay period The employee has a tax code of M SL and receives a fortnightly salary of $1,128.00. They received a one-off bonus of $1,000 on 5 September. They receive a redundancy payment of $7,500 with their normal pay on 5 October. The calculation would look like this: Fortnightly gross wages $1,128 Four weekly gross wages $2,256 Multiplied by 13 $29,328 Plus, the redundancy payment $7,500 Annualised income plus redundancy pay $36,828 Tax rate to be applied to the redundancy payment 17.5% The student loan deduction would be calculated as follows: Fortnightly gross income $1,128 Plus, redundancy payment $7,500 Total payment for the fortnight $8,628 Minus fortnightly pay period threshold $928 Total $7,700 Student loan deductions (12% of $7,700) $924 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] However, in another scenario, the employee asks that the redundancy payment be made as soon as possible. The employer agrees to this and pays the redundancy payment on 28 September. In this case the calculation would look like this: Fortnightly gross wages $1,128 Four-weekly pays gross (Do not include $1,000 bonus payment in the gross) $2,256 Multiplied by 13 $29,328 Plus, the bonus payment $7,500 Annualised income plus extra pay $36,828 Tax rate to be applied to the redundancy payment 17.5% As the extra pay is not associated with a regular pay period, no regular student loan repayment threshold applies, and student loan deductions are calculated at 12% of the extra pay. Redundancy pay $7,500 Student loan deductions (12% of $7,500) $900.00 Example 5 - Signing bonus: The employee has a tax code of M and will receives a fortnightly salary of $1,128.00. They received a one-off Signing bonus of $10,000 on 5 September before commencing employment. Fortnightly gross wages $0.00 The bonus payment $10,000 Annualised income plus extra pay $10,000 Tax rate to be applied to the signing on bonus 10.5% The annualised income does come from previous amounts paid, so if no previous payments have been made then the annualised income will be zero. So, the default tax rate is based only on the amount of the extra pay. Note- the employee can notify their employer to choose a higher tax rate. Refer to section RD 10(2). 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 47 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.12 Extra pay (Lump Sum) - Secondary Income PAYE and student loan calculation 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 48 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Sequence Task Associated Rules 1 Determine tax code 2 Calculate Student Loan deduction. Tax code = S SL, SB SL, SH SL, & ST SL, SA SL 2.1 Calculate pay for pay period. Include lump sum payments which are paid as annual or special bonuses, retiring or redundancy payments, gratuities or back pay. Exclude non- taxable amounts. This amount is referred to as “pay for the pay period” below. 2.2 Truncate pay period amount to whole dollars, $457.89 becomes $457. 2.3 Calculate student loan deductions. No special deduction rate certificate. Multiply pay for the pay period amount by 12%. If a borrower has provided a special deduction rate certificate. Multiply pay for the pay period amount by the percentage provided on the certificate. 2.3.1 Tailored Tax Code (STC) If a bonus is paid to an employee who has a tailored tax code, deduct tax at the rate shown on the certificate. For retiring or redundancy payments deduct tax at the tailored tax code rate (excluding ACC Earners’ Levy). The payment should be marked as “Earnings not liable for ACC Earners’ Levy” on the EI to avoid the ACC Earners’ Levy being forwarded to ACC. For example, a tailored tax code rate of 24% would be deducted at 22.4% (24%-1.6%) for retiring or redundancy payments. 2.4 Truncate amount to whole cents, e.g. $45.789 becomes $45.78. If tax is calculated using a tailored tax code rate, sequence ends at this step. 3 Calculate PAYE. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 49 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Sequence Task Associated Rules 3.1 Calculate annualised amount. Identify the number of salary or wage payments made in the four weeks prior to, and inclusive of the day on which the extra pay is paid. Note: Do not include any other amounts of extra pay that may have been made in that 4 week period. If in the four weeks prior, the employee was paid: - Four one-weekly pays – total of the four pays and multiply by 13 - Two fortnightly pays – total of the two pays and multiply by 13 - One four-weekly pays - multiply the amount by 13 - One monthly pay - multiply the amount by 12 In other circumstances, add all PAYE income payments made to the employee in the four weeks prior and multiply by 13. This amount is the annualised amount. Note: If the employee is paid monthly, but was not paid within the last four weeks, then the annualised amount will be zero. However, the employee can notify their employer to choose a higher tax rate. Refer to section RD 10(2). 3.2 Calculate low threshold amount The low threshold amount is determined by the tax code used by the employee: - If tax code = SB or SB SL then low threshold amount is $0. - If tax code = S or S SL then low threshold amount is $14,001. - If tax code = SH or SH SL then low threshold amount is $48,001. - If tax code = ST or ST SL then low threshold amount is $70,001. - If tax code – SA or SA SL then low threshold amount is $180,001. 3.3 Calculate grossed amount Add the amount of the extra pay to the annualised amount and the low threshold amount. This is the grossed amount. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Sequence Task Associated Rules 3.4 Drop cents from the grossed amount (truncate to whole dollars), e.g. $14,000.90 becomes $14,000. 3.5 Determine Tax rate. 3.6 If the employee has elected to have extra pays deducted at a higher rate, the tax rate is either 17.5%, 30% or 33%, 39% whichever they have elected. 3.6a If the grossed-up amount is greater than $180,000. Tax rate is 39%. 3.7 If the grossed-up amount is greater than $70,000 but less or equal to $180,000. Tax rate is 33%. Note: They can elect to deduct at 39%. 3.8 If the grossed-up amount is greater than $48,000 but less or equal to $70,000. Tax rate is 30%. Note: They can elect to deduct at 39% or 33%. 3.9 If the grossed-up amount is greater than $14,000but less than or equal to $48,000. Tax rate is 17.5%. Note: They can elect to deduct at 39%, 33% or 30%. 3.10 If the grossed-up amount is less than or equal to $14,000. Tax rate is 10.5% Note: They can elect to deduct at 39%, 33%, 30% or 17.5%. 3.11 If tax rate was 10.5%. Record a flag showing extra pay deducted at the low rate. This would require a ‘tick’ on the printed EI and a ‘1’ on the electronic file. 3.12 Calculate tax amounts to be deducted. 3.13 Multiply the extra pay amount by the tax rate determined. From step above– will be 10.5%, 17.5%, 30%, 33% or 39%. Do not round this figure. 4 Calculate Earners Levy. 4.1 If the extra pay is redundancy, retirement allowance or Employee Share Scheme benefit. ACC Earners’ Levy is $0.00. 4.2 If the annualised amount plus the low threshold amount exceeds $142,283 ACC Earners’ Levy on the extra pay is $0.00. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 51 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Sequence Task Associated Rules 4.3 If the grossed amount does not exceed $142,283. ACC Earners’ Levy is 1.60% multiplied by the extra pay. Do not round this figure. 4.4 If the annualised amount plus the low threshold amount is lower than $142,283 but the grossed amount exceeds $142,283. Subtract the annualised amount plus the low threshold amount from $142,283. This is the extra pay liable for ACC. Multiply this amount by the ACC Earner’s levy of 1.6%. Do not round this figure. 5 Calculate total tax to be deducted. 5.1 Add ACC Earners’ Levy and tax deducted. Do not round this figure. 5.2 Truncate amount to whole cents. Example 1 – all of bonus liable for ACC A taxpayer using the SH tax code receives a bonus payment of $1000 and the gross earnings for the last four weeks were $500. • The last four weeks income ($500 x 13) = annualised amount $6,500. • The low threshold amount for the SH tax code is $48,001. • The extra pay $1,000 + the annualised amount $6,500 + low threshold amount $48,0001 = grossed amount $55,001. • The correct tax rate for the bonus would be 30% since the grossed amount is greater than $48,000 and less than $70,000. • ACC Earners’ Levy would be calculated as the bonus $1000 \* 0.016. Example 2 – some of bonus not liable for ACC A taxpayer using the ST tax code receives a bonus payment of $40,000, and in the last two fortnights they have earned $2,695 from their second job ($1300+1395) • The last two fortnights ($1300+1395) = Annualised income $2,695 x 2613 =$35,035 • The low threshold amount for the ST tax code is $70,001 • The extra pay $40,000 + the annualised amount $35,035 + low threshold amount $70,001 = grossed amount of $153,136$145,036. • The correct tax rate for the bonus would be 33% since the grossed amount is greater than $70,000 but equal to or less than $180,000. PAYE on Bonus ($40,000 x 33%) = $13,200 • To calculate ACC Earner’s levy: o The annualised amount plus the low threshold amount is $145,036. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 52 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] o The grossed amount is $145,036.– this is less than exceeds the maximum income liable for ACC amount of $142,283. o $ 145,036 (annualised amount plus low threshold amount) -$142,283 = $2,753 This amount is not liable for the ACC Earner’s Levy. o Part of Bonus liable for ACC $40,000-$2,753= $37,247 o Part of Bonus liable for ACC $37,247\*0.0160 (ACC Earner Levy rate) = $595.95 Their bonus payment will be $40,000 less PAYE of $13,200 and ACC levy of $595.95 that is $26,204.05 paid into their bank account. 5.13 Lump sum payment taxed at the lowest rate If the lowest rate of tax was used in the calculation of the tax on an extra pay amount, the employer will need to enter a tick in the ‘lump sum payment taxed at low rate’ circle on the paper return, enter a ‘1’ on the electronic return or tick the checkbox on the electronic onscreen form. 5.14 Regular bonuses A regular bonus is any bonus paid frequently throughout the year, such as: • monetary incentives • production bonuses Bonuses paid at same time as regular pay Regular bonuses are treated as being part of the salary or wages for the employee for the relevant pay period. Add the regular bonus to the salary/wages for the pay period, then calculate PAYE as usual according to the employee’s tax code. Note: If the employee uses an M SL, ME SL, SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL code, student loan repayments must also be deducted from the bonus. The following steps refer only to PAYE, but the same method applies for employees with student loans. Monthly bonuses covering more than one pay period 1. Add up the gross wages paid for a month’s income, eg if you pay weekly, add the four weekly payments together. 2. Work out the PAYE on the gross wages for the month 3. Add the bonus to the gross wages calculated at step 1 and work out the PAYE for the month on the total. 4. Subtract the PAYE calculated at step 2 from that calculated at step 3. This gives you the PAYE on the bonus. Bonuses covering more than one month 1. Divide the bonus by the number of months it covers. This gives you the monthly bonus 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 53 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] amount. 2. Add the monthly bonus to the normal pay for the month and calculate PAYE. Select monthly in the PAYE calculator. 3. Calculate the PAYE on the normal monthly pay and subtract this amount from the PAYE calculated at step 2 above. This gives you the PAYE on the monthly bonus. 4. Multiply this by the number of months the bonus covers to get the total PAYE to be deducted from the bonus. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 54 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.15 Schedular Payments As per the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017, the following now applies: • Contractors (including companies) hired by labour-hire firms under a labour-hire arrangement have been added as a schedular payment type. • Most contractors are able to elect their own withholding rate, though there are exceptions to this relating to Non-Resident contractors, Non-resident entertainers, and professional sports people. This is done on an IR330c Tax rate notification for contractor's form (follow the link for details of this form: https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/withholding-taxes/schedular- payments). This form specifies that their tax code is WT, and what their elected deduction rate is, which can be between 10 and 100%. • If the contractor provides their name and IRD number but does not or cannot elect a rate, use the table below to determine the standard rate to use, unless they provide a tailored tax code certificate or a certificate of exemption on schedular payments (follow the link for details of this certificate: https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/withholding-taxes/schedular- payments/getting-schedular-payments/certificates-of-exemption-for-schedular-payments). • A schedular payment type for persons wanting to voluntarily have tax deducted from their contractor income has been added. Voluntary schedular payments have a standard rate of 20 cents per dollar of the payment. • The Commissioner is also able to notify the payer of a specific tax rate to be deducted from payments made to a contractor. • The no-notification rate as applicable for WT has been standardised at 45 cents per dollar of the payment. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 55 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.15.1 Rates of tax for schedular payments Activity Standard rate No- notification rate ACC personal service rehabilitation payments (attendant care, home help, childcare, attendant care services related to training for independence and attendant care services related to transport for independence) paid under the Injury Prevention and Rehabilitation Compensation Act 2001. 0.105 0.45 Agricultural contracts for maintenance, development, or other work on farming or agricultural land 0.15 0.45 Agricultural, horticultural, and viticulture contracts by companies and other contractors, including supply of labour for pruning and/or thinning of fruit trees or vines, and picking and/or packing of fruit or grapes 0.15 0.45 Cleaning office, business, institution, or other premises (except residential) or cleaning or laundering plant, vehicles, furniture, etc. 0.20 0.45 Commissions to insurance agents and sub-agents and salespeople 0.20 0.45 Company director’s fees 0.33 0.45 Contracts wholly or substantially for labour only in the building industry 0.20 0.45 Demonstrating goods or appliances 0.25 0.45 Entertainers (New Zealand resident only) such as lecturers, presenters, participants in sporting events, and radio, television, stage and film performers 0.20 0.45 Examiners (fees payable) 0.33 0.45 Forestry or bush work of all kinds, planting, sowing or gathering vegetables, or flax planting or cutting 0.15 0.45 Freelance contributing to newspapers, journals, etc. (articles, photographs, cartoons, etc.) or for radio, television or stage productions 0.25 0.45 Gardening, grass or hedge cutting, or weed or vermin destruction (for an office, business or institution) 0.20 0.45 Honoraria (including payments to Mayors, chairpersons and members of council, boards of trustees, boards, committees and official clubs or societies, etc.) 0.33 0.45 Jockeys’ or drivers’ apprentices 0.15 0.45 Modelling 0.20 0.45 Non-resident contractors who are not companies 1 : • construction work, installation, assembly and similar projects • professional or technical services for such projects • hire of equipment or personnel (other than as employees) 0.15 0.45 Non-resident contractors who are a company 1 0.15 0.20 Non-resident entertainers and professional sports people visiting New Zealand 2 0.20 N/A Payments made to contractors under a labour-hire arrangement, includes payments to individuals and companies. 3 0.20 0.45 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 56 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Activity Standard rate No- notification rate Payments for: • mail contracting • transport of school children • milk delivery • refuse removal, street or road cleaning • Caretaking or acting as a watchman 0.15 0.45 Proceeds from sales of: • eels, greenstone, whitebait, Sphagnum moss (not retail sales) • wild deer, pigs, or goats or parts of these animals 0.25 0.45 Public office holders (fees) 0.33 0.45 Share fishing (on contract for the supply of labour only) 0.20 0.45 Shearing or droving 0.15 0.45 Television, video or film; on-set and off-set production processes (New Zealand residents only) 0.20 0.45 Voluntary schedular payments Other contractors who are not required to have any form of PAYE deductions can, with the agreement of the payer, opt to have payments made to them treated as a schedular payment. 0.20 0.45 1 Non-resident contractors cannot elect below 15% 2 Non-resident entertainers and professional sports people visiting New Zealand cannot elect their own rate.

Schedular payments should not include or be included in earnings as an employee. If paying both normal earnings as an employee and schedular payments, you must record one line on the EI as an employee with normal tax code and one line for the schedular payment with WT code. GST If the payee is GST-registered, exclude deducted GST from the payment before calculating tax on schedular payments. Only the GST exclusive amount has tax on schedular payments deducted. For example, a payment of $115 (GST inclusive) is due to the payee; exclude the GST component of $15. Deduct the tax on schedular payments (e.g. 20%) from the remaining $100 to calculate the net amount excluding GST. The amount on the EI will show Gross $100, tax on schedular payments of $20.00, earnings not liable for EL of $100 and a tax code of WT. Add the amount of GST back to the net amount to calculate the net payment to the payee (e.g., $80 net amount plus $15 GST = $95). The amount of GST is not included on the EI. If a declaration has been filled out with all details Tax = (Standard or Elected Rate) \* (Earnings) Else Tax = (No Not. Rate) \* (Earnings) In both cases truncate the tax amount to whole dollars and cents. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 58 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.16 Child Support Employer Deduction Notice YL0010 Inland Revenue Child Support can send you a notice telling you to deduct, amend or stop child support payments from your employee’s next pay. The notice shows: • Your employee’s name and IRD number. • The frequency and payday that you must start, amend or stop child support deductions. • The amount to deduct from each pay. • Employee reference number (currently only for MSD/ACC). • Do not make any deductions before the start date on the notice. • If the payday or pay frequency on the notice is different from your actual payday or frequency, please contact us so we can update our records. Incorrect information will mean the deductions we have calculated may not cover the amount of child support the employee needs to pay. • If you have more than one employee you need to make child support deductions for, we will send you a consolidated deduction notice for all employees you need to start, stop of change child support deductions for. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 59 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.16.1 Protected net earnings All employees must be allowed to keep 60% of their net pay, after tax and child support and any other attachment order is deducted. This is the employee’s ‘protected net earnings’, to cover living expenses. Note that student loan repayment obligations are not considered a tax when calculating protected net earnings. ‘Protected net earnings’ only apply to child support payments (and other attachment orders as described in the following section). You must still make other deductions, such as student loan repayments, KiwiSaver or ACC Earners’ Levy. However, insurance, superannuation and union fees may be deducted subject to the Wages Protection Act 1983. Child support and any other attachment order deductions cannot exceed 40% of the net pay. Note: Employee Share Scheme benefits are treated as a PAYE income payment for the purposes of this calculation when the employer has elected to withhold PAYE. Do not include ESS amounts in Gross Earnings or PAYE below if the employer has not elected to withhold PAYE. 1 Calculate Net Pay 4. Calculate Child Support Deduction Amount 2.

Calculate other Attachment Order Deduction Amount If Attachment Order Deduction Amount > Maximum Deduction Then Deduct Attachment Order Deduction Amount Maximum Deduction = 0 Else Deduct Attachment Order Deduction Amount Maximum Deduction = Maximum Deduction - Attachment Order Deduction Amount. 5.16.2 Calculating Protected net earnings on other Attachment Orders Where an employee has one or more District Court attachment orders other than child support, Section 157 of the District Court Act 2016 provides legislation allowing deduction restrictions in addition to those provided by the Income Tax Act and the Tax Administration Act. Section 157 (3) of the District Court Act states that where an attachment order is working alone or in conjunction with one of a number of possible notices (child support, tax arrears, parentage test costs, social security debts), the protected net earnings rule applies in all situations upon these attachment orders; whether included with a child support notice or not. (Please note, Inland Revenue arrears orders are based on gross earnings). In these situations, the protected net earnings rate is the higher of: • 60% of the post-tax earnings for the period, or • the minimum level of income specified in the notice, as provided by Section 156 (d) of the District Court Act 2016. For example, an employee who earns $2,000 a week has protected net earnings of the higher of 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 61 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] $1,514, or any level set by the District Court. In situations where the employee has one or more attachment orders in addition to a child support notice, the child support payment should always be deducted ahead of any other attachment orders. The following order of rank should apply: 1. Child support 2. Other attachment orders 3. ACC levy 4. Student loan repayments 5. KiwiSaver employee contribution 6. Other voluntary deductions Note: ACC levy is excluded when calculating protected net earnings on attachment orders. 5.17 Payroll Giving Payroll Giving grants employees an immediate tax credit for their donation(s) to a donee organisation (listed on Inland Revenue’s Donee List) where the donation is made using their employer’s Payroll Giving scheme. The tax credits for payroll donations are used to reduce the amount of PAYE paid by the employee. Payroll Giving is voluntary for both employers and employees. Tax credits for payroll donations are reported via an electronic Employment Information return (the EI in myIR). Payroll Giving is only available to employees of employers who file their EI and payment form electronically. The same calculation is used to calculate tax credits for payroll donations for all tax codes and all annual incomes equally: Tax Credit for Payroll Donation = Total Donation x 0.333333 The amount is truncated to whole cents i.e. calculate to 2 decimal places, do not round up or down. Before making a donation, individuals must have met all tax obligations and any payments legally required to be deducted from their pay. These include: • PAYE (tax and ACC Earners’ Levy) • Student Loan • Child Support • KiwiSaver The Maximum tax credit for payroll donations is limited to the ‘Tax’ element of PAYE i.e., PAYE minus ACC Earners’ Levy equals ‘Tax’. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 62 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Timeframe for Passing Donations Donations are deducted from employee’s salary or wages by the employer and passed directly to the chosen donee organisation. Donations need to be passed to the donee organisation on or before the due date for your PAYE payment, whichever is closest to the end of the two months from the last day of the pay period that the donation was deducted. Keeping Sufficient Records Employers and PAYE intermediaries must keep sufficient records of the amount of any payroll donation deducted from an employee’s pay to enable Inland Revenue to determine that payroll donations have been transferred to the correct recipient. For additional information on payroll giving please refer to the link below: https://www.ird.govt.nz/employing-staff/deductions-from-income/payroll-giving 5.18 Inland Revenue arrears payments An employer may receive a notice from us requiring them to deduct tax, student loan arrears or family tax credit over payments from an employee’s wage (a section 157 notice). The notice will explain how to calculate the required amounts. Child support payments must be deducted before tax and student loan arrears and Working for Family Tax Credit over-payments. Note: This is a different situation from the student loan process for significant under-deductions, where the employer would be instructed to use the SLCIR deductions field. Note: The notice received refers to weekly pay periods. If the employee is not paid weekly, you need to multiply the deduction amount to suit the pay period. The payments need to be sent to IR by the end of each calendar month, completely separate from PAYE payments. They should not appear on the EI. If the payment is to be made electronically, please specify the employee’s IRD number, tax type, period and amount. If it is not made electronically, the details should be supplied on a separate piece of paper. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 63 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Note: In certain circumstances, deduction notices for fixed amounts different from the lesser of the 10% of the sum in default as per notice or 20% of gross pay, may be issued. 5.18.1 Other Child Support deduction notices for WT payers In some cases, a notice may specify a percentage of the net pay is to be deducted. These deductions are paid directly to Inland Revenue using the customer’s IRD number and tax type NCP (Non-Custodial Parent). When using a percentage deduction, the maximum amount that can be requested by Inland Revenue is 40% of their net pay. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 64 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Non-Filing Information This section contains information for Payroll developers not directly related to filing information via myIR. 5.19 Initiating electronic payments using payroll software packages If your package is able to initiate electronic payments to us, then you need to ensure that the correct payment reference details are supplied for your client. If the details are incorrect, delays in processing these payments can occur. There are two different tax type codes that relate to employer deducted payments. If the payment includes a combination of the following, you can use the employer deductions (DED) code: • PAYE • Child Support deductions • Student Loan repayment deductions • Employer superannuation contribution tax • KiwiSaver deductions for employees • Net KiwiSaver employer contributions If the payment is being made for PAYE intermediary purposes, the intermediary employer deductions code (IED) must be used. 5.19.1 Electronic payment format requirements Employers (including PAYE intermediaries) will need to provide their bank with the following payment information: • Payee name:” Inland Revenue” • Amount: total amount of the payment • Our bank account details: “03 0049 0001100 27” • Particulars: Employer’s or PAYE intermediary’s IRD number • Payee code: “DED” or “IED” (see above). Leave the next box blank, then enter the period end date for the payment being processed i.e. (DDMMCCYY) • Reference: This can be used for your own personal reference. NOTE: These fields (IRD number, Tax Type code and Period End Date) are necessary in order for us to allocate the payment received correctly. Some software packages may already populate specific non-Inland Revenue information (e.g. an accounting reference) in either the particulars or payee code field and changing this is very difficult. Should this be the case, then you need to ensure that the IR payment reference details are displayed in any remaining fields to minimise impacts for your clients and how their payments are processed. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 65 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.19.2 Particulars field This field simply represents the Employer or PAYE intermediary’s IRD number. The field should contain 9 digits. If the IRD number is eight digits long, then a preceding zero must be shown in the field. The IRD number must start from the left and the remaining three boxes left blank. 5.19.3 Payee code field Enter the tax type code (EMP, DED or IED). Leave the next box blank, then enter the period end date the payment is for – not the date the payment is being made. 5.19.4 Reference field This field is for your own personal reference.

The information covered in this section shows how FBT is calculated on the alternate rate calculation process and includes both the short-form and the full alternate rate calculation process, as well as the pooled alternate rate calculation. We also explain how to complete the adjustments required for shareholder-employees or those receiving attributed income where full remuneration details were unknown at the time of completing last year's fourth quarter or annual FBT return, and the adjustment for GST. For more information about FBT and the calculation process, please refer to the latest Fringe benefit tax guide (IR 409) or the Fringe benefit tax return guide (IR 425). These are available from our website at www.ird.govt.nz or by phoning SPK2IR (Speak to IR – formerly INFOexpress) on 0800 257 777. Shareholder-employee remuneration adjustment Employers who completed their fourth quarter or annual return last year without knowing all the remuneration details of shareholder-employees (or those receiving attributed income) and applied the 49.25% FBT rate to the value of the attributed benefits, must use the alternate rate calculation when making the remuneration adjustment. The calculation required is based on last year's remuneration and attributed benefit details for each individual, less the amount of FBT calculated and paid for each of those individuals in last year’s return. A remuneration adjustment sheet is included in our Fringe benefit tax return guide (IR 425) to assist with this calculation. GST on fringe benefits The GST payable is calculated on the taxable value of all benefits from Box 3 of the FBT return less the value of any benefits which are exempt or zero-rated supplies for GST purposes. The GST content of those supplies is to be shown in Box 7 of the FBT return for quarterly filers and Box 6 of the FBT return for annual and income year filers. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 67 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] For more information on FBT refer to the IR Website: https://www.ird.govt.nz/employing- staff/paying-staff/fringe-benefit-tax 5.20.2 Short-form alternate rate calculation The short-form alternate rate calculation option is a streamlined approach that allows all attributed benefits to be taxed at a flat rate of 63.93%, and all non-attributed benefits to be taxed at a flat rate of 49.25% (or 63.93% on fringe benefits provided to major shareholder- employees). This option is more likely to appeal to employers where all of their employees who receive attributed benefits earn more than $180,000. Under the short-form alternate rate option, employers simply add all attributed benefits provided to employees together and calculate the FBT on the combined figure at 63.93%. The non- attributed benefits are calculated the same way as they are under the full alternate rate option. 5.20.3 Full alternate rate calculation The following information shows how FBT is calculated on attributed fringe benefits using the full alternate rate calculation, using one employee as an example. The full alternate rate calculation is a five-step process explained under the heading “Full alternate rate calculation process”. For each employee who receives a benefit that is attributed to them, their employer must: • Retrieve gross cash remuneration information (gross salary or wages, bonuses or overtime and other taxable income from all entities within a company) • Apply the tax rates, shown in step 1 of the full alternate rate calculation (not the actual PAYE deducted based on the PAYE tax tables) to obtain a net cash remuneration amount. • Add the value of attributed taxable benefits for the year to the net cash remuneration • Apply FBT rates to this total amount (see step 4, Table B) • Apply FBT rates to the net cash remuneration amount. • Calculate the FBT payable by subtracting the FBT tax calculated on the gross wages net cash remuneration. Completion of this calculation for annual filers will give them their FBT to pay for each employee on the value of attributed benefits. Quarterly filers take off the previous three-quarters assessments. 5.20.4 Full alternate rate calculation process Step 1: Calculate net cash remuneration The employer calculates the net cash remuneration of each employee. This calculation takes the employee’s gross cash remuneration minus the tax on that income to get net cash remuneration 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 68 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] total. Table A (see below) sets out the current income tax rates used in the calculation. Cash remuneration is the employee’s gross salary or wages, bonuses, overtime and other taxable income from all entities associated with the company, including subsidiaries, for the year. For a major shareholder-employee it also includes any interest, or dividends received from the employer or a related employer. If an employee worked only part of the year, the cash remuneration is the amount paid to them during the year. Table A: Income tax rates Income tax range Cumulative Income tax per range Income tax rate From $0 to $14,000 $1,470.00 10.5% $14,001 to $15,600 $205.12 12.82% $14,001 $15,601 to $48,000 $7,420.00 $5,670 17.5% $48,001 to $70,000$53,500 $14,020.00 $1,190.20 21.64% $53,501 to $70,000 $4,950 30.0% $70,001 to $78,100 $2510.19 30.99% $70,00178,101 to $180,000 $50,320.00 $33,627 33.0% $180,001 upwards 39.0% Example: Employee A Gross cash Remuneration $78,333.00 Tax on first $78,100 $14,020.00 $15,995.51 Tax on remaining $233 @ 33.0% $2,749.89 $76.89 Tax on $78,333 = $16,769.89 $16,072.40 Therefore: Net cash remuneration $61,563.11 $62,260.60 Note: 1. When calculating the tax on the cash remuneration the gross cash remuneration total is in whole dollars. The tax amount is truncated to the second decimal place after. For example, if the tax amount calculated was $2,305.45674 the amount that would be shown as the tax on cash remuneration is $2,305.45. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 69 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Step 2: Calculate taxable value of attributed fringe benefits The employer calculates the taxable value of each attributed benefit received by the employee. For each employee they add all the taxable values, of all such benefits received for each quarter, to get the annual value of the benefits for each employee. These are obtained from the FBT taxable value calculation sheet that employers have completed in quarters one to four. Example: Quarter 1 total $1,272.00 Quarter 2 total $1,272.00 Quarter 3 total $1,177.60 Quarter 4 total $1,272.00 Total taxable value of benefit $4,993.60 For more details on attributed fringe benefits, and the thresholds that apply, please refer to the Fringe benefit tax guide (IR 409). Note: When adding the amount of benefits received by an employee, truncate figures to whole cents. Using the above example, the third quarter amount was calculated at $1,177.60814, but is shown as $1,177.60. Step 3: Fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration (FBICR) For each employee take the net cash remuneration (whole dollars only) calculated in step 1 and add the taxable value of attributed fringe benefits (whole dollars only) from step 2. This gives the fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration (FBICR) total against which the FBT alternate rates will be applied. Example: Employee A Net income $61,563.00 $62,260.00 Taxable value on benefit $ 4,993.00 FBICR $66,556.00 $ 67,253.00 Note: When transferring the fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration (FBICR) to step 4 this amount must be in whole dollars. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 70 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Step 4: Applying the alternate rates Tax on the FBICR is calculated using the rates in the table below. Table B: Fringe benefit tax rates Fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration Accumulative FBT per bracket FBT tax rate From $1 to $12,530 $1,469.76 11.73% $12,531 to $40,580 $7,419.16 21.21% $40,581 to $55,980 $14,019.60 42.86% $55,981 to $129,680 $50,316.85 49.25% $129,681 upwards 63.93% Example: Employee A FBICR (from step 3) $66,556.00 $ 67,253.00 FBT on first $55,980 $14,019.60 FBT on remaining $10,576 $11,273.00 @ 49.25% =$5,208.68 $5,551.95 FBT on $66,556.00 $ 67,253.00 $19,228.28 $19,571.55 Note: When calculating the tax on the fringe benefit-inclusive tax remuneration within each fringe benefit tax rate, the amount calculated is to the second decimal place after the decimal point so the FBT on $12,530 is $1,469.76 ($12,530 x 11.73% = $1,469.769). Using the above example, tax on the difference between $66,556 $67,253 and $55,980 is $10,576 $11,273 ($10,576.00 $11,273 x 49.25% = $5,208.68 $5,551.95). Step 5: Calculating the FBT on net cash remuneration Take the net cash remuneration (step 1) and calculate the FBT on this using Table B (in step 4) Example: Employee A Net cash remuneration (from step 1) $62,260.00 FBT on first $55,980 $14,019.60 FBT on remaining $6,280.00 @ 49.25% = $3,092.90 FBT on $62,260 = $17,112.50 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 71 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Step 6: Calculating the FBT liability Take the tax on the FBICR (step 4) and subtract the FBT tax on the net income (step 5). This gives the amount of fringe benefit tax the employer should have paid for that employee on the value of attributed benefits in that year. Example: Employee A Tax on FBICR of $19,228.28 Less FBT tax on net cash remuneration $16,769.89 FBT liability for employer $2,458.39 $19,571.55 $17,112.50 $2,459.05 Step 7: FBT to pay The annual FBT liability for the employer is the: • FBT calculated on attributed fringe benefits for each employee plus the • FBT payable on the non-attributed fringe benefits. The FBT payable on the taxable value of non-attributed benefits is calculated at a flat FBT rate of 49.25% (or 63.93% if received by major shareholder-employees or an associated person, if the benefits received by that associated person were not as an employee). Quarterly filers If the employer is a quarterly filer, the amount of FBT assessed in the previous quarters is subtracted from the total to get the amount to pay in the final quarter. FBT to pay is transferred to Box 6 on the Quarterly return (IR 420). Example: Employee A FBT liability for employer $2,458.39 Less FBT assessed in quarters 1 to 3 $1,600.28 FBT to pay in final quarter $858.11 $2,459.05 $1832.58 $626.45 The employer may be entitled to a refund if the annual FBT liability is less than the FBT assessed in quarters 1-3. 5.20.5 Annual filers If the employer is an annual or income year filer, the total FBT to pay is $2,458.39$2,459.05. This is transferred to Box 5 on the annual or income year return IR 422 or IR 421. 5.20.6 Pooled alternate rate calculation The pooled alternate rate option is available from the 2021-22 tax year onwards. This option works in a similar way to the short form alternate rate option. The sole difference between these 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 72 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] options is that under the pooled alternate rate option, attributed benefits are divided into two pools, with one pool taxed at the 63.93% rate and the other at the 49.25% rate. This option is intended to strike a better balance between accuracy and simplicity for many employers than the other FBT payment options. Employers who predominantly provide attributed benefits to employees who earn less than $180,000 in gross cash pay, especially if all or most of those employees earn within the “safe harbour” thresholds outlined below, are expected to benefit the most from this option. By default, the 49.25% rate pool comprises benefits provided to employees whose remuneration is within the following “safe harbour” thresholds: 1 • Attributed benefits of up to $13,400 • Cash pay of up to $160,000. The 63.93% rate pool comprises benefits provided to employees earning above the safe harbour thresholds. Pooled alternate rate example: Employee X Company A employs full-time and part-time staff in a range of roles requiring different skill sets, qualifications, and levels of experience. Salaries range from $30,000 to $170,000. However, only Employee X earns $170,000 before tax, with the next highest-paid employee earning $120,000 before tax. In the 2021–22 tax year, Company A provides fringe benefits totalling $100,000 to all its staff members in the form of subsidised transport and some low interest, employment-related loans. No individual staff member received more than $6,000 in attributed benefits, so none of Company A’s staff received anywhere near $13,400 in attributed benefits. Employee X received attributed benefits to the value of $5,000. Company A has calculated its FBT (Fringe Benefit Tax) liability for attributed benefits for the first three quarters of the 2021–22 tax year under section RD 59(2). This means it paid FBT at the 1 The exception to this rule is explained below at ‘Option to pay FBT at 49.25% rate for employees receiving all-inclusive pay below $129,681’. Treatment of non-attributed benefits Non-attributed benefits provided to employees that are not major shareholders are still pooled and taxed at the 49.25% rate, while any non-attributed benefits provided to employees who are major shareholders, or to persons associated with an employee who is a major shareholder, are still required to be pooled and taxed at the 63.93% rate. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 73 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] rate of 49.25% of the taxable value of attributed benefits for those first three quarters. As fringe benefits totalling $75,000 were provided in the first three quarters, Company A has paid FBT of $36,937.50 for that period. Company A decides to use the pooled alternate rate option to calculate its FBT liability for the final quarter of 2021–22. When preparing the FBT return for the final quarter, Company A identifies that only one employee earned above the safe harbour limit of $160,000 in cash pay for the 2021–22 tax year, being Employee X. Company A accordingly pays FBT on the taxable value of fringe benefits attributed to Employee X at the top rate of 63.93%. FBT for Employee X: Company A’s FBT liability for Employee X for the 2021–22 year is $3,196.50 ($5,000 × 63.93%). FBT for other employees: The total FBT payable for all other employees for the 2021–22 year is calculated by subtracting the taxable value of benefits attributed to Employee X from the taxable value of attributed benefits Company A provided to all its staff during 2021–22 and then applying the 49.25% rate to this amount. The taxable value of attributed benefits Company A provided to all its staff during 2021–22 is $100,000. Employee X received $5,000 of these benefits. This means that the total FBT payable for Company A’s employees (excluding Employee X) for the 2021–22 tax year is $46,787.50 (($100,000 - $5,000) × 49.25%). Total FBT liability: Therefore, Company A’s total FBT liability for all employees (including Employee X) for the 2021– 22 tax year is $49,984 ($46,787.50 + $3,196.50). As Company A has already paid $36,937.50 in FBT for the first three quarters of the 2021–22 tax year, the FBT payable for the final quarter is $13,046.50 ($49,984 - $36,937.50). Option to pay FBT at 49.25% rate for employees receiving all-inclusive pay below $129,681 Employers may also choose to pay FBT at the 49.25% rate on benefits attributed to employees who receive less than $129,681 in all-inclusive pay, even if the employee receives more than $160,000 in cash pay or more than $13,400 in attributed benefits. Provided the requirement around the level of the employee’s all-inclusive pay is met, this choice is available to an employer even if the employee earns above either of the safe harbour thresholds outlined above. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 74 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.21 ESCT (employer’s superannuation contribution tax) ESCT is a tax paid on employer superannuation cash contributions (employer contributions). ESCT is paid on all employer contributions made after the employer either starts new employment (auto-enrolment into KiwiSaver) or the employer has been given notice to make KiwiSaver deductions (KS2 from employee or letter from IRD). ESCT applies to all employer contributions from that date onwards regardless of the pay period the payment may be for. 5.21.1 Options for calculating tax on employer contributions ESCT can be calculated by the employer: • using a progressive rate based on the employee’s salary scale (see Table 1 below) or, • at the employees request all or part of the value of the employer superannuation contribution can be included in the employee’s gross salary or wages and taxed at their personal tax rates as per RD 68 (1) of the ITA (Income Tax Act) 2007. Table 1 Income Tax Act 2007 RD 68 Choosing to have amount treated as salary or wages Amount treated as salary or wages 1. With the agreement of their employer who makes an employer's superannuation cash contribution on their behalf, an employee may choose to have some or all of an employer's superannuation cash contribution made on their behalf treated as salary or wages under the PAYE rules.

The employee's election is valid until revoked in writing. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 75 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.21.2 Calculation Details Taxing employer’s superannuation cash contributions as salary or wages under the PAYE rules All or part of the employer’s superannuation cash contribution (employer contribution) can be included in the employee’s gross salary or wages and taxed under the PAYE rules (section RD 68 (ITA 2007). Example - when an employee is a member of KiwiSaver Rachel is employed by Company Q Ltd\*. She is a KiwiSaver member. Her employment agreement includes Company Q Ltd\* contributing $15 (3%) a week to her KiwiSaver scheme, in addition to her normal weekly salary of $500.03. Rachel chooses, and her employer agrees, to have these contributions included as part of her salary. This means Company Q Ltd\* uses the total of her salary and the employer contributions of $515.03 to calculate her PAYE. Note: Any student loan deductions, working for family tax credit entitlements or child support obligations the employee may have will be calculated on the new Gross amount of $515.03. ACC employer levies will increase due to the new gross as well.

If the employer contribution is paid as a gross amount, the calculation is: As per the above example the employer would deduct the following from the employee’s salary or wages: Total gross wage inclusive of the employer contribution $515.03 Less PAYE $82.76 $77.36 Less KiwiSaver employer contribution $15.00 Less KiwiSaver employee deduction $20.00 Total net wage given to employee $397.27$402.67 2. If the employer contribution is paid as a net amount the employer will need to calculate what tax is to be deducted, the calculation is: Step 1 Original gross wage $500.03 PAYE on original gross $79.80 $76.65 $74.50 Total gross inclusive of the employer contribution $515.03 PAYE on gross inclusive of the employer contribution $82.76 $77.36 Step 2 PAYE on gross inclusive of the employer contribution $82.76 $77.36 less PAYE on original gross $79.80$76.65 $74.50 $2.96 $2.86 \* the use of this name is used as an example only and Inland Revenue does not intend the use of this name to reflect on any real entity that may coincidentally have the same name. Step 3 The employer contribution is sent to the provider less tax not PAYE, which means we have to identify and deduct the ACC Earners’ Levy from the tax on the employer contribution. Gross employer contribution $15.00 Multiplied by ACC Earners’ Levy 1.6% ACC calculated on employer contribution $0.24 Step 4 PAYE calculated on employer contribution (refer step 2) $2.96 $2.86 Less ACC calculated on employer contribution $0.24 Total tax to deduct from employer contribution $2.72 $2.62 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 77 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Step 5 Gross employer contribution $15.00 Less tax to deduct from employer contribution $2.72 $2.62 Net employer contribution $12.28 $12.38 As per the above example the employer would deduct the following from the employee’s salary or wages: Total gross inclusive of the employer contribution $515.03 Less PAYE $82.76 $77.36 Less KiwiSaver employee deduction $20.00 Less KiwiSaver employer contribution $12.38 Total net wage given to employee $399.99 $405.29 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 78 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.21.3 Amount of employer superannuation cash contributions to be shown on the EI When employer superannuation cash contributions (employer contributions) are treated as salary and wages the amount paid to the superannuation fund as shown on the EI can be either: • the amount calculated on the original gross or • the amount calculated after the income tax component of the PAYE has been identified and removed from the employer contribution. This may be specified under the employment contract. This can be calculated using the following options: Option One Employer contribution is $15.00 per week and the gross wage is $515.00 (incl employer contribution). The employer shows the following information on the EI: Gross $515.00 PAYE $82.76 $77.36 KiwiSaver employee deduction $20.00 KiwiSaver employer contribution $15.00 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 79 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Option Two Employer contribution is $12.36 per week and the gross wage is $515.00 (incl employer contribution).

If the employee has not been employed the full previous tax year, then the employer estimates what their earnings would be for a whole year. Under section RD 67(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007, the amount of tax is determined by applying the relevant rate given by Table 1 to each dollar of an employer’s superannuation contribution: Income Tax Act 2007 RD 67 Calculating amounts of tax for employer's superannuation cash contributions The amount of tax for an employer’s superannuation cash contribution is the amount determined under Schedule 1, part D, clause 1 (Basic tax rates: income tax, ESCT, RSCT, RWT (Resident Withholding Tax), and attributed fringe benefits) Note: Schedule 1, Part D, clause 2 has been repealed. Income Tax Act 2007 Basic rates for ESCT given by Table 1 Amount of tax for section RD 67(a) Under section RD 67(a), the amount of tax is determined by applying the relevant rate given by table 1 to each dollar of an employer’s superannuation contribution.

Therefore, the ESCT rate threshold is set at the beginning of the tax year and cannot change until the following year when the rate is re-calculated. 5.21.6 Employer contribution and ESCT calculated using whole dollars and cents KiwiSaver legislation requires the following rules to be applied to the calculation for employer contribution: • employer contribution is to be based on complete dollars and cents i.e. $861.85 and not just $861 • ESCT is calculated based on the last amount i.e. $51 and not $51.71. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 82 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.22 ESCT rate calculation examples 5.22.1 Employee with employer for whole tax year Note: Use employee’s actual earnings from previous tax year An employee has earned $50,000 total income and has been employed by his employer for the full previous tax year. The employee has also received a gross employer superannuation contribution of $4000 (8% of the employee’s gross salary or wage) and the employer has paid other superannuation on behalf of the employee of $216.00 (total employer superannuation contributions are $4,216.00). The ESCT threshold rate is calculated as follows: Total income $50,000.00 Total Superannuation Contribution $ 4,216.00 ------------ Total ESCT threshold amount is $54,216.00 ======= The tax rate that the ESCT will be deducted is 0.175 or 17.5%. Note: The ESCT rate of 0.175 will remain for the whole tax year and will not change regardless of any change to employee's salary/wages during the current tax year. 5.22.2 Employee with employer less than 12 months Examples based in 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 tax year. Example One - Employee starting in the current tax year NOTE: Estimate income using expected current year’s earnings Employee commenced during the tax year on the 17th of July 2024 earning weekly gross $380 with employer superannuation contributions of $11.40 per week. 1) Calculation to estimate income earned for 2025 tax year using period 17/7/2024 to 31/3/2025 (258 days) including the end date. 2) Gross income + Superannuation Contributions/ days earnings x days in tax year 3) ($380 + $11.40) / 7 x 258 = $14,425.88 ESCT rate threshold amount 4) ESCT threshold amount of $14,425.88 is between $0 - $16,800.00, the ESCT rate for the 2025 tax year is 0.105 or 10.5%. Note: The ESCT rate of 0.105 will remain for the whole tax year and will not change regardless of any change to employee’s salary/wages during the current tax year. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 83 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example Two - Employee started in the previous tax year NOTE: Estimate income using expected current year’s earnings (not previous year earnings) Employee commenced work on 15th March 2024. From 1 April 2024 the employee will earn $878.00 gross per fortnight with employer super contributions of $26.34. 1) Calculation to estimate income earned for tax year 1/4/2024 to 31/3/2025 using earnings they are expected to derive per fortnight (14 days) from 1 April 2024. 2) Gross income + Superannuation Contributions/ days earnings x days in tax year 3) ($878.00 + $26.34) / 14 x 365 = $23,577.43 ESCT rate threshold amount 4) ESCT threshold amount of $23,577.43 is between $16,801 - $57,600, the ESCT rate for the 2025 tax year is 0.175 or 17.5%. Note: The ESCT rate of 0.175 will remain for the whole tax year and will not change regardless of any change to employee’s salary/wages during the current tax year. Example Three - Casual employee starting in the current tax year NOTE: Estimate income using expected current year’s earnings Employee commenced work as a casual employee on the 14th of November 2024 earning $250.00 hour with employer superannuation contributions of 3%. The employer has estimated the employee will work 150 hours from 14/11/2024 to 31/03/2025: 1) Estimated income earned for tax year using – 150 hours worked x $250 hourly rate = $37,500 estimated earnings 2) Estimated Superannuation Contributions – $37,500 estimated earnings x 3% employer contribution = $1125.00 3) Add estimated gross income + estimated Superannuation Contributions – $37,500 + $1125 = $38,625.00 ESCT rate threshold amount 4) ESCT threshold amount of $38,625.00 is between $16,801 - $57,600, the ESCT rate for the 2025 tax year is 0.175 or 17.5%. Note: The ESCT rate of 0.175 will remain for the whole tax year and will not change regardless of any change to employee’s salary/wages during the current tax year. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 84 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.22.3 Calculating ESCT using the ESCT threshold tax amount Sequence Task Associated Rules 1 Calculate KiwiSaver Employer Contribution.

The employee’s ESCT threshold tax rate of 17.5% ESCT will be calculated separately using rules in 5.22.3, before being added together: KiwiSaver employer contributions (2%) 79.04 ($79 x .175 = 13.825) Other super fund employer contributions (1%) 39.52 ($39 x .175 = 6.82) Total ESCT = 13.82 + 6.82 = 20.64 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 85 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.22.5 Refund of ESCT when an employee opts out If an employee completes an Employee opt-out request (KS10) and them opt out is accepted, the employer is refunded all compulsory and non-compulsory employer contributions automatically if they have been forwarded onto IR. Any tax, calculated on employer contributions, paid to IR for the employee that has opted out will be refunded to the employer on request. Employers can do this by either: • completing an IR344 or • calling us on 0800 377 772 Example An employee earns $800.00 gross for the week and is paid a net KiwiSaver employer contribution of $19.80 (3% less ESCT of $4.20). There are 4 pay periods in this month. Returned on the Employment Information return (EI) are gross earnings of $800.00 and a net KiwiSaver employer contribution of $19.80. The employee opts out and the employer receives a letter confirming this. The employer then contacts IR to request a refund of $4.20 of the ESCT deducted. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 86 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 6 Inland Revenue (IRD) Number validation The IRD number format used by Inland Revenue is an eight- or nine-digit number consisting of the following parts - • A seven- or eight-digit base number • A trailing check digit 6.1 Check digit validation The following steps are to be performed - 1. Check the valid range • If the IRD number is < 10-000-000 or > 150-000-000 then the number is invalid. This step ensures that the IRD number is in the already issued range or is in the range expected to be issued in the next 10 years. 2. Form the eight-digit base number: • Remove the trailing check digit. • If the resulting number is seven digits long, pad to eight digits by adding a leading zero. 3. Calculate the check digit: • To each of the base number’s eight digits a weight factor is assigned. From left to right these are: 3, 2, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. • Sum together the products of the weight factors and their associated digits. • Divide the sum by 11. If the remainder is 0, the calculated check digit is 0. • If the remainder is not 0, subtract the remainder from 11, giving the calculated check digit. • If the calculated check digit is in the range 0 to 9, go to step 5. • If the calculated check digit is 10, continue with step 4. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 87 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4. Re-calculate the check digit : • To each of the base number’s eight digits a secondary weight factor is assigned. From left to right these are: 7, 4, 3, 2, 5, 2, 7, 6. • Sum together the products of the weight factors and their associated digits. • Divide the sum by 11. If the remainder is 0, the calculated check digit is 0. • If the remainder is not 0 then subtract the remainder from 11, giving the calculated check digit. • If the calculated check digit is 10, the IRD number is invalid. 5. Compare the check digit: • Compare the calculated check digit to the last digit of the original IRD number. If they match, the IRD number is valid. Example 1 IR number 49091850. The base number is 4909185 and the supplied check digit is 0. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (0\*3) + (4\*2) + (9\*7) + (0\*6) + (9\*5) + (1\*4) + (8\*3) + (5\*2) = 154. 154 / 11 = 14 remainder 0 (i.e. mod (154,11) = 0) The remainder (0) = check digit (0), so no further calculation is necessary. Example 2 IR number 35901981. The base number is 3590198 and the supplied check digit is 1. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (0\*3) + (3\*2) + (5\*7) + (9\*6) + (0\*5) + (1\*4) + (9\*3) + (8\*2) = 142. 142 / 11 = 12 remainder 10 (i.e. mod (142,11) = 10) 11 – 10 = 1 which matches the check digit. The number is valid. Example 3 IR number 49098576. The base number is 4909857 and the supplied check digit is 6. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (0\*3) + (4\*2) + (9\*7) + (0\*6) + (9\*5) + (8\*4) + (5\*3) + (7\*2) = 177. 177 / 11 = 16 remainder 1 (i.e. mod (177,11) = 1) 11 – 1 = 10 so perform the secondary calculation. (0\*7) + (4\*4) + (9\*3) + (0\*2) + (9\*5) + (8\*2) + (5\*7) + (7\*6) = 181 181 / 11 = 16 remainder 5 (i.e. mod (181,11) = 5) 11 – 5 = 6, this matches the check digit. The number is valid. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 88 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 4 (9-digit IRD number) IR number 136410132. The base number is 13641013 and the supplied check digit is 2. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (1\*3) + (3\*2) + (6\*7) + (4\*6) + (1\*5) + (0\*4) + (1\*3) + (3\*2) = 89. 89 / 11 = 8 remainder 1 (i.e. mod (89,11) = 1) 11 – 1 = 10 so perform the secondary calculation. (1\*7) + (3\*4) + (6\*3) + (4\*2) + (1\*5) + (0\*2) + (1\*7) + (3\*6) = 75 75 / 11 = 6 remainder 9 (i.e. mod (75,11) = 9) 11 – 9 = 2 which matches the check digit. The number is valid. Example 5 (9-digit IRD number) IR number 136410133. The base number is 13641013 and the supplied check digit is 3. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (1\*3) + (3\*2) + (6\*7) + (4\*6) + (1\*5) + (0\*4) + (1\*3) + (3\*2) = 89. 89 / 11 = 8 remainder 1 (i.e. mod (89,11) = 1) 11 – 1 = 10 so perform the secondary calculation. (1\*7) + (3\*4) + (6\*3) + (4\*2) + (1\*5) + (0\*2) + (1\*7) + (3\*6) = 75 75 / 11 = 6 remainder 9 (i.e. mod (75,11) = 9) 11 – 9 = 2, this does not match the check digit (3). The number is invalid. Example 6 IR number 9125568. The number is less than 10,000,000 so fails the first validation. The number is invalid. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 89 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 7 Bank account number validation The bank account number format used by all banks is numeric and includes the following parts: • Bank ID (maximum 2 digits) • Bank branch (maximum 4 digits) • Account base number (maximum 8 digits) • Account suffix (maximum 4 digits). For processing at Inland Revenue, the fields for the individual account number parts are all of maximum size. If less than the maximum number of digits is supplied, then values are right justified, and the fields padded with zeroes (where applicable). 7.1 Validation step 1 The first step in the validation process is to verify the Bank ID number. This number can then be used to derive the appropriate algorithm code for that bank. Once the appropriate algorithm code has been derived, the second whole account number validation step must be performed as outlined in Validation Step 2 on the following page. Current valid Bank IDs and their associated algorithms are included in this table: Bank ID Algorithm 01 A or B (see note) 02 A or B (see note) 03 A or B (see note) 04 A or B (see note) 05 A or B (see note) 06 A or B (see note) 08 D 10 A or B (see note) 11 A or B (see note) 12 A or B (see note) 13 A or B (see note) 14 A or B (see note) 15 A or B (see note) 16 A or B (see note) 17 A or B (see note) 18 A or B (see note) 19 A or B (see note) 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 90 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Bank ID Algorithm 20 A or B (see note) 21 A or B (see note) 22 A or B (see note) 23 A or B (see note) 24 A or B (see note) 25 F 27 A or B (see note) 30 A or B (see note) 31 X 38 A or B (see note) 88 A or B (see note) Note: If the account base number is below 00990000 then apply algorithm A, otherwise apply algorithm B. The actual branch numbers in use change from time to time, and are included in the Bank Branch Register, which gets updated monthly. A link to this register on the paymentsNZ website is included here: https://www.paymentsnz.co.nz/resources/industry-registers/bank-branch-register/ To request monthly updates to the Bank Branch Register, use this email address: branchregister@paymentsnz.co.nz 7.2 Validation step 2 The second validation step is a modulus n algorithm applied to the whole account number. The algorithm type is derived from the table on the previous page. Follow this process: 1. Identify the corresponding weight factor for every digit in the account number as shown in the table below. Note: all fields (i.e., bank ID, bank branch, account base and account suffix) are right justified and padded with zeroes. 2. Add together the products of the weight factors and their associated account number digit. If the algorithm E or G is used then add the two digits of the product (tens and ones), and again the two digits of the result before summing (see example 3). Divide the sum by the value in the “Modulo” column below. If the remainder is zero, then the bank account number is valid. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 91 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Algorithm Bank Branch Account Base Suffix Modulo A 0 0 6 3 7 9 0 0 10 5 8 4 2 1 0 0 0 0 11 B 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 5 8 4 2 1 0 0 0 0 11 \*C 3 7 0 0 0 0 9 1 10 5 3 4 2 1 0 0 0 0 11 D 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 0 0 0 11 E 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 4 3 2 0 0 0 1 11 F 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 7 3 1 7 3 1 0 0 0 0 10 G 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 7 1 3 7 1 0 3 7 1 10 \*X 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 Note 1: \*Algorithm C is not currently used by the banks.

For a student loan borrower, the following student loan deductions are made: • For main employment income, a deduction of the standard deduction rate from the gross income over the pay period repayment threshold ($464 per week) should be made. • For secondary employment income, a deduction of the standard deduction rate from the gross income should be made. Other areas to note for student loans: Unused Repayment Threshold Special Deduction Rate (URT SDR): • If a borrower has more than one employer at the same time, and gross income from main employment is below the pay period repayment threshold, the borrower can apply to IR for an URT SDR to have the “unused” portion of the pay period threshold allocated to secondary employers. • For an URT SDR, the borrower is still required to use a “SL” repayment code (unless they also have a tailored tax code, in which case “STC” is the code to be used). • Depending on the amount of unused repayment threshold, the Student Loan deduction rate advised on the certificate could be anything from 0% to 11%. Repayment Deduction Exemption (RDE): • Borrowers who are studying full-time and expect their income for the year to be under the annual repayment threshold are eligible to apply for an RDE. • For the period of time an RDE is in effect, the borrower is exempt from having Student Loan deductions made from their salary and wages and does not have to use an “SL” repayment code. Therefore, the Student Loan deductions are 0%. Commissioner deductions (SLCIR): • In the EI, the ‘SLCIR deductions’ field should be used for Commissioner deductions. • Commissioner deductions are extra deductions and may be required if the Student Loan standard deductions were less than the amount that should have been deducted. • IR will notify the borrower and employer if Commissioner deductions are required to be made. • Notification will specify the amount to be recovered, and the percentage to be deducted until that amount has been reached. • The maximum rate will be 5% on gross income (over the pay period repayment threshold) for primary employment earnings. • For secondary income this will be 5% on the gross payment of salary or wages. Example: How to calculate the compulsory extra deductions Employer receives a student loan compulsory extra deduction notice for their employee (who is using the M SL tax code) asking them to make the extra deductions at 5% of gross earnings over the pay period repayment threshold. The formula for calculating compulsory extra deductions is: Compulsory extra deduction = (gross earnings – pay period repayment threshold) x 5.00% 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The employee is paid weekly so their deductions for November 2024 will be as follows: Week Gross earnings Student loan compulsory extra deduction Calculation Note: truncate gross earnings to whole dollars 1 $875.90 $20.55 ($875 - $464) x 5.00% = $20.55 2 $960.00 $24.80 ($960 - $464) x 5.00% = $24.80 3 $425.35 $0.00 Gross earnings less than repayment threshold so no compulsory extra deduction required 4 $956.80 $24.60 ($956 - $464) x 5.00% = $24.60 Voluntary deductions (SLBOR): • In the EI, the ‘SLBOR deductions’ field should be used for voluntary deductions. • Borrower deductions are extra deductions that can be requested by employees wishing to pay more towards their Student loan. • The amount, or percentage, to be deducted is determined by the borrower. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4 KiwiSaver No changes are required to existing paper or electronic Employment Information returns as the existing field Net KiwiSaver Employer Contributions will be used to record the total of voluntary and compulsory employer contributions. KiwiSaver members can make a contribution of 3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10% of their wages. They may change their contribution rate at any time by advising their employer. The default contribution rate is 3% if no rate is elected. 4.1 Employers who must contribute to member savings Employers with employees who contribute to KiwiSaver schemes and/or complying funds must make Compulsory Employer Contributions (CEC). For KiwiSaver purposes, CEC must start from: • the first pay after an employee starts new employment, or • the first pay after the employer receives notice from IR or the employee that they have become a member of a KiwiSaver scheme. The minimum Compulsory Employer Contribution for pay periods commencing on or after 1 April 2013 is 3%. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4.2 Employers who need not contribute to member savings Employers do not need to contribute to KiwiSaver and Complying Funds as well as other schemes if an employee belongs to several schemes (if certain requirements are met). An employee who belongs to a Registered Superannuation Scheme (RSS) or Complying Fund may also join a KiwiSaver scheme. Employers are not required to make compulsory contributions if they already contribute to a scheme on behalf of the member (if certain conditions are met). To avoid employers being forced to contribute more than once, any employer contribution to an RSS, Complying Fund or KiwiSaver scheme may qualify as compulsory employer contributions if, as per section 101D(5) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006: 1. employer superannuation contributions (the contributions) are made to a registered superannuation scheme (the contributions scheme); and the contributions scheme was registered before 17 May 2007, or the contributions scheme is one (a succeeding scheme) for which there is, due to all relevant members transferring to the succeeding scheme by virtue of section 9BAA of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989, a prior registered superannuation scheme (a prior scheme) and that prior scheme or another prior scheme for the contributions scheme were registered before 17 May 2007; and the employer provided access for employees generally to the contributions scheme or a prior scheme for the contributions scheme before 17 May 2007; and the employee is - 1. employed by the employer before 1 April 2008, and the employer makes or has agreed with the employee to make employer superannuation contributions for the employee before 1 April 2008 to the contributions scheme or a prior scheme for the contributions scheme; or 2. covered by a collective agreement that is in force before 17 May 2007 and expires after 1 April 2008 3. someone who has had contributions paid or credited to the contributions scheme or a prior scheme for the contributions scheme by a previous employer, and those contributions met the requirements described in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 above. Employer contributions which satisfy the paragraphs above, must also vest completely in the employee no later than 5 years after the employee joins the contributions scheme. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Employer contributions to an RSS scheme, which meets the requirements listed above, count towards the compulsory employer contribution, even if the scheme does not have similar lock- in rules to Complying Funds or KiwiSaver schemes. This policy prevents an employer being forced to contribute twice, once because an employee belongs to an RSS, which requires employer contributions and a second time because the same employee joins a KiwiSaver scheme or complying fund. If an employee is a member of a defined benefit scheme, their employer is not liable to pay CEC for that or any other scheme that employee may belong to. The table below summarises employer obligations where employees belong to several superannuation schemes: Contribution Type CEC implications Defined Benefit Fund If an employee is a member of a defined benefit scheme, there are no CEC obligations in regards to that employee Registered Superannuation Scheme No CEC requirements for these but contributions to RSS can offset other CEC liabilities. See formula below Complying Fund CEC applies KiwiSaver Scheme CEC applies CEC = (payment of gross salary or wages x CEC rate) – other contributions 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4.3 Definition of Salary and Wages for KiwiSaver purposes 4.3.1 Gross salary and wages The definition of gross salary and wages for KiwiSaver purposes includes: • bonuses • commissions • gratuities • overtime payments, and • any other remuneration of any kind. The following payments to employees are specifically excluded from the definition of salary and wages for KiwiSaver purposes, and as such an employer contribution is optional. • Redundancy payments • Reasonable employer provided accommodation or accommodation allowances • Actual costs reimbursed for allowances or expenses relating to living outside New Zealand • Payments made under the Voluntary Bonding Schemes administered by the Ministry for Primary Industries, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Education. • Employee Share Schemes Gross base salary and wages are used to determine the amount of employer deductions and compulsory employer contributions (CECs) for members of a complying fund scheme. Refer to the Glossary section of the KiwiSaver Employer Guide for the full definition of gross salary and wages. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 13 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4.3.2 KiwiSaver - Employees under 18 and over 65 New and existing employees under 18 can only join KiwiSaver by choosing and contacting directly a KiwiSaver scheme provider. Once an employee under 18 is accepted by the scheme provider and the employee has nominated their employer, lR will notify their employer and request they start deducting the employee KiwiSaver contributions. IR will provide the contribution rate for the employee, their name and IRD number. New and existing employees 65 and over can join KiwiSaver by choosing and contacting directly a KiwiSaver scheme provider or join by completing a KS2 KiwiSaver deduction form with their employer. The KS2 form will indicate the rate of deductions from an employee’s salary/wage. Deductions of employee KiwiSaver contributions are based on the following: • For under 18 or over 65 employees, employers need to deduct employee contributions. • Employers are not required to make CECs on behalf of employees under 18 or over 65. • Any KiwiSaver employer contributions made to employees under 18 or over 65 are voluntary employer contributions. Note: With the removal of the tax credit for children under the age of 18, they are now liable for PAYE deductions and if they are an existing KiwiSaver member, they are also required to have KiwiSaver employee contributions. If you have an employee who turns 18 while working for you, you do not need to take any additional action unless specifically requested by the employee, though you are required to begin making CECs on their behalf if they are a member. 4.3.3 CEC Validations The following validation will occur in Inland Revenue systems and if failed, will cause the employer’s EI return to be queried unless there is an existing arrangement to overlook specific CEC validations: • If the employee is making KiwiSaver or complying fund deductions, the compulsory employer contributions must be at least 3% of the employee’s gross income. The amount shown on the EI will always be the employer's contribution less any tax withheld (i.e. the net amount). 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5 Calculation Details This section provides the table of tax codes (immediately below in section 5.1) and the details of the calculations required for specific tax codes (section 5.2 onwards).

Note: Calculate PAYE as per PAYE calculations above (Sections 5.2 and 5.3) 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.5 NSW – Non-resident Seasonal Worker calculation Non-resident Seasonal Workers (NSW) are taxed at a flat rate. There are no thresholds to apply. Tax credits for payroll donations can be applied. The total to pay also includes the ACC Earners’ Levy at 1.60% from each pay period (0.0160). The flat rate is 10.5% (0.105). Eligible non-resident seasonal workers must use the NSW tax code. If the NSW tax code is used, then the EI line for the employee cannot contain: • KiwiSaver contributions • Student Loan Repayments As a non-resident the worker is not eligible to enrol in KiwiSaver, nor are they subject to student loan repayments. Child Support payments can be deducted. The flat rate of 10.5% also applies to extra pay. This is applicable to PAYE income payments made from 01 April 2016 for non-resident seasonal workers with the NSW tax code. For example: Mike contracted as fruit packer for ten weeks at $25/hour with NSW tax code. His final gross pay on the tenth week is $1,000 with $800 being the 8% holiday pay. Mike will receive net earnings of $703.20 holiday pay on top of his final pay. This is based on 10.5% tax rate and 1.60% ACC earners levy deducted which is $96.80. If Mike’s employer applied the normal extra pay rate rules of 17.5% then Mike would have only received net earnings of $647.76 based on a deduction of $152.24. Please note: Non-resident seasonal workers under the recognised seasonal employer (RSE) rules have a tax code of NSW for the first month of a period of employment in New Zealand After the first month of employment, then the usual rules for tax codes apply as per Tax Administration Act 1994 section 24B PAYE tax codes. If the employee hasn’t provided a completed IR330 within that first month then the no-notification rate should apply until they provide the tax code declaration. Note: that it is also legally possible for the Commissioner to advise the employer which tax code should be used, after that first month period has passed. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 22 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Sequence Task Associated Rules 1 Calculate employee’s pay amount for pay period. 2 Truncate pay period amount to whole dollars, $457.89 becomes $457. 3 Calculate amounts to be deducted.

Student loan deductions will take into consideration the repayment threshold – the flat rate will be on income above the repayment threshold. The tailored tax code/special deduction rate certificate (IR 23) shows a figure to deduct PAYE at the rate of XX cents per dollar. (XX =>rate on certificate) This amount includes earner’s levy of 1.60%. Note: The tailored tax code/deduction rate can only be used if the certificate covers the period (or parts of the period) 01/04/2024 to 31/03/2025 or longer. Special tax rates, including for schedular payments (tax code WT), can be an amount from zero to 100 cents per dollar. Where the person also has a student loan the certificate will provide the deduction rate to deduct student loan deductions. This will be anything from 0% – 12%. Where the employment is the main employment, the rate will apply to income above the pay period repayment threshold, e.g. $464 per week. Where the income is from secondary employment the threshold will not apply. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 29 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.9.1 Schedular Payment Provisions Student loan deductions, KiwiSaver deductions and contributions and the ACC Earners’ Levy do not apply to schedular payments (tax code WT). Most contractors can elect their own WT tax rate (no lower than 10%), which means they will not need to apply for a tailored tax code. However, there may be scenarios where the WT rate needs to be lower than 10% so a tailored tax code certificate will still be necessary.

Multiply pay period amount by the PAYE rate on IR 23. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 30 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.9.2 Special Deduction Rate (SDR) and Tailored Tax Codes (STC) A borrower may have a special deduction rate (SDR) applied to their salary or wage income. This can be used where the borrower is in hardship, or where they have more than one job and earn under the pay period repayment threshold in their main job. A SDR is any standard deduction rate less than 12 cents in every dollar. No SDR can be greater than 12 cents in every dollar. A borrower wanting deductions of more than 12 cents in every dollar should be using SLBOR – see 3.2 above. The SDR cannot be applied retrospectively. Borrowers will be provided with a Special Deduction Rate certificate which they provide to their employer. The certificate will continue to advise which tax code/SL repayment code (e.g. S SL) the employer should use, the rate at which the SL deductions are to be made, and the period that the SDR should apply to. The SDR will be a whole percentage only (e.g. 3% or 3 cents in the dollar), calculated to two decimal places (e.g. $0.03). The Special Deduction Rate Certificate may or may not require the pay period threshold to be used. For some tax codes the correct treatment can be inferred- e.g. "M SL" and "S SL" codes provide sufficient information as to whether or not the threshold is to be used. If the employee’s tailored tax code certificate expires and employer has not received either a replacement tailored tax code certificate or a new IR330/330C the employee tax rate would revert to the tax code specified on the previous IR330/IR330C provided to the employer. Where the employee has not previously provided an IR330/IR330C, then the employee would be placed on the No Notification tax rate until such time as an IR330/IR330C or tailored tax code certificate is provided. Special deduction rate and SLCIR – If an SDR is granted to a borrower, the Commissioner will cancel any SLCIRs that a borrower may have, regardless of employer. Special Deduction Rate and SLBOR – If a borrower currently has an SDR rate of 8 cents in every dollar for their secondary employment and also has additional deductions using the SLBOR repayment code of a set amount of $20.00 a week, the borrower would have standard deductions using a SL repayment code (e.g. S SL) at 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 31 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the rate of 8 cents in every dollar, and in addition has an extra $20 deducted for student loan using the SL repayment code SLBOR. Borrowers can continue to apply for a tailored tax code in respect of income tax. Where the borrower is entitled to reduced income tax and SL deductions, a Tailored Tax Code Certificate will be issued. The certificate will continue to advise employers to use the tailored tax code, the rate at which income tax should be deducted, the rate for SL deductions, and the period that the certificate should apply to. The following examples show what happens when a borrower has a Tailored tax code or Special Deduction Rate. Example One The borrower has been granted a tailored tax code due to hardship and has reduced SL and tax rates for the full year. The tailored tax code is valid from 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025, with tax at a flat 20% rate and SL deductions at 8 cents in every dollar. The tailored tax code certificate will state: • that the applicable period is the whole year (1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025) • that the STC tax code must be used • that the amount of tax will be calculated at 20% of earnings • that SL deductions will be calculated at 8 cents in every dollar, but note: o if this is the borrower’s main income SL deductions will be 8 cents in every dollar above the repayment threshold, which is 8 cents in every dollar of earnings in excess of $464 per week. o if this is their secondary employment, then SL deductions will be 8 cents of every dollar. o the certificate will state which of these scenarios applies. Example Two A borrower applies for a Special Deduction Rate (SDR) for their secondary employment, because they have an unused repayment threshold from their main employment. They do not currently have a reduced rate for tax. The SDR certificate will state: • that the SDR period is from 1 July 2024 to 30 September 2024 • that the tax code is S SL (or appropriate secondary employment SL) tax code • that SL deductions will be at the rate of 8 cents in every dollar (must be for every dollar of earnings as this is secondary income). In addition, the SDR certificate will state: 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 32 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • that from 1 October 2024 to 31 March 2025 the tax code will be SSL (or other secondary employment SL code) • that SL deductions will be at the rate of 12 cents in every dollar of earnings (must be for every dollar as this is secondary income). Example Three A borrower has an SDR in place for their second job, applicable from 1 July 2024 to 30 September 2024. They then apply for a reduced tax rate for that job. The original Special Deduction Rate certificate (see example two above) will be replaced with a Tailored Tax Code certificate. In this example the Tailored Tax Code certificate applies from 2 August 2024. The tailored tax code certificate would state - • for the period 2 August 2024 to 30 September 2024: o the tax code will be STC o tax will be calculated at the rate of 18 cents in every dollar of earnings o SL deductions will be at the rate of 8 cents in every dollar (as this is secondary employment it will be 8 cents of every dollar earned, and the certificate will make this clear). • for the period 1 October 2024 – 31 March 2025: o the tax code will be STC o tax will be calculated at rate of 18 cents of every dollar o SL deductions will be at the standard rate of 12 cents of every dollar (as this is secondary employment it will be 12 cents of every dollar earned, and the certificate will make this clear). 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 33 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example: Special Deduction Rate (certificate) Student loan special deduction rate certificate Inland Revenue PO Box 39050 Lower Hutt 5010 Date of issue: 15 March 2024 Telephone 0800-999-999 IRD Number 123-456-789 Certificate number DLN number This certificate is valid from 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025. Dear: ABC Employer For your employee James Smith, IRD number 123-456-789, you are authorised to: From 1 April 2024 to 30 June 2024 • use tax code SSL • make student loan deductions at the special deduction rate of 8 cents in each dollar of gross income. From 1 July 2024 to 31 March 2025 • use tax code SSL • make student loan deductions at the standard deduction rate from each dollar of gross income. This replaces any other student loan special deduction rate or repayment deduction exemption certificate we have issued previously for the same period for the above employee. Your employee must give you a new certificate when this one expires. If they do not, you will need to make student loan deductions at the standard deduction rate from each dollar of gross income. Please keep this certificate with your employee's wage records. For more information on the standard deduction rate go to www.ird.govt.nz (keywords: student loan glossary) Yours sincerely Name Title Please note - it is an offence to alter this certificate. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 34 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.9.3 Repayment deduction exemption All borrowers must use a SL repayment code (unless exempt). A borrower who is a full-time student, earning above the pay period repayment threshold, but below the annual repayment threshold, may be eligible to be exempt from SL repayment deductions. This means they do not also use the SL repayment code in combination with their tax code. The exemption cannot be applied retrospectively. If the borrower is exempt, Inland Revenue will provide the borrower with an exemption certificate, which they provide to their employer(s). The certificate will advise that they are not required to have SL deductions, which tax code (e.g. M instead of MSL) they should use, and the period for which the exemption will apply. The certificate will also provide instructions as to which tax code should be applied when the exemption ceases – e.g. MSL. Refer: Employer’s guide IR335 – page 8. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 35 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.10 Employee Share Schemes (ESS) Employers are able to tax benefits of an employee share scheme as an extra pay. It is not compulsory to do so, and employers can choose to withhold PAYE on an employee-by- employee basis and on a benefit-by-benefit basis for each employee. Note: When using the Employment Information return (EI) with the header record indicator HEI2, the taxable value of the benefit is to be shown in the Employee Share Scheme field. ESS benefits are to be shown on the EI except in the following circumstances; • share benefit arises from an exempt employee share scheme; or • the employer has elected not to make deductions from a share benefit provided to a former employee. The value of an ESS benefit is included as income for the purposes of: • Student loan deductions, • Child support payments, and • Working for Families tax credits However, ESS benefits are not liable for: • KiwiSaver deductions or employer contributions • the ACC Earners’ Levy The value of the ESS benefit is determined on the share scheme taxing date. The share scheme taxing date is the earlier of the date when: • the benefits are either transferred to a non-associated person or cancelled; or • the employee owns the shares as any other shareholder would without the terms of employment affecting the status of the ownership or value. Unless a share scheme beneficiary first transfers their share scheme benefits to a non- associate, or the company cancels them, the share scheme taxing date is when: • there is no material risk that beneficial ownership of the shares will change, or that the shares will be required to be transferred or cancelled; • the employee is not entitled to be compensated for a fall in the value of the shares; and • there is no material risk that there will be a change in the terms of the shares affecting their value. Example 1: - Simple vesting period Acme Limited (Acme) transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trust to hold for their employee, Alice. Alice only receives the shares from the trust if she stays employed by Acme for at least 3 years and she receives no benefit from or ownership of the shares if she leaves before 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] then. As the risk that Alice will leave the employment of Acme within the 3 years is material the share scheme taxing date is the date that Alice reaches 3 years employment with Acme. Example 2: - Vesting subject to misconduct Acme Limited transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trust to hold for their employee, Bob. Bob receives the shares 3 years after they are transferred to the trust as long as he is not dismissed for serious misconduct in this time. Bob will still be entitled to the shares if he ceases employment with 3 years as long as the employment is not ceased due to serious misconduct, so the share scheme taxing date is the date the shares are transferred to the trust as there is little risk that Bob will lose his entitlement to the shares. The taxable value of the ESS benefit must be reported based on the 20 th day after the share scheme taxing date. There are two methods an employer can use to determine when the taxable value of ESS benefit needs to be reported. Option 1 • If the 20th day falls between the 1st and 15th of a month the information must be reported treating the 15th as the payday. • If the 20th day falls between the 16th and the end of a month the information must be reported treating the last day of the month as the payday. Option 2 The employer can treat the 20th day as the payday and report the value of the ESS benefit to us more regularly. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 37 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 3 – Employee Share Scheme ESS (employer deducts PAYE) Treat the ESS benefits as lump sum payments, also known as extra pay. You do not need to deduct KiwiSaver or pay ACC Earners’ Levy. If your employee agrees, you can sell some shares to pay any tax owing. The employee has a tax code of M SL and receives a 4-weekly salary of $3,500.00. They contribute to KiwiSaver at 3% and have an ESCT rate of 17.5%.

PAYE and Student Loan calculations 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 40 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Extra pay (Lump Sum) – PAYE calculations – Primary Income Sequence Task Associated Rules 1 Determine Tax code 2 Calculate Student Loan deduction. Tax code = M SL, ME SL, or STC 2.1 Calculate pay for pay period, including normal pay and extra pay Include lump sum payments which are paid as annual or special bonuses, retiring or redundancy payments, gratuities or back pay. Exclude non-taxable amounts. This amount (normal pay plus extra pay) is referred to as “pay for the pay period” below. 2.2 Truncate pay for the pay period (ie before Student loan deduction) amount to whole dollars, $457.89 becomes $457. 2.3 Calculate student loan deductions. No special deduction rate certificate. If the pay for the pay period is less than student loan pay period repayment threshold, then the deduction is $0.00. If the pay for the pay period is more than the student loan pay period repayment threshold the calculation is: pay for the pay period minus the SL repayment threshold x 12%. If the borrower is on a tailored tax code the threshold may or may not apply - this will be clarified on the certificate. If a borrower has provided a special deduction rate certificate. If the pay for the pay period is less than student loan pay period repayment threshold, then the deduction is $0.00. If the pay for the pay period is more than student loan pay period repayment threshold the calculation is: pay for the pay period minus the SL repayment threshold x SDR rate. NB If the extra pay amount is not paid at the same time as the normal pay and the pay for the pay period cannot be calculated then multiply the entire extra pay amount by the appropriate student loan deduction rate. Eg 12% or SDR rate 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 41 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Sequence Task Associated Rules 2.3.1 Tailored Tax Code (STC) If a bonus is paid to an employee who has a tailored tax code, deduct tax at the rate shown on the certificate. For retiring or redundancy payments deduct tax at the tailored tax code rate (excluding ACC Earners’ Levy). The payment should be marked as “Earnings not liable for ACC Earners’ Levy” on the EI to avoid the ACC Earners’ Levy being forwarded to ACC. For example, a tailored tax code rate of 24% would be deducted at 22.40% (24%-1.60%) for retiring or redundancy payments. 2.4 Truncate amount to whole cents e.g. $45.789 becomes $45.78. If tax is calculated using a tailored tax code rate, sequence ends at this step. 3 Calculate PAYE 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 42 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Sequence Task Associated Rules 3.1 Calculate annualised income then add extra pay amount Identify the value of the PAYE income payments made in the four weeks prior to, and inclusive of the day on which the extra pay is paid. Note: Do not include any other amounts of extra pay that may have been made in that 4- week period. If in the four weeks prior, the employee was paid: - Four one-weekly pays – total of the four pays and multiply by 13 - Two fortnightly pays – total of the two pays and multiply by 13 - One four-weekly pays - multiply the amount by 13 - One monthly pay - multiply the amount by 12 In other circumstances, add all PAYE income payments made to the employee in the four weeks prior and multiply by 13. This amount is the annualised income. Add the amount of the extra pay to the annualised income to get the grossed-up amount. Example Pay period weekly at $1,000 per week with an extra pay of $500 included with the latest pay In the past four weeks (inclusive of this pay) the employee has had four weekly pays totalling $4,000 (exclude this extra pay $500). Multiply this by 13 X $4,000 = $52,000 Then add the extra pay $500 The Grossed-up amount = $52,500 Note: When a payment is made outside the normal pay cycle, the 4-week period ends on the day the payment is made. 3.2 Drop cents from the grossed-up amount (truncate to whole dollars), e.g. $14,000.90 becomes $14,000. 3.3 Determine Tax rate 3.4 If the employee has elected to have extra pays deducted at a higher rate, the tax rate is either 17.5%, 30%, 33% or 39% whichever they have elected. 3.5 If the grossed-up amount is greater than $180,000. Tax rate is 39%. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Sequence Task Associated Rules 3.5a If the grossed-up amount is greater than $70,000 $78,100 but less or equal to $180,000. Tax rate is 33%. Note: They can elect to deduct at 39%. 3.6 If the grossed-up amount is greater than $48,000 $53,500 but less or equal to $70,000 $78,100. Tax rate is 30%. Note: They can elect to deduct at 39% or 33%. 3.7 If the grossed-up amount is greater than $14,000$15,600 but less than or equal to $48,000 $53,500. Tax rate is 17.5%. Note: They can elect to deduct at 39%, 33% or 30%. 3.8 If the grossed-up amount is less than or equal to $14,000 $15,600. Tax rate is 10.5% Note: They can elect to deduct at 39%, 33%, 30% or 17.5%. 3.9 If tax rate was 10.5%. Record a flag showing extra pay deducted at the lowest rate. This would require a tick on the printed EI and a ‘1’ on the electronic file. 3.10 Calculate tax amounts to be deducted. 3.11 Multiply the extra pay amount by the tax rate determined. From step above– will be 10.5%, 17.5%, 30%, 33% or 39%. Do not round this figure. 4 Calculate ACC Earners’ Levy. 4.1 If the extra pay is redundancy, retirement allowance or Employee Share Scheme benefit. ACC Earners’ Levy is $0.00. 4.2 If the grossed-up amount does not exceed $142,283 ACC Earners’ Levy is the extra pay multiplied by 1.60%. 4.3 If the annualised income does not exceed $142,283, and the grossed-up amount exceeds $142,283 ACC Earners’ Levy is $142,283 minus the annualised income, multiplied by 1.60%. Please refer to example 1 below. Do not round this figure. 4.4 If the annualised income exceeds $142,283 ACC Earners’ Levy on the extra pay is $0.00. Please refer to example 2 below. 5 Calculate total tax to be deducted. 5.1 Add ACC Earners’ Levy and tax deducted. Do not round this figure. 5.2 Truncate amount to whole cents. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 44 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 1 If a bonus payment is $15,000.56 and the gross earnings for the last four weeks were 10,000: The last four weeks’ income $10,000 x 13 = annualised income $130,000. The total earnings $130,000 + bonus $15,000.56 = grossed up amount $145,000.56 The maximum ACC Earners’ Levy threshold is $142,283 The bonus payment means the grossed-up amount is in excess of ACC Earners’ Levy threshold, therefore: ACC Earners’ Levy on the lump sum is to be calculated as follows - ($142,283 - 130,000) x 1.60% = $196.52 In this example the tax to be deducted from the lump sum would be at 33% since the grossed- up amount exceeds $70,000 $78,100 giving $4,950.18 (15,000.56 lump sum amount) \*33% applicable rate) + ACC Earners’ Levy $196.52= $5,146.70 Note: Cents are not removed from bonus payment and final figure will not be rounded. Example 2 – If a bonus payment is $15,000 and the gross earnings for the last four weeks were $15,000 - The last four weeks’ income $15,000 x 13 = annualised income $195,000. The total earnings $195,000 + bonus $15,000 = grossed up amount $210,000. The maximum ACC Earners’ Levy threshold is $142,283. The annualised income is in excess of the ACC Earners’ Levy threshold, so the bonus payment is not liable for ACC Earners’ Levy In this example the tax to be deducted from the lump sum would be at 39% since the grossed- up amount exceeds $180,000 giving $5,850 (15,000.00 lump sum amount) \*39% applicable rate) + ACC Earners’ Levy $0 = $5,850 Example 3 – If a redundancy payment is $70,000, a final pay leave payment is $15,000 and the gross earnings for the last four weeks were $5,000 – The last four weeks’ income of $5,000 x 13 = annualised income of $65,000 The total earnings are $65,000 + $70,000 extra pay + $15,000 extra pay = grossed up amount of $150,000 The $70,000 redundancy payment is not liable for ACC Earners’ Levy Portion of grossed up amount liable for ACC Earners’ Levy is $80,000 The maximum ACC Earners’ Levy threshold is $ 142,283 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 45 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The grossed-up amount which is liable for ACC is below the ACC Earners’ Levy threshold, therefore: ACC Earners’ Levy on the lump sum is to be calculated as follows – $15,000 x 1.60% = $240.00 In this example the tax to be deducted from the total lump sum would be at 33% since the grossed-up amount of $150,000 ($65,000 + $15,000 + $70,000) exceeds $70,000 $78,100. This amounts to $28,050 ($85,000 total lump sum amount\*33% applicable rate) + ACC Earners’ Levy $240.00 = $28,290.00 Note: Cents are not removed from bonus payment and final figure will not be rounded. Example 4 – Extra pay is paid outside the standard pay period The employee has a tax code of M SL and receives a fortnightly salary of $1,128.00. They received a one-off bonus of $1,000 on 5 September. They receive a redundancy payment of $7,500 with their normal pay on 5 October. The calculation would look like this: Fortnightly gross wages $1,128 Four weekly gross wages $2,256 Multiplied by 13 $29,328 Plus, the redundancy payment $7,500 Annualised income plus redundancy pay $36,828 Tax rate to be applied to the redundancy payment 17.5% The student loan deduction would be calculated as follows: Fortnightly gross income $1,128 Plus, redundancy payment $7,500 Total payment for the fortnight $8,628 Minus fortnightly pay period threshold $928 Total $7,700 Student loan deductions (12% of $7,700) $924 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] However, in another scenario, the employee asks that the redundancy payment be made as soon as possible. The employer agrees to this and pays the redundancy payment on 28 September. In this case the calculation would look like this: Fortnightly gross wages $1,128 Four-weekly pays gross (Do not include $1,000 bonus payment in the gross) $2,256 Multiplied by 13 $29,328 Plus, the bonus payment $7,500 Annualised income plus extra pay $36,828 Tax rate to be applied to the redundancy payment 17.5% As the extra pay is not associated with a regular pay period, no regular student loan repayment threshold applies, and student loan deductions are calculated at 12% of the extra pay. Redundancy pay $7,500 Student loan deductions (12% of $7,500) $900.00 Example 5 - Signing bonus: The employee has a tax code of M and will receives a fortnightly salary of $1,128.00. They received a one-off Signing bonus of $10,000 on 5 September before commencing employment. Fortnightly gross wages $0.00 The bonus payment $10,000 Annualised income plus extra pay $10,000 Tax rate to be applied to the signing on bonus 10.5% The annualised income does come from previous amounts paid, so if no previous payments have been made then the annualised income will be zero. So, the default tax rate is based only on the amount of the extra pay. Note- the employee can notify their employer to choose a higher tax rate.

If in the four weeks prior, the employee was paid: - Four one-weekly pays – total of the four pays and multiply by 13 - Two fortnightly pays – total of the two pays and multiply by 13 - One four-weekly pays - multiply the amount by 13 - One monthly pay - multiply the amount by 12 In other circumstances, add all PAYE income payments made to the employee in the four weeks prior and multiply by 13. This amount is the annualised amount. Note: If the employee is paid monthly, but was not paid within the last four weeks, then the annualised amount will be zero. However, the employee can notify their employer to choose a higher tax rate. Refer to section RD 10(2 ). 3.2 Calculate low threshold amount The low threshold amount is determined by the tax code used by the employee: - If tax code = SB or SB SL then low threshold amount is $0. - If tax code = S or S SL then low threshold amount is $14,001$15,601. - If tax code = SH or SH SL then low threshold amount is $48,001$53,501. - If tax code = ST or ST SL then low threshold amount is $70,001$78,101. - If tax code – SA or SA SL then low threshold amount is $180,001. 3.3 Calculate grossed amount Add the amount of the extra pay to the annualised amount and the low threshold amount.

Example 1 – all of bonus liable for ACC A taxpayer using the SH tax code receives a bonus payment of $1000 and the gross earnings $29,24the last four weeks were $500. • The last four weeks income ($500 x 13) = annualised amount $6,500. • The low threshold amount for the SH tax code is $48,001 53,501. • The extra pay $1,000 + the annualised amount $6,500 + low threshold amount $48,0001 $53,501= grossed amount $55,001.$61,001. • The correct tax rate for the bonus would be 30% since the grossed amount is greater than $48,000 $53,501 and less than $70,000. $78,100. • ACC Earners’ Levy would be calculated as the bonus $1000 \* 0.016. Example 2 – some of bonus not liable for ACC A taxpayer using the ST tax code receives a bonus payment of $40,000, and in the last two fortnights they have earned $1,347.50 from their second job ($650 and $697.50). • The last two fortnights ($650 +697.50) = Annualised income $1347.50 x 26 =$35,035 • The low threshold amount for the ST tax code is $70,001 $78,101. • The extra pay $40,000 + the annualised amount $35,035 + low threshold amount $70,001 $78,101= grossed amount of $145,036.$153,136. • The correct tax rate for the bonus would be 33% since the grossed amount is greater than $70,000 $78,100 but equal to or less than $180,000. PAYE on Bonus ($40,000 x 33%) = $13,200 • To calculate ACC Earner’s levy: o The annualised amount plus the low threshold amount is $145,036 .$153,136 o The grossed amount is $145,036.$153,136– this exceeds the maximum income liable for ACC amount of $142,283. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 52 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] o $ 145,036$153,136 (annualised amount plus low threshold amount) -$142,283 = $2,753 $10,853.

Add the regular bonus to the salary/wages for the pay period, then calculate PAYE as usual according to the employee’s tax code. Note: If the employee uses an M SL, ME SL, SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL code, student loan repayments must also be deducted from the bonus. The following steps refer only to PAYE, but the same method applies for employees with student loans. Monthly bonuses covering more than one pay period 1. Add up the gross wages paid for a month’s income, eg if you pay weekly, add the four weekly payments together. 2. Work out the PAYE on the gross wages for the month 3. Add the bonus to the gross wages calculated at step 1 and work out the PAYE for the month on the total. 4. Subtract the PAYE calculated at step 2 from that calculated at step 3. This gives you the PAYE on the bonus. Bonuses covering more than one month 1. Divide the bonus by the number of months it covers. This gives you the monthly bonus amount. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 53 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2. Add the monthly bonus to the normal pay for the month and calculate PAYE. Select monthly in the PAYE calculator. 3. Calculate the PAYE on the normal monthly pay and subtract this amount from the PAYE calculated at step 2 above. This gives you the PAYE on the monthly bonus. 4. Multiply this by the number of months the bonus covers to get the total PAYE to be deducted from the bonus. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 54 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.15 Schedular Payments As per the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017, the following now applies: • Contractors (including companies) hired by labour-hire firms under a labour-hire arrangement have been added as a schedular payment type. • Most contractors are able to elect their own withholding rate, though there are exceptions to this relating to Non-Resident contractors, Non-resident entertainers, and professional sports people. This is done on an IR330c Tax rate notification for contractor's form (follow the link for details of this form: https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/withholding-taxes/schedular- payments). This form specifies that their tax code is WT, and what their elected deduction rate is, which can be between 10 and 100%. • If the contractor provides their name and IRD number but does not or cannot elect a rate, use the table below to determine the standard rate to use, unless they provide a tailored tax code certificate or a certificate of exemption on schedular payments (follow the link for details of this certificate: https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/withholding-taxes/schedular- payments/getting-schedular-payments/certificates-of-exemption-for-schedular-payments). • A schedular payment type for persons wanting to voluntarily have tax deducted from their contractor income has been added. Voluntary schedular payments have a standard rate of 20 cents per dollar of the payment. • The Commissioner is also able to notify the payer of a specific tax rate to be deducted from payments made to a contractor. • The no-notification rate as applicable for WT has been standardised at 45 cents per dollar of the payment. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 55 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.15.1 Rates of tax for schedular payments Activity Standard rate No- notification rate ACC personal service rehabilitation payments (attendant care, home help, childcare, attendant care services related to training for independence and attendant care services related to transport for independence) paid under the Injury Prevention and Rehabilitation Compensation Act 2001. 0.105 0.45 Agricultural contracts for maintenance, development, or other work on farming or agricultural land 0.15 0.45 Agricultural, horticultural, and viticulture contracts by companies and other contractors, including supply of labour for pruning and/or thinning of fruit trees or vines, and picking and/or packing of fruit or grapes 0.15 0.45 Cleaning office, business, institution, or other premises (except residential) or cleaning or laundering plant, vehicles, furniture, etc. 0.20 0.45 Commissions to insurance agents and sub-agents and salespeople 0.20 0.45 Company director’s fees 0.33 0.45 Contracts wholly or substantially for labour only in the building industry 0.20 0.45 Demonstrating goods or appliances 0.25 0.45 Entertainers (New Zealand resident only) such as lecturers, presenters, participants in sporting events, and radio, television, stage and film performers 0.20 0.45 Examiners (fees payable) 0.33 0.45 Forestry or bush work of all kinds, planting, sowing or gathering vegetables, or flax planting or cutting 0.15 0.45 Freelance contributing to newspapers, journals, etc. (articles, photographs, cartoons, etc.) or for radio, television or stage productions 0.25 0.45 Gardening, grass or hedge cutting, or weed or vermin destruction (for an office, business or institution) 0.20 0.45 Honoraria (including payments to Mayors, chairpersons and members of council, boards of trustees, boards, committees and official clubs or societies, etc.) 0.33 0.45 Jockeys’ or drivers’ apprentices 0.15 0.45 Modelling 0.20 0.45 Non-resident contractors who are not companies 1 : • construction work, installation, assembly and similar projects • professional or technical services for such projects • hire of equipment or personnel (other than as employees) 0.15 0.45 Non-resident contractors who are a company 1 0.15 0.20 Non-resident entertainers and professional sports people visiting New Zealand 2 0.20 N/A Payments made to contractors under a labour-hire arrangement, includes payments to individuals and companies. 3 0.20 0.45 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 56 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Activity Standard rate No- notification rate Payments for: • mail contracting • transport of school children • milk delivery • refuse removal, street or road cleaning • Caretaking or acting as a watchman 0.15 0.45 Proceeds from sales of: • eels, greenstone, whitebait, Sphagnum moss (not retail sales) • wild deer, pigs, or goats or parts of these animals 0.25 0.45 Public office holders (fees) 0.33 0.45 Share fishing (on contract for the supply of labour only) 0.20 0.45 Shearing or droving 0.15 0.45 Television, video or film; on-set and off-set production processes (New Zealand residents only) 0.20 0.45 Voluntary schedular payments Other contractors who are not required to have any form of PAYE deductions can, with the agreement of the payer, opt to have payments made to them treated as a schedular payment. 0.20 0.45 1 Non-resident contractors cannot elect below 15% 2 Non-resident entertainers and professional sports people visiting New Zealand cannot elect their own rate.

Schedular payments should not include or be included in earnings as an employee. If paying both normal earnings as an employee and schedular payments, you must record one line on the EI as an employee with normal tax code and one line for the schedular payment with WT code. GST If the payee is GST-registered, exclude deducted GST from the payment before calculating tax on schedular payments. Only the GST exclusive amount has tax on schedular payments deducted. For example, a payment of $115 (GST inclusive) is due to the payee; exclude the GST component of $15. Deduct the tax on schedular payments (e.g. 20%) from the remaining $100 to calculate the net amount excluding GST. The amount on the EI will show Gross $100, tax on schedular payments of $20.00, earnings not liable for EL of $100 and a tax code of WT. Add the amount of GST back to the net amount to calculate the net payment to the payee (e.g., $80 net amount plus $15 GST = $95). The amount of GST is not included on the EI. If a declaration has been filled out with all details Tax = (Standard or Elected Rate) \* (Earnings) Else Tax = (No Not. Rate) \* (Earnings) In both cases truncate the tax amount to whole dollars and cents. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 58 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.16 Child Support Employer Deduction Notice YL0010 Inland Revenue Child Support can send you a notice telling you to deduct, amend or stop child support payments from your employee’s next pay. The notice shows: • Your employee’s name and IRD number. • The frequency and payday that you must start, amend or stop child support deductions. • The amount to deduct from each pay. • Employee reference number (currently only for MSD/ACC). • Do not make any deductions before the start date on the notice. • If the payday or pay frequency on the notice is different from your actual payday or frequency, please contact us so we can update our records. Incorrect information will mean the deductions we have calculated may not cover the amount of child support the employee needs to pay. • If you have more than one employee you need to make child support deductions for, we will send you a consolidated deduction notice for all employees you need to start, stop of change child support deductions for. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 59 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.16.1 Protected net earnings All employees must be allowed to keep 60% of their net pay, after tax and child support and any other attachment order is deducted. This is the employee’s ‘protected net earnings’, to cover living expenses. Note that student loan repayment obligations are not considered a tax when calculating protected net earnings. ‘Protected net earnings’ only apply to child support payments (and other attachment orders as described in the following section). You must still make other deductions, such as student loan repayments, KiwiSaver or ACC Earners’ Levy. However, insurance, superannuation and union fees may be deducted subject to the Wages Protection Act 1983. Child support and any other attachment order deductions cannot exceed 40% of the net pay. Note: Employee Share Scheme benefits are treated as a PAYE income payment for the purposes of this calculation when the employer has elected to withhold PAYE. Do not include ESS amounts in Gross Earnings or PAYE below if the employer has not elected to withhold PAYE. 1 Calculate Net Pay 4. Calculate Child Support Deduction Amount 2.

Section 157 (3) of the District Court Act states that where an attachment order is working alone or in conjunction with one of a number of possible notices (child support, tax arrears, parentage test costs, social security debts), the protected net earnings rule applies in all situations upon these attachment orders; whether included with a child support notice or not. (Please note, Inland Revenue arrears orders are based on gross earnings). In these situations, the protected net earnings rate is the higher of: • 60% of the post-tax earnings for the period, or • the minimum level of income specified in the notice, as provided by Section 156 (d) of the District Court Act 2016. For example, an employee who earns $2,000 a week has protected net earnings of the higher of 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 61 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] $1,514, or any level set by the District Court. In situations where the employee has one or more attachment orders in addition to a child support notice, the child support payment should always be deducted ahead of any other attachment orders. The following order of rank should apply: 1. Child support 2. Other attachment orders 3. ACC levy 4. Student loan repayments 5. KiwiSaver employee contribution 6. Other voluntary deductions Note: ACC levy is excluded when calculating protected net earnings on attachment orders. 5.17 Payroll Giving Payroll Giving grants employees an immediate tax credit for their donation(s) to a donee organisation (listed on Inland Revenue’s Donee List) where the donation is made using their employer’s Payroll Giving scheme. The tax credits for payroll donations are used to reduce the amount of PAYE paid by the employee. Payroll Giving is voluntary for both employers and employees. Tax credits for payroll donations are reported via an electronic Employment Information return (the EI in myIR). Payroll Giving is only available to employees of employers who file their EI and payment form electronically. The same calculation is used to calculate tax credits for payroll donations for all tax codes and all annual incomes equally: Tax Credit for Payroll Donation = Total Donation x 0.333333 The amount is truncated to whole cents i.e. calculate to 2 decimal places, do not round up or down. Before making a donation, individuals must have met all tax obligations and any payments legally required to be deducted from their pay. These include: • PAYE (tax and ACC Earners’ Levy) • Student Loan • Child Support • KiwiSaver The Maximum tax credit for payroll donations is limited to the ‘Tax’ element of PAYE i.e., PAYE minus ACC Earners’ Levy equals ‘Tax’. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 62 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Timeframe for Passing Donations Donations are deducted from employee’s salary or wages by the employer and passed directly to the chosen donee organisation. Donations need to be passed to the donee organisation on or before the due date for your PAYE payment, whichever is closest to the end of the two months from the last day of the pay period that the donation was deducted. Keeping Sufficient Records Employers and PAYE intermediaries must keep sufficient records of the amount of any payroll donation deducted from an employee’s pay to enable Inland Revenue to determine that payroll donations have been transferred to the correct recipient. For additional information on payroll giving please refer to the link below: https://www.ird.govt.nz/employing-staff/deductions-from-income/payroll-giving 5.18 Inland Revenue arrears payments An employer may receive a notice from us requiring them to deduct tax, student loan arrears or family tax credit over payments from an employee’s wage (a section 157 notice). The notice will explain how to calculate the required amounts. Child support payments must be deducted before tax and student loan arrears and Working for Family Tax Credit over-payments. Note: This is a different situation from the student loan process for significant under-deductions, where the employer would be instructed to use the SLCIR deductions field. Note: The notice received refers to weekly pay periods. If the employee is not paid weekly, you need to multiply the deduction amount to suit the pay period. The payments need to be sent to IR by the end of each calendar month, completely separate from PAYE payments. They should not appear on the EI. If the payment is to be made electronically, please specify the employee’s IRD number, tax type, period and amount. If it is not made electronically, the details should be supplied on a separate piece of paper. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 63 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Note: In certain circumstances, deduction notices for fixed amounts different from the lesser of the 10% of the sum in default as per notice or 20% of gross pay, may be issued. 5.18.1 Other Child Support deduction notices for WT payers In some cases, a notice may specify a percentage of the net pay is to be deducted. These deductions are paid directly to Inland Revenue using the customer’s IRD number and tax type NCP (Non-Custodial Parent). When using a percentage deduction, the maximum amount that can be requested by Inland Revenue is 40% of their net pay. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 64 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Non-Filing Information This section contains information for Payroll developers not directly related to filing information via myIR. 5.19 Initiating electronic payments using payroll software packages If your package is able to initiate electronic payments to us, then you need to ensure that the correct payment reference details are supplied for your client. If the details are incorrect, delays in processing these payments can occur. There are two different tax type codes that relate to employer deducted payments. If the payment includes a combination of the following, you can use the employer deductions (DED) code: • PAYE • Child Support deductions • Student Loan repayment deductions • Employer superannuation contribution tax • KiwiSaver deductions for employees • Net KiwiSaver employer contributions If the payment is being made for PAYE intermediary purposes, the intermediary employer deductions code (IED) must be used. 5.19.1 Electronic payment format requirements Employers (including PAYE intermediaries) will need to provide their bank with the following payment information: • Payee name:” Inland Revenue” • Amount: total amount of the payment • Our bank account details: “03 0049 0001100 27” • Particulars: Employer’s or PAYE intermediary’s IRD number • Payee code: “DED” or “IED” (see above). Leave the next box blank, then enter the period end date for the payment being processed i.e. (DDMMCCYY) • Reference: This can be used for your own personal reference. NOTE: These fields (IRD number, Tax Type code and Period End Date) are necessary in order for us to allocate the payment received correctly. Some software packages may already populate specific non-Inland Revenue information (e.g. an accounting reference) in either the particulars or payee code field and changing this is very difficult. Should this be the case, then you need to ensure that the IR payment reference details are displayed in any remaining fields to minimise impacts for your clients and how their payments are processed. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 65 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.19.2 Particulars field This field simply represents the Employer or PAYE intermediary’s IRD number.

The information covered in this section shows how FBT is calculated on the alternate rate calculation process and includes both the short-form and the full alternate rate calculation process, as well as the pooled alternate rate calculation. We also explain how to complete the adjustments required for shareholder-employees or those receiving attributed income where full remuneration details were unknown at the time of completing last year's fourth quarter or annual FBT return, and the adjustment for GST. For more information about FBT and the calculation process, please refer to the latest Fringe benefit tax guide (IR 409) or the Fringe benefit tax return guide (IR 425). These are available from our website at www.ird.govt.nz or by phoning SPK2IR (Speak to IR – formerly INFOexpress) on 0800 257 777. Shareholder-employee remuneration adjustment Employers who completed their fourth quarter or annual return last year without knowing all the remuneration details of shareholder-employees (or those receiving attributed income) and applied the 49.25% FBT rate to the value of the attributed benefits, must use the alternate rate calculation when making the remuneration adjustment. The calculation required is based on last year's remuneration and attributed benefit details for each individual, less the amount of FBT calculated and paid for each of those individuals in last year’s return. A remuneration adjustment sheet is included in our Fringe benefit tax return guide (IR 425) to assist with this calculation. GST on fringe benefits The GST payable is calculated on the taxable value of all benefits from Box 3 of the FBT return less the value of any benefits which are exempt or zero-rated supplies for GST purposes. The GST content of those supplies is to be shown in Box 7 of the FBT return for quarterly filers and Box 6 of the FBT return for annual and income year filers. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 67 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] For more information on FBT refer to the IR Website: https://www.ird.govt.nz/employing- staff/paying-staff/fringe-benefit-tax 5.20.2 Short-form alternate rate calculation The short-form alternate rate calculation option is a streamlined approach that allows all attributed benefits to be taxed at a flat rate of 63.93%, and all non-attributed benefits to be taxed at a flat rate of 49.25% (or 63.93% on fringe benefits provided to major shareholder- employees). This option is more likely to appeal to employers where all of their employees who receive attributed benefits earn more than $180,000. Under the short-form alternate rate option, employers simply add all attributed benefits provided to employees together and calculate the FBT on the combined figure at 63.93%. The non- attributed benefits are calculated the same way as they are under the full alternate rate option. 5.20.3 Full alternate rate calculation The following information shows how FBT is calculated on attributed fringe benefits using the full alternate rate calculation, using one employee as an example. The full alternate rate calculation is a five-step process explained under the heading “Full alternate rate calculation process”. For each employee who receives a benefit that is attributed to them, their employer must: • Retrieve gross cash remuneration information (gross salary or wages, bonuses or overtime and other taxable income from all entities within a company) • Apply the tax rates, shown in step 1 of the full alternate rate calculation (not the actual PAYE deducted based on the PAYE tax tables) to obtain a net cash remuneration amount. • Add the value of attributed taxable benefits for the year to the net cash remuneration • Apply FBT rates to this total amount (see step 4, Table B) • Apply FBT rates to the net cash remuneration amount. • Calculate the FBT payable by subtracting the FBT tax calculated on the gross wages net cash remuneration. Completion of this calculation for annual filers will give them their FBT to pay for each employee on the value of attributed benefits. Quarterly filers take off the previous three-quarters assessments. 5.20.4 Full alternate rate calculation process Step 1: Calculate net cash remuneration The employer calculates the net cash remuneration of each employee. This calculation takes the employee’s gross cash remuneration minus the tax on that income to get net cash remuneration 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 68 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] total. Table A (see below) sets out the current income tax rates used in the calculation. Cash remuneration is the employee’s gross salary or wages, bonuses, overtime and other taxable income from all entities associated with the company, including subsidiaries, for the year. For a major shareholder-employee it also includes any interest, or dividends received from the employer or a related employer. If an employee worked only part of the year, the cash remuneration is the amount paid to them during the year. Table A: Income tax rates Income tax range Cumulative Income tax per range Income tax rate From $0 to $14,000 $1,470.00 10.5% $14,001 to $15,600 $205.12 12.82% $14,001 $15,601 to $48,000 $7,420.00 $5,670 17.5% $48,001 to $70,000$53,500 $14,020.00 $1,190.20 21.64% $53,501 to $70,000 $4,950 30.0% $70,001 to $78,100 $2510.19 30.99% $70,00178,101 to $180,000 $50,320.00 $33,627 33.0% $180,001 upwards 39.0% Example: Employee A Gross cash Remuneration $78,333.00 Tax on first $78,100 $14,020.00 $15,995.51 Tax on remaining $233 @ 33.0% $2,749.89 $76.89 Tax on $78,333 = $16,769.89 $16,072.40 Therefore: Net cash remuneration $61,563.11 $62,260.60 Note: 1. When calculating the tax on the cash remuneration the gross cash remuneration total is in whole dollars. The tax amount is truncated to the second decimal place after. For example, if the tax amount calculated was $2,305.45674 the amount that would be shown as the tax on cash remuneration is $2,305.45. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 69 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Step 2: Calculate taxable value of attributed fringe benefits The employer calculates the taxable value of each attributed benefit received by the employee. For each employee they add all the taxable values, of all such benefits received for each quarter, to get the annual value of the benefits for each employee. These are obtained from the FBT taxable value calculation sheet that employers have completed in quarters one to four. Example: Quarter 1 total $1,272.00 Quarter 2 total $1,272.00 Quarter 3 total $1,177.60 Quarter 4 total $1,272.00 Total taxable value of benefit $4,993.60 For more details on attributed fringe benefits, and the thresholds that apply, please refer to the Fringe benefit tax guide (IR 409). Note: When adding the amount of benefits received by an employee, truncate figures to whole cents. Using the above example, the third quarter amount was calculated at $1,177.60814, but is shown as $1,177.60. Step 3: Fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration (FBICR) For each employee take the net cash remuneration (whole dollars only) calculated in step 1 and add the taxable value of attributed fringe benefits (whole dollars only) from step 2. This gives the fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration (FBICR) total against which the FBT alternate rates will be applied. Example: Employee A Net income $61,563.00 $62,260.00 Taxable value on benefit $ 4,993.00 FBICR $66,556.00 $ 67,253.00 Note: When transferring the fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration (FBICR) to step 4 this amount must be in whole dollars. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 70 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Step 4: Applying the alternate rates Tax on the FBICR is calculated using the rates in the table below. Table B: Fringe benefit tax rates Fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration Accumulative FBT per bracket FBT tax rate From $1 to $12,530 $1,469.76 11.73% $12,531 to $40,580 $7,419.16 21.21% $40,581 to $55,980 $14,019.60 42.86% $55,981 to $129,680 $50,316.85 49.25% $129,681 upwards 63.93% Example: Employee A FBICR (from step 3) $66,556.00 $ 67,253.00 FBT on first $55,980 $14,019.60 FBT on remaining $10,576 $11,273.00 @ 49.25% =$5,208.68 $5,551.95 FBT on $66,556.00 $ 67,253.00 $19,228.28 $19,571.55 Note: When calculating the tax on the fringe benefit-inclusive tax remuneration within each fringe benefit tax rate, the amount calculated is to the second decimal place after the decimal point so the FBT on $12,530 is $1,469.76 ($12,530 x 11.73% = $1,469.769). Using the above example, tax on the difference between $66,556 $67,253 and $55,980 is $10,576 $11,273 ($10,576.00 $11,273 x 49.25% = $5,208.68 $5,551.95). Step 5: Calculating the FBT on net cash remuneration Take the net cash remuneration (step 1) and calculate the FBT on this using Table B (in step 4) Example: Employee A Net cash remuneration (from step 1) $62,260.00 FBT on first $55,980 $14,019.60 FBT on remaining $6,280.00 @ 49.25% = $3,092.90 FBT on $62,260 = $17,112.50 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 71 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Step 6: Calculating the FBT liability Take the tax on the FBICR (step 4) and subtract the FBT tax on the net income (step 5). This gives the amount of fringe benefit tax the employer should have paid for that employee on the value of attributed benefits in that year. Example: Employee A Tax on FBICR of $19,228.28 Less FBT tax on net cash remuneration $16,769.89 FBT liability for employer $2,458.39 $19,571.55 $17,112.50 $2,459.05 Step 7: FBT to pay The annual FBT liability for the employer is the: • FBT calculated on attributed fringe benefits for each employee plus the • FBT payable on the non-attributed fringe benefits. The FBT payable on the taxable value of non-attributed benefits is calculated at a flat FBT rate of 49.25% (or 63.93% if received by major shareholder-employees or an associated person, if the benefits received by that associated person were not as an employee). Quarterly filers If the employer is a quarterly filer, the amount of FBT assessed in the previous quarters is subtracted from the total to get the amount to pay in the final quarter. FBT to pay is transferred to Box 6 on the Quarterly return (IR 420). Example: Employee A FBT liability for employer $2,458.39 Less FBT assessed in quarters 1 to 3 $1,600.28 FBT to pay in final quarter $858.11 $2,459.05 $1832.58 $626.45 The employer may be entitled to a refund if the annual FBT liability is less than the FBT assessed in quarters 1-3. 5.20.5 Annual filers If the employer is an annual or income year filer, the total FBT to pay is $2,458.39$2,459.05. This is transferred to Box 5 on the annual or income year return IR 422 or IR 421. 5.20.6 Pooled alternate rate calculation The pooled alternate rate option is available from the 2021-22 tax year onwards. This option works in a similar way to the short form alternate rate option. The sole difference between these 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 72 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] options is that under the pooled alternate rate option, attributed benefits are divided into two pools, with one pool taxed at the 63.93% rate and the other at the 49.25% rate. This option is intended to strike a better balance between accuracy and simplicity for many employers than the other FBT payment options. Employers who predominantly provide attributed benefits to employees who earn less than $180,000 in gross cash pay, especially if all or most of those employees earn within the “safe harbour” thresholds outlined below, are expected to benefit the most from this option. By default, the 49.25% rate pool comprises benefits provided to employees whose remuneration is within the following “safe harbour” thresholds: 1 • Attributed benefits of up to $13,400 • Cash pay of up to $160,000. The 63.93% rate pool comprises benefits provided to employees earning above the safe harbour thresholds. Pooled alternate rate example: Employee X Company A employs full-time and part-time staff in a range of roles requiring different skill sets, qualifications, and levels of experience. Salaries range from $30,000 to $170,000. However, only Employee X earns $170,000 before tax, with the next highest-paid employee earning $120,000 before tax. In the 2021–22 tax year, Company A provides fringe benefits totalling $100,000 to all its staff members in the form of subsidised transport and some low interest, employment-related loans. No individual staff member received more than $6,000 in attributed benefits, so none of Company A’s staff received anywhere near $13,400 in attributed benefits. Employee X received attributed benefits to the value of $5,000. Company A has calculated its FBT (Fringe Benefit Tax) liability for attributed benefits for the first three quarters of the 2021–22 tax year under section RD 59(2). This means it paid FBT at the 1 The exception to this rule is explained below at ‘Option to pay FBT at 49.25% rate for employees receiving all-inclusive pay below $129,681’. Treatment of non-attributed benefits Non-attributed benefits provided to employees that are not major shareholders are still pooled and taxed at the 49.25% rate, while any non-attributed benefits provided to employees who are major shareholders, or to persons associated with an employee who is a major shareholder, are still required to be pooled and taxed at the 63.93% rate. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 73 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] rate of 49.25% of the taxable value of attributed benefits for those first three quarters. As fringe benefits totalling $75,000 were provided in the first three quarters, Company A has paid FBT of $36,937.50 for that period. Company A decides to use the pooled alternate rate option to calculate its FBT liability for the final quarter of 2021–22. When preparing the FBT return for the final quarter, Company A identifies that only one employee earned above the safe harbour limit of $160,000 in cash pay for the 2021–22 tax year, being Employee X. Company A accordingly pays FBT on the taxable value of fringe benefits attributed to Employee X at the top rate of 63.93%. FBT for Employee X: Company A’s FBT liability for Employee X for the 2021–22 year is $3,196.50 ($5,000 × 63.93%). FBT for other employees: The total FBT payable for all other employees for the 2021–22 year is calculated by subtracting the taxable value of benefits attributed to Employee X from the taxable value of attributed benefits Company A provided to all its staff during 2021–22 and then applying the 49.25% rate to this amount. The taxable value of attributed benefits Company A provided to all its staff during 2021–22 is $100,000. Employee X received $5,000 of these benefits. This means that the total FBT payable for Company A’s employees (excluding Employee X) for the 2021–22 tax year is $46,787.50 (($100,000 - $5,000) × 49.25%). Total FBT liability: Therefore, Company A’s total FBT liability for all employees (including Employee X) for the 2021– 22 tax year is $49,984 ($46,787.50 + $3,196.50). As Company A has already paid $36,937.50 in FBT for the first three quarters of the 2021–22 tax year, the FBT payable for the final quarter is $13,046.50 ($49,984 - $36,937.50). Option to pay FBT at 49.25% rate for employees receiving all-inclusive pay below $129,681 Employers may also choose to pay FBT at the 49.25% rate on benefits attributed to employees who receive less than $129,681 in all-inclusive pay, even if the employee receives more than $160,000 in cash pay or more than $13,400 in attributed benefits. Provided the requirement around the level of the employee’s all-inclusive pay is met, this choice is available to an employer even if the employee earns above either of the safe harbour thresholds outlined above. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 74 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.21 ESCT (employer’s superannuation contribution tax) ESCT is a tax paid on employer superannuation cash contributions (employer contributions). ESCT is paid on all employer contributions made after the employer either starts new employment (auto-enrolment into KiwiSaver) or the employer has been given notice to make KiwiSaver deductions (KS2 from employee or letter from IRD). ESCT applies to all employer contributions from that date onwards regardless of the pay period the payment may be for. 5.21.1 Options for calculating tax on employer contributions ESCT can be calculated by the employer: • using a progressive rate based on the employee’s salary scale (see Table 1 below) or, • at the employees request all or part of the value of the employer superannuation contribution can be included in the employee’s gross salary or wages and taxed at their personal tax rates as per RD 68 (1) of the ITA (Income Tax Act) 2007. Table 1 Income Tax Act 2007 RD 68 Choosing to have amount treated as salary or wages Amount treated as salary or wages 1. With the agreement of their employer who makes an employer's superannuation cash contribution on their behalf, an employee may choose to have some or all of an employer's superannuation cash contribution made on their behalf treated as salary or wages under the PAYE rules.

Example - when an employee is a member of KiwiSaver Rachel is employed by Company Q Ltd\*. She is a KiwiSaver member. Her employment agreement includes Company Q Ltd\* contributing $15 (3%) a week to her KiwiSaver scheme, in addition to her normal weekly salary of $500.03. Rachel chooses, and her employer agrees, to have these contributions included as part of her salary. This means Company Q Ltd\* uses the total of her salary and the employer contributions of $515.03 to calculate her PAYE. Note: Any student loan deductions, working for family tax credit entitlements or child support obligations the employee may have will be calculated on the new Gross amount of $515.03. ACC employer levies will increase due to the new gross as well.

If the employee has not been employed the full previous tax year, then the employer estimates what their earnings would be for a whole year. Under section RD 67(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007, the amount of tax is determined by applying the relevant rate given by Table 1 to each dollar of an employer’s superannuation contribution: Income Tax Act 2007 RD 67 Calculating amounts of tax for employer's superannuation cash contributions The amount of tax for an employer’s superannuation cash contribution is the amount determined under Schedule 1, part D, clause 1 (Basic tax rates: income tax, ESCT, RSCT, RWT (Resident Withholding Tax), and attributed fringe benefits) Note: Schedule 1, Part D, clause 2 has been repealed. Income Tax Act 2007 Basic rates for ESCT given by Table 1 Amount of tax for section RD 67(a) Under section RD 67(a), the amount of tax is determined by applying the relevant rate given by table 1 to each dollar of an employer’s superannuation contribution.

Therefore, the ESCT rate threshold is set at the beginning of the tax year and cannot change until the following year when the rate is re-calculated. 5.21.6 Employer contribution and ESCT calculated using whole dollars and cents KiwiSaver legislation requires the following rules to be applied to the calculation for employer contribution: • employer contribution is to be based on complete dollars and cents i.e. $861.85 and not just $861 • ESCT is calculated based on the last amount i.e. $51 and not $51.71. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 82 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.22 ESCT rate calculation examples 5.22.1 Employee with employer for whole tax year Note: Use employee’s actual earnings from previous tax year An employee has earned $50,000 total income and has been employed by his employer for the full previous tax year. The employee has also received a gross employer superannuation contribution of $4000 (8% of the employee’s gross salary or wage) and the employer has paid other superannuation on behalf of the employee of $216.00 (total employer superannuation contributions are $4,216.00). The ESCT threshold rate is calculated as follows: Total income $50,000.00 Total Superannuation Contribution $ 4,216.00 ------------ Total ESCT threshold amount is $54,216.00 ======= The tax rate that the ESCT will be deducted is 0.175 or 17.5%.

Check the valid range • If the IRD number is < 10-000-000 or > 150-000-000 then the number is invalid. This step ensures that the IRD number is in the already issued range or is in the range expected to be issued in the next 10 years. 2. Form the eight-digit base number: • Remove the trailing check digit. • If the resulting number is seven digits long, pad to eight digits by adding a leading zero. 3. Calculate the check digit: • To each of the base number’s eight digits a weight factor is assigned. From left to right these are: 3, 2, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. • Sum together the products of the weight factors and their associated digits. • Divide the sum by 11. If the remainder is 0, the calculated check digit is 0. • If the remainder is not 0, subtract the remainder from 11, giving the calculated check digit. • If the calculated check digit is in the range 0 to 9, go to step 5. • If the calculated check digit is 10, continue with step 4. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 87 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4. Re-calculate the check digit : • To each of the base number’s eight digits a secondary weight factor is assigned. From left to right these are: 7, 4, 3, 2, 5, 2, 7, 6. • Sum together the products of the weight factors and their associated digits. • Divide the sum by 11. If the remainder is 0, the calculated check digit is 0. • If the remainder is not 0 then subtract the remainder from 11, giving the calculated check digit. • If the calculated check digit is 10, the IRD number is invalid. 5. Compare the check digit: • Compare the calculated check digit to the last digit of the original IRD number. If they match, the IRD number is valid. Example 1 IR number 49091850. The base number is 4909185 and the supplied check digit is 0. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (0\*3) + (4\*2) + (9\*7) + (0\*6) + (9\*5) + (1\*4) + (8\*3) + (5\*2) = 154. 154 / 11 = 14 remainder 0 (i.e. mod (154,11) = 0) The remainder (0) = check digit (0), so no further calculation is necessary. Example 2 IR number 35901981. The base number is 3590198 and the supplied check digit is 1. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (0\*3) + (3\*2) + (5\*7) + (9\*6) + (0\*5) + (1\*4) + (9\*3) + (8\*2) = 142. 142 / 11 = 12 remainder 10 (i.e. mod (142,11) = 10) 11 – 10 = 1 which matches the check digit. The number is valid. Example 3 IR number 49098576. The base number is 4909857 and the supplied check digit is 6. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (0\*3) + (4\*2) + (9\*7) + (0\*6) + (9\*5) + (8\*4) + (5\*3) + (7\*2) = 177. 177 / 11 = 16 remainder 1 (i.e. mod (177,11) = 1) 11 – 1 = 10 so perform the secondary calculation. (0\*7) + (4\*4) + (9\*3) + (0\*2) + (9\*5) + (8\*2) + (5\*7) + (7\*6) = 181 181 / 11 = 16 remainder 5 (i.e. mod (181,11) = 5) 11 – 5 = 6, this matches the check digit. The number is valid. 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 88 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 4 (9-digit IRD number) IR number 136410132. The base number is 13641013 and the supplied check digit is 2.

Using the weightings above: (1\*3) + (3\*2) + (6\*7) + (4\*6) + (1\*5) + (0\*4) + (1\*3) + (3\*2) = 89. 89 / 11 = 8 remainder 1 (i.e. mod (89,11) = 1) 11 – 1 = 10 so perform the secondary calculation. (1\*7) + (3\*4) + (6\*3) + (4\*2) + (1\*5) + (0\*2) + (1\*7) + (3\*6) = 75 75 / 11 = 6 remainder 9 (i.e. mod (75,11) = 9) 11 – 9 = 2 which matches the check digit. The number is valid. Example 5 (9-digit IRD number) IR number 136410133. The base number is 13641013 and the supplied check digit is 3. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (1\*3) + (3\*2) + (6\*7) + (4\*6) + (1\*5) + (0\*4) + (1\*3) + (3\*2) = 89. 89 / 11 = 8 remainder 1 (i.e. mod (89,11) = 1) 11 – 1 = 10 so perform the secondary calculation. (1\*7) + (3\*4) + (6\*3) + (4\*2) + (1\*5) + (0\*2) + (1\*7) + (3\*6) = 75 75 / 11 = 6 remainder 9 (i.e. mod (75,11) = 9) 11 – 9 = 2, this does not match the check digit (3). The number is invalid. Example 6 IR number 9125568. The number is less than 10,000,000 so fails the first validation.

For processing at Inland Revenue, the fields for the individual account number parts are all of maximum size. If less than the maximum number of digits is supplied, then values are right justified, and the fields padded with zeroes (where applicable). 7.1 Validation step 1 The first step in the validation process is to verify the Bank ID number. This number can then be used to derive the appropriate algorithm code for that bank. Once the appropriate algorithm code has been derived, the second whole account number validation step must be performed as outlined in Validation Step 2 on the following page. Current valid Bank IDs and their associated algorithms are included in this table: Bank ID Algorithm 01 A or B (see note) 02 A or B (see note) 03 A or B (see note) 04 A or B (see note) 05 A or B (see note) 06 A or B (see note) 08 D 10 A or B (see note) 11 A or B (see note) 12 A or B (see note) 13 A or B (see note) 14 A or B (see note) 15 A or B (see note) 16 A or B (see note) 17 A or B (see note) 18 A or B (see note) 19 A or B (see note) 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 90 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Bank ID Algorithm 20 A or B (see note) 21 A or B (see note) 22 A or B (see note) 23 A or B (see note) 24 A or B (see note) 25 F 27 A or B (see note) 30 A or B (see note) 31 X 38 A or B (see note) 88 A or B (see note) Note: If the account base number is below 00990000 then apply algorithm A, otherwise apply algorithm B. The actual branch numbers in use change from time to time, and are included in the Bank Branch Register, which gets updated monthly. A link to this register on the paymentsNZ website is included here: https://www.paymentsnz.co.nz/resources/industry-registers/bank-branch-register/ To request monthly updates to the Bank Branch Register, use this email address: branchregister@paymentsnz.co.nz 7.2 Validation step 2 The second validation step is a modulus n algorithm applied to the whole account number. The algorithm type is derived from the table on the previous page. Follow this process: 1. Identify the corresponding weight factor for every digit in the account number as shown in the table below. Note: all fields (i.e., bank ID, bank branch, account base and account suffix) are right justified and padded with zeroes. 2. Add together the products of the weight factors and their associated account number digit.

Student Loan deductions rate and thresholds 2021/22 2022/23 Student Loan annual repayment threshold $20,280 $21,268 Student Loan repayment rate Primary Income: 12% per $ over repayment threshold Secondary Income: 12% Student Loan pay period repayment thresholds Weekly pay period (Threshold divided by 52) $390 $409 Fortnight pay period (Threshold divided by 26) $780 $818 Monthly pay period (Threshold divided by 12) $1,690 $1,772.33 Four weekly pay period (Threshold divided by 13) $1,560 $1,636 2.3 New option for calculating fringe benefit tax (FBT) Amendments contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Bill provide employers with a new pooled alternate rate option for calculating fringe benefit tax (FBT). The Bill is expected to be enacted before the end of March 2022. The new pooled alternate rate option for calculating FBT will be available for the 2021-22 and later income years. Under this new option, employers can choose to pay FBT at the flat rate of 49.25% on benefits attributed to employees who earn up to $160,00 in gross cash pay if the value of the benefits attributed to those employees is no more than $13,400 per employee (referred to as the “safe harbour” thresholds). FBT is payable at the flat rate of 63.93% on benefits attributed to all other employees. Alternatively, employers may choose to pay FBT at the 49.25% rate on benefits attributed to employees who receive less than $129,681 in all-inclusive pay, even if the employee receives more than $160,000 in cash pay or more than $13,400 in attributed benefits. Section 5.20 (Fringe Benefit Tax) has been updated to include information on this new calculation option. Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 3 Student Loans The student loan repayment rate (standard deduction rate) for all New Zealand-based borrowers is 12%. For a student loan borrower, the following student loan deductions are made: • For main employment income, a deduction of the standard deduction rate from the gross income over the pay period repayment threshold ($409 per week) should be made. • For secondary employment income, a deduction of the standard deduction rate from the gross income should be made. Other areas to note for student loans: Unused Repayment Threshold Special Deduction Rate (URT SDR): • If a borrower has more than one employer at the same time, and gross income from main employment is below the pay period repayment threshold, the borrower can apply to IR for an URT SDR to have the “unused” portion of the pay period threshold allocated to secondary employers. • For an URT SDR, the borrower is still required to use a “SL” repayment code (unless they also have a tailored tax code, in which case “STC” is the code to be used). • Depending on the amount of unused repayment threshold, the Student Loan deduction rate advised on the certificate could be anything from 0% to 11%. Repayment Deduction Exemption (RDE): • Borrowers who are studying full-time and expect their income for the year to be under the annual repayment threshold are eligible to apply for an RDE. • For the period of time an RDE is in effect, the borrower is exempt from having Student Loan deductions made from their salary and wages and does not have to use an “SL” repayment code. Therefore the Student Loan deductions are 0%. Commissioner deductions (SLCIR): • In the EI, the ‘SLCIR deductions’ field should be used for Commissioner deductions. • Commissioner deductions are extra deductions and may be required if the Student Loan standard deductions were less than the amount that should have been deducted. • IR will notify the borrower and employer if Commissioner deductions are required to be made. • Notification will specify the amount to be recovered, and the percentage to be deducted until that amount has been reached. • The maximum rate will be 5% on gross income (over the pay period repayment threshold) for primary employment earnings. • For secondary income this will be 5% on the gross payment of salary or wages. • However, the compulsory extra deduction notices refer to a deduction rate based on student loan standard deductions as per the example below. Example: How to calculate the compulsory extra deductions Employer receives a student loan compulsory extra deduction notice for their employee asking them to make the extra deductions at 41.67% of the employees’ student loan standard deduction.

KiwiSaver members can make a contribution of 3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10% of their wages. They may change their contribution rate at any time by advising their employer. The default contribution rate is 3% if no rate is elected. 4.1 Employers who must contribute to member savings The Crown legislated employers with employees who contribute to KiwiSaver schemes and/or complying funds to make Compulsory Employer Contributions (CEC) from 1 April 2008. For KiwiSaver purposes, CEC must start from: • the first pay after an employee starts new employment, or • the first pay after the employer receives notice from IR or the employee that they have become a member of a KiwiSaver scheme. The minimum Compulsory Employer Contribution for pay periods commencing on or after 1 April 2013 is 3%. 4.2 Employers who need not contribute to member savings Employers do not need to contribute to KiwiSaver and Complying Funds as well as other schemes if an employee belongs to several schemes (if certain requirements are met). An employee who belongs to a Registered Superannuation Scheme (RSS) or Complying Fund may also join a KiwiSaver scheme. Employers are not required to make compulsory contributions if they already contribute to a scheme on behalf of the member (if certain conditions are met). Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] To avoid employers being forced to contribute more than once, any employer contribution to an RSS, Complying Fund or KiwiSaver scheme may qualify as compulsory employer contributions if, as per section 101D(5) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006: 1. employer superannuation contributions (the contributions) are made to a registered superannuation scheme (the contributions scheme); and the contributions scheme was registered before 17 May 2007, or the contributions scheme is one (a succeeding scheme) for which there is, due to all relevant members transferring to the succeeding scheme by virtue of section 9BAA of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989, a prior registered superannuation scheme (a prior scheme) and that prior scheme or another prior scheme for the contributions scheme were registered before 17 May 2007; and the employer provided access for employees generally to the contributions scheme or a prior scheme for the contributions scheme before 17 May 2007; and the employee is - 1. employed by the employer before 1 April 2008, and the employer makes or has agreed with the employee to make employer superannuation contributions for the employee before 1 April 2008 to the contributions scheme or a prior scheme for the contributions scheme; or 2. covered by a collective agreement that is in force before 17 May 2007 and expires after 1 April 2008 3. someone who has had contributions paid or credited to the contributions scheme or a prior scheme for the contributions scheme by a previous employer, and those contributions met the requirements described in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 above. Employer contributions which satisfy the paragraphs above, must also vest completely in the employee no later than 5 years after the employee joins the contributions scheme. Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Employer contributions to an RSS scheme, which meets the requirements listed above, count towards the compulsory employer contribution, even if the scheme does not have similar lock- in rules to Complying Funds or KiwiSaver schemes. This policy prevents an employer being forced to contribute twice, once because an employee belongs to an RSS, which requires employer contributions and a second time because the same employee joins a KiwiSaver scheme or complying fund. If an employee is a member of a defined benefit scheme, their employer is not liable to pay CEC for that or any other scheme that employee may belong to. The table below summarises employer obligations where employees belong to several superannuation schemes: Contribution Type CEC implications Defined Benefit Fund If an employee is a member of a defined benefit scheme, there are no CEC obligations in regards to that employee Registered Superannuation Scheme No CEC requirements for these but contributions to RSS can offset other CEC liabilities. See formula below Complying Fund CEC applies KiwiSaver Scheme CEC applies CEC = (payment of gross salary or wages x CEC rate) – other contributions Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4.3 Definition of Salary and Wages for KiwiSaver purposes 4.3.1 Gross salary and wages The definition of gross salary and wages for KiwiSaver purposes includes: • bonuses • commissions • gratuities • overtime payments, and • any other remuneration of any kind. The following payments to employees are specifically excluded from the definition of salary and wages for KiwiSaver purposes, and as such an employer contribution is optional. • Redundancy payments • Reasonable employer provided accommodation or accommodation allowances • Actual costs reimbursed for allowances or expenses relating to living outside New Zealand • Payments made under the Voluntary Bonding Schemes administered by the Ministry for Primary Industries, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Education. Gross base salary and wages are used to determine the amount of employer deductions and compulsory employer contributions (CECs) for members of a complying fund scheme. Refer to the Glossary section of the KiwiSaver Employer Guide for the full definition of gross salary and wages. Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 13 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4.3.2 KiwiSaver - Employees under 18 and over 65 New and existing employees under 18 can only join KiwiSaver by choosing and contacting directly a KiwiSaver scheme provider. Once an employee under 18 is accepted by the scheme provider and the employee has nominated their employer, lR will notify their employer and request they start deducting the employee KiwiSaver contributions. IR will provide the contribution rate for the employee, their name and IRD number. New and existing employees 65 and over can join KiwiSaver by choosing and contacting directly a KiwiSaver scheme provider or join by completing a KS2 KiwiSaver deduction form with their employer. The KS2 form will indicate the rate of deductions from an employee’s salary/wage. Deductions of employee KiwiSaver contributions are based on the following: • For under 18 or over 65 employees, employers need to deduct employee contributions. • Employers are not required to make CECs on behalf of employees under 18 or over 65. • Any KiwiSaver employer contributions made to employees under 18 or over 65 are voluntary employer contributions. Note: With the removal of the tax credit for children under the age of 18, they are now liable for PAYE deductions and if they are an existing KiwiSaver member they are also required to have KiwiSaver employee contributions. If you have an employee who turns 18 while working for you, you do not need to take any additional action unless specifically requested by the employee, though you are required to begin making CECs on their behalf if they are a member. 4.3.3 CEC Validations The following validation will occur in Inland Revenue systems and if failed, will cause the employer’s EI return to be queried unless there is an existing arrangement to overlook specific CEC validations: • If the employee is making KiwiSaver or complying fund deductions, the compulsory employer contributions must be at least 3% of the employee’s gross income. The amount shown on the EI will always be the employer contribution less any tax withheld (i.e. the net amount).

There are no thresholds to apply. Tax credits for payroll donations can be applied. The total to pay also includes the ACC Earners’ Levy at 1.46% from each pay period (0.0146). The flat rate is 10.5% (0.105). Eligible non-resident seasonal workers must use the NSW tax code. If the NSW tax code is used then the EI line for the employee cannot contain: • KiwiSaver contributions • Student Loan Repayments As a non-resident the worker is not eligible to enrol in KiwiSaver, nor are they subject to student loan repayments. Child Support payments can be deducted. The flat rate of 10.5% also applies to extra pay. This is applicable to PAYE income payments made from 01 April 2016 for non-resident seasonal workers with the NSW tax code. For example: Mike contracted as fruit packer for ten weeks at $20/hour with NSW tax code. His final gross pay on the tenth week is $800 with $640 being the 8% holiday pay. Mike will receive net earnings of $563.46 holiday pay on top of his final pay. This is based on 10.5% tax rate and 1.46% ACC earners levy deducted which is $76.54. If Mike’s employer applied the normal extra pay rate rules of 17.5% then Mike would have only received net earnings of $528 based on a deduction of $112. Please note: From 14 May 2016, non-resident seasonal workers under the recognised seasonal employer (RSE) rules have a tax code of NSW for the first month of a period of employment in New Zealand – after this, the no-notification rate can apply.

Student loan deductions will take into consideration the repayment threshold – the flat rate will be on income above the repayment threshold. The tailored tax code/special deduction rate certificate (IR 23) shows a figure to deduct PAYE at the rate of XX cents per dollar. (XX =>rate on certificate) This amount includes earner’s levy of 1.46%. Note: The tailored tax code/deduction rate can only be used if the certificate covers the period (or parts of the period) 01/04/2022 to 31/03/2023 or longer. Special tax rates, including for schedular payments (tax code WT), can be an amount from zero to 100 cents per dollar. Where the person also has a student loan the certificate will provide the deduction rate to deduct student loan deductions. This will be anything from 0% – 12%. Where the employment is the main employment, the rate will apply to income above the pay period repayment threshold, e.g. $409 per week. Where the income is from secondary employment the threshold will not apply.

This can be used where the borrower is in hardship, or where they have more than one job and earn under the pay period repayment threshold in their main job. A SDR is any standard deduction rate less than 12 cents in every dollar. No SDR can be greater than 12 cents in every dollar. A borrower wanting deductions of more than 12 cents in every dollar should be using SLBOR – see 3.2 above. The SDR cannot be applied retrospectively. Borrowers will be provided with a Special Deduction Rate certificate which they provide to their employer. The certificate will continue to advise which tax code/SL repayment code (e.g. S SL) the employer should use, the rate at which the SL deductions are to be made, and the period that the SDR should apply to. The SDR will be a whole percentage only (e.g. 3% or 3 cents in the dollar), calculated to two decimal places (e.g. $0.03). The Special Deduction Rate Certificate may or may not require the pay period threshold to be used. For some tax codes the correct treatment can be inferred- e.g. "M SL" and "S SL" codes provide sufficient information as to whether or not the threshold is to be used. If the employee’s tailored tax code certificate expires and employer has not received either a replacement tailored tax code certificate or a new IR330/330C the employee tax rate would revert to the tax code specified on the previous IR330/IR330C provided to the employer. Where the employee has not previously provided an IR330/IR330C, then the employee would be placed on the No Notification tax rate until such time as an IR330/IR330C or tailored tax code certificate is provided. Special deduction rate and SLCIR – If an SDR is granted to a borrower, the Commissioner will cancel any SLCIRs that a borrower may have, regardless of employer. Special Deduction Rate and SLBOR – If a borrower currently has an SDR rate of 8 cents in every dollar for their secondary employment and also has additional deductions using the SLBOR repayment code of a set amount of $20.00 a week, the borrower would have standard deductions using a SL repayment code (e.g. S SL) at Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 31 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the rate of 8 cents in every dollar, and in addition has an extra $20 deducted for student loan using the SL repayment code SLBOR. Borrowers can continue to apply for a tailored tax code in respect of income tax. Where the borrower is entitled to reduced income tax and SL deductions, a Tailored Tax Code Certificate will be issued. The certificate will continue to advise employers to use the tailored tax code, the rate at which income tax should be deducted, the rate for SL deductions, and the period that the certificate should apply to. The following examples show what happens when a borrower has a Tailored tax code or Special Deduction Rate. Example One The borrower has been granted a tailored tax code due to hardship and has reduced SL and tax rates for the full year. The tailored tax code is valid from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023, with tax at a flat 20% rate and SL deductions at 8 cents in every dollar. The tailored tax code certificate will state: • that the applicable period is the whole year (1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023) • that the STC tax code must be used • that the amount of tax will be calculated at 20% of earnings • that SL deductions will be calculated at 8 cents in every dollar, but note: o if this is the borrower’s main income SL deductions will be 8 cents in every dollar above the repayment threshold, which is 8 cents in every dollar of earnings in excess of $409 per week. o if this is their secondary employment, then SL deductions will be 8 cents of every dollar. o the certificate will state which of these scenarios applies. Example Two A borrower applies for a Special Deduction Rate (SDR) for their secondary employment, because they have an unused repayment threshold from their main employment. They do not currently have a reduced rate for tax. The SDR certificate will state: • that the SDR period is from 1 July 2022 to 30 September 2022 • that the tax code is S SL (or appropriate secondary employment SL) tax code • that SL deductions will be at the rate of 8 cents in every dollar (must be for every dollar of earnings as this is secondary income). Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 32 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] In addition, the SDR certificate will state: • that from 1 October 2022 to 31 March 2023 the tax code will be S\_SL (or other secondary employment SL code) • that SL deductions will be at the rate of 12 cents in every dollar of earnings (must be for every dollar as this is secondary income). Example Three A borrower has an SDR in place for their second job, applicable from 1 July 2022 to 30 September 2022. They then apply for a reduced tax rate for that job. The original Special Deduction Rate certificate (see example two above) will be replaced with a Tailored Tax Code certificate. In this example the Tailored Tax Code certificate applies from 2 August 2022. The tailored tax code certificate would state - • for the period 2 August 2022 to 30 September 2022: o the tax code will be STC o tax will be calculated at the rate of 18 cents in every dollar of earnings o SL deductions will be at the rate of 8 cents in every dollar (as this is secondary employment it will be 8 cents of every dollar earned, and the certificate will make this clear). • for the period 1 October 2022 – 31 March 2023: o the tax code will be STC o tax will be calculated at rate of 18 cents of every dollar o SL deductions will be at the standard rate of 12 cents of every dollar (as this is secondary employment it will be 12 cents of every dollar earned, and the certificate will make this clear).

Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 34 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.9.3 Repayment deduction exemption All borrowers must use a SL repayment code (unless exempt). A borrower who is a full time student, earning above the pay period repayment threshold, but below the annual repayment threshold, may be eligible to be exempt from SL repayment deductions. This means they do not also use the SL repayment code in combination with their tax code. The exemption cannot be applied retrospectively. If the borrower is exempt, Inland Revenue will provide the borrower with an exemption certificate, which they provide to their employer(s). The certificate will advise that they are not required to have SL deductions, which tax code (e.g. M instead of MSL) they should use, and the period for which the exemption will apply. The certificate will also provide instructions as to which tax code should be applied when the exemption ceases – e.g. MSL. Refer: Employer’s guide IR335 – page 8. Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 35 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.10 Employee Share Schemes (ESS) Effective 1 April 2017 employers are able to tax benefits of an employee share scheme as an extra pay. It is not compulsory to do so, and employers can choose to withhold PAYE on an employee by employee basis and on a benefit by benefit basis for each employee. Note: When using the Employment Information return (EI) with the header record indicator HEI2, the taxable value of the benefit is to be shown in the Employee Share Scheme field. ESS benefits are to be shown on the EI except in the following circumstances; • share benefit arises from an exempt employee share scheme; or • the employer has elected not to make deductions from a share benefit provided to a former employee. The value of an ESS benefit is included as income for the purposes of: • Student loan deductions, • Child support payments, and • Working for Families tax credits However, ESS benefits are not liable for: • KiwiSaver deductions or employer contributions • the ACC Earners’ Levy The value of the ESS benefit is determined on the share scheme taxing date. The share scheme taxing date is the earlier of the date when: • the benefits are either transferred to a non-associated person or cancelled; or • the employee owns the shares as any other shareholder would without the terms of employment affecting the status of the ownership or value. Unless a share scheme beneficiary first transfers their share scheme benefits to a non- associate, or the company cancels them, the share scheme taxing date is when: • there is no material risk that beneficial ownership of the shares will change, or that the shares will be required to be transferred or cancelled; • the employee is not entitled to be compensated for a fall in the value of the shares; and • there is no material risk that there will be a change in the terms of the shares affecting their value. Example 1: - Simple vesting period Acme Limited (Acme) transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trust to hold for their employee, Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Alice. Alice only receives the shares from the trust if she stays employed by Acme for at least 3 years and she receives no benefit from or ownership of the shares if she leaves before then. As the risk that Alice will leave the employment of Acme within the 3 years is material the share scheme taxing date is the date that Alice reaches 3 years employment with Acme. Example 2: - Vesting subject to misconduct Acme Limited transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trust to hold for their employee, Bob. Bob receives the shares 3 years after they are transferred to the trust as long as he is not dismissed for serious misconduct in this time. Bob will still be entitled to the shares if he ceases employment with 3 years as long as the employment is not ceased due to serious misconduct, so the share scheme taxing date is the date the shares are transferred to the trust as there is little risk that Bob will lose his entitlement to the shares. The taxable value of the ESS benefit must be reported based on the 20 th day after the share scheme taxing date. There are two methods an employer can use to determine when the taxable value of ESS benefit needs to be reported. Option 1 • If the 20th day falls between the 1st and 15th of a month the information must be reported treating the 15th as the payday. • If the 20th day falls between the 16th and the end of a month the information must be reported treating the last day of the month as the payday. Option 2 The employer can treat the 20th day as the payday and report the value of the ESS benefit to us more regularly. Example 1 – Employee Share Scheme ESS (employer deducts PAYE) The employee has a tax code of M SL and receives a 4-weekly salary of $3,500.00. They contribute to KiwiSaver at 3% and have an ESCT rate of 17.5%. The ESS benefit (extra pay) is $2,500, and the gross earnings for the last four weeks were $3,500 – The last four weeks’ income $3,500 x 13 = annual income $45,500 The total earnings $45,500 + extra pay $2,500 amounts to $48,000 The tax rate applied to the extra pay is 17.5% 17.5% \* $2,500 = $437.50 The extra pay is not liable for ACC Earners’ Levy.

They contribute to KiwiSaver at 3% and have an ESCT rate of 17.5%. The ESS benefit (extra pay) is $2,500, but the employer has chosen not to deduct PAYE so no calculation is necessary for PAYE or Student Loan. Completing the EI (with header record indicator HEI2): Employee Tax Code M SL Gross earnings and/or schedular payments $3,500.00 Prior period gross adjustments $0.00 Earnings and / or schedular payments not liable for ACC Earners’ Levy $2,500.00 Lump sum (extra pay) indicator 0 PAYE / tax $588.20 Prior period PAYE adjustments $0.00 Child support deductions $0.00 Student loan deductions $223.68 SLCIR deductions $0.00 Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] SLBOR deductions $0.00 KiwiSaver deductions $105.00 Net KiwiSaver employer contributions $86.63 ESCT deducted $18.37 Tax credits for payroll donations $0.00 Family tax credits $0.00 Employee Share Scheme $2,500.00 Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 39 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.11 Extra pay (Lump Sum) - Primary income 1 Note: The extra pay payment calculation applies to the rates codes EDW, CAE and ND.

Tax code = M SL, ME SL, or STC 2.1 Calculate pay for pay period, including normal pay and extra pay Include lump sum payments which are paid as annual or special bonuses, retiring or redundancy payments, gratuities or back pay. Exclude non-taxable amounts. This amount (normal pay plus extra pay) is referred to as “pay for the pay period” below. 2.2 Truncate pay for the pay period (ie before Student loan deduction) amount to whole dollars, $457.89 becomes $457. 2.3 Calculate student loan deductions. No special deduction rate certificate. If the pay for the pay period is less than student loan pay period repayment threshold, then the deduction is $0.00. If the pay for the pay period is more than the student loan pay period repayment threshold the calculation is: pay for the pay period minus the SL repayment threshold x 12%. If the borrower is on a tailored tax code the threshold may or may not apply - this will be clarified on the certificate. If a borrower has provided a special deduction rate certificate. If the pay for the pay period is less than student loan pay period repayment threshold, then the deduction is $0.00. If the pay for the pay period is more than student loan pay period repayment threshold the calculation is : pay for the pay period minus the SL repayment threshold x SDR rate. NB If the extra pay amount is not paid at the same time as the normal pay and the pay for the pay period cannot be calculated then multiply the entire extra pay amount by the appropriate student loan deduction rate. Eg 12% or SDR rate Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 41 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Sequence Task Associated Rules 2.3.1 Tailored Tax Code (STC) If a bonus is paid to an employee who has a tailored tax code, deduct tax at the rate shown on the certificate. For retiring or redundancy payments deduct tax at the tailored tax code rate (excluding ACC Earners’ Levy). The payment should be marked as “Earnings not liable for ACC Earners’ Levy” on the EI to avoid the ACC Earners’ Levy being forwarded to ACC. For example, a tailored tax code rate of 24% would be deducted at 22.54% (24%-1.46%) for retiring or redundancy payments. 2.4 Truncate amount to whole cents e.g. $45.789 becomes $45.78. If tax is calculated using a tailored tax code rate, sequence ends at this step. 3 Calculate PAYE Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 42 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Sequence Task Associated Rules 3.1 Calculate annualised income then add extra pay amount Identify the value of the PAYE income payments made in the four weeks prior to, and inclusive of the day on which the extra pay is paid. Note: Do not include any other amounts of extra pay that may have been made in that 4 week period. If in the four weeks prior, the employee was paid: - Four one-weekly pays – total of the four pays and multiply by 13 - Two fortnightly pays – total of the two pays and multiply by 13 - One four-weekly pays - multiply the amount by 13 - One monthly pay - multiply the amount by 12 In other circumstances, add all PAYE income payments made to the employee in the four weeks prior and multiply by 13. This amount is the annualised income. Add the amount of the extra pay to the annualised income to get the grossed up amount. Example Pay period weekly at $1,000 per week with an extra pay of $500 included with the latest pay In the past four weeks (inclusive of this pay) the employee has had four weekly pays totalling $4,000 (exclude this extra pay $500). Multiply this by 13 X $4,000 = $52,000 Then add the extra pay $500 The Grossed up amount = $52,500 Note: When a payment is made outside the normal pay cycle, the 4-week period ends on the day the payment is made. 3.2 Drop cents from the grossed up amount(truncate to whole dollars), e.g. $14,000.90 becomes $14,000. 3.3 Determine Tax rate 3.4 If the employee has elected to have extra pays deducted at a higher rate, the tax rate is either 17.5%, 30%, 33% or 39% whichever they have elected.

This would require a tick on the printed EI and a ‘1’ on the electronic file. 3.10 Calculate tax amounts to be deducted. 3.11 Multiply the extra pay amount by the tax rate determined. From step above– will be 10.5%, 17.5%, 30%, 33% or 39%. Do not round this figure. 4 Calculate ACC Earners’ Levy. 4.1 If the extra pay is redundancy, retirement allowance or Employee Share Scheme benefit. ACC Earners’ Levy is $0.00. 4.2 If the grossed up amount does not exceed $136,544 ACC Earners’ Levy is the extra pay multiplied by 1.46%. 4.3 If the annualised income does not exceed $136,544, and the grossed up amount exceeds $136,544 ACC Earners’ Levy is $136,544 minus the annualised income, multiplied by 1.46%. Please refer to example 1 below. Do not round this figure. 4.4 If the annualised income exceeds $136,544 ACC Earners’ Levy on the extra pay is $0.00.

The total earnings $123,500 + bonus $15,000.56 = grossed up amount $138,500.56 The maximum ACC Earners’ Levy threshold is $136,544 The bonus payment means the grossed up amount is in excess of ACC Earners’ Levy threshold, therefore: ACC Earners’ Levy on the lump sum is to be calculated as follows - ($136,544 - 123,500) x 1.46% = $190.44 In this example the tax to be deducted from the lump sum would be at 33% since the grossed up amount exceeds $70,000 giving $4,950.18 (15,000.56 lump sum amount)\*33% applicable rate) + ACC Earners’ Levy $190.44 = $5,140.62 Note: Cents are not removed from bonus payment and final figure will not be rounded. Example 2 – If a bonus payment is $15,000 and the gross earnings for the last four weeks were $15,000 - The last four weeks’ income $15,000 x 13 = annualised income $195,000. The total earnings $195,000 + bonus $15,000 = grossed up amount $210,000. The maximum ACC Earners’ Levy threshold is $136,544. The annualised income is in excess of the ACC Earners’ Levy threshold, so the bonus payment is not liable for ACC Earners’ Levy In this example the tax to be deducted from the lump sum would be at 39% since the grossed up amount exceeds $180,000 giving $5,850 (15,000.00 lump sum amount)\*39% applicable rate)+ ACC Earners’ Levy $0 = $5,850 Example 3 – If a redundancy payment is $70,000, a final pay leave payment is $15,000 and the gross earnings for the last four weeks were $5,000 – The last four weeks’ income of $5,000 x 13 = annualised income of $65,000 The total earnings is $65,000 + $70,000 extra pay + $15,000 extra pay = grossed up amount of $150,000 The $70,000 redundancy payment is not liable for ACC Earners’ Levy Portion of grossed up amount liable for ACC Earners’ Levy is $80,000 The maximum ACC Earners’ Levy threshold is $136,544 Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 45 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The grossed up amount which is liable for ACC is below the ACC Earners’ Levy threshold, therefore: ACC Earners’ Levy on the lump sum is to be calculated as follows – $15,000 x 1.46% = $219.00 In this example the tax to be deducted from the total lump sum would be at 33% since the grossed up amount of $150,000 ($65,000 + $15,000 + $70,000) exceeds $70,000. This amounts to $28,050 ($85,000 total lump sum amount\*33% applicable rate) + ACC Earners’ Levy $219.00 = $28,269.00 Note: Cents are not removed from bonus payment and final figure will not be rounded. Example 4 – Extra pay is paid outside the standard pay period The employee has a tax code of M SL and receives a fortnightly salary of $1,128.00. They received a one-off bonus of $1,000 on 5 September. They receive a redundancy payment of $7,500 with their normal pay on 5 October. The calculation would look like this: Fortnightly gross wages $1,128 Four-weekly gross wages $2,256 Multiplied by 13 $29,328 Plus the redundancy payment $7,500 Annualised income plus redundancy pay $36,828 Tax rate to be applied to the redundancy payment 17.5% The student loan deduction would be calculated as follows: Fortnightly gross income $1,128 Plus redundancy payment $7,500 Total payment for the fortnight $8,628 Minus fortnightly pay period threshold $818 Total $7,810 Student loan deductions (12% of $7,810) $937.20 Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] However, in another scenario, the employee asks that the redundancy payment be made as soon as possible.

The difference between the annualised income plus the low threshold amount and the grossed amount is the extra pay amount. Multiply the extra pay amount that is less than $136,544 by the ACC Earner’s Levy of 1.46%. Do not round this figure.

Add the regular bonus to the salary/wages for the pay period, then calculate PAYE as usual according to the employee’s tax code. Monthly bonuses covering more than one pay period 1. Add up the gross wages paid for a month’s income, eg if you pay weekly, add the four weekly payments together. 2. Work out the PAYE on the gross wages for the month 3. Add the bonus to the gross wages calculated at step 1 and work out the PAYE for the month on the total. 4. Subtract the PAYE calculated at step 2 from that calculated at step 3. This gives you the PAYE on the bonus. Bonuses covering more than one month 1. Divide the bonus by the number of months it covers. This gives you the monthly bonus amount. 2. Add the monthly bonus to the normal pay for the month and calculate PAYE. Select monthly in the PAYE calculator. 3. Calculate the PAYE on the normal monthly pay and subtract this amount from the PAYE calculated at step 2 above. This gives you the PAYE on the monthly bonus. 4. Multiply this by the number of months the bonus covers to get the total PAYE to be deducted from the bonus.

This is done on an IR330c Tax rate notification for contractors form (follow the link for details of this form: https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/withholding-taxes/schedular- payments). This form specifies that their tax code is WT, and what their elected deduction rate is, which can be between 10 and 100%. • If the contractor provides their name and IRD number but does not or cannot elect a rate, use the table below to determine the standard rate to use, unless they provide a tailored tax code certificate or a certificate of exemption on schedular payments (follow the link for details of this certificate: https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/withholding-taxes/schedular- payments/getting-schedular-payments/certificates-of-exemption-for-schedular-payments). • A schedular payment type for persons wanting to voluntarily have tax deducted from their contractor income has been added. Voluntary schedular payments have a standard rate of 20 cents per dollar of the payment. • The Commissioner is also able to notify the payer of a specific tax rate to be deducted from payments made to a contractor. • The no-notification rate as applicable for WT has been standardised at 45 cents per dollar of the payment.

Schedular payments should not include or be included in earnings as an employee. If paying both normal earnings as an employee and schedular payments you must record one line on the EI as an employee with normal tax code and one line for the schedular payment with WT code. GST If the payee is GST-registered, exclude deducted GST from the payment before calculating tax on schedular payments. Only the GST exclusive amount has tax on schedular payments deducted. For example, a payment of $115 (GST inclusive) is due to the payee; exclude the GST component of $15. Deduct the tax on schedular payments (e.g. 20%) from the remaining $100 to calculate the net amount excluding GST. The amount on the EI will show Gross $100, tax on schedular payments of $20.00, earnings not liable for EL of $100 and a tax code of WT. Add the amount of GST back to the net amount to calculate the net payment to the payee (e.g., $80 net amount plus $15 GST = $95). The amount of GST is not included on the EI. If a declaration has been filled out with all details Tax = ( Standard or Elected Rate ) \* (Earnings) Else Tax = (No Not.

This is the employee’s ‘protected net earnings’, to cover living expenses. Note that student loan repayment obligations are not considered a tax when calculating protected net earnings. ‘Protected net earnings’ only apply to child support payments (and other attachment orders as described in the following section). You must still make other deductions, such as student loan repayments, KiwiSaver or ACC Earners’ Levy. However, insurance, superannuation and union fees may be deducted subject to the Wages Protection Act 1983.

Section 157 (3) of the District Court Act states that where an attachment order is working alone or in conjunction with one of a number of possible notices (child support, tax arrears, parentage test costs, social security debts), the protected net earnings rule applies in all situations upon these attachment orders; whether included with a child support notice or not. (Please note, Inland Revenue arrears orders are based on gross earnings). In these situations, the protected net earnings rate is the higher of: • 60% of the post-tax earnings for the period, or Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 59 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • the minimum level of income specified in the notice, as provided by Section 156 (d) of the District Court Act 2016. For example, an employee who earns $2,000 a week has protected net earnings of the higher of $1,514, or any level set by the District Court. In situations where the employee has one or more attachment orders in addition to a child support notice, the child support payment should always be deducted ahead of any other attachment orders. The following order of rank should apply: 1. Child support 2. Other attachment orders 3. ACC levy 4. Student loan repayments 5. Kiwisaver employee contribution 6. Other voluntary deductions Note: ACC levy is excluded when calculating protected net earnings on attachment orders. 5.17 Payroll Giving Payroll Giving grants employees an immediate tax credit for their donation(s) to a donee organisation (listed on Inland Revenue’s Donee List) where the donation is made using their employer’s Payroll Giving scheme. The tax credits for payroll donations are used to reduce the amount of PAYE paid by the employee. Payroll Giving is voluntary for both employers and employees. Tax credits for payroll donations are reported via an electronic Employment Information return (the EI in myIR). Payroll Giving is only available to employees of employers who file their EI and payment form electronically. The same calculation is used to calculate tax credits for payroll donations for all tax codes and all annual incomes equally: Tax Credit for Payroll Donation = Total Donation x 0.333333 The amount is truncated to whole cents i.e. calculate to 2 decimal places, do not round up or down. Before making a donation, individuals must have met all tax obligations and any payments legally required to be deducted from their pay. These include: • PAYE (tax and ACC Earners’ Levy) • Student Loan • Child Support • KiwiSaver The Maximum tax credit for payroll donations is limited to the ‘Tax’ element of PAYE i.e., PAYE minus ACC Earners’ Levy equals ‘Tax’. Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 60 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Timeframe for Passing Donations Donations are deducted from employee’s salary or wages by the employer and passed directly to the chosen donee organisation. Donations need to be passed to the donee organisation on or before the due date for your PAYE payment, whichever is closest to the end of the two months from the last day of the pay period that the donation was deducted. Keeping Sufficient Records Employers and PAYE intermediaries must keep sufficient records of the amount of any payroll donation deducted from an employee’s pay to enable Inland Revenue to determine that payroll donations have been transferred to the correct recipient. For additional information on payroll giving please refer to the link below: https://www.ird.govt.nz/employing-staff/deductions-from-income/payroll-giving 5.18 Inland Revenue arrears payments An employer may receive a notice from us requiring them to deduct tax, student loan arrears or family tax credit over payments from an employee’s wage (a section 157 notice). The notice will explain how to calculate the required amounts. Child support payments must be deducted before tax and student loan arrears and Working for Family Tax Credit over-payments. Note: This is a different situation from the student loan process for significant under-deductions, where the employer would be instructed to use the SLCIR deductions field. Note: The notice received refers to weekly pay periods. If the employee is not paid weekly, you need to multiply the deduction amount to suit the pay period. The payments need to be sent to IR by the end of each calendar month, completely separate from PAYE payments. They should not appear on the EI. If the payment is to be made electronically, please specify the employee’s IRD number, tax type, period and amount. If it isn’t made electronically, the details should be supplied on a separate piece of paper.

Or if the employee asks you to deduct a higher amount, you must do this. Yes No Yes Note: In certain circumstances, deduction notices for fixed amounts different from the lesser of the 10% of the sum in default as per notice or 20% of gross pay, may be issued. 5.18.1 Other Child Support deduction notices for WT payers In some cases, a notice may specify a percentage of the net pay is to be deducted. These deductions are paid directly to Inland Revenue using the customer’s IRD number and tax type NCP. When using a percentage deduction, the maximum amount that can be requested by Inland Revenue is 40% of their net pay.

If the details are incorrect, delays in processing these payments can occur. There are two different tax type codes that relate to employer deducted payments. If the payment includes a combination of the following, you can use the employer deductions (DED) code: • PAYE • Child Support deductions • Student Loan repayment deductions • Employer superannuation contribution tax • KiwiSaver deductions for employees • Net KiwiSaver employer contributions If the payment is being made for PAYE intermediary purposes, the intermediary employer deductions code (IED) must be used. 5.19.1 Electronic payment format requirements Employers (including PAYE intermediaries) will need to provide their bank with the following payment information: • Payee name: ”Inland Revenue” • Amount: total amount of the payment • Our bank account details: “03 0049 0001100 27” • Particulars: Employer’s or PAYE intermediary’s IRD number • Payee code: “DED” or “IED” (see above). Leave the next box blank, then enter the period end date for the payment being processed i.e. (DDMMCCYY) • Reference: This can be used for your own personal reference. NOTE: These fields (IRD number, Tax Type code and Period End Date) are necessary in order for us to allocate the payment received correctly. Some software packages may already populate specific non Inland Revenue information (e.g. an accounting reference) in either the particulars or payee code field, and changing this is very difficult. Should this be the case, then you need to ensure that the IR payment reference details are displayed in any remaining fields to minimise impacts for your clients and how their payments are processed.

The information covered in this section shows how FBT is calculated on the alternate rate calculation process and includes both the short-form and the full alternate rate calculation process, as well as the pooled alternate rate calculation. We also explain how to complete the adjustments required for shareholder-employees or those receiving attributed income where full remuneration details were unknown at the time of completing last year's fourth quarter or annual FBT return, and the adjustment for GST. For more information about FBT and the calculation process, please refer to the latest Fringe benefit tax guide (IR 409) or the Fringe benefit tax return guide (IR 425). These are available from our website at www.ird.govt.nz or by phoning SPK2IR (Speak to IR – formerly INFOexpress) on 0800 257 777. Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 65 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Shareholder-employee remuneration adjustment Employers who completed their fourth quarter or annual return last year without knowing all the remuneration details of shareholder-employees (or those receiving attributed income), and applied the 49.25% FBT rate to the value of the attributed benefits, must use the alternate rate calculation when making the remuneration adjustment. The calculation required is based on last year's remuneration and attributed benefit details for each individual, less the amount of FBT calculated and paid for each of those individuals in last year’s return. A remuneration adjustment sheet is included in our Fringe benefit tax return guide (IR 425) to assist with this calculation. GST on fringe benefits The GST payable is calculated on the taxable value of all benefits from Box 3 of the FBT return less the value of any benefits which are exempt or zero-rated supplies for GST purposes. The GST content of those supplies is to be shown in Box 7 of the FBT return for quarterly filers and Box 6 of the FBT return for annual and income year filers. For more information on FBT refer to the IR Website: https://www.ird.govt.nz/employing- staff/paying-staff/fringe-benefit-tax Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 66 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.20.2 Short-form alternate rate calculation The short-form alternate rate calculation option is a streamlined approach that allows all attributed benefits to be taxed at a flat rate of 63.93%, and all non-attributed benefits to be taxed at a flat rate of 49.25% (or 63.93% on fringe benefits provided to major shareholder- employees). This option is more likely to appeal to employers where all of their employees who receive attributed benefits earn more than $180,000. Under the short-form alternate rate option, employers simply add all attributed benefits provided to employees together and calculate the FBT on the combined figure at 63.93%. The non- attributed benefits are calculated the same way as they are under the full alternate rate option. 5.20.3 Full alternate rate calculation The following information shows how FBT is calculated on attributed fringe benefits using the full alternate rate calculation, using one employee as an example. The full alternate rate calculation is a five-step process explained under the heading “Full alternate rate calculation process”. For each employee who receives a benefit that is attributed to them, their employer must: • Retrieve gross cash remuneration information (gross salary or wages, bonuses or overtime and other taxable income from all entities within a company) • Apply the tax rates, shown in step 1 of the full alternate rate calculation (not the actual PAYE deducted based on the PAYE tax tables) to obtain a net cash remuneration amount. • Add the value of attributed taxable benefits for the year to the net cash remuneration • Apply FBT rates to this total amount (see step 4, Table B) • Calculate the FBT payable by subtracting the tax calculated on the gross wages. Completion of this calculation for annual filers will give them their FBT to pay for each employee on the value of attributed benefits. Quarterly filers take off the previous three-quarters assessments. 5.20.4 Full alternate rate calculation process Step 1: Calculate net cash remuneration The employer calculates the net cash remuneration of each employee. This calculation takes the employee’s gross cash remuneration minus the tax on that income to get net cash remuneration total. Table A (see below) sets out the current income tax rates used in the calculation. Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 67 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Gross cash remuneration is the employee’s gross salary or wages, bonuses, overtime and other taxable income from all entities associated with the company, including subsidiaries, for the year. For a major shareholder-employee it also includes any interest or dividends received from the employer or a related employer. If an employee worked only part of the year, the cash remuneration is the amount paid to them during the year. Table A: Income tax rates Gross income Cumulative income tax per bracket Income tax rate From $0 to $14,000 $ 1,470.00 10.5% $14,001 to $48,000 $ 7,420.00 17.5% $48,001 to $70,000 $ 14,020.00 30.0% $70,001 to $180,000 $ 50,320.00 33.0% $180,001 upwards 39.0% Example: Employee A Gross cash Remuneration $78,333.00 Tax on first $70,000 $14,020.00 Tax on remaining $8,333 @ 33.0% $ 2,749.89 Tax on $78,333 = $16,769.89 Therefore: Net cash remuneration $61,563.11 Note: When calculating the tax on the cash remuneration the gross cash remuneration total is in whole dollars. The tax amount is truncated to the second decimal place after. For example, if the tax amount calculated was $2,305.45674 the amount that would be shown as the tax on cash remuneration is $2,305.45. Step 2: Calculate taxable value of attributed fringe benefits The employer calculates the taxable value of each attributed benefit received by the employee. For each employee they add all the taxable values, of all such benefits received for each quarter, to get the annual value of the benefits for each employee. These are obtained from the FBT taxable value calculation sheet that employers have completed in quarters one to four. Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 68 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example: Quarter 1 total $1,272.00 Quarter 2 total $1,272.00 Quarter 3 total $1,177.60 Quarter 4 total $1,272.00 Total taxable value of benefit $4,993.60 For more details on attributed fringe benefits, and the thresholds that apply, please refer to the Fringe benefit tax guide (IR 409). Note: When adding the amount of benefits received by an employee, truncate figures to whole cents. Using the above example, the third quarter amount was calculated at $1,177.60814, but is shown as $1,177.60. Step 3: Fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration (FBICR) For each employee take the net cash remuneration (whole dollars only) calculated in step 1 and add the taxable value of attributed fringe benefits (whole dollars only) from step 2. This gives the fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration (FBICR) total against which the FBT alternate rates will be applied. Example: Employee A Net income $61,563.00 Taxable value on benefit $ 4,993.00 FBICR $66,556.00 Note: When transferring the fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration (FBICR) to step 4 this amount must be in whole dollars. Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 69 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Step 4: Applying the alternate rates Tax on the FBICR is calculated using the rates in the table below. Table B: Fringe benefit tax rates Fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration Accumulative FBT per bracket FBT tax rate From $1 to $12,530 $1,469.76 11.73% $12,531 to $40,580 $7,419.16 21.21% $40,581 to $55,980 $14,019.60 42.86% $55,981 to $129,680 $50,316.85 49.25% $129,681 upwards 63.93% Example: Employee A FBICR (from step 3) $66,556.00 FBT on first $55,980 $14,019.60 FBT on remaining $10,576 @ 49.25% = $5,208.68 FBT on $66,556.00 $19,228.28 Note: When calculating the tax on the fringe benefit-inclusive tax remuneration within each fringe benefit tax rate, the amount calculated is to the second decimal place after the decimal point so the FBT on $12,530 is $1,469.76 ($12,530 x 11.73% = $1,469.769). Using the above example, tax on the difference between $66,556 and $55,980 is $10,576 ($10,576.00 x 49.25% = $5,208.68). Step 5: Calculating the FBT liability Take the tax on the FBICR (step 4) and subtract the tax on the income (step 1). This gives the amount of fringe benefit tax the employer should have paid for that employee on the value of attributed benefits in that year. Example: Employee A Tax on FBICR of $19,228.28 Less tax on income $16,769.89 FBT liability for employer $ 2,458.39 Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 70 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Step 6: FBT to pay The annual FBT liability for the employer is the: • FBT calculated on attributed fringe benefits for each employee plus the • FBT payable on the non-attributed fringe benefits. The FBT payable on the taxable value of non-attributed benefits is calculated at a flat FBT rate of 49.25% (or 63.93% if received by major shareholder-employees or an associated person, if the benefits received by that associated person were not as an employee). Quarterly filers If the employer is a quarterly filer, the amount of FBT assessed in the previous quarters is subtracted from the total to get the amount to pay in the final quarter. FBT to pay is transferred to Box 6 on the Quarterly return (IR 420). The employer may be entitled to a refund if the annual FBT liability is less than the FBT assessed in quarters 1-3. 5.20.5 Annual filers If the employer is an annual or income year filer, the total FBT to pay is $2,458.39. This is transferred to Box 5 on the annual or income year return IR 422 or IR 421. 5.20.6 Pooled alternate rate calculation The pooled alternate rate option is available from the 2021-22 tax year onwards. This option works in a similar way to the short form alternate rate option. The sole difference between these options is that under the pooled alternate rate option, attributed benefits are divided into two pools, with one pool taxed at the 63.93% rate and the other at the 49.25% rate. This option is intended to strike a better balance between accuracy and simplicity for many employers than the other FBT payment options. Employers who predominantly provide attributed benefits to employees who earn less than $180,000 in gross cash pay, especially if all or most of those employees earn within the “safe harbour” thresholds outlined below, are expected to benefit the most from this option. Example: Employee A FBT liability for employer $2,458.39 Less FBT assessed in quarters 1 to 3 $1,600.28 FBT to pay in final quarter $858.11 Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 71 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] By default, the 49.25% rate pool comprises benefits provided to employees whose remuneration is within the following “safe harbour” thresholds: 1 • Attributed benefits of up to $13,400 • Cash pay of up to $160,000. The 63.93% rate pool comprises benefits provided to employees earning above the safe harbour thresholds. Pooled alternate rate example: Employee X Company A employs full-time and part-time staff in a range of roles requiring different skill sets, qualifications, and levels of experience. Salaries range from $30,000 to $170,000. However, only Employee X earns $170,000 before tax, with the next highest-paid employee earning $120,000 before tax. In the 2021–22 tax year, Company A provides fringe benefits totalling $100,000 to all its staff members in the form of subsidised transport and some low interest, employment-related loans. No individual staff member received more than $6,000 in attributed benefits, so none of Company A’s staff received anywhere near $13,400 in attributed benefits. Employee X received attributed benefits to the value of $5,000. Company A has calculated its FBT liability for attributed benefits for the first three quarters of the 2021–22 tax year under section RD 59(2). This means it paid FBT at the rate of 49.25% of the taxable value of attributed benefits for those first three quarters. As fringe benefits totalling $75,000 were provided in the first three quarters, Company A has paid FBT of $36,937.50 for that period. Company A decides to use the pooled alternate rate option to calculate its FBT liability for the final quarter of 2021–22. When preparing the FBT return for the final quarter, Company A identifies that only one employee earned above the safe harbour limit of $160,000 in cash pay for the 2021–22 tax year, being Employee X. Company A accordingly pays FBT on the taxable value of fringe benefits attributed 1 The exception to this rule is explained below at ‘Option to pay FBT at 49.25% rate for employees receiving all-inclusive pay below $129,681’. Treatment of non-attributed benefits Non-attributed benefits provided to employees that are not major shareholders are still pooled and taxed at the 49.25% rate, while any non-attributed benefits provided to employees who are major shareholders, or to persons associated with an employee who is a major shareholder, are still required to be pooled and taxed at the 63.93% rate. Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 72 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] to Employee X at the top rate of 63.93%. FBT for Employee X: Company A’s FBT liability for Employee X for the 2021–22 year is $3,196.50 ($5,000 × 63.93%). FBT for other employees: The total FBT payable for all other employees for the 2021–22 year is calculated by subtracting the taxable value of benefits attributed to Employee X from the taxable value of attributed benefits Company A provided to all its staff during 2021–22 and then applying the 49.25% rate to this amount. The taxable value of attributed benefits Company A provided to all its staff during 2021–22 is $100,000. Employee X received $5,000 of these benefits. This means that the total FBT payable for Company A’s employees (excluding Employee X) for the 2021–22 tax year is $46,787.50 (($100,000 - $5,000) × 49.25%). Total FBT liability: Therefore, Company A’s total FBT liability for all employees (including Employee X) for the 2021– 22 tax year is $49,984 ($46,787.50 + $3,196.50). As Company A has already paid $36,937.50 in FBT for the first three quarters of the 2021–22 tax year, the FBT payable for the final quarter is $13,046.50 ($49,984 - $36,937.50). Option to pay FBT at 49.25% rate for employees receiving all-inclusive pay below $129,681 Employers may also choose to pay FBT at the 49.25% rate on benefits attributed to employees who receive less than $129,681 in all-inclusive pay, even if the employee receives more than $160,000 in cash pay or more than $13,400 in attributed benefits. Provided the requirement around the level of the employee’s all-inclusive pay is met, this choice is available to an employer even if the employee earns above either of the safe harbour thresholds outlined above.

ESCT is paid on all employer contributions made after the employer either starts new employment (auto-enrolment into KiwiSaver) or the employer has been given notice to make KiwiSaver deductions (KS2 from employee or letter from IRD). ESCT applies to all employer contributions from that date onwards regardless of the pay period the payment may be for. 5.21.1 Options for calculating tax on employer contributions ESCT can be calculated by the employer: • using a progressive rate based on the employee’s salary scale (see Table 1 below) or, • at the employees request all or part of the value of the employer superannuation contribution can be included in the employee’s gross salary or wages and taxed at their personal tax rates as per RD 68 (1) of the ITA 2007. Table 1 Income Tax Act 2007 RD 68 Choosing to have amount treated as salary or wages Amount treated as salary or wages 1. With the agreement of their employer who makes an employer's superannuation cash contribution on their behalf, an employee may choose to have some or all of an employer's superannuation cash contribution made on their behalf treated as salary or wages under the PAYE rules.

Example - when an employee is a member of KiwiSaver Rachel is employed by Company Q Ltd\*. She is a KiwiSaver member. Her employment agreement includes Company Q Ltd\* contributing $15 (3%) a week to her KiwiSaver scheme, in addition to her normal weekly salary of $500.03. Rachel chooses, and her employer agrees, to have these contributions included as part of her salary. This means Company Q Ltd\* uses the total of her salary and the employer contributions of $515.03 to calculate her PAYE. Note: Any student loan deductions, working for family tax credit entitlements or child support obligations the employee may have will be calculated on the new Gross amount of $515.03.

If the employee has not worked the full previous tax year, then the employer estimates what their earnings would be for a whole year. Under section RD 67(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007, the amount of tax is determined by applying the relevant rate given by Table 1 to each dollar of an employer’s superannuation contribution: Income Tax Act 2007 RD 67 Calculating amounts of tax for employer's superannuation cash contributions The amount of tax for an employer’s superannuation cash contribution is the amount determined under Schedule 1, part D, clause 1 (Basic tax rates: income tax, ESCT, RSCT, RWT, and attributed fringe benefits) Note: Schedule 1, Part D, clause 2 has been repealed. Income Tax Act 2007 Basic rates for ESCT given by Table 1 Amount of tax for section RD 67(a) Under section RD 67(a), the amount of tax is determined by applying the relevant rate given by table 1 to each dollar of an employer’s superannuation contribution.

Therefore, the ESCT rate threshold is set at the beginning of the tax year and cannot change until the following year when the rate is re-calculated. 5.21.6 Employer contribution and ESCT calculated using whole dollars and cents KiwiSaver legislation requires the following rules to be applied to the calculation for employer contribution: • employer contribution is to be based on complete dollars and cents i.e. $861.85 and not just $861 • ESCT is calculated based on the last amount i.e. $51 and not $51.71.

Check the valid range • If the IRD number is < 10-000-000 or > 150-000-000 then the number is invalid. This step ensures that the IRD number is in the already issued range, or is in the range expected to be issued in the next 10 years. 2. Form the eight digit base number: • Remove the trailing check digit. • If the resulting number is seven digits long, pad to eight digits by adding a leading zero. 3. Calculate the check digit: • To each of the base number’s eight digits a weight factor is assigned. From left to right these are: 3, 2, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. • Sum together the products of the weight factors and their associated digits. • Divide the sum by 11. If the remainder is 0, the calculated check digit is 0. • If the remainder is not 0, subtract the remainder from 11, giving the calculated check digit. • If the calculated check digit is in the range 0 to 9, go to step 5. • If the calculated check digit is 10, continue with step 4.

(1\*7) + (3\*4) + (6\*3) + (4\*2) + (1\*5) + (0\*2) + (1\*7) + (3\*6) = 75 75 / 11 = 6 remainder 9 (i.e. mod (75,11) = 9) 11 – 9 = 2, this does not match the check digit (3). The number is invalid. Example 6 IR number 9125568. The number is less than 10,000,000 so fails the first validation. The number is invalid. Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 88 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 7 Bank account number validation The bank account number format used by all banks is numeric and includes the following parts: • Bank ID (maximum 2 digits) • Bank branch (maximum 4 digits) • Account base number (maximum 8 digits) • Account suffix (maximum 4 digits). For processing at Inland Revenue the fields for the individual account number parts are all of maximum size. If less than the maximum number of digits is supplied, then values are right justified and the fields padded with zeroes (where applicable). 7.1 Validation step 1 The first step in the validation process is to verify the Bank ID number. This number can then be used to derive the appropriate algorithm code for that bank. Once the appropriate algorithm code has been derived, the second whole account number validation step must be performed as outlined in Validation Step 2 on the following page. Current valid Bank IDs and their associated algorithms are included in this table: Bank ID Algorithm 01 A or B (see note) 02 A or B (see note) 03 A or B (see note) 04 A or B (see note) 05 A or B (see note) 06 A or B (see note) 08 D 10 A or B (see note) 11 A or B (see note) 12 A or B (see note) 13 A or B (see note) 14 A or B (see note) 15 A or B (see note) 16 A or B (see note) 17 A or B (see note) 18 A or B (see note) Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 89 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Bank ID Algorithm 19 A or B (see note) 20 A or B (see note) 21 A or B (see note) 22 A or B (see note) 23 A or B (see note) 24 A or B (see note) 25 F 27 A or B (see note) 30 A or B (see note) 31 X 38 A or B (see note) 88 A or B (see note) Note: If the account base number is below 00990000 then apply algorithm A, otherwise apply algorithm B. The actual branch numbers in use change from time to time, and are included in the Bank Branch Register, which gets updated monthly. A link to this register on the paymentsNZ website is included here: https://www.paymentsnz.co.nz/resources/industry-registers/bank-branch-register/ To request monthly updates to the Bank Branch Register, use this email address: branchregister@paymentsnz.co.nz 7.2 Validation step 2 The second validation step is a modulus n algorithm applied to the whole account number. The algorithm type is derived from the table on the previous page. Follow this process: 1. Identify the corresponding weight factor for every digit in the account number as shown in the table below. Note: all fields (i.e., bank ID, bank branch, account base and account suffix) are right justified and padded with zeroes. 2. Add together the products of the weight factors and their associated account number digit. If the algorithm E or G is used then add the two digits of the product (tens and ones), and again the two digits of the result before summing (see example 3). Divide the sum by the value in the “Modulo” column below. If the remainder is zero then the Payroll Calculations & Business Rules 2023 V1.0 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 90 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] bank account number is valid.

Payroll giving - a new tax credit
=================================

The new voluntary payroll-giving scheme, providing a tax credit for gifts of money deducted from an employee's pay via payroll, is available from Jan 2010.

_**Sections LD 4 to LD 8, RP 14(ab), RP 8(a)(iii) and (iv) of the Income Tax Act 2007, sections 22(2)(ed), 22(2)(ke), 24Q and 141E(1)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, schedule 7 of the Companies Act 1993 and section 274(2)(aa) of the Insolvency Act 2006**_

The new voluntary payroll-giving scheme will be available on 7 January 2010. The scheme provides a tax credit for gifts of money that are deducted from an employee's pay through his or her employer's payroll. Employees receive an immediate reduction in tax by way of the tax credit each pay-period, eliminating the need to collect and keep receipts to claim the tax relief on gifts of money at the end of the year. To participate in the payroll-giving scheme the recipient organisation, such as a charity or school, must be a donee organisation.

The legislation only provides for the tax administration of the scheme. It does not prescribe the nature of the arrangements or relationships between employers, employees and donee organisations, or how the schemes should be set up in the workplace.

The scheme operates in addition to the current end-of-year donation tax credit claim system. Therefore, employees who do not or are unable to give through a payroll-giving scheme can still claim tax benefits on their donations through the existing end-of-year refund process.

### Background

The government first raised the idea of introducing a voluntary payroll-giving scheme to New Zealand in the 2006 discussion document, _Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations_. This was followed by a further discussion document in November 2007, _Payroll giving: providing a real-time benefit for charitable giving_, which discussed several options for implementing payroll giving in New Zealand. Submissions made in response to these documents indicated a wide level of public support for introducing a payroll-giving scheme – in particular, for making giving to charitable and philanthropic causes easier.

Other countries, such as Australia and the United Kingdom have introduced payroll giving and their experiences suggest that payroll giving is a simple, convenient and effective way of supporting charitable giving. These countries have also found that payroll giving enables businesses to connect with their communities in ways that achieve tangible and mutual benefits for everyone involved. In particular, payroll giving offers donee organisations the benefit of stable funding that is free of fundraising costs – that is, donee organisations receive donations as a lump sum from each employer and this reduces their costs as donee organisations only need to process one donation made through each employer. Another benefit is that donee organisations are not required to issue receipts to the donors.

The non-prescriptive nature of New Zealand's new payroll-giving scheme is intended to provide flexibility to allow relevant parties to work together to establish schemes that operate best for them and to manage the associated costs. A key policy outcome of the payroll-giving scheme is that it has the potential to establish genuine partnerships between businesses and the community, while supporting employees' community activities.

The Finance and Expenditure Committee recommended a number of changes to the payroll giving provisions to better reflect policy intentions and to improve the overall equity of the scheme.

### Key features

The rules for the new payroll-giving scheme are largely contained in new sections LD 4 to LD 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and in new section 24Q of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Unless otherwise indicated, section references are to the Income Tax Act 2007.

The key features of the scheme are:

*   Participation in payroll giving is voluntary for employers and employees.
*   Payroll giving is available only to employees whose employers file their employer monthly schedules and PAYE deduction forms electronically, using Inland Revenue's ir-File service, and who choose to offer payroll giving in their workplace.
*   Employees who choose to make payroll donations will receive a tax credit on the amount of those donations each payday. The tax credit is calculated on a set rate of 33?% of the donation made. The tax credit is offset against the PAYE amount calculated on the employee's gross pay, thereby reducing the amount of PAYE payable for that period. The maximum tax credit permitted is limited to the tax portion of the PAYE deduction on the employee's pay each pay-period.
*   Payroll donations must be made to a donee organisation. A donee organisation is a society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund as described in section LD 3(2) or an organisation listed in schedule 32.
*   Employees are responsible for ensuring that the chosen recipient is in fact a donee organisation and for supplying to the employer relevant details that will enable the transfer of the payroll donations to the donee organisations. A full list of donee organisations can be found at www.ird.govt.nz/donee-organisations.
*   Employers are responsible for ensuring that payroll donations are transferred to the chosen donee organisations within a specified period. They are also required to disclose certain information and keep adequate records to enable Inland Revenue to determine that payroll donations have in fact been transferred.
*   Payroll donations are held in trust for employees who participate until these are transferred to the correct donee organisation
*   Employees who donate through payroll giving are not eligible for the end-of-year donation refund on their payroll donations.

**Examples: Calculation of payroll donation**

In this example an employee asks her employer to deduct $10.00 from her gross weekly wage of $762.00. The amount of the tax credit is $3.33 and it is used to reduce the amount of PAYE that is payable by the employee for the pay-period.

The employer must transfer the $10.00 donation to the chosen donee organisation on or before the PAYE payment due date which is closest to the end of the two months from the last day of the pay-period that the donation was deducted. See below for an example of how to determine this transfer date. The employee has a take-home pay for the week of $605.25. The charity receives $10.00. Inland Revenue receives a PAYE payment of $146.75.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Employee's gross wage for the week | $762.00 |
| Donation amount | $10.00 |
|     |     |
| PAYE on gross wage (includes ACC levy) | $150.08 |
| Tax credit for payroll donation ($10 x 33?) | $3.33 |
| PAYE less tax credit for payroll donation | $146.75 |
|     |     |
| Employee's gross wage | $762.00 |
| Less PAYE net of the tax credit for payroll donation | $146.75 |
| Less donation | $10.00 |
|     |     |
| **Employee's take-home pay for the week** | **$605.25** |

### Application date

The rules of the payroll-giving scheme come into force on 7 January 2010.

### Detailed analysis

#### Establishing payroll-giving schemes in the workplace

In New Zealand, a small number of employers have already established payroll-giving relationships with their employees and individual donee organisations. Under these schemes, donations are made from the after-tax pay of the employee. As long as they keep records, employees can claim the tax benefit of these donations at the end of the year through the current donation tax credit process, like any other charitable donation. The new payroll-giving scheme replaces the end-of-year claim process for employees donating via payroll giving.

As stated earlier, the payroll-giving scheme legislation does not prescribe the nature of the arrangements or relationships between employers, employees and donee organisations, or how the schemes should be set up. Matters that would need to be decided upon by the relevant parties include:

*   the process for establishing a scheme that works best for all parties concerned;
*   the level of employee education about payroll giving that may be needed;
*   the process for selecting donee organisations to participate in the scheme;
*   the number of donee organisations that can participate in the scheme;
*   the level of engagement between donee organisations and employee donors; and
*   any minimum payroll donation threshold.

The following examples illustrate three possible approaches to establishing payroll-giving arrangements based on current New Zealand and overseas experiences.

**Example 1**

The employer has established a charitable trust to receive its employees' payroll donations and to decide on the ultimate destination of those donations. The charitable trust is itself a donee organisation. Community organisations apply for grant funding from the trust. As there is employee representation in the grant-making process, employees have the ability to determine the ultimate destination of their payroll donations. Employees receive regular feedback about the impact of their support in the community.

The employer-established charitable trust offers the employer and its employees a flexible payroll-giving programme.

**Example 2**

The employer and its employees participate in selecting the donee organisations they wish to support. The number of donee organisations is limited to six organisations. Employee peer champions are selected to communicate the benefits of the payroll-giving programme to employees and to facilitate on-going engagement in the workplace. Employees must give at least $2.00 or more each pay. Employees receive advice detailing the amount donated and to whom each year.

The employer also provides a degree of matching donations. Employees are encouraged to increase their involvement with the selected donee organisations through the giving of volunteer time and expertise (pro bono work).

There is a high level of employer/employee engagement in facilitating the payroll-giving programme. The six donee organisations are also actively involved in the programme.

**Example 3**

The employer has partnered with a third-party intermediary (which is a donee organisation). The intermediary receives the employee payroll donations from the employer and decides who in the community should benefit. The intermediary ensures that payroll donations go to support certain community activities in the region in which the payroll donations are sourced. Employees have no control over where their payroll donations are applied.

A third-party intermediary offers efficiency gains in time and costs for the employer and its employees.

#### The new tax credit for payroll donations

##### _Who can participate in the payroll-giving scheme (section LD 4(1))_

*   Participation in payroll giving is voluntary for both employers and employees. Tax credits for payroll donations are available to any person:
*   whose employer chooses to offer payroll giving in the workplace;
*   whose employer files its employer monthly schedules and employer deduction forms by electronic means; and
*   who chooses to make a payroll donation in a pay-period from their pay.

There is no registration process for payroll giving. An employer simply records any tax credits for payroll donations on the employer monthly schedule and then electronically files this form with Inland Revenue.

##### _Amount of credit (section LD 4(2) and (3))_

The credit applies at the rate of 33?% on the dollar value of all qualifying payroll donations made by the employee in a pay-period.

##### _Maximum credit (section LD 4(4))_

The maximum credit is limited to the income tax that the employee has paid for the pay period in which the donation has been deducted. In the earlier example, the PAYE tables show a PAYE deduction of $150.08 for a weekly pay of $762.00. The amount of $150.08 includes the ACC earners' levy of $12.95. Therefore, the maximum tax credit limit is $137.13 as this amount represents the actual income tax portion of the PAYE deduction.

##### _Non-refundable credit (section LD 4(5))_

The tax credit for payroll donations is treated as a non-refundable credit.

##### _No refunds for payroll donations (section LD 4(6))_

Payroll donations are not eligible for the end-of-year donation refund.

##### _Definition of "pay" (section LD 4(7))_

A new definition of "pay" has been included for the purposes of payroll giving. The definition is intended to ensure that only people who earn income in connection with their employment can participate in the payroll-giving scheme.

##### _Cancellation of the tax credit (sections LD 5, LD 6 and LD 7)_

New section LD 5 extinguishes the tax credit when a calculation or filing error has occurred. This provision also restores the tax credit if the error is subsequently corrected by the employer.

New section LD 6 extinguishes the tax credit when an employer or PAYE intermediary transfers an employee's payroll donation to a recipient that is not a donee organisation. Extinguishing the credit would result in a shortfall in PAYE, and so the employee would have an additional PAYE liability to pay for the relevant pay-period. Ultimately, the employee would be liable to meet any shortfall in PAYE, as provided in section RD 4(1), and section 168 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. New section LD 7 extinguishes the tax credit if the donation is returned to the employee. There may be instances when the employee receives a donation back (for example, the employer might have the donation returned if it had been provided to an ineligible donee organisation so the amount can be returned to the employee). The tax credit they previously received for that donation would be cancelled.

##### _Meaning and ranking of payroll donations (section LD 8)_

New section LD 8 provides that a payroll donation is the amount an employee requests an employer to transfer to a donee organisation for that pay-period. Section LD 8 also provides that an employee must meet his or her tax and other obligations for each pay-period before he or she can make payroll donations for a pay-period. In practice, this means that the employer would make the required pay-period tax and social policy deductions (including student loan, child support payments and KiwiSaver obligations) and any other deductions required to be made from an employee's salary and, if there are sufficient funds, make the necessary adjustments for payroll donations.

This provision may affect the amount of payroll donations an employee may make in a pay-period and also the maximum amount of tax credit.

##### _Transferring payroll donations (section 24Q of the Tax Administration Act 1994)_

Section 24Q of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is intended to apply when an employer agrees to establish payroll giving in the workplace and an employee asks the employer to transfer an amount of payroll donation from the employee's pay to a donee organisation. The provision specifies that employers must transfer any payroll donations to donee organisations on or before the due date required by sections RA 15 and RD 4 that is nearest to the end of the two-month period from the last day of the pay-period in which the donation was deducted.

The table below illustrates how this rule works. Date A is the last day of the pay period. If the pay covers 1-12 February, the last day of the pay-period is 12 February. To find Date B, add two months to Date A. Date C is the nearest PAYE payment due date to Date B. Date C is the last day on which an employer must pass the donation to the chosen donee organisation before penalties may apply.

**Table: Transfer of payroll donations**

|     | Date A | Add 2 months | Date B | Date C |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Monthly filer | 12 February | \+ 2 months | 12 April | 20 April |
| Twice-monthly filer | 12 February | \+ 2 months | 12 April | 5 April |

Payroll donations must be held in trust for employees until transferred to the donee organisations.

Employees are responsible for checking that the organisation they are donating to is in fact a "donee organisation" and for supplying their employer with sufficient details of the recipient to enable the payroll donation to be made.

#### _Priority of payroll-giving donations_

Schedule 7 of the Companies Act 1993 and section 274(2)(aa) of the Insolvency Act 2006 have been amended to confirm that when an employer goes into bankruptcy or liquidation and has not passed on the employee's donations to a donee organisation, those donations will have the same priority for return to the employee in a bankruptcy or liquidation as unpaid wages.

##### _Information disclosure and record-keeping requirements_

New section RP 14(ab) requires PAYE intermediaries to transfer any payroll donations to the relevant recipients on or before the due date of the employer's EDF/IR 345 nearest to the expiry of the two-month period that follows the pay period in which the donation was deducted.

New sections RP 8(a)(iii) and (iv) require employers who use PAYE intermediaries to keep a record of the amount of payroll donations and any tax credit for payroll donations and provide this information to the intermediary.

New sections 22(2)(ed) and 22(2)(ke) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provide that employers must maintain sufficient records to enable Inland Revenue to determine the transfer of an employee's payroll donation to the recipient of that donation.

##### _Penalty and use-of-money interest provisions_

Section RD 2(1)(b) provides that the payroll donation tax credit provisions are part of the PAYE rules. Therefore, the normal penalty and use-of-money-interest charges that apply to the determination and payment of PAYE also apply to the tax credit for payroll donations. It would be a question of fact and degree whether the current late payment penalties or any of the shortfall penalties would apply and the application of penalties would be on a case-by-case basis.

The only additional penalty for payroll giving is contained in section 141E(1)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This provides that employers are liable to pay a shortfall penalty of 150% if the employer knowingly does not transfer the payroll donations to the correct recipient. The penalty is imposed on the tax credit that is extinguished, because the credit would represent the short-paid PAYE.

Payroll software providers signing up with Inland Revenue to offer payday filing
================================================================================

**11 January 2019**

The new payday filing system works best for employers with payroll software and Inland Revenue has been working closely with the providers to make sure they’re well placed to meet their clients’ needs when it becomes mandatory in April.

This is when all employers will be required to submit their employment information every time they pay their staff.

Customer segment leader Richard Owen says a few software providers are already up and running and many more are in the process of finalising their solutions.

“Now more providers are on board, we’re hoping employers will put payday filing on their New Year to-do list.

“This is not something you want to leave until the last minute so we’ve been encouraging customers to speak with their software provider and start payday filing as soon as possible to avoid stress close to the deadline.

“Using payroll software is the simplest way to complete the task so I would encourage newcomers to the technology to take some time to research all available options.

“This includes the payday filing tool we’ve built into myIR within the Payroll Returns Account, which might suit those employers who are not quite ready to make a switch to software.”

\[embed width="480" height="270" class="leftAlone" thumbnail="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aEXA6lcb0uw/hqdefault.jpg?r"\]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEXA6lcb0uw\[/embed\]

Robert Watt describes his payday filing experience on software

Inland Revenue has provided a network ‘gateway’ for software providers to feed employment information straight into its systems. It guides them through testing and will help resolve any compatibility issues.  
  
“The gateway has allowed software providers to create a one-stop shop where in many cases the payday filing obligations can be completed seamlessly with just a few extra clicks,” Mr Owen says.  
  
“Accounting and payroll software has the ability to revolutionise business interactions with the tax system and has the potential to further reduce compliance costs.

“There will be some businesses wary of making another technology investment or think their business is too small to use software but there are a range of lower-cost options available in the market to suit companies of all sizes.

“We appreciate that some employers will feel that software doesn’t suit their business and that’s fine – there are other ways to payday file.

“We’ve designed the tool in our myIR portal to help them give us the information we need as easily as possible. A little set up time is needed but after that, most of their employment information will be pre-populated so employers can avoid having to re-enter much of the same information every payday.”

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 04/01 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Truck Leasing Limited trading as Esanda Fleet Partners (“Esanda”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BG 1, CI 3(1), GC 15, GC 17, and Schedule 2, Part A, clause 1(c). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the leasing of motor vehicles by Esanda under Multi-lease agreements to employers who provide the motor vehicles to employees for their private use. The Multi-lease agreements involve a motor vehicle lease with a term of one year, with the possibility of entering into two further terms of one year each. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. Esanda conducts a fleet leasing business. One of the options offered to customers is a motor vehicle lease with a term of one year, with the possibility of entering into two further terms of one year each (“Multi-lease”). 2. The arrangement for which this ruling is sought is the lease (using the Multi- lease product) of a motor vehicle from Esanda to an employer and the provision of that motor vehicle by the employer to an employee for their private use and enjoyment. The lease from Esanda to the employer is made under the terms and conditions contained in the Master Lease Agreement and Agreement to Lease (copies of which were provided to Inland Revenue with the application dated 2 December 2003). The Master Lease Agreement states that the agreement is between the lessee and Truck Leasing Limited. 3. As part of Esanda’s contractual obligations under the arrangement, it is required to advise employers of the market valuation of the vehicles. 4. The leases are operating leases rather than finance leases for income tax purposes. 5. Employers find the Multi-lease product appealing because of its flexibility. There are no penalties payable as a result of a customer choosing not to take up a further lease of the vehicle concerned. At the expiry of each 12-month period, lease obligations have been met under the Multi-lease product. 6. By comparison, Esanda imposes a significant potential penalty for early termination under its three year lease (under clause 28 of the Master Lease Agreement, Esanda can determine the amount of the penalty). 7. The flexibility provided by the Multi-lease is particularly valuable when employers are unsure of the number of employees for whom they will require vehicles or are unsure of the type of vehicle the employees may wish to have available. As a result, the employers prefer short lease terms so that they are not required to continue either renting vehicles that they do not require or pay significant penalties for early termination. 8. The leasing of the motor vehicles by Esanda to customers/lessees (being, for the purposes of this ruling, the employers) comprises the following steps: (a) Initial lease enquiry This is the initial contact from the potential customer inquiring about leasing vehicles from Esanda. (b) Marketing response This involves the initial meeting and consideration of promotional material. (c) Lease proposal Esanda provides the customer with a “Lease Proposal”. This is not a contractual document. It is a strategic/informative document that sets out the general basis for the services that Esanda can provide to customers, as lessees. (d) Credit application The lessee’s credit application is completed and assessed. (e) Motor Vehicle Leasing Terms and Conditions When a lessee commences dealings with Esanda, Esanda then provides the lessee with the Motor Vehicle Leasing Terms and Conditions. This is the Master Lease Agreement (“MLA”), which sets out the general terms and conditions for motor vehicles to be subsequently leased from Esanda. There is no specific reference to actual vehicles in the MLA. (f) Vehicle Order The lessee then completes a “Vehicle Order” which details their precise requirements, for example, the vehicle, term, kilometres, and relevant monthly lease rental etc. The Vehicle Order also incorporates the conditions in the MLA. 2 The Vehicle Order is completed prior to the commencement of each new lease and reflects the details for that lease only. (g) Acceptance Esanda then confirms acceptance with the lessee. (h) Agreement to Lease Esanda and the lessee then enter into an “Agreement to Lease”. The terms and conditions set out in the MLA are incorporated into this lease agreement. In a contractual sense, the lease of each vehicle is clearly created by the offer and acceptance of each specific Agreement to Lease. The actual motor vehicle is then delivered to the lessee. Under each and every Agreement to Lease entered into between Esanda and a particular lessee, the following will apply: • The term of the lease is 12 months. • There will be no provision for automatic renewal of the term of the lease. • There will be no option conferred on the lessee to renew, extend or vary the term of the lease. • There will be no provision for an incentive to the lessee if it takes up a further lease of the vehicle. • There will be no penalty on the lessee if it does not take up a further lease of the vehicle. (i) Procedure at the end of the lease As standard practice, Esanda advises the lessee of the status of the lease at least three months prior to the expiration of the 12-month lease term. Esanda is then able to determine whether the lessee wishes to lease the vehicle for a further lease term of 12 months. If not, the vehicle is returned to Esanda upon expiry of the lease. If the lessee wishes to retain the vehicle, a new lease is entered into for a further 12-month period. This new 12-month lease is assigned a separate and distinct number or record in Esanda’s computer system, which is used to manage vehicles leased using its Multi-lease product. In all cases, the old record for the previous 12-month lease is noted as having terminated. In addition, a new Agreement to Lease is executed for the further 12-month lease. Again, the general conditions set out in the MLA are incorporated into that new Agreement to Lease. The rental rates for the second and third periods are lower than the first. The rates reduce as the depreciated value of the vehicle reduces. If the customer does not renew, it does not get the benefit of reduced rates. However, there is 3 no obligation on Esanda to provide vehicles for subsequent 12-month leases and no obligation on customers to enter into a subsequent 12-month lease. (j) Valuation of vehicles As noted above, Esanda is required to advise lessees of the market value of the vehicle at the commencement of each 12-month lease period. The market value assessment takes into account the type of car and its condition and mileage. Esanda advises employers/lessees of the market valuation of the vehicles, and also provides market value forecasts for subsequent periods for indicative purposes only. Market values are routinely reviewed prior to the commencement of subsequent leases to ensure that the forecasts are accurate. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The motor vehicles leased by the employers under this Arrangement are leased for the private use or enjoyment of the employees or made available for the private use or enjoyment of the employees. b) No contract, agreement, plan, or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable), or any other documentation that concerns or otherwise affects the terms of the leases entered into under the Arrangement, is entered into between Esanda and the Lessee in relation to the Arrangement, other than the MLA, the Agreement to Lease and the Vehicle Order. c) Any rental rate for the Lessee for a subsequent lease period is the same rental rate that would be offered to any other customer for that particular vehicle and lease period (taking into account the customer credit rating, customer fleet size, kilometre allowances, and general service components of the lease including vehicle maintenance) irrespective of whether a previous lease for that vehicle was entered into by that Lessee. d) There is no contract, agreement, arrangement, plan, undertaking or understanding (whether formal or informal, and whether intended to be legally enforceable or not) at the time of entering into any lease under this Arrangement: • that any party will, or will if requested, renew, extend or vary the Lease Term; • that the parties will enter into a further lease in respect of the vehicle; or • that there will be penalties for choosing not to enter into a further lease in respect of the vehicle. 4 e) All calculations, factors, and/or projections which are taken into account in formulating the rental rates applying to each lease are not in any way based on a lease of the relevant motor vehicle for more than the relevant lease period. f) No Lessee is associated with Esanda within the meaning of section OD 7. g) The Lease is not a “finance lease” as defined in section OB 1. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The market value of a motor vehicle under this Arrangement, for the purposes of calculating the fringe benefit value of that vehicle under section CI 3(1) and Schedule 2, Part A clause 1(c), is determined on the date on which each new 12-month lease commences. • Sections GC 15 and GC 17 do not apply to the Arrangement. • Section BG l does not apply to negate or vary the conclusions above. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 4 May 2004 to 3 May 2007. This Ruling is signed by me on the 5 th day of February 2004.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 04/02 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Fletcher Challenge Forests Limited (“FCFL”). Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CF 3(1)(b). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement involves the payment by FCFL of a first return of approximately $349 million of capital to shareholders (“the Return of Capital”) out of the proceeds of the sale by the FCFL group of its forest estate and related assets, and upon the cancellation of FCFL shares. The forest estate sale involves the sale of such assets held by FCFL wholly-owned subsidiaries, with the proceeds being repatriated to FCFL. Further details of the Arrangement, and the background thereto, are as follows. Sale of entire forest estate 1. On 16 June 2003 FCFL announced that it was seeking buyers for its entire forest estate. FCFL has now reached agreement to sell the forestry assets (excluding the interest held by the FCFL group in Tarawera Forests Limited: “the Tarawera interest”) for $560 million to a group of three purchasers, namely, Kiwi Forests Group Limited, Viking Global New Zealand Limited and OTPP New Zealand Forests Limited (“the Purchasers”). The Purchasers will each purchase separate parts of the forestry assets. 2. Neither FCFL, nor any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, are an “associated person” (as defined in section OB 1) with any of the Purchasers. At the time this Ruling was issued FCFL directors understood that the ownership of the Purchasers was as follows: • Kiwi Forests Group Limited was owned by four New Zealand resident investors, Messrs Trevor Farmer, Ross Green, Mark Wyborn and Adrian Burr; • Viking Global New Zealand Limited was wholly-owned by a fund of institutional investors managed by Prudential Timber Investments, Inc of the United States of America; • OTPP New Zealand Forest Investments Limited was wholly-owned by The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan of Canada. 3. On an initial settlement of the sale FCFL will receive $351 million. The balance of $209 million will be received as and when third party consents are granted to the transfer (to the Purchasers) of the interest of FCFL under various leases, forestry rights and joint venture arrangements that are part of the forestry assets. The consent process is expected to take seven months to complete. 4. Receipt of proceeds from the sale of the Tarawera interest will depend upon when a buyer is located for that asset. 5. The forest estate comprises approximately 80% of the total assets of FCFL. Following completion of the sale of the forest estate (including the Tarawera interest), the business of FCFL will comprise timber processing, marketing and distribution activities. Return of sale proceeds 6. The Return of Capital is the first of two returns of capital planned for the sale proceeds. The Return of Capital is scheduled to occur in March 2004 and is expected to total approximately $349 million. The second return of up to $311 million (subject to determination of the sale price for the Tarawera interest) is planned to occur once all necessary third party consents have been granted and the outstanding purchase price payable by the Purchasers has been received together with receipt of the sale price of the Tarawera interest. Approximately $65 million will be applied to meet transaction costs, working capital adjustments, repaying debt and forestry staff redundancies. 7. FCFL intends that the Return of Capital will be upon a pro rata cancellation of one out of every two current shares pursuant to an arrangement subject to the supervision of the High Court under Part XV of the Companies Act 1993. A payment of $1.25 per share cancelled will be made and shares will be cancelled wholly and not in part. 8. FCFL will seek shareholder approval for the sale of the forestry assets and the first return of sale proceeds at a meeting of shareholders scheduled to be held on 20 February 2004. If shareholders approve, and if the High Court also approves, the first return of sale proceeds should be made some time in March 2004, with shares consequentially cancelled pursuant to the order of the High Court. 9. The funding for the Return of Capital will be derived from Fletcher Challenge Forests Industries Limited (“FCFIL”) selling its shares in East Woodlands Ltd, Northwest Woodland Ltd and South Woodlands Ltd, as well as from FCFIL 2 selling some related forest plant and equipment. Each of these four companies are wholly-owned subsidiaries of FCFL. The funding will not reflect trading profits derived prior to the time of the Return of Capital. 10. The sale proceeds received by FCFIL will be used to repay debt owed to Fletcher Challenge Forests (Manufacturing) Limited (“FCFML”) of approximately $351 million, which is another wholly-owned subsidiary of FCFL. These funds will then be used by other wholly-owned companies of the FCFL group to repay debt for the same amount owed within the FCFL group. Ultimately, the sale proceeds will be used by Fletcher Challenge Industries Limited (“FCIL”) to pay a dividend of approximately $294 million to FCFL and to repay a debt to FCFL of approximately $57 million. Payment of dividends 11. FCFL has not paid a dividend since April 1998, as the financial position of the company has not allowed it. However, FCFL is now in a position where it could re-contemplate paying dividends. In this regard, FCFL management estimates that FCFL will be able to pay a dividend for the year ended 30 June 2005. Level of reserves 12. FCFL’s reserves since 1998 were as follows: Year Total Reserves ($m) 1998 211 1999 222 2000 481 2001 (44) 2002 (299) 2003 (579) 13. Any surplus cash accumulated before dividends are paid to FCFL shareholders will be applied as part of the capital expenditures on upgrading plant, repaying debt, and making investments to establish a suitable platform for FCFL’s processing and distribution activities. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) None of the shares cancelled upon the Return of Capital are a “non- participating redeemable share” as defined in section CF 3(14). b) The share cancellation upon the Return of Capital constitutes a “pro rata cancellation”, as defined in section CF 3(14). 3 c) The Return of Capital constitutes a “fifteen percent capital reduction”, as defined in section CF 3(14). d) At the time the Return of Capital is undertaken, it is not anticipated by the directors of FCFL that the associated returns to shareholders will affect the future dividend policy of FCFL. e) At the time the Return of Capital is undertaken it is not anticipated by the directors of FCFL that there will be a subsequent issue of shares. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: • To the extent that it does not exceed the “available subscribed capital per share cancelled” (as defined in section OB 1), the Return of Capital will be excluded from the definition of “dividends” pursuant to section CF 3(1)(b). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 13 February 2004 until 31 March 2006. This Ruling is signed by me on the 13 th day of February 2004.

Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Infrastructure Auckland. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: • Section 2 • Section 3A • Section 5(1) • Section 5(6D) • Section 8(1) • Section 10(2) • Section 20(3) The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the making of grants by Infrastructure Auckland (“IA”) on the basis of applications from potential recipients to carry out specific transport or stormwater infrastructure projects within the Auckland region. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Background 1. IA is a body corporate which was established pursuant to the Local Government Amendment Act 1998, and the Infrastructure Auckland Deed. 2. Section 707ZZK(1) of the Local Government Act 1974 (“LGA”) provides that the principal function of Infrastructure Auckland is to contribute funds, by way of grants, in respect of projects, or parts of projects, undertaken in the Auckland Region for the purpose of providing: (a) Land transport; or (b) Any passenger service; or (c) Any passenger transport operation; or \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 17/01/2007 2 of 10 (d) Stormwater infrastructure; where the projects or parts of projects generate benefits to the community generally in addition to any benefits that accrue to any identifiable persons or groups of persons. (Despite the repeal of the Local Government Act 1974 by the Local Government Act 2002, the provisions relating to Infrastructure Auckland in Part 44C (sections 707ZZH to 707ZZZZG) continue to have effect as if those provisions were still in force: section 313, Local Government Act 2002.) 3. IA’s asset base was originally derived from the Auckland Regional Council (the “ARC”). In 1992, certain assets and liabilities of the ARC relating to its non-core activities were transferred to the Auckland Regional Services Trust (“ARST”) under Part XLIVB of the LGA. However, ARST did not inherit all the functions of the ARC and its primary role was to manage its assets, reduce the liabilities and dispose of specified assets as required under the provisions of the LGA. 4. In 1998, the Government decided that the assets held by ARST should be applied for developing the infrastructure of the Auckland region and it was decided to create IA to facilitate this decision. Pursuant to section 707ZZZL of the LGA, on 1 October 1998 the assets and liabilities of ARST were transferred to IA, with the following exceptions: • $10 million was paid to the ARC for the purposes of regional parks; • $10 million was paid to the territorial authorities of the Auckland region to be applied to significant projects in the Auckland region in the area of arts and culture; • the assets and liabilities of ARST in relation to the Pikes Point walkway were transferred to the Auckland City Council; and • the shares in Watercare Services Limited were divided between the territorial authorities of the Auckland region. 5. Regional Treasury Management Limited, a subsidiary of the ARST, was also dissolved at that time and its assets and liabilities vested in IA. The making of grants 6. Section 707ZZL(1) of the LGA provides that any local authority which, or other person who, intends to undertake within the Auckland Region a project in respect of which IA may make a grant in the exercise of its functions under section 707ZZK(1) may apply to IA for such a grant. 7. IA, in deciding whether or not to contribute funds to projects or parts of projects or components of projects in the exercise of its principal function \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 17/01/2007 3 of 10 under section 707ZZK, must be guided by the criteria specified in clause 5.2 of the Infrastructure Auckland Deed, which provides: 5.2 Criteria: The criteria, in relation to each such project, are as follows: (a) The extent to which the project generates benefits to the community generally in addition to those that accrue to any identifiable persons or groups of persons; and (b) The extent to which the benefits generated to the community generally by the project exceed the costs (including the external costs) of the project by a margin greater than the assessed risk that the project will not deliver its intended net benefits; and (c) Whether the project satisfies the requirements of clause 4.1; and (d) The extent to which the project contributes and gives effect to any Auckland Regional Land Transport Strategy or the Auckland regional growth strategy or any regional policy statement or proposed regional policy statement adopted under the Resource Management Act 1991 or any regional stormwater strategy as adopted by the Regional Growth Forum; and (e) The principle that the costs of the project, including the external costs, should be: (i) Allocated in a manner that is consistent with economic efficiency; and (ii) Where practicable, recovered from those persons or groups of persons who-- - benefit from the project; or - contributed to such costs; and in a manner that matches the extent to which those persons or groups of persons benefit from the project or contributed to such costs; and (f) The extent to which the project will be in the best interests of the inhabitants of the Auckland Region; and (g) The extent to which the project provides the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people in the Auckland Region; and (h) The extent to which the project provides for a geographical spread of public benefits across the Auckland Region; and (i) The degree to which the project may improve economic performance in the Auckland Region; and (j) The degree to which the project may contribute to regional environmental outcomes; and (k) The degree of urgency for the project. 8. Clause 4.1 of the Infrastructure Auckland Deed sets out further matters which IA must have regard to in making grants. It states: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 17/01/2007 4 of 10 Infrastructure Auckland must ensure that grants it makes under section 707ZZK(1)-- (a) Are made primarily for the purpose of funding the capital components of projects; and (b) Are not inconsistent with any Auckland Regional Land Transport Strategy or the Auckland regional growth strategy or any regional policy statement or proposed regional policy statement under the Resource Management Act 1991; and (c) Are made having regard to Transfund New Zealand's funding policies; and (d) Are not for services for which funding has already been identified. (As required by section 707ZZZA(1)(c)) 9. The vast majority of the grants made by IA have been made (and will continue to be made) to local authorities and commercial transport operators who carry on taxable activities and must account for GST in respect of supplies they make. Terms and conditions attaching to grants 10. The grants IA makes are usually subject to terms and conditions. 11. IA has a broad discretion, pursuant to section 707ZZL of the LGA, to make grants subject to such terms and conditions as IA sees fit. 12. However, in practice, there are three broad categories under which IA will impose conditions in relation to a grant. These are: (a) Conditions which do no more than ensure the efficient and proper application of the grant funds, consistent with section 707ZZK(1) and 707ZZL(2) of the LGA, as well as other relevant statutory requirements, including one or more of the following conditions: (i) The grant recipient warranting that it has disclosed all information material to the grant, and that all information supplied is correct; (ii) The grant recipient completing any due diligence or further enquiry (if appropriate) for the purpose of ensuring the feasibility of the project; (iii) The grant recipient obtaining all relevant statutory and other consents and approvals (such as resource consents, building consents, local body and regulatory authority approvals) on terms and conditions that enable it to complete the grant project in accordance with the plans, specifications and project description submitted with the grant application; \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 17/01/2007 5 of 10 (iv) The grant recipient obtaining all relevant board and shareholder approvals; (v) The grant recipient having the legal capacity to carry out the project and enter into the requisite contractual arrangements; (vi) The grant recipient entering into the principal contracts required to complete the relevant project; (vii) The grant recipient establishing an appropriate entity to hold assets and/or carry out the project; (viii) The grant recipient obtaining all property and other legal rights that are necessary for the project; (ix) The grant recipient obtaining any additional funding required to carry out the grant project (to the extent that the grant made by IA does not provide sufficient funding); (x) That any contract for work to be done in relation to the project must, as far as is practicable: • Be awarded following a competitive process approved by the grant recipient’s governing body and which involves the receipt and consideration of at least two competing bids from independent parties; • Provide certainty on pricing and completion; and • Be on an industry standard form published by Standards New Zealand or similar; (xi) That the project will be carried out in accordance with all legal requirements (in particular the Resource Management Act 1991 and the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992); (xii) Where the grant recipient is not a local authority, IA will designate a local authority to be responsible for ensuring the grant is applied to its approved purpose; (xiii) The project will be completed to specified standards; (xiv) The grant recipient carrying out the project as stated in the grant application. The grant recipient must obtain IA’s approval if it cannot complete the project in accordance with the plans, specifications and project description provided in the grant application, or if variations or modifications are required; (xv) The grant recipient obtaining certificates from the project engineer or other qualified, impartial, independent contract \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 17/01/2007 6 of 10 administrator approved by IA (who acknowledges that he or she owes a duty of care to IA): • That a project milestone (as agreed with IA) has been completed as outlined in the grant application; • That the project has been completed in accordance with the plans, specifications, and project description included in the grant application, and a completion certificate issued; and • Showing the amount of capital expenditure on the project from the date IA approved the grant to the date the project was completed, and copies of the final accounts issued under the construction contract, for consultants and other project costs. (xvi) The grant recipient providing regular reports to IA at specified intervals including information on the progress of the project and costs, adverse events that have arisen, and the outcome of the project following its completion; and (xvii) The grant recipient acknowledging that the assistance provided by IA in respect of the project is limited to the amount of the grant, and IA will have no residual liabilities in respect of the project; (b) Conditions that ensure that the benefit of the grant is obtained by the Auckland people and region; provided that in any such case any benefit connected with any specified person or group of persons is incidental to and/or a necessary and unavoidable result of generating benefits to the community generally in the Auckland Region, including one or more of the following conditions: (i) The grant recipient allowing competitors to use assets that are funded by grants; (ii) The grant recipient allowing general public access to certain assets; (iii) The grant recipient informing the public of the existence of the services, assets or improvements (as the case may be) arising from the grant project; and (iv) The grant recipient acknowledging the contribution of IA to the funding of the grant project. (c) Conditions that are contingent on the occurrence of some future event that would alter the assumptions inherent in making the grant, including one or more of the following conditions: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 17/01/2007 7 of 10 (i) The grant recipient agreeing not to sell or dispose of its interest in assets acquired or approved as part of a project in respect of which a grant has been made unless authorised by IA; (ii) A condition providing that, if assets are disposed of, those assets must continue to be used in a manner that will deliver benefits to the Auckland Region generally, whether by reason of being transferred to a local authority, a subsidiary of a local authority, a competitor or otherwise; (iii) Rights to grants provided by IA may not be assigned; (iv) The grant applicant maintaining the project for the life of the asset in accordance with sound business practice; (v) A right for IA to cancel a grant and require repayment of amounts paid in respect of the grant if: • the grant recipient cannot complete the project by the specified date; or • the specified purpose for which the grant was made cannot be achieved; or • the grant was made in reliance on information that was incorrect or misleading; or • there are variations to the project to which the grant funds were applied that are not authorised by IA and will have a material adverse impact on the amount of benefit to the community that the project will generate; or • a condition upon which a grant is made is not satisfied; (vi) The grant recipient ensuring that any assets created as a result of the grant project remain available to be used for the benefit of the Auckland Region where the grant recipient disposes of its ownership of the assets or ceases to use them for the purposes for which the grant was made; and (vii) The grant recipient obtaining IA’s consent prior to moving certain assets to another physical location or changing the ownership of such assets.

IA is required to be operated by up to seven “members” who are appointed in accordance with the Infrastructure Auckland Deed. The members are responsible for the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer. 14. The members are appointed by a body known as the Electoral College. The Electoral College is established pursuant to the LGA and its function is set out in section 707ZZT, which provides: (1) The functions of the Electoral College are— (a) To appoint, in accordance with this Act and the Infrastructure Auckland deed, members of Infrastructure Auckland: (b) To appoint, in accordance with this Act and the Infrastructure Auckland deed, the chairperson of Infrastructure Auckland: (c) To discharge, in accordance with this Act and the Infrastructure Auckland deed, its duties in relation to Infrastructure Auckland’s statement of corporate intent: (d) To monitor the performance of Infrastructure Auckland: (e) To consult with the Minister from time to time about amendments to the Infrastructure Auckland deed: (f) To carry out such other functions as are conferred on it by this Act or any other Act. 15. The Electoral College has eight members with each of the Manukau City Council, the Auckland City Council, the Waitakere City Council, the North Shore City Council, the Papakura District Council, the Rodney District Council, the Franklin District Council and the Auckland Regional Council being entitled to appoint one member. Central government involvement with IA 16. The Minister of Local Government (“the Minister”) has a minor degree of involvement with IA. 17. The Minister has been required to prepare and sign the Infrastructure Auckland Deed. In addition the Infrastructure Auckland Deed may be amended from time to time by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister after consultation with the Electoral College. 18. Pursuant to clause 46.1 of the Infrastructure Auckland Deed, the Minister, in consultation with the Electoral College, must, in the period of 12 months ending with the close of 30 September 2008, conduct a review of the activities and future of IA for the purpose of determining whether there is a continuing need for IA to make grants under section 707ZZK(1). 19 In all other material respects, IA is totally divorced from central government involvement. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 17/01/2007 9 of 10 Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) No direct benefit to IA will arise in respect of grants made by IA except for a market rate return to compensate IA for temporary loss of use of funds where circumstances arise which necessitate repayment of a grant previously made. b) Any benefit resulting from any project in respect of which a grant is made which arises to specified or identified persons or groups of persons is incidental to IA’s overall purpose of providing a benefit to the Auckland Region generally. c) No direct benefit will arise to any member or employee of IA from any project in respect of which a grant is made except in that member or employee’s capacity as a member of the community generally living in the Auckland Region. d) This ruling only applies in respect of grants made subject to no conditions, or subject to one or more of the conditions listed in paragraphs 12(a), 12(b), or 12(c) of the Arrangement, and will not apply in respect of any grant which contains conditions which are not listed in paragraphs 12(a), 12(b), or 12(c) if such conditions are inconsistent with the conditions listed in such paragraphs. e) The criteria specified in clause 5.2 of the Infrastructure Auckland Deed are the sole criteria that IA will use in determining whether to offer a grant. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: • The grant payments that the grant recipients receive from IA will not be deemed to be consideration for a supply of goods or services pursuant to section 5(6D). • The grant recipients will not be required to account for GST pursuant to section 8(1) in respect of the grant payments they receive from IA. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 5 May 2004 to 4 May 2009.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 04/04 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by McBreen Jenkins Construction Limited (“McBreen”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BG 1, CD 5, CH 2, CH 3, EB 1 and GB 1. This Ruling does not consider the tax implications (if any) arising in respect of contributions made by McBreen to employees of associated companies of McBreen, or any tax implications (if any) arising in respect of any benefits derived by those employees of associated companies of McBreen. This Ruling does not consider the application of section DF 7 or the implications of this provision (if any) on interest free loans made by McBreen to the Trust under the Arrangement. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and operation of the McBreen Jenkins Construction Limited Employee Option Plan (“EOP”) for the benefit of the employees of McBreen in New Zealand. The EOP will be implemented through the establishment of a trust (“the Trust”). The Trustee of the EOP will be TMG Trustees (NZ) Limited, a New Zealand registered company (“the Trustee”). The Trust Deed (“the Trust Deed”), the Plan Rules and the Employee Share Option Contract (“Contract”) provided to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue on 1 March 2002 together form the Arrangement subject to this Ruling. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. McBreen 1. McBreen is incorporated in New Zealand. It is one of New Zealand’s leading civil engineering organisations. At the time of issuing this Ruling it employs a workforce of around 500 employees and is noted for successful completion of the more difficult and complex construction projects. Establishment of the EOP 2. McBreen will select certain employees and direct the Trustee to invite those employees to enter into a Contract. The Contract is a contract between the Trustee and the employee under which the employee can acquire options to purchase shares from the Trustee (“Options”). The shares will generally be McBreen shares, purchased directly from the company (ie. as fresh share issues) or from existing shareholders. However, where McBreen shares are unavailable or are inappropriate given the purpose of the EOP, other shares may be purchased on the New Zealand Stock Exchange or other shares approved by McBreen (“the Shares”). 3. In terms of the source of shares to be acquired by the Trust, it is necessary to undertake a threefold process, being: (a) valuation of shares; (b) creating a warehouse for shares (ie. The EOP); and (c) creating a market for shares (ie. The EOP). Source of Shares 4. Firstly, it is anticipated that there will be two sources of shares for the EOP, that is: • Plan A ESOT shares, which will be shares in McBreen; and • Plan B ESOT shares will be in an associated investment/finance company of the McBreen Jenkins Group. 5. To commence the plan, all shares will be sourced from fresh issues – ie. it is not envisaged that initial acquisitions of shares by the Trustee would be acquired from existing shareholders. However, there have been situations in past employee share plans where founding directors have wished to sell shares and the employee share plan acquired those shares at an arm’s length market value. Also, over time as employees acquire shares and sell those shares the EOP trust, as the prime market for EOP shares, will issue options, acquire shares, issue shares to employees under the terms of the EOP and purchase shares from employees. 6. It is proposed to earmark around 35% of McBreen’s issued capital for utilisation by the Plan A ESOT. However, given McBreen’s circumstances as an unlisted company, with limitations as to its issued capital, it is necessary to establish a subsidiary or associated company to provide further equity under the Plan B ESOT. 7. The shares issued under Plan A ESOT will involve the more key and skilled employees of McBreen’s operation, while the Plan B ESOT will provide equity to the remaining employees as a general employee share plan. 2 8. If an employee takes up the invitation to join the EOP they will become a participating employee (“Participant”). The Participant will then enter into an agreement with their employer, McBreen, that as a consequence of entering into the Contract with the Trustee they will agree to sacrifice a part of their salary (i.e. a reduction of up to 25% of their pre-tax total fixed remuneration). This agreement may also include giving up the right to any future and contingent bonuses and any future contingent incentive payments. This can either be a percentage reduction or a specific figure. 9. McBreen will execute an addendum to their employment contract making provision for Salary Sacrifice, and amending the contract of employment, in the following terms: I,............................ have accepted an offer by the Trustee of the McBreen Jenkins Employee Option Plan, to participate in the Plan and to acquire the right to purchase shares from the Trustee, on the terms and conditions referred to in the Trust Deed and the Share Option Contract. I authorise and accept a reduction in my pre-taxation monetary remuneration of an amount equal to the Employee Election (as defined in the Employee Share Option Contract) and I authorise and accept a reduction in any future and contingent bonuses or other future and contingent incentive payments of not more than the Employee Remuneration Election (as defined in the Employee Share Option Contract). 10. The remuneration package of McBreen employees is set each year in advance. Participants will be offered the choice of taking part of the total value of their remuneration package in cash salary, or benefits in kind, which may include Options under the EOP. The Options issued to Participants may replace some of the current incentives or performance based reward programmes of McBreen. 11. McBreen may also make additional payments to the Trustee to enable it to acquire further shares. These payments may arise from bonus offers. Bonus offers 12. This will involve McBreen paying an amount, which would otherwise be paid as a salary bonus, to the Trust. The amount paid to the Trust will be determined as follows. McBreen sets a minimum operating turnover, less: wages, operating costs and overheads. Once the minimum operating turnover is achieved McBreen will set a “bonus pool” equivalent to 5% of the annual operating turnover and 30% of the “Participating Contribution”. The “Participating Contribution” is defined as operating turnover less direct wages and direct operating costs and overheads (plant operating costs and other variable costs and indirect operating wages and salaries, but not shareholder salaries). 100% of the “bonus pool” will be paid to the Trust. For example, if a bonus pool of $90,000 were established, McBreen or an associated company of McBreen (being a company that is related to McBreen by virtue of section 2(3) of the Companies Act 1993) would make a contribution to the Trustee who would then acquire shares. The Trustee would then issue Options to the Participants. 3 13. The extent to which the Participants will receive the Options will be determined in accordance with the proportion of points allocated to each Participant. The points will be calculated as follows: • one point for every $5,000 of gross taxable earnings; and • one point for each year of service to a maximum of 25 years of service. 14. McBreen may also use bonus offers to operate as long term incentives to the Participants. Long term incentives are used as a means of attracting key employees with particular expertise necessary for the ongoing performance and profitability of the organisation. They are usually structured so that key employees may be retained and “locked-in” by way of “golden handcuffs” (minimum non-exercise periods of say 3 to 5 years, which are set as a term of offer for particular option allocations). 15. Payments will be made from the “bonus pool” only if the company is left in a position of profit and its net assets backing is sufficient to meet its banking covenant. In some years no “bonus pool” would be generated, while in others bonus pools of varying amounts would be produced. Operation of the Trust 16. The payments from McBreen to the Trust, arising from Salary Sacrifice and Bonus Offers will not exceed the following percentages, expressed as a percentage of a Participant’s total wages, salary or other remuneration in any one year: • in respect of Salary Sacrifice, up to 25%. • in respect of Bonus Offers, up to 30%. 17. These amounts received by the Trustee from the Salary Sacrifice and Bonus Offers will then be used to purchase the Shares. 18. Shares acquired by the Trustee will be purchased at their prevailing market values. The value of the shares will be reflected (i.e. indeed, costed to the Participants’ remuneration in lieu of bonuses and salary) on the basis of the cost price of shares acquired by the Trustee. It is this cost price which will be reflected and deducted from their remuneration entitlements. This may require Salary Sacrifice or debiting against annual remuneration or other performance remuneration (eg. bonuses, incentives, profit share etc). 19. The valuation of shares is set on the basis of net asset values on a times profitability (eg earnings, before tax), while also applying general principles “of true and fair value”, and maintaining “transparency”, and “integrity” in the calculation of the share value. McBreen has used quite simple valuation formula in the past. These have usually been provided by the company’s management. For example, there may be a “times earnings” ratio – eg. 2, 3 or 4 x EBIT (earnings before interest and tax). Alternatively, some companies may use net asset values. 4 20. However, as net asset values invariably equate to a net accumulated profit figure, companies have tended to use a “times” earnings basis. 21. The Options will be provided from the Trust to the Participants for nil consideration. The shares will be held in the Trust for the benefit of the Participants. Participants will, therefore, have a general beneficial interest in the shares held as the corpus of the Trust. These beneficial interests in the corpus of the Trust and the capacity to enforce due administration of that Trust will be complemented by the Contract. 22. Under the terms of the Trust Deed and Plan Rules of the EOP, the Participants will not have specific shares allocated to them or held on their behalf or for their benefit prior to exercise of the Options. Nothing in the EOP confers upon any Participants any rights in respect of the shares, including any right to instruct the Trustee how to vote or otherwise to deal with the shares. Prior to the Participant exercising their option to acquire shares and pay the stipulated consideration, the Trustee does not hold any of the shares for the benefit of any particular Participant. 23. In each of the ways Options may be acquired, payments made by McBreen and associated companies are for the purpose of remunerating the Participants for their services to McBreen or the associated companies. McBreen considers that the contributions are made in respect of the provision of services by Participants as part of their employment duties. 24. The Trustee may accumulate or decide to accumulate all or part of the income (including any dividends in respect of EOP shares) arising from the Trust in an income year. The accumulated income shall be added to the capital of the Trust so that it becomes part of the Trust and is held on the same trusts and with the same powers, but the Trustee may still resort to the accumulated income at any time and pay, apply, or appropriate all or part of it as if it were income of the Trust. 25. The Trustee may, and shall at the direction of the Participant, pay, apply or appropriate all or part of the income arising from the trust fund in an income year: • in meeting EOP expenses; • to one or more of the Participants; and/or • for any other purposes relevant to the EOP. Any dividend income distributed as cash to the Participants will be on a pro- rata basis. 26. In some cases the payments made by McBreen will be in respect of employees who are employed by an associated company for reasons of administrative convenience, but will be reimbursed by those associated companies. 5 Administrative Contributions 27. McBreen will also provide the Trustee with sufficient funds (“Administrative Contributions”) to enable the Trustee to perform its obligations under the EOP. These Administrative Contributions will be made to the Trustee only for accounting fees, audit fees, investment management fees and trustee fees. These funds will be provided by way of grant. For financial reporting purposes, these payments made by McBreen to the Trustee for accounting fees, audit fees, investment management fees and trustee fees will be expensed in the year in which they are paid. Loans 28. In some cases loans will be provided to the Trustee in lieu of contributions so as to reduce the effect of contributions on the profitability of the company. McBreen considers this also has the effect of deferring the time of tax deductibility on the contributions. For example, McBreen may not wish to have the contribution reflected in the profit and loss account, due to adverse perceptions of financiers or investment analysts. This is the usual means of spreading the costs of contributions over a number of years, rather than in any one particular year. Participants exercising their Options under the EOP 29. The Contract is a contract between the Trustee and the Participant which governs the Participant’s right to exercise their Option and acquire the Shares. The Contract can only be exercised in respect of an “Unrestricted Share Option”. In some cases the Participants may be required to have achieved certain time or performance based contingencies before their Options become “Unrestricted Share Options” under the Contract. In particular there may be a set minimum vesting or non-exercise periods (eg. three years of continuous service and/or certain other performance criteria). Under the first proposed allocation, the non-exercise period will be for a period of one year from the date of entering into the Contract. Once this vesting or minimum vesting non- exercise condition is achieved, the Option becomes an “Unrestricted Share Option”, which may be exercised at the discretion of the Participant. 30. In order to exercise their Option under the Contract the Participant must give the Trustee an “Exercise Notice”. The Exercise Notice must specify the number of shares the Participant wishes to purchase and whether the Participant wishes to either: • purchase the relevant shares from the Trustee; or • at the Participant’s election, request the Trustee to sell the relevant shares on behalf of the Participant and distribute the proceeds of the sale of the shares to the Participant. 31. In both cases, it will first be necessary for the Participant to exercise their Option under the Contract and pay the stipulated consideration of $1.00 in 6 total. The right to acquire shares, which are the subject of an Unrestricted Share Option, is the subject of rules dealing with forfeiture. 32. The right to exercise the Options will be subject to the ongoing restrictions consisting of: (a) The Plan Rules—the conditions applicable to the acquisition of the Shares by the Trustee and provision of Options under the terms of the trust are to be set out in the governing Plan Rules. The Plan Rules will govern the respective relationships between McBreen, participating employees and the Trustee. (b) Paying for Shares—on vesting the Shares will be issued to the Participants for consideration. 33. Additionally, the Participant is also deemed to have given an Exercise Notice in the following circumstances: • ten years from date the Participant entered into the Contract; • termination of employment; or • termination of Trust. If this situation occurs, the Participant will be required to pay the consideration of $1. 34. Upon the receipt of a valid Exercise Notice, and receipt of a consideration of $1.00, the Trustee shall either transfer the Shares in specie to the Participant or pay cash distributions to the Participant funded from the sale of the relevant Shares or from additional contributions from McBreen. The Shares or cash will be distributed to the Participant at a point in time contemporaneous with the exercise of the Option. 35. The number of shares which the Participant will be entitled to purchase will be calculated by dividing the amount of the Salary Sacrifice by the average price paid by the Trustee to acquire the shares for the purpose of the EOP over a one week period up to and including the day of the close of the offer to the Participant. 36. The number of shares to which the Participants are entitled will be adjusted under the terms of the Contract for any bonus offer or matching offer. 37. The Options will be operative for up to a maximum period of ten years from the date the Participant entered into the Contract or earlier on termination of employment. The ten-year limitation may be waived at the discretion of the Trustee (e.g. in cases of hardship). Participants forfeiting their Options under the EOP 38. The Options will be subject to forfeiture and cancellation for nil consideration by the Trustee in situations of: 7 • Theft, fraud or defalcation by the Participant in respect of McBreen or one of its associated companies; and • Summary dismissal from McBreen or one of its subsidiaries. 39. If Options are forfeited by one Participant, it is intended that further Options will be issued to present or future Participants. The options are forfeited if the person has not served their required vesting or non exercise period. Forfeited options are usually cancelled and new options may be allocated in accordance with the remuneration purpose of each allocation. 40. Those allocations and the terms of those allocations (eg: the non-exercise or vesting period and the performance hurdles) which may be set depend on the purpose of the allocation. For example, a short term incentive may have a relatively short vesting period (eg: one (1) year), while a long term incentive would typically have a vesting or non-exercise period ranging from two (2) to five (5) years. 41. The plans are usually implemented on an “enabling” basis. That means that the employee is in a position to set varying terms and conditions of the vesting or non-exercise period depending on the particular remuneration purpose of the particular allocation. 42. The Options cannot be transferred or disposed of for cash. Winding up of the Trust 43. In the event that the Trust is wound up, each Participant will be deemed to have exercised their Option under the Contract to purchase from the Trustee for a consideration not exceeding $1.00 in total, and (at the Participant’s election) to receive the proceeds from the sale (by the Trustee) of shares subject to the Contract (for which the Participant has an Option). 44. If any shares or other assets remain, such shares and other assets, or the proceeds of their sale, will first be applied to meeting the costs and liabilities of winding up, and thereafter will be applied by the Trustee at the direction of McBreen to or for the benefit of any other employee incentive plan or scheme for the benefit of the employees. Pursuant to clause 8 of the Trust Deed the Trustee is prevented from applying the above winding up options in any way for the benefit of McBreen. It states: 8. Application of Plan Shares 8.1 Shares are to be held by the Trustee for the purposes of this Plan until sold by the Trustee to a Participating in accordance with the Participant’s right under a Share Option Contract. 8.2 Notwithstanding Rule 8.1, the Participating Employer may in its absolute discretion from time to time by notice in writing direct the Trustee to apply any Plan Shares in any one or more of the following ways: 8 (a) to be transferred to any other incentive plan or scheme for the benefit of Employees in which the participating Employer or any Associated Company is not beneficially interested: (b) to be transferred to any superannuation or similar fund for the benefit of Employees in which the Participating Employer or any Associated Company is not beneficially interested. Reasons for the EOP 45. The EOP will be a key part of McBreen’s remuneration performance pay regime for its key executives and other deserving employees. The purpose is to attract, retain, and motivate such employees (quality years of service), and to act as a deterrent to theft or misbehaviour, and to give them a clear identity as shareholders in McBreen. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: (a) The final documents will not differ in any material way from the documents provided to the Commissioner on 1 March 2002. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • When the Participants acquire the shares or the proceeds from the sale of the shares as a result of exercising their Options, the taxable value of the benefit will be gross income under sections CH 2 and CH 3 . • Under section CH 2(6), the Participants derive the gross income in respect of the shares or proceeds acquired under the EOP, on the date on which the Participants exercise their Options to acquire the shares from the Trustee. • The taxable value of the benefit received by the Participants under section CH 2 is the difference between the amount paid for the shares, being $1.00 (one dollar), and the market value of the shares on the day the Options are exercised by the Participants. • The amount of the Salary Sacrifice agreed to by the Participants to satisfy the requirements of the EOP does not constitute gross income of the Participants under sections CD 5, CH 3, or EB 1. • The amount of any contributions made by McBreen to the Trustee of the EOP does not constitute gross income of the Participants under sections CD 5, CH 3, or EB 1. • Sections BG 1 and GB 1 will not apply to negate or vary the conclusions above. 9 This Ruling does not consider or rule on any aspect of the tax consequences (if any) that may arise from any payment, application or appropriation of all or part of the income arising from the Trust Fund to the Participants. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 15 March 2004 to 14 March 2009. This Ruling is signed by me on the 15 th day of March 2004.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 04/05 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Brooklyn Park Olive Groves Limited (“BPOGL”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections EP 1, BD 2(1)(b)(i) and BD 2(2)(e). This Ruling does not consider or rule on the potential application (if any) of sections EF 1 and BG 1, or Determination E10. This Ruling considers expense deductibility in relation to section BD 2(1)(b)(i) (incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income). Accordingly it has not been necessary for the purposes of this Ruling to consider or rule on whether investors are carrying on a business for the purposes of the Act. This Ruling does not consider or rule on the taxation implications of financing arrangements (if any) entered into by Growers in order to invest in this Arrangement. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement (also referred to as “the Project”) is the purchase of 1,000 “A” shares (one interest) in BPOGL, and the opportunity to carry on the business of commercially growing olives for domestic and international sale on certain land situated at Brooklyn Park in Australia. Shareholders will own the capital asset, land, water, infrastructure and olive trees, by virtue of their shareholding in BPOGL. There is no minimum subscription for the Arrangement, however, there is a maximum subscription of 750 interests. All amounts quoted in this Ruling are inclusive of Australian GST (if any). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The Arrangement is governed by the terms of the Prospectus and Product Disclosure Statement for “Brooklyn Park Olive Groves Limited Stage 3” (“Stage 3”) as provided to the Inland Revenue Department on 9 February 2004 (“the prospectus”). Stage 3 is in no way dependent on Stages 1 and 2 of Brooklyn Park Olive Groves which are already established on Brooklyn Park. 2. Key aspects of the prospectus are as follows: (i) BPOGL owns the Brooklyn Park property (“the Property”) which is leased to Huntley’s Custodians Limited (“the Custodian”). The Custodian holds this interest as Head Lessee for the security of the Growers (also referred to as “members” or “investors”). The Property is sub-leased back to BPOGL for administration of the Project. (ii) Growers will enter a Licence to Occupy Agreement with BPOGL in its capacity as lessee of the Property. A Grower acquiring a single interest in the Project will hold a licence over a separate and distinct area (called an “Allotment”) of 0.2 hectare on which the Grower can plant and maintain 80 olive trees. Each Allotment will be separately identifiable on a plan prepared by BPOGL for that purpose. (iii) Growers may acquire more than one interest in the Project. However, for each interest acquired the Grower must first apply for and be allotted a parcel of 1,000 $1 shares in BPOGL. (iv) Growers will also have the option to enter into a Management Agreement with Australian Green & Gold Limited (“the Manager”) whereby the Manager will establish and maintain each Allotment during the term of the Project. (v) Unless a Grower elects otherwise, the Manager will harvest the olives on their behalf and use its best endeavours to sell the produce at the best available price. The Manager holds a contract with Inglewood Olive Processors, to buy and market the produce. Scheme Constitution 3. Upon entering into a Management Agreement, Growers will be bound by the provisions of the Brooklyn Park Olive Groves Scheme Constitution (“the Scheme Constitution”) which sets out the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the Manager. The Manager is responsible for the Project and will have the primary responsibility for managing the Project, ensuring compliance with the Australian Corporations Law, the Scheme Constitution and the Management Agreement. Compliance Plan 4. The Compliance Plan for the Brooklyn Park Olive Groves Managed Investment Scheme describes how the Responsible Entity (the Manager) will ensure its compliance with the Australian Corporations Law and the Scheme Constitution. The compliance plan is designed to protect the rights of Growers. Licence to Occupy Agreement 2 5. Growers enter into a Licence to Occupy Agreement (“the Agreement”) with the following rights: • The Agreement is entered into until 30 June 2020. Under the Agreement BPOGL grants the Grower a Licence to Occupy an Allotment on the Project land for the purpose of conducting the “Business” (“Business” is defined as planting, growing, cultivating, harvesting and marketing olives for domestic and overseas sale). • Each Allotment is 0.2 hectare in size and will have 80 olive trees planted on it. Each Grower’s allotment will be a distinct area of the Project Land and will be identified on an Allotment Plan to be maintained by BPOGL. Each Allotment will be numbered and shown in relation to the boundaries of the Project Land. Growers will be able to identify their individual Allotment and tree holding and Growers will be advised by BPOGL of the location of their individual Allotment. • The Grower must maintain and use the Allotment in a certain manner under the Agreement. Growers will be permitted to use dams, irrigation systems, roads and other infrastructure which is located on the Project Land. • The Grower is required to pay an annual Licence Fee for each year of the Agreement. The Fee is $22 per year for the first 3 years. From the fourth year onwards, the annual Fee will equal the Fee of the preceding year indexed by the All Groups Consumer Price Index for Brisbane (“CPI”) in accordance with the formula set out in the Agreement. • The Grower will pay all telephone, garbage, waste, electric light and power charges levied against the Land or the Allotment in respect of the Grower’s use of the Allotment to conduct the Business. BPOGL will pay all charges and assessments levied on the Allotment including water and municipal rates. • The Grower may delegate the conduct of all or part of the Business to the Manager or an approved contractor as defined in the Agreement. Delegates of the Grower will be entitled to enter the Allotment for the purpose of conducting the Grower’s business. • The Grower may terminate the Agreement prior to 30 June 2020, where either party defaults or does not fulfil its obligations under the Agreement. Growers are not entitled to assign the Licence except as set out in the Scheme Constitution. • Upon termination of the Agreement, Growers are not required to remove the trees or restore the Allotment to its original condition. However, the Grower must remove any item brought onto the Allotment or any improvement constructed on the Allotment. 3 • BPOGL will be legally entitled to any trees growing on the Allotment and things brought on to the Allotment by the Grower that are not removed within 14 days following the termination of the Agreement. • The rights attaching to shares expire on 30 June 2020 when the Licence to Occupy terminates. At that time, each Grower will remain as a shareholder in BPOGL. As shareholders of BPOGL the Growers maintain their involvement in the Property and the Olive Grove. A shareholder may, at their option: - elect to continue operating Brooklyn Park under management of their choice; or - sell the Property. In the event of sale of the Property each shareholder will be entitled to share in the capital proceeds of the sale of their capital asset, land, water, infrastructure and olive trees. Management Agreement 6. Growers may elect to use the services of the Manager by entering into a Management Agreement. Growers that do not execute a Management Agreement with the Manager will be outside the scope of this Product Ruling and the taxation consequences of their participation in the Project are not dealt with in this Ruling. The Management Agreement provides for the following: • The parties to the Management Agreement are the Grower, the Manager and BPOGL. The Management Agreement will terminate on 30 June 2020, subject to the valid terminations as set out in clause 16 of the Management Agreement. • The Manager undertakes to establish the “Business” of the Grower, including the planting of trees as soon as is reasonably practicable. These services will begin to be performed and carried out by the Manager on behalf of the Grower immediately after the Grower enters into the relevant agreements. It is anticipated that planting will commence soon after the acceptance of the Grower into the Project. The olive trees are expected to be ready for the first commercial harvesting in Grower years 3 to 4 after acceptance into the Project. • The Manager must carry out its duties under the Management Agreement in a manner consistent with the best agricultural practice. Under clause 4.2 of the Management Agreement the manager will carry out the following duties: - properly prepare the Allotment, including the performance of soil conservation, irrigation and drainage work on the Land to the benefit of the Allotment; - cause at least 80 trees to be planted on the Allotment; and 4 - identify the Grower’s trees with appropriate markings. 7. The Manager must also provide additional services to the Grower as provided for under clause 5.2 and 5.3 of the Management Agreement as follows: 5.2 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and subject to such instructions as it may from time to time receive from the Grower, the Manager shall provide the following services to the Grower in respect of the Grower’s Business: (a) procure, plant and tend to the Trees in the Allotment in a proper and workmanlike manner; (b) use its best endeavours to minimise soil erosion and maintain soil quality on the Olive Grove; (c) use its best endeavours to keep the Olive Grove free from vermin and vegetation; (d) use its best endeavours to keep the Trees free from insects and diseases, which might damage or inhibit the growth of the Trees; (e) use its best endeavours to destroy, abandon or leave to rot any Trees which a reasonable agriculturalist would destroy, abandon or leave to rot; (f) maintenance and cultivation of the Trees including growing, watering, weeding, selecting, procuring and applying appropriate fertilisers, nutrients and herbicides and doing all other things reasonably necessary for the purpose of maintaining and cultivating the Trees in accordance with good and proper agricultural practices; (g) procuring the use of all necessary plant, equipment, machinery goods and materials for the purposes of performing the Management Services and procuring the use at the Allotment of suitable irrigation, fencing, drainage and shelter for the Trees and any other necessary fixtures or improvements required for the purposes of performing such services; (h) subject to the Grower’s rights pursuant to clause 6, harvest the Trees in the Allotment in such manner and at such time as will maximise the yield from the Trees; (i) if the Grower directs pursuant to clause 6, make the Allotment available to the Grower to harvest on his/her own behalf for the period ending at the commencement of Grower Year 4; (j) subject to the Grower’s rights pursuant to clause 6, market and sell the Olives (including the Olives harvested from the Allotment) in such manner so as to achieve the maximum price therefore, and account to the Grower pursuant to clause 7; (k) if the Grower directs pursuant to clause 6, make the Olives harvested from the Allotment available to the Grower for his/her own benefit; (l) obtaining professional services and advice which the Manager may consider necessary or desirable in connection with the maintenance and cultivation of the Trees or the harvesting and marketing of the Olives; 5 (m) the Manager shall diligently carry out quality control and other best practice procedures to ensure the production of high quality Olives and thereafter will use its best endeavours to market the Olives effectively and manage the Business efficiently to increase revenues and returns to the Grower; and (n) do all other acts or things which the Growers may reasonably instruct the Manager to do or which are or may be necessary or desirable, to cultivate, maintain and manage the Trees, the Olives and the Olive Grove in a condition consistent with best agricultural practice. 5.3 The Manager must also: (a) use its best endeavours to maintain any windbreaks, access roads or tracks on the Land in good repair; and (b) prepare accurate records of all fertilisers, nutrients and other chemicals applied to the Land, the Olives or the Trees and make those records available to the Grower. 8. Further features of the Management Agreement are as follows: • The Manager guarantees survival of the Grower’s trees to the commencement of the fourth year of the term of the Agreement. Thereafter, the Manager does not guarantee survival of the Grower’s trees or that they will produce olives as outlined in clause 4.4. • Growers may elect not to use all the services provided by the Manager. Growers may elect to have the Manager harvest the trees on their Allotment separately or they may elect to harvest the trees on their Allotment themselves. Growers may also elect to retain the olives harvested from their Allotment and market, sell or otherwise deal with as they see fit under clauses 6.1 to 6.3. This Ruling does not apply to any Grower who makes an election under clauses 6.1 to 6.3. • The Manager is entitled to delegate all or any of the functions to be performed by it under the Management Agreement under clause 20. • The Manager will pool the olives produced by the Grower’s trees with those of each other Grower, and market and sell all such olives under clause 7.1. The proceeds of the sale of all olives will be paid to the Custodian, to be divided and credited among all Growers with the intent that the Grower shall be entitled to receive the Grower’s proceeds without reference to the quality, volume, prices or any other factor in relation to the Grower’s olives or those of any other Grower under clause 7.3. • The Custodian will establish an account for each Grower, to which the Grower’s share of sale proceeds will be credited under clause 7.3. The Manager will account for the gross sale proceeds received and Management Fees payable and must provide each Grower with certain financial information in respect of the Grower’s olives under clause 7.5. The Manager is also required to provide the Grower with various reports, 6 including half yearly reports on the Management Services provided and the progress and condition of the Allotment under clause 14. • Growers are not entitled to assign their rights or obligations under the Management Agreement, except in certain limited circumstances. Grower Fees 9. For a Grower accepted into the Project the table below sets out the amounts payable, per interest, upon application. Amount Payable Amount of Fee Part payment of shares $200 Licence Fee $22 Management Fee (part Management Fee for month 1) $1,118.50 Landcare operations $2,049.50 Total payable on application $3,390.00 10. Other than the amount payable upon application, during the first 36 months of the Project, Management Fees for each year are payable by 30 June of that year. 11. These Management Fees accrue on a monthly basis (referred to as a “Grower Month”) and relate wholly to services provided by the Manager and completed during the month. For each interest held in the Project Growers incur the amounts set out in the table below. The amount payable for Management Fees on 30 June of a particular year will vary according to the month that a Grower is accepted to participate in the Project. Amount Payable Grower Month Amount of Fee Supply and plant olive trees1 $412.50 Irrigation establishment costs 1 $1,464.00 Management Fee (balance of initial Management Fee - see note below). 1 $5,575.50 Management Fee 2 to 12 $308.00 Management Fee 13 to 36 $80.00 Note: total Management Fee for month 1 is $6,694, being $1,118.50 payable on application plus $5,575.50 payable by 30 June. 12. In the event that an applicant is accepted as a Grower after the 1 st of the month (referred to as a “Part Grower Month”), the Management Fees payable shall be calculated according to the following formula: 7 A=( B x C)-E D Where: A = the amount payable for Management Fees for the Part Grower Month B = number of days of the Part Grower Month up to 30 June C = Management Fee payable for month 1 D = 30 E = If the Part Grower Month is June – $1,118.50, otherwise NIL 13. It is the intention of the Manager that in all months, other than June, applications will be accepted and work will only be commenced on the 1 st of the month following the application. 14. For year 4 and subsequent years, the annual Management Fee will be calculated using the percentages (set out in the table below) of “gross sale proceeds” of the “olives” harvested in the immediately preceding financial year: Year Percentage 488% 577% 666% 755% 8 -termination 44% Examples of fees payable by 30 June in year of application. Example 1: Grower joins the Project on 1 June 2003: Shares $200.00 Licence Fee $22.00 Landcare operation $2,049.50 Irrigation establishment$1,464.00 Purchase and planting trees$412.50 Management Fee $6,694.00 Total amount payable for year ended 30 June 2003 $10,842.00 8 Example 2: Grower joins the Project on 15 June 2003: Shares $200.00 Licence Fee $22.00 Landcare operation $2,049.50 Irrigation establishment $1,464.00 Purchase and planting trees$412.50 Management Fee $2,228.50 Total amount payable for year ended 30 June 2003 $6,376.50 Note: as the Grower has joined the Project part way through the month the Management Fee is calculated as follows: A = (B x C)-E D (15 x 6,694) - 1,118.50 30 = $2,228.50 Where: A = the amount payable for Management Fees for the Part Grower Month. B = 15, that is the number of days of the Part Grower Month up to 30 June. C = $6,694, that is the total Management Fee payable for month 1 D = 30 E = $1,118.50 – as the Part Grower Month is June. Example 3: Grower joins the Project on 1 st September 2004: Shares $200.00 Licence Fee $22.00 Landcare operation $2,049.50 Irrigation establishment $1,464.00 Purchase and planting trees$412.50 Management Fee $9,466.00 Total amount payable for year ended 30 June 2004 $13,614.00 Note: the Management Fee consists of the following amounts: On application $1,118.50 9 By 30 June 2004 September (balance of month 1 fees) $5,575.50 October to June (month 2 to month 9 @ $308) $2,772.00 Total Management Fee $9,466.00 Licence Fee 15. In addition to the Management fee a Grower is required to pay a $22 Licence Fee each year. From Year 4 onwards the Licence Fee will be increased annually by the amount of the Brisbane CPI for the year. Shares in BPOGL 16. For each Interest acquired in the Project a Grower must first apply for and be allotted shares in BPOGL, the landowning company. The minimum subscription for an investor is 1,000 shares of $1 each, with further applications to be made in parcels of 1,000 shares. For each Interest a part payment of $200 is payable on application. A further $400 will be payable on or before 30 June in the financial year following the Application. The remaining $400 is payable on or before 30 June in the next financial year. Water and Services Agreement 17. Upon application, the Grower becomes a party to a Water and Services Agreement. The other parties to the Agreement are the owner of the property adjoining the Project Land (“the Supplier”), and the Manager. The effect of this Agreement will be to supplement the water supply and infrastructure available for the Project. Infrastructure refers to accommodation and the administration buildings, machinery service sheds and storage sheds located on the adjoining property. Under this Agreement all fees are the responsibility of the Manager. No fees are payable by the Grower. The term of the Agreement is 20 years. 18. The projected cashflows for Growers holding one interest in BPOGL, are as follows: 10 Year Net Project income 2003 – 2004 -10,842.00 2004 – 2005 -3,868.00 2005 – 2006 -1,360.00 2006 – 2007 -427.68 2007 – 2008 394.37 2008 – 2009 947.29 2009 – 2010 1,567.91 2010 – 2011 2,262.93 2011 – 2012 2,263.97 2012 – 2013 2,265.02 2013 – 2014 2,266.10 2014 – 2015 2,267.21 2015 – 2016 2,268.35 2016 – 2017 2,269.50 2017 – 2018 2,270.69 2018 – 2019 2,271.91 2019 – 2020 2,273.16 2020 – 2021 2,274.46 TOTAL 11,365.19 Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: (a) Any foreign source income and foreign expenditure that arises in respect of any Grower’s investment in BPOGL has been included in the Grower’s annual returns of income in Australia. (b) No foreign source income, nor foreign expenditure arising from the investment in BPOGL, has been included in the Grower’s income tax return for the base year.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 04/06 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited as Trustee for the NZGT30 Fund (“the Fund”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: • Section CF 2(3); • Section CF 2(3A); • Subpart LE; • Section CF 3(1)(b); • Section HH 3; • Section GB 1(3); and • Section BG 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and continued operation of the Fund, pursuant to the Deed of Trust dated 5 September 1996 and Deeds of Amendment dated 15 September 2000 and 26 June 2001, which acts as a specialist investment fund to hold a portfolio of shares and other securities that match the composition and weighting of the NZSE30 Capital Share Price Index (“the Index”). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The Trustee and Manager of the Fund is The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited (“the Trustee” and “the Fund Manager”). It is registered as a trustee company under the Trustee Companies Act 1967. The Fund has been established under the Trustee Companies Act 1967 and meets the definition of “group investment fund” contained in section OB 1. 2. The Investment Manager of the Fund is New Zealand Guardian Trust Funds Management Limited (“the Investment Manager”). The Investment Manager was appointed to invest and manage various funds, including the NZGT30 Fund, by an Investment Management Agreement dated 16 August 2000. 3. The Fund invests in securities of those companies that make up the index formerly known as the NZSE30 Capital Share Price Index (“the Index”). The Index provides a measure of price trends of New Zealand’s top thirty listed companies and was chosen for its ability to best reflect the shares that are able to be purchased by members of the public on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (“NZSX”). 4. The beneficial interest in the Fund is divided into units. Each unit confers an undivided part or share in the beneficial interest of the Fund. Income of the Fund is distributed to unit holders twice a year. 5. The Fund has both “category A units” and “category B units”. Category B units are those units which are acquired with funds from “designated sources” as defined in section HE 2(3). As the majority of the investments in the Fund are not from “designated sources”, most of the units in the Fund are category A units. All of the units in the Fund are subject to the same rules regarding income distribution and redemption of units. 6. The Trustee receives subscriptions from each investor, with a minimum value of $1000, with further investments being in multiples of $100. The Trustee also receives redemption requests, of a minimum number of 100 units per investor. On a valuation day subscriptions and redemptions of units are netted off. The Trustee will then purchase securities and issue new units, if the subscriptions exceed the redemptions, or sell securities and cancel units, if the redemptions exceed the subscriptions. The valuation day is defined in clause 1 of the Trust Deed as the close of business on Thursday of each week, or, if any such date is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day. 7. The Fund Manager may also purchase units from unit holders, when unit holders wish to redeem their units. The Fund Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool, and is unable to sell sufficient securities in order to redeem the units requested. To date, the Fund Manager has not utilised this power. 8. Clause 6.9 of the Trust Deed enables the Fund to suspend unit redemptions. The power to suspend unit redemptions is used in exceptional circumstances, being: • where a material adverse change in the financial markets occurs namely, a breakdown in liquidity caused by an act of God, or a system failure; or • if there is a fundamental breakdown in the functioning of financial markets namely, closure of the NZSX or a collapse of the market resulting in a lack of liquidity in the Fund’s securities. Where it is necessary to suspend redemption of units, the suspension will be for a maximum period of 3 business days, unless the exceptional circumstances giving rise to the need to suspend are beyond the control of the Trustee and the Investment Manager, in which case the suspension shall only be for such a period as is strictly necessary for the Fund and or the Investment Manager to recover from the event. 2 9. This Ruling does not consider the application of sections CD 3 or CD 4 to the disposal of units by any particular unit holder. 10. The Applicant has confirmed that all aspects of the previous rulings (BR Prv 01/49 and BR Prd 01/17), relating to the Fund, have been complied with except for the statement that: With respect to the Private Ruling BR Prv 01/49 at page 7(c), I advise that we have promptly realigned securities weightings to the NZSX30 Capital Index upon formal advice from the Index provider. There are occasionally delays between NZSX media announcements of changes and actual effective dates of changes. Our record of portfolio tracking error supports our best efforts to adhere to the conditions as required by the Commissioner for the actual portfolio construction relative to the NZSE30 Capital Index. (letter of 17 March 2004 from Anthony Harland of NZGT Funds Management) 11. There has been no change to the Trust Deed of the Fund (except for the noted Deeds of Amendment). Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) All units redeemed by the Fund will be redeemed in whole and not in part. b) The units are not non-participating redeemable shares as that term is defined in section CF 3(14). c) Any redemption of units will not be part of a pro-rata cancellation as that term is defined in section CF 3(14). d) The units will not be quoted on the official list of any recognised exchange as that term is defined in section OB 1. e) The units are issued on such terms that their redemption is subject to the reverse ordering rule as stated in section CF 3(1)(b)(iv)(B). f) All distributions received by the Fund will be paid out to unit holders net of any expenses incurred by the Fund. g) The Fund Manager has the power to purchase units from unit holders, when unit holders wish to redeem their units. The Fund Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool, and is unable to sell sufficient securities in order to redeem the units requested. h) There is no agreement, arrangement or understanding in place between the Fund, the Trustee, the Fund Manager or the Investment Manager (or any person associated with the Fund, the Trustee, the Fund Manager or the Investment Manager) and any unit holder (or any person associated with any unit holder) which directly or indirectly has a purpose or effect of the 3 redemption or disposition of any of a unit holder’s units occurring in substitution for or instead of one or more distributions from the Fund. i) The Fund is a qualifying trust as that term is defined in section OB 1. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The distribution of category A income to category A unit holders will be treated as a “dividend” pursuant to section CF 2(3). • In respect of payments made to category A unit holders, section CF 2(3A) will treat the Fund as if it were a company for the purposes of subpart LE of the Act. • The amount paid to category A unit holders on the redemption of their units will be excluded from the definition of dividend by section CF 3(1)(b) to the extent that the amount does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled. • Section GB 1(3) does not apply to the sale of category A units to the Fund Manager by category A unit holders. • In the absence of other factors relating to the circumstances of any particular category A unit holder, any gain on the sale of the category A units to the Fund Manager does not of itself give rise to the application of section BG 1. • Any distribution of category B income to category B unit holders is included within the definition of “beneficiary income” as defined in section OB 1, and is included in the gross income of the unit holder under section HH 3(1). • Under section HH 3(2) the Trustee is liable, as agent for the unit holder, to deduct tax from distributions of category B income made to unit holders at the unit holders’ marginal tax rate. • The amount paid to category B unit holders on the redemption of units is not gross income to the unit holders under section HH 3(5), to the extent that it does not include any “beneficiary income”. • In the absence of other factors relating to the circumstances of any particular category B unit holder, any gain on the sale of the category B units to the Fund Manager does not of itself give rise to the application of section BG 1. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2007. 4 This Ruling is signed by me on the 25 th day of May 2004.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 04/07 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This ruling has been applied for by Tortis-International Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CF 3(1)(b) and CF 3(1)(c). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and continued operation of a unit trust known as Tortis-International Fund (“Tortis-INTL” or the “Fund” or the “Trust”) pursuant to a Deed of Trust dated 16 December 1996 and amended on 18 February 1997, 31 July 2000, 16 August 2001 and 12 July 2002 (the “Trust Deed”), and the Prospectus for the Fund dated 11 September 2003 (the “Prospectus”). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1 The Fund invests in the securities of those companies that make up the TOWER Global Index (the “Global Index” or the “Index”). The Global Index is a customised version of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index (the “MSCI World Index”). The Fund has been designed to provide investors with comprehensive coverage of global equities. 2 Tortis-INTL is a unit trust in terms of the Unit Trusts Act 1960 and meets the definition of a “unit trust” contained in section OB 1. 3 Tortis-INTL is a New Zealand tax resident. The trustee of Tortis-INTL is the Public Trustee (the “Trustee”). The manager of Tortis-INTL is TOWER Managed Funds Investments Limited (previously known under the name “TOWER Trust Services Limited”) (the “Manager”). The investment manager of the Fund is State Street Global Advisors, Australia, Limited (the “Investment Manager” or “State Street”). 4 The investment policy of the Fund is set out in clause 82.1 of the Trust Deed. It states: 82. The investment policy of the Trust shall be: 82.1 to only invest the Fund (other than the Cash Pool and Unmarketable Accumulations) in Index Shares in a manner that replicates the Adjusted MSCI and to only enter into transactions that are necessary to give effect to that policy; 82.2 to invest the Cash Pool in deposits with banks registered under the Reserve Bank Act 1989 or other debt obligations or in the TOWER FirstRate Account upon terms that will allow the Manager to pay the anticipated Liabilities of the Fund and to manage the redemption of Units and the liquidity of the Trust; 82.3 to invest Unmarketable Accumulations in Derivatives until the total value of investment in Derivatives reaches a Marketable Amount whereupon the Derivatives will be realised and the proceeds invested in accordance with clause 82.1 or 82.2; and 82.4 to not take any action to hedge or manage foreign exchange risks or exposures that arise from the Investments being held in non New Zealand currencies. 5 The investment objectives of the Fund are as follows: • To track the adjusted MSCI Index, called the TOWER Global Index, to provide broad international coverage of approximately 1,000 companies; • The Global Index includes only “grey listed” countries to New Zealand, so that double taxation issues do not occur. These include companies resident in the United Sates, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Japan, and Australia. These companies provide coverage of 80% of all international companies contained within the total MSCI Index; • The Investment Manager cannot diversify investments of the Fund, or take prudent steps in respect of the mix of the Fund’s investments. 6 The Trust Deed states that: It is not the Fund or the Trustee’s intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling constituent company securities. 7 Tortis-INTL is an open fund and new investors are able to subscribe for units from time to time. The beneficial interest in Tortis-INTL is divided into units. Each unit confers an equal interest in Tortis-INTL (other than a fractional unit which will confer a proportionate interest) but does not confer any interest in any particular part of the fund or any particular investment of the fund. 8 Tortis-INTL has confirmed that all aspects of the previous rulings (BR Prv 96/135, BR Prv 96/136, and BR Prv 01/15), relating to the Fund, have been complied with. There has been no change to the Trust Deed of the Fund (except for the changes noted above), nor any change to the management or operation of the Fund since its establishment. The MSCI World Index 9 The TOWER Global Index is a customised version of the MSCI World Index. 10 The tracking of the Global Index is undertaken by the Investment Manager. 2 11. The document MSCI Methodology Book: MSCI Standard Index Series Methodology dated and effective from 29 April 2003 (“the Methodology Book”) states the objective of MSCI, with respect to its Equity Index Series, as being the construction of global benchmark indices which serve as a gauge for measuring performance of a market and investment strategy, effective research tools for purposes such as strategic asset allocation, and as the basis for investment vehicles designed to replicate the performance of a market or to implement and manage an investment policy. MSCI consistently applies its equity index construction and maintenance methodology across regions and developed and emerging markets, making it possible to aggregate individual country and industry indices to create meaningful regional and composite benchmark indices. 12. The MSCI Standard Index Series adjusts the market capitalisation of index constituents for free float and targets for index inclusion 85% of free float- adjusted market capitalisation in each industry group, in each country. Currently, MSCI calculates the Standard Index Series for 50 countries globally in the developed and the emerging markets. 13. As of December 2003, the MSCI World Index comprises the 23 developed market country indices. 14. The Methodology Book describes MSCI’s index construction objective (see paragraph 11 above), guiding principles, and the methodology for the Standard Index Series. Guiding principles 15. MSCI adheres to the following principles in the design and implementation of its index construction and maintenance methodology: • Broad and fair representation of the total underlying market; • Investability and replicability; • Consistent application of the methodology across all markets; • Continuity and relatively low turnover while reflecting the evolution of the markets in a timely fashion; • Disciplined approach: principles, rules and guidelines to ensure all decisions MSCI makes are consistent with a benchmark index; • Transparency; • Independence and objectivity. Index construction process 3 16. The index construction process involves: • Defining the equity universe – about 99% of the world’s total equity market capitalisation is included; • Adjusting the total market capitalisation of securities in the universe for free float available to foreign investors; • Classifying the universe of securities under the Global Industry Classification Standard; • Selecting securities for inclusion according to MSCI’s index construction rules and guidelines. Index constituent eligibility rules and guidelines 17. MSCI targets an 85% free float-adjusted market representation level within each industry group, within each country. The security selection process within each industry group is based on the careful analysis of: • Each company's business activities and the diversification that its securities would bring to the index. • The size (based on free float-adjusted market capitalisation) and liquidity of securities. All other things being equal, MSCI targets for inclusion the most sizeable and liquid securities in an industry group. In addition, securities that do not meet the minimum size guidelines and/or securities with inadequate liquidity are not considered for inclusion. • The estimated free float for the company and its individual share classes. Only securities of companies with an estimated overall and/or security free float greater than 15% are, in general, considered for inclusion. The only exception is where not including a security of a large company would compromise the index’s ability to fully and fairly represent the characteristics of the underlying market. 18. Differences in the structure of industries, and other considerations, may lead to over- or under-representation in certain industries. In these cases, the indices are constructed with a view to minimising the divergence between the industry group representation achieved in the index and the 85% representation guideline. Maintaining the MSCI Standard Index Series 19. The MSCI Standard Index Series is maintained with the objective of reflecting, on a timely basis, the evolution of the underlying equity markets. Emphasis is also placed on continuity, replicability and on minimising turnover in the indices. Overall, index maintenance can be described by three broad categories of implementation of changes: 4 • Annual full country index reviews that systematically reassess the various dimensions of the equity universe for all countries and are conducted on a fixed annual timetable. • Quarterly index reviews, aimed at promptly reflecting other significant market events. • Ongoing event-related changes, such as mergers and . acquisitions, which are generally implemented in the indices rapidly as they occur. Potential changes in the status of countries (standalone, emerging, developed) follow their own separate timetables. These changes are normally implemented in one or more phases at the regular annual full country index review and quarterly index review dates. In this Ruling, index maintenance is referred to as Structural Change (quarterly and annual review changes) and Market Driven Change (ongoing event-related changes). The Adjusted MSCI World Index: the TOWER Global Index 20. The Global Index is a customised version of the MSCI World Index. The Global Index replicates the MSCI World Index, with one qualification: it only contains grey list countries, which comprise at least 2% of the MSCI World Index. The Global Index does not alter the MSCI World Index in any other way. 21. If any of the countries included in the Global Index leave the grey list then securities held in companies resident in that country will be immediately divested. If any company in which Tortis-INTL holds securities ceases to be resident in a grey list country, then securities held in that company will be immediately divested. Trust Deed and Prospectus Two classes of units 22. The Fund offers two classes of units: Class A and Class B. Class A units are standard retail units. Class B units are issued on exactly the same terms as Class A units, however holders of Class B units, due to the size of their investment, are able to negotiate reduced management and trustee fees. Date of Adjustments 23. The Fund is rebalanced in the following circumstances: • If any security, any country index, or the entire Index has a deviation of greater than +/- 0.5% of the total Fund; and 5 • Due to the Structural Changes in the MSCI, currently quarterly; and • If there is a Market Driven Change such as a merger, takeover, new listing or reduction or increase in capital affecting any Index company on the Global Index. 24. Such rebalancing will occur as soon as possible after the above events have occurred and in any event within 2 business days. Rights Issues 25. The Global Index may be adjusted from time to time because of rights issues. 26. In the event of any rights issue by an Index Company, the Manager will hold the entitlement if the entitlement is included in the Index. If the entitlement is not included in the Index, but the securities the subject of the entitlement will be immediately included in the Index, the Manager will retain the entitlement and take up the securities. If the Manager does not know whether the securities the subject of the entitlement will be included in the Index the Manager will sell the entitlement at the earliest possible time and reinvest the proceeds in the Index Companies to track the Index. Mergers, Takeovers and Share Buy-backs 27. The Global Index may be adjusted from time to time because of mergers, takeovers or share buy-backs. 28. With the exception of any situation where shares in an Index company are compulsorily acquired pursuant to any companies legislation, listing rules or takeover code requirements, in the event of a merger or takeover of an Index Company, the Manager will adjust the Fund portfolio at a time as close as practicably possible to the time the Index is adjusted. The Fund will not accept an offer unless as a consequence of not accepting the offer the Fund would track the Index less accurately than if it had accepted the offer. 29. The Manager will not elect to participate in a share buy-back scheme of a Index Company. Cash investments held by the Fund 30. Although it is not an objective of the Fund to hold cash, the Manager and the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Fund) may hold cash to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund. The cash held by the Manager and the Investment Manager is on “call”. Wherever possible, the Manager will enter into futures contracts to cover the cash held by the Fund. This is known as “equitised cash”. 6 31. The Investment Manager (on behalf of the Fund) will hold cash in the following circumstances: • Following the sale of securities in the course of tracking the Index, pending the reinvestment of that cash; • Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; • Following the sale of securities to meet a request for withdrawal by a Manager on behalf of a unit holder; • To accumulate the minimum amount of cash required to allow for minimum trade sizes and to obtain a reasonable representation of the number of securities on the Index, which is presently $US3 million (“the minimum investment level”). 32. The Investment Manager may hold up to an amount equivalent to the minimum investment level in cash (including both free and equitised cash). This threshold may be exceeded in the following circumstances: • for up to 10 working days preceding a MSCI structural change; • for up to 3 working days after a MSCI structural change; or • for up to 10 working days prior to a pending withdrawal in respect of which it has received a withdrawal request. 33. In addition to any funds held by the Investment Manager, the Manager may hold cash. The amount of cash held by the Manager will not be greater than what strictly arises out of the circumstances described below, and in any event will not exceed 2% of the total assets of the Fund. Those circumstances are: • Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; • Following the sale of securities to meet a request to redeem units in cash; and • To fund the expenses, fees and taxation for the Fund; 34. The 2% threshold of cash held by the Manager may be exceeded in the following circumstances: • For up to one business day if there is rapid inflow to the Fund, or the Fund has notice of a substantial pending withdrawal ; 7 • For up to one calendar month if the Manager receives a formal notice of a forthcoming obligation of subsequent performance (ie, payment due on partly paid shares) affecting the constituent securities in the Index; or • For up to one calendar month if the Manager is aware of a forthcoming distribution to unit holders at the scheduled date of distribution. 35. However, in any event, if the 2% threshold of cash held by the Manager is exceeded, the Fund will take immediate action to remedy the situation within the shortest practicable time. 36. At all times, there is a limit on the total cash (including cash held by the Manager and free and equitised cash held by the Investment Manager) which is the greater of 5% of the total value of the Fund and the sum of 2% of the total value of the Fund and the minimum investment level (except if there is a significant withdrawal or investment). 37. The Investment Manager will use best endeavours to equitise all cash, subject to futures contract size constraints. 38. The following futures contracts are currently used: Country Contract Australia SPI200 Canada S&P/TSE60 Japan Nikkei 225, TOPIX Germany DAX United Kingdom FTSE100 United States S&P500 39. In the event that alternative futures contracts in one or more markets enable improved tracking of the Global Index, or that one or more of the above contracts ceases to exist, the Investment Manager will use such alternative contract or contracts. Hedging 40. The Fund does not take any action to hedge or remove foreign currency risks or exposures that arise from the investments of the Fund in non-New Zealand currencies. Foreign Currencies 41. The Investment Manager may enter into spot foreign exchange contracts where these are necessary in order to purchase or divest the foreign currencies necessary to purchase or dispose of Index securities. These contracts are not speculative and are settled within 2 business days. Borrowing 8 42. The Fund may only borrow in the following circumstances: • To temporarily fund the redemption of units when the cash pool has insufficient funds; this borrowing must be repaid as soon as possible, and in any event any such borrowing will be repaid within three business days; • Where a security is sold and another purchased and a settlement mismatch occurs resulting in the Fund becoming inadvertently overdrawn, and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; • To temporarily fund the purchase of securities in order to rebalance following a merger, where pursuant to the merger payment due to the Fund for securities that have been disposed of has been delayed (such delay being beyond the control of the Fund), and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; or • For advances (not to exceed total borrowings of $5,000) by the Manager to the Fund to meet expenses of the Fund, where the Manager’s expense account is insufficient to enable the Manager to meet such expenses. Events that trigger acquisitions or realisations 43. The Fund will only sell or otherwise dispose of securities in the following circumstances: • If the Fund is voluntarily or involuntarily wound up; • If there is a change in the Index composition due to either Structural Changes or Market Driven Changes so that the composition of the Fund no longer tracks the Index, or when the Fund is otherwise required to buy and sell securities to rebalance the Fund in order to maintain tracking; • Funding redemptions to the extent that these cannot be met out of cash held by the Fund; • Transferring securities to a unit holder if the unit holder redeems units for securities; • If there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Fund that cannot be met by the cash held by the Fund or cash held in the Manager’s expense account. Issue and redemption of Units 44. Investors wishing to subscribe for units may do so for cash or, alternatively, above a certain prescribed level, investors may subscribe for units by transferring to Tortis-INTL an appropriately weighted basket of securities, and will receive units in Tortis-INTL in exchange. 9 45. When a unit holder wishes to dispose of an investment in the Fund, the unit holder is able to elect that the units be either redeemed by the Trustee, or repurchased by the Manager. Notwithstanding any provision in the Prospectus or the Deed of Trust, it is the invariable practice of the Fund that where such an election is made by the unit holder, the units will be either redeemed by the Trustee, or repurchased by the Manager, in strict accordance with that election. In the absence of an election by the unit holder, the units will in all instances be repurchased by the Manager. Where units are repurchased by the Manager, the price paid to the unit holder by the Manager will be the same amount as would be received by the unit holder if the unit holder had elected the direct redemption method. In all instances where units are repurchased by the Manager, whether pursuant to an election by a unit holder or not, the Manager will redeem those units with the Trustee for the same price as paid to the unit holder. 46. A unit holder may redeem units subject to the conditions in Article C of the Trust Deed. Article C gives the Manager a discretion to refuse to redeem units where the amount to be redeemed is less than the minimum number acceptable by the Manager at that time. Currently the Manager has set a minimum withdrawal at $500. 47. Unit prices may be published in newspapers. Tortis-INTL has an Internet site which will be used principally to publish prices at which the Manager will repurchase or redeem units, and as a means for transferring units only by purchase from the Manager, and redemption or repurchase by the Manager. Same day unit redemption policy 48. When units are repurchased, the Manager is required to pay the aggregate value of the units to the investor within 21 business days of the relevant time (as described in the Trust Deed). However when possible the Fund operates a same day unit redemption policy. The Fund will endeavour to redeem the units requested by any unit holder and redeem and pay for those units on the same day as the unit holder's request is made. 49. If the Fund has insufficient cash in the cash pool, the Fund will always in the first instance attempt to borrow (on suitable commercial terms) sufficient funds in order to meet the redemption request. In situations where the Fund is not able to borrow such sufficient funds, the Fund may suspend the withdrawal of units in the Fund. The only exception to the Fund always attempting to borrow in the first instance where a redemption request is made and there is insufficient cash in the cash pool, is where a redemption request is made by a unit holder who holds 5% or more of the value of the Fund and to borrow rather than suspend the withdrawal of units in the Fund would 10 prejudice other unit holders. In such a case the Fund will always suspend the withdrawal of units. Suspension of issuing and redeeming units 50. A suspension from issuing or redeeming units (including any deferral notice with regard to Class B units) may be necessary in exceptional circumstances, being the following situations: (1) if the Fund is to be terminated and notice has been given to the Trustee pursuant to clause 198 of the Trust Deed; (2) if extreme financial, political, or economic conditions occur and prevent the acquisition or redemption of Index Shares from the Stock Exchanges on which those Index Shares are listed; (3) where the Fund has received redemption requests that exceed the available cash pool and the Fund is unable to borrow (on suitable commercial terms) sufficient funds to meet such redemption requests; or (4) where there is insufficient cash in the cash pool and a redemption request is made by a unit holder who holds 5% or more of the value of the Fund and to borrow rather than suspend the withdrawal of units in the Fund would prejudice other unit holders; or (5) in the case of any deferral notice in respect of class B units, the Trustee reasonably forms the opinion that to fund redemptions may prejudice the Fund’s obligations to Class A unit holders. Where suspension occurs because of termination of the Fund, the suspension will be for a maximum of 3 months of the giving of the notice to terminate by the Manager. In other circumstances, if a suspension from issuing or redeeming units occurs, the period of suspension will not exceed 3 business days, except if the situation is beyond the control of the Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund or the Manager to recover from that event. However in the case of a deferral notice, with regard to Class B units, the period of the deferral notice may be extended until the Trustee reasonably forms the opinion that to fund redemptions is no longer prejudicial to the Fund’s obligations to Class A unit holders. The Fund has suspended the issuing and redeeming of units only once, for 3 days after the World Trade Center was destroyed, as the US market was closed and so valuations were not available. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner 11 This Ruling is subject to the following conditions: (a) The predetermined rules used by the Investment Manager to ascertain the Global Index constituents, and the predetermined rules used by MSCI to calculate the MSCI World Index, will not be made with or influenced by any intention of seeking higher rates of return or capital growth. (b) No material changes will be made to the way in which the Global Index tracks the MSCI World Index. (c) No material changes will be made to the way in which MSCI constructs and maintains the MSCI World Index. (d) The proportion of Tortis-INTL’s assets to be held as cash (including all “free” cash and “equitised” cash) will not exceed what is strictly necessary in order to fulfil the purposes stated in paragraph 30 of this ruling, and will not in any event exceed the greater of 5% of the value of the Fund and the sum of 2% of the value of the Fund and the minimum investment level. This condition will not be regarded as being breached if, pending investment of contributions or disbursement of withdrawal proceeds, the Fund is forced to hold cash in excess of the greater of 5% of the value of the Fund and the sum of 2% of the value of the Fund and the minimum investment level. The Fund will immediately invest or disburse such cash, except where immediate investment to track the Index is not possible due to the unavailability of appropriate equities, in which case the excess cash may be held for only so long as is strictly necessary and in any event no longer than two business days. (e) When the cash held by the Investment Manager reaches the minimum investment level (presently $US 3 million), it will be immediately applied to track the Index. (f) The Investment Manager will rebalance the Fund in the following circumstances: i. If any security, any country index, or the entire Index has a deviation of greater than +/- 0.5% of the total Fund; and ii. Due to Structural Changes in the MSCI, currently quarterly; and iii. If there is a Market Driven Change such as a merger, takeover, new listing or reduction or increase in capital affecting any Index company on the Global Index. Such rebalancing will occur as soon as possible after the above events have occurred and in any event within 2 business days. (g) When rebalancing the Fund the Investment Manager will use its best endeavours to track the Index as exactly as possible. Any rebalancing of the Fund that does not achieve an exact match of the Index will only occur where it is not possible to 12 obtain or sell the securities necessary to exactly replicate the Index. In any case the tracking deviation will not exceed 1% of the value of the Fund. (h) In the event of any rights issue by an Index Company, the Manager will hold the entitlement if the entitlement is included in the Index. If the entitlement is not included in the Index, but the securities the subject of the entitlement will be immediately included in the Index, the Manager will retain the entitlement and take up the securities. If the Manager does not know whether the securities the subject of the entitlement will be included in the Index the Manager will sell the entitlement at the earliest possible time and reinvest the proceeds in the Index Companies to track the Index. (i) With the exception of any situation where shares in an Index company are compulsorily acquired pursuant to any companies legislation, listing rules or takeover code requirements, in the event of a merger or takeover of an Index Company, the Manager will adjust the Fund portfolio at a time as close as practicably possible to the time the Index is adjusted (but in any event within 2 business days). The Fund will not accept an offer unless as a consequence of not accepting the offer the Fund would track the Index less accurately than if it had accepted the offer. (j) The Fund Manager will not elect to participate in a share buy-back scheme of any Index Company. (k) When the Fund is given the option of re-investing its dividends into any Index Company, the Fund invariably accepts the cash dividend. (l) The Fund can only borrow in the following circumstances: i. To temporarily fund the redemption of units when the cash pool has insufficient funds; this borrowing must be repaid as soon as possible, and in any event any such borrowing will be repaid within three business days; ii. Where a security is sold and another purchased and a settlement mismatch occurs resulting in the Fund becoming inadvertently overdrawn, and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; iii. To temporarily fund the purchase of securities in order to rebalance following a merger, where pursuant to the merger payment due to the Fund for securities that have been disposed of has been delayed (such delay being beyond the control of the Fund), and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; or iv. For advances (not to exceed total borrowings of $5,000) by the Manager to the Fund to meet expenses of the Fund, where the Manager’s expense account is insufficient to enable the Manager to meet such expenses. 13 (m) The Fund will not take any action to hedge or remove foreign currency risks or exposures that arise from the investments of the Fund in non-New Zealand currencies. (n) The Fund will only sell or otherwise dispose of securities in the following circumstances: i. If the Fund is voluntarily or involuntarily wound up; ii. If there is a change in the Index composition due to either Structural Changes or Market Driven Changes so that the composition of the Fund no longer tracks the Index, or when the Fund is otherwise required to buy and sell securities to rebalance the Fund in order to maintain tracking; iii. Funding redemptions to the extent that these cannot be met out of cash held by the Fund; iv. Transferring securities to a unit holder if the unit holder redeems units for securities; v. If there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Fund that cannot be met by the cash held by the Fund or cash held in the Manager’s expense account. (o) The Fund will not be wound up with a view to enhancing the performance of the Fund or to minimise losses of the Fund in any way. This condition will not be breached if: i the Manager decides to wind up the Fund for reasons unrelated to the performance of the investments of the Fund; or ii if the unit holders independently resolve to wind up the Fund. (p) This Ruling shall cease to apply if at any time: i. there is a unit holder, or two or more unit holders that are associated with each other, or are acting in concert in relation to their investments in the Fund, who hold/s more than 75% of the issued units of the Fund; and ii. if that unit holder, or one or more of such unit holders, ordinarily hold securities on revenue account or the disposal of securities by that unit holder, or one or more of such unit holders, would ordinarily give rise to gross income for income tax purposes. For the purposes of this condition unit holders are associated with each other if they are “associated persons” within the meaning of section OD 7 or OD 8(3). (q) This Ruling only applies while this Fund remains a widely-held trust (as that term is defined in section CF 3(14)), and the Fund units are offered to the public. 14 (r) Apart from the Trust Deed and the Prospectus of the Fund that have been supplied to Inland Revenue as part of the application for this Ruling, there is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Fund or the Trustee or the Manager (or any party acting on behalf of the Fund) and any unit holder (or any person associated with or acting on behalf of any unit holder) regarding the control of the Fund, the nature and timing of its investments, or the timing of the investing or withdrawal of funds. This condition shall not be regarded as breached by virtue only of: i. the fact that a unit holder has the ability to invest, or withdraw at any time; and/or ii. the entry into of any agreement, arrangement or understanding contemplated by the Trust Deed for the purpose of enabling investment or withdrawal; and/or iii. the appointment by the Trustee of the Manager; and/or iv. any agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into by the Trustee in a capacity other than as trustee of the Fund, or the Manager in a capacity other than as manager of the Fund, in the ordinary course of the Trustee or the Manager conducting an independent investment advisory or investment portfolio management business. (s) The Fund will not exercise any voting rights associated with the holding of Index Company securities. (t) If the Fund is resettled this Ruling shall not apply from the date of resettlement. The Fund will not be resettled in order to enhance the performance of the Fund or to minimise losses of the Fund in any way. (u) The Fund will not be involved in any securities lending. (v) The Fund will not utilise the power to suspend the issuing or redeeming of units (including any deferral notice with regard to Class B units) except in exceptional circumstances, being the following situations: i. if the Fund is to be terminated and notice has been given to the Trustee pursuant to clause 198 of the Trust Deed; ii. if extreme financial, political, or economic conditions occur and prevent the acquisition or redemption of Index Shares from the Stock Exchanges on which those Index Shares are listed; 15 iii. where the Fund has received redemption requests that exceed the available cash pool and the Fund is unable to borrow (on suitable commercial terms) sufficient funds to meet such redemption requests; iv. where there is insufficient cash in the cash pool and a redemption request is made by a unit holder who holds 5% or more of the value of the Fund and to borrow rather than suspend the withdrawal of units in the Fund would prejudice other unit holders; or v. in the case of any deferral notice in respect of class B units, the Trustee reasonably forms the opinion that to fund redemptions may prejudice the Fund’s obligations to Class A unit holders. Where suspension occurs because of termination of the Fund, the suspension will be for a maximum of 3 months of the giving of the notice to terminate by the Manager. In other circumstances, if a suspension from issuing or redeeming units occurs, the period of suspension will not exceed 3 business days, except if the situation is beyond the control of the Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund or the Manager to recover from that event. However in the case of a deferral notice, with regard to Class B units, the period of the deferral notice may be extended until the Trustee reasonably forms the opinion that to fund redemptions is no longer prejudicial to the Fund’s obligations to Class A unit holders. (w) The Manager will not redeem units as a means of correcting tracking errors. (x) The Trustee will not exercise its power under clause 87.7 of the Trust Deed to promote or carry on any scheme or undertaking in any country upon such terms and conditions as the Trustee deems fit. (y) The Fund will not invest in derivatives, with the exception of futures contracts entered into for the purposes of tracking the Index and spot foreign exchange contracts (which have a settlement period of no longer than two business days) to acquire or dispose of the necessary foreign currency so as to purchase or dispose of Index securities. (z) The Manager has the power to purchase units from unit holders when unit holders wish to redeem their units. The Manager will always use this power when the unit holder specifically requests that the Manager purchase the units and in any instance where the unit holder does not specifically request that the Trustee redeem the units. The Manager will not purchase units from any unit holder, where to do so would be inconsistent with the unit holder’s election to redeem their units with the Trustee. The Manager will not use this power to enhance the profit of the Fund. (aa) The Global Index will only include countries that are listed in Schedule 3, Part A. 16 (bb) The foreign companies included in the Global Index are resident and liable for tax in a country listed in Schedule 3, Part A. (cc) For the purposes of section CG 15(2)(b)(iii), in the case of an interest, in relation to a foreign entity, of a kind specified in section CG 15(1)(a), the foreign entity is not a foreign entity, or a member of a class of foreign entities, specified in Part B of Schedule 4. (dd) The Fund will not acquire or hold any income interest or any control interest in any company that is a “controlled foreign company” under section CG 4. (ee) There is no arrangement between the Trustee and any unit holders to effect the redemption of units in substitution for dividends. (ff) Any cancellation of units will not be part of a pro-rata cancellation as that term is defined in section CF 3(14). (gg) The Trust units will not be quoted on the official list of any recognised exchange as that term is defined in section OB 1. (hh) The Trust units are issued on such terms that their redemption is subject to the reverse ordering rule as stated in section CF 3(1)(b)(iv)(B). (ii) All distributions received by the Fund will be paid out to investors net of any expenses incurred by the Fund. (jj) In relation to amounts paid as consideration for a cancellation upon liquidation, the recipient will not be a person that is related to Tortis-INTL within the meaning of section CF 3(12). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows. • Income distributed by the Trustee will be treated as a dividend pursuant to section CF 2(1)(i). • Any amount received by unit holders on redemption of units in the Fund will be excluded from the definition of dividend in section CF 2, by section CF 3 (1)(b) to the extent that that amount does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled. The Commissioner is satisfied that, in terms of section CF 3 (1)(b)(iii), the distribution is not in lieu of the payment of dividends. The procedure of publicising buy-back and redemption prices on the Internet does not constitute a “recognised exchange” in terms of the definition of that phrase in section OB 1. 17 • If the Fund is liquidated, section CF 3 (1)(c) will apply. The amount distributed to unit holders will not be a dividend to the extent that it does not exceed the aggregate of the “available subscribed capital per share cancelled” and the “excess return amount”, as those terms apply to the Fund. The excess return amount will include gains on any securities sold by the Fund. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 July 2004 until 30 June 2007. This Ruling is signed by me on the 11 th day of June 2004. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 18
PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 04/08 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by ASB World Shares Trust. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CF 2(1)(i), CF 3(1)(b) and GB 1(3). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and continued operation of the ASB World Shares Trust (the “ASB World Trust” or the “Trust” or the “Fund”) pursuant to a master deed dated 17 October 1997 (the “Master Deed”), an establishment deed also dated 17 October 1997 (the “Establishment Deed”), a “Variation of Master Deed Dated 17 October 1997” (executed on 27 April 1999), a Deed of Amendment to ASB World Shares Trust Establishment Deed (dated 18 June 2001) and the ASB Unit Trusts Prospectus (dated 5 August 2003). Further details of the arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The ASB World Trust is a unit trust pursuant to the Unit Trusts Act 1960 and is a “unit trust” for the purposes of the definition of that term in section OB 1. 2. The trustee of the ASB World Trust is Trustees Executors Limited (the “Trustee”). It is registered as a trustee company under the Trustee Companies Act 1967. The manager of the Trust is ASB Group Investments Limited (formerly ASB Investment Services Limited) (the “Manager”), part of the ASB group of Companies. The beneficial interests in the Trust are divided into units. Each unit confers an equal interest in the Trust, but units do not confer any interest in any particular investment of the Trust. 3. The Applicant has confirmed that the Fund has complied with the previous ruling (BR Prd 01/18) except insofar as the issuing and redemption of units was suspended for 5 days as a result of the September 11 terrorist attack. There has been no material change to the management or operation of the Fund. Investment 4. The ASB World Trust acts as a special purpose vehicle, which holds units in the AMP Investments’ World Index Fund (the “AMP WiNZ Fund”). Ownership of units in the AMP WiNZ Fund enable the ASB World Trust to obtain the same financial results through one investment as would be achieved by direct investment in the securities which make up the MSCI World Index (the “Index”) tracked by the AMP WiNZ Fund. 5. ASB selected the AMP WiNZ Fund for its underlying investment for the following reasons: • The corporate strength and stability of AMP Limited (“AMP”), and the strong likelihood that AMP would be able to support an index-tracking fund well into the foreseeable future; • AMP’s technical expertise, particularly the investment management skill and capability of AMP Capital Investors (New Zealand) Limited in being able to construct and efficiently manage an index-tracking fund; • The high standard of service provided by AMP eg, regular statements and reporting on the AMP WiNZ Fund; good working relationship; and • AMP’s competitive investment management fees resulting in a lower cost to ASB World Trust Fund investors in having their funds invested in the AMP WiNZ Fund through the ASB World Trust. 6. Clauses 3.1 and 3.2 of the ASB World Trust’s Establishment Deed state the “investment objectives” of the ASB World Trust and identify the “authorised investments” as follows: 3 Investment Policy 3.1 Objectives: The objectives of the Trust are to: (a) invest in the AMP Investments’ World Index Fund subject to the need for the Trust to hold some cash for liquidity and administrative purposes; and (b) provide after tax foreign currency hedges in respect of 50% of the foreign currency securities indirectly invested in through the Trust’s investment in the AMP Investment’s World Index Fund. The funds of the Trust that are available for investment shall be invested in the AMP Investments’ World Index Fund or in foreign currency contracts as soon as practicable after receipt by the Trustee. The Trust and the Trustee do not have an intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling AMP Investments’ World Fund units. 3.2 Authorised Investments: For the purposes of this Trust “Authorised Investments” means: (a) the AMP Investments’ World Index Fund; (b) cash balances with banks, brokers, agents, funds, including, without limitation, the ASB Money Market Trust, or custodians held for the liquidity and administrative purposes of the Trust referred to at Clause 3.1; and (c) foreign exchange contracts for the foreign currencies of the securities 2 making up the AMP World Index entered into to provide the hedges referred to in clause 3.1 7. Pursuant to the Establishment Deed, the ASB World Trust is only authorised to invest contributions from Members in: (a) the AMP WiNZ Fund, (b) a fixed 50% after tax foreign currency hedge and (c) cash investments. The Fund may hold cash investments to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund. The cash investments are held by the Fund in bank deposits. The Fund will hold cash in the following instances: • Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; • Following the sale of AMP WiNZ Fund units to meet a request to redeem units in cash; • To make income distributions to unitholders; • To meet obligations under the fixed 50% after tax foreign currency hedge; and • To met administration expenses of the Fund. 8. It is the intention of the ASB World Trust that investment in AMP WiNZ Fund units (taking into account the appropriate level of hedge, or distribution of excess cash, whichever is relevant) will be completed on a weekly basis. The level of funds is monitored on a weekly basis and invested if in excess of the cash pool. Funds passed to the Manager are invested in the underlying pool within 24 hours. 9. The currencies to be hedged are the US dollar, Japanese yen, Euro, British pound, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. The weighting of these currencies in the hedge will be determined exactly, based on the Trust’s underlying exposure, on each rollover date, based on the latest country weightings (included in the Index) which are made available by AMP Capital Investors (New Zealand) Limited. 10. The ASB World Trust is required to place an order for a 74.6% hedge (or an equivalent residual figure should the applicable income tax rate change from 33%) and accept the closest to this figure that is obtainable within the set limits. Further, realignment of the hedge level will occur monthly at the rollover of forward contracts to a new forward date. All hedge contracts will mature on or about the fifteenth business day of the month following entry. The level of the hedge is to be maintained at between 71.6% and 77.6% of the non-New Zealand dollar amount invested offshore. This variance is required to take account of redemptions and subscriptions arising during a month. It is also required to take account of the fact that foreign currency hedges can generally only be obtained in round amounts. Where the hedge moves outside the plus or minus 3% (pre-tax) band the hedge will be adjusted back to 74.6%, on the day that this occurs, based on the country weightings made available by AMP Capital Investors (New Zealand) Limited on the last roll-over date. 11. Under clause 11.3(h) of schedule 1 to the Master Deed the unitholders can sanction any variation of the “authorised investments” of the Trust by 3 extraordinary resolution. However, the Fund intends to maintain its current investment strategy. AMP WiNZ Fund 12. The AMP WiNZ Fund is a “group investment fund” within the meaning of section OB 1. The AMP WiNZ Fund is required to buy and sell shares as required to ensure that it continues to track the Index. The AMP WiNZ Fund has two current binding rulings (BR Prv 01/31, regarding BD 1(1), CD 3, CD 4, and CD 5 and BR Prv 01/32, regarding OZ1 and CG 1) which state that such buying and selling is not motivated by any intention to derive a profit or gain from such sales. The AMP WiNZ Fund is listed on the New Zealand Stock Market (“NZSX”). 13. The AMP WiNZ Fund will make taxable distributions to the Trust from any income received by the AMP WiNZ Fund semi-annually within 20 days from the end of June and December. 14. The Trust will generally distribute such part, as is determined by the Manager, of its net income 6-monthly to unitholders and that net income will be calculated taking into account all costs, charges and expenses due. 15. The Establishment Deed also provides for special distributions to occur at other times determined by the Manager. However, in the period between receipt of income from the AMP WiNZ Fund and any distribution, the ASB World Trust is required to invest amounts not held for administrative or liquidity purposes in units in the AMP WiNZ Fund and maintain the fixed 50% after tax foreign currency hedge. Suspensions 16. A suspension from issuing or redeeming units will only occur in exceptional circumstances, being the following situations: (1) If a material adverse change in the financial markets occurs, namely, a breakdown in liquidity caused by an act of God or a system failure or a terrorist attack; (2) If there is a fundamental breakdown in the functioning of financial markets, namely, the failure of pricemaking software; or (3) If it is required so as to avoid a breach of any applicable law. Any such suspension will be for a maximum period of 3 business days, unless the exceptional circumstance giving rise to the need to suspend is beyond the control of the Trustee and Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund and/or the Manager to recover from that event. 4 The issuing and redeeming of units was suspended for 5 days as a result of the September 11 terrorist attack. Redemption of ASB World Fund units 17. The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders, when unitholders wish to redeem or sell their units. The Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool to redeem the units requested and the Fund is unable to borrow to meet the unitholders’ requests. To date, the Manager has not utilised this power. Redemption of AMP WiNZ Fund units 18. When the ASB World Trust is required to redeem units in the AMP WiNZ Fund, the ASB World Trust can sell its units to a third party, or it can redeem its units to the AMP WiNZ Fund. Upon redemption, the ASB World Trust will receive a parcel of securities equal to the value of the units at that time. The AMP WiNZ Fund manager may sell those securities on behalf of (as agent for) the ASB World Trust, and then give the ASB World Trust cash for those units. The ASB World Trust also has the option (as opposed to redeeming its units to the AMP WiNZ Fund) to sell its units through the AMP WiNZ Fund manager. 19. Redemption requests for AMP WiNZ Fund units must be for a minimum of 1,000,000 WiNZ units. When the ASB World Trust makes a redemption request to the AMP WiNZ Fund, the AMP WiNZ Fund manager makes a choice as to how to effect that redemption request. The AMP WiNZ Fund manager may effect redemption by either: (1) cancellation of the units or (2) purchasing those units on its own behalf. In either situation, when the AMP WiNZ Fund manager effects a redemption request, the unitholder (ie, the ASB World Trust) will receive the same redemption amount for its AMP WiNZ Fund units. 20. Requests to dispose of parcels of less than 1,000,000 AMP WiNZ Fund units will be facilitated by the AMP WiNZ Fund manager in parcels of 100,000 AMP WiNZ Fund units. The ASB World Trust will only dispose of its AMP WiNZ Fund units by making a redemption request to the AMP WiNZ Fund manager. The ASB World Trust will not dispose of AMP WiNZ Fund units in any other manner. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) There is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Fund or the Trustee or the Manager and any unitholder (or any person associated with any unitholder) which directly or indirectly has a purpose or effect of the redemption or disposition of any of a unitholder’s units occurring in substitution for or instead of one or more distributions from the Fund. 5 b) The Trust will be a widely-held trust, as that term is defined in section CF 3(14). c) Any cancellation of ASB World Trust units will not be part of a pro-rata cancellation as that term is defined in section CF 3(14). d) The ASB World Trust units will not be quoted on the official list of any recognised exchange as that term is defined in section OB 1. e) The ASB World Trust units are issued on such terms that their redemption is subject to the reverse ordering rule as stated in section CF 3(1)(b)(iv)(B). f) The income of the Fund, net of any expenses incurred by the Fund, will be paid out to unitholders either as cash or additional units in the Fund. However, the Manager may use its discretion, and decide not to make such a payment if the amount to be paid is so minimal that the administrative costs of making the payment would exceed the amount to be distributed. The payment of income to unitholders on this basis is consistent with the Fund's normal dividend policy and Trust Deed. Not necessarily paying out the full value of the WiNZ Fund units received as income reflects the Trustee's normal prudence in only distributing the "profits" of the Fund and does not occur for tax purposes. g) The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders, when unitholders wish to redeem or sell their units. The Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool to redeem the units requested and the Fund is unable to borrow to meet the unitholders’ requests. h) Where unitholders elect to receive distributions as additional Fund units instead of cash, these constitute a “taxable bonus issue” as that term is defined in section OB 1. i) The AMP WiNZ Fund was chosen to provide a cost effective means for simulating an investment that matches the composition and weighting of the Index. The AMP WiNZ Fund was not selected in order to maximise returns. j) The Fund has not taken into account historical returns in deciding to maintain its current investment strategy. k) The investment objectives and authorised investments of the Trust will not be amended. l) The cash pool is held in cash deposits which are held on call in bank deposits.. The holding of such cash will arise only from the following circumstances: • Pending investment in AMP WiNZ Fund units; • To meet a withdrawal from the Trust; • To make income distributions to unitholders; • Pursuant to the fixed 50% after tax foreign currency hedge; and • To meet administration expenses of the Fund. 6 The proportion of the Fund’s assets to be held as cash will not be greater than what strictly arises out of the above described circumstances, and in any event will not exceed the greater of $200,000 or 4% of the total assets of the Fund. m) Condition (l) shall not be breached if the limit referred to in condition (l) is exceeded when this occurs due to the following reasons: • Where a large cash subscription has been paid into the cash pool; or • Receipt of dividends from the AMP WiNZ Fund; or • From proceeds or settlement of maturing currency hedge contracts; and the Fund takes immediate action to remedy this within the shortest practicable time, and in any event, no longer than 5 business days. n) The Fund may borrow temporarily in order to meet the following obligations where it is unable to meet such demands out of its current cash reserves: (1) to redeem units; (2) to meet hedging contract obligations. Any such borrowing will only be to the extent that is strictly necessary and in the case of borrowing to redeem units will not exceed 2% of the value of the Fund and in the case of borrowing to meet hedging obligations will not exceed 10% of the value of the Fund. All such borrowing will be repaid within five business days. o) The Fund will only sell or otherwise dispose of AMP WiNZ Fund units in the following circumstances: • To meet administration expenses of the Fund that cannot be met out of the cash pool; or • Where the Manager must purchase or redeem AMP WiNZ Fund units in order to meet the needs of the Fund’s unitholders; or • In order to wind up the Trust; or • To meet hedging contract obligations that cannot be met out of the cash pool. p) When the Fund is given the option of re-investing its dividends for additional units in the AMP WiNZ Fund, the Fund will always accept the reinvestment option. In any such case, the value of the units received is equivalent to the value of the cash dividend, (net of tax, fees and expenses). q) This ruling shall cease to apply if at any time: (i) there is a unitholder, or two or more unitholders that are associated with each other, or are acting in concert in relation to their investments in the Fund, who hold/s more than 75% of the issued units of the Fund; and 7 (ii) if that unitholder, or one or more of such unitholders, ordinarily hold securities on revenue account or the disposal of securities by that unitholder, or one or more of such unitholders, would ordinarily give rise to gross income for income tax purposes. For the purposes of this condition unitholders are associated with each other if they are “associated persons” within the meaning of section OD 7 or OD 8(3). r) This Ruling only applies while this Fund remains a widely-held trust (as that term is defined in section CF 3(14)), and the Fund units are offered to the public. s) Apart from the Trust Deed and/or Prospectus and/or any Rules of the Fund that have been supplied to Inland Revenue as part of the application for this ruling, there is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Fund or the Trustee or the Manager (or any party acting on behalf of the Fund) and any unitholder (or any person associated with or acting on behalf of any unitholder) regarding the control of the Fund, the nature and timing of its investments, or the timing of the investing or withdrawal of funds. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the fact that a unitholder has the ability to invest, or withdraw at any time and/or (ii) the entry into of agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated by the Trust Deed for the purpose of enabling investment or withdrawal, will not alone constitute an agreement, arrangement or understanding to which the preceding sentence applies. t) The Fund will not exercise any voting rights associated with the holding of AMP WiNZ Fund units. u) If the Fund is resettled this Ruling shall not apply from the date of resettlement. The Fund will not be resettled in order to enhance the performance of the Fund or to minimize the losses of the Fund in any way. v) A suspension from issuing or redeeming units will only occur in exceptional circumstances, being: (1) If a material adverse change in the financial markets occurs namely, a breakdown in liquidity caused by an act of God, or a system failure or a terrorist attack; or (2) If there is a fundamental breakdown in the functioning of financial markets namely, the failure of pricemaking software; or (3) If it is required so as to avoid a breach of any applicable law. Any such suspension will be for a maximum period of 3 business days, unless the exceptional circumstance giving rise to the need to suspend is beyond the control of the Trustee and Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension 8 shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund and/or the Manager to recover from that event. w) The distribution period of the Fund will only be altered for administrative reasons and shall not be altered to enhance the performance of the Fund in any way. x) The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders, when unitholders wish to redeem or sell their units. The Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool to redeem the units requested and the Fund is unable to borrow to meet the unitholders’ requests. y) There is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the AMP WiNZ Fund or its trustee or its manager and the ASB World Trust (or any person associated with the ASB World Trust) which directly or indirectly has a purpose or effect of the redemption or disposition of any of the ASB World Trust’s units occurring in substitution for or instead of one or more distributions from the AMP WiNZ Fund. z) The Trust will only dispose of its AMP WiNZ Fund units by making a redemption request to the AMP WiNZ Fund manager or by selling to a third party. The Fund will only sell to a third party in the exceptional circumstance where the request to the AMP WiNZ Fund Manager cannot be actioned within 7 business days. aa) Any powers exercised by the Trustee under the Master Deed and Establishment Deed are for the purposes of either buying units in the AMP WiNZ Fund, matched by a 50% after tax hedge, to reflect the level of funds invested in the Trust, or selling units in the AMP WINZ Fund to fund redemption of units in the Trust, or in order to meet its payment obligations under the hedging arrangement or to meet administration expenses of the Fund. bb) The existing binding rulings for the AMP WiNZ Fund (BR Prv 01/31 and BR Prv 01/32) or any such replacement ruling or rulings in respect of the same taxation laws remain current and in force. cc) The Fund will not be wound up with a view to enhancing the performance of the Fund or to minimise losses of the Fund in any way. This condition will not be breached if: (i) the Manager decides to wind up the Fund for reasons unrelated to the performance of the investments of the Fund; or (ii) if the unitholders independently resolve to wind up the Fund. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement 9 Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Income distributed by the Trustee will be treated as a dividend pursuant to section CF 2(1)(i). • Any amount received by unitholders on redemption of units in the Fund will be excluded from the definition of dividend in section CF 2, by section CF 3 (1)(b) to the extent that that amount does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled. • Section GB 1(3) does not apply to the arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 July 2004 until 30 June 2007. This Ruling is signed by me on the 22 nd day of June 2004.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 04/09 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by ASB New Zealand Shares Trust. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CF 2(1)(i), CF 3(1)(b) and GB 1(3). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and continued operation of the ASB NZ Shares Trust (the “ASB NZ Trust” or the “Trust” or the “Fund”) pursuant to the Master Deed (which is dated 17 October 1997) (the “Master Deed”), the Establishment Deed (which is also dated 17 October 1997) (the “Establishment Deed”), a “Variation of Master Unit Trust Deed Dated 17 October 1997” (dated 27 April 1999), a Deed of Amendment to ASB NZ Shares Trust Establishment Deed (dated 18 June 2001) and the ASB Unit Trusts Prospectus (dated 5 August 2003). Further details of the arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The ASB NZ Trust is a unit trust pursuant to the Unit Trusts Act 1960 and is a “unit trust” for the purposes of the definition of that term in section OB 1. 2. The trustee of the ASB NZ Trust is Trustees Executors Limited (the “Trustee”). It is registered as a trustee company under the Trustee Companies Act 1967. The manager of the Trust is ASB Group Investments Limited (formerly ASB Investment Services Limited) (the “Manager”), part of the ASB Group of Companies. The beneficial interests in the Trust are divided into units. Each unit confers an equal interest in the Trust, but units do not confer any interest in any particular investment of the Trust. 3. The Applicant has confirmed that the Fund has complied with the previous ruling (BR Prd 01/19). There has been no material change to the management or operation of the Fund. Investment 4. The ASB NZ Trust acts as a special purpose vehicle, which holds units in the AMP Investments’ Tracker Fund (the “AMP Tracker Fund”). Ownership of units in the AMP Tracker Fund enable the ASB NZ Trust to obtain the same financial results through one investment as would be achieved by direct investment in the securities which make up the Russell Ord Minnett Tradeable Index (“the Index”) tracked by the Tracker Fund. The AMP Tracker Fund intends to switch in 2004 to tracking the NZSX 50 Index as soon as it obtains a replacement ruling that refers to the new Index. There will be no realisation of any investment by the ASB NZ Trust or change in the way that it will operate as a result of this change. 5. ASB selected the AMP Tracker Fund as its underlying investment for the following reasons: • The corporate strength and stability of AMP Limited (“AMP”), and the strong likelihood that AMP would be able to support an index-tracking fund well into the foreseeable future; • AMP’s technical expertise, particularly the investment management skill and capability of AMP Capital Investors (New Zealand) Limited in being able to construct and efficiently manage an index-tracking fund; • The high standard of service provided by AMP eg, regular statements and reporting on the AMP Tracker Fund; good working relationship; and • AMP’s competitive investment management fees resulting in a lower cost to ASB NZ Trust Fund investors in having their funds invested in the AMP Tracker Fund through the ASB NZ Trust. 6. Clauses 3.1 and 3.2 of the ASB NZ Trust’s Establishment Deed state the “investment objectives” of the ASB NZ Trust and identify the “authorised investments” as follows: 3 Investment Policy 3.1 Objectives: The objective of the Trust is to invest in the AMP Investments Tracker Fund, subject to the need for the Trust to hold some cash for liquidity and administrative purposes. The funds of the Trust that are available for investment shall be invested in the AMP Investment Tracker Fund as soon as practicable after receipt by the Trustee. The Trust and the Trustee do not have an intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling AMP Investments’ Tracker Fund units. The Trust and the Trustee do not have an intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling AMP Investments’ Tracker Fund units. 3.2 Authorised Investments: For the purposes of this Trust “Authorised Investments” means: (a) the AMP Investments’ Tracker Fund; (b) cash balances with banks, brokers, agents, funds, including, without limitation, the ASB Money Market Trust, or custodians held for the liquidity and administrative purposes of the Trust referred to at Clause 3.1; 2 7. Pursuant to the Establishment Deed, the ASB NZ Trust is only authorised to invest contributions from members in: (a) the AMP Tracker Fund and (b) cash investments. The Fund may hold cash investments to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund. The cash investments are held as cash by the Fund in bank deposits. The Fund will hold cash in the following instances: • Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; • Following the sale of AMP Tracker Fund units to meet a request to redeem Trust units in cash; • To make income distributions to unitholders; and • To meet administration expenses of the Fund. 8. It is the intention of the ASB NZ Trust that investment in AMP Tracker Fund units, taking into account the appropriate distribution of excess cash, will be completed on a weekly basis. The level of funds is monitored on a weekly basis and invested if in excess of the cash pool. Funds passed to the Manager are invested in the underlying pool within 24 hours. 9. Under clause 11.3(h) of schedule 1 to the Master Deed the unitholders can sanction any variation of the “authorised investments” of the Trust by extraordinary resolution. However, the Fund intends to maintain its current investment strategy. AMP Tracker Fund 10. The AMP Tracker Fund is a “group investment fund” within the meaning of section OB 1. The AMP Tracker Fund is required to buy and sell shares as required to ensure that it continues to track the Index. The AMP Tracker Fund has a current binding ruling (BR Prv 01/84) which states that such buying and selling is not motivated by any intention to derive a profit or gain from such sales. 11. The AMP Tracker Fund makes taxable distributions to the ASB NZ Trust. The taxable distributions from the AMP Tracker Fund to the ASB NZ Trust are from any dividends received by the AMP Tracker Fund, according to the Prospectus, either on receipt or quarterly, depending on the size of the ASB NZ Trust’s investment. However, in practice, the dividends are received on a monthly basis. 12. The ASB NZ Trust will generally distribute to its unitholders part of the distributions it receives from the AMP Tracker Fund six-monthly. To determine the amount of the distribution, the Manager of the ASB NZ Trust will determine the Trust’s “net income” by taking into account, not only the distributions received by the AMP Tracker Fund, but also all costs, charges and expenses due by or to the ASB NZ Trust. 13. The Establishment Deed also provides for special distributions to occur at other times determined by the Manager. However, in the period between receipt of income from the AMP Tracker Fund and any distribution the ASB 3 NZ Trust is required to invest amounts not held for administrative or liquidity purposes in units in the AMP Tracker Fund. 14. The AMP Tracker Fund units will be issued subject to the reverse ordering rule (subparagraph CF 3(1)(b)(iv)(B)) and may only be redeemed in whole, and not in part. Units in the AMP Tracker Fund are not quoted on any exchange. Suspensions 15. The Fund has not previously suspended redemptions. A suspension from issuing or redeeming units will only occur in exceptional circumstances, being: (1) If a material adverse change in the financial markets occurs, namely, a breakdown in liquidity caused by an act of God or a system failure or a terrorist attack; or (2) if there is a fundamental breakdown in the functioning of financial markets, namely, the failure of pricemaking software; or (3) If it is required so as to avoid a breach of any applicable law. Any such suspension will be for a maximum period of 3 business days, unless the exceptional circumstance giving rise to the need to suspend is beyond the control of the Trustee and Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund and/or the Manager to recover from that event. Redemption of ASB NZ Trust Units 16. The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders, when unitholders wish to redeem or sell their units. The Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool to redeem the units requested and the Fund is unable to borrow to meet the unitholders’ requests. To date, the Manager has not utilised this power. Redemption of AMP Tracker Fund Units 17. When the ASB NZ Trust is required to redeem units in the AMP Tracker Fund, the parcel of securities held by the AMP Tracker Fund attributable to the ASB NZ Trust’s investment can be returned to the ASB NZ Trust. Alternatively, the redemption parcel of securities can be delivered to the AMP Tracker Fund manager as agent for the unitholder (ie, the ASB NZ Trust). In this alternative situation, the AMP Tracker Fund manager will sell the basket of securities comprising the redemption parcel as agent for the ASB NZ Trust, and the AMP Tracker Fund manager will pay the proceeds to the ASB NZ Trust (or in certain circumstances, the AMP Tracker Fund manager will hold the securities and transfer to the ASB NZ Trust the equivalent dollar value of the redeemed securities). 4 18. The ASB NZ Trust always requests the AMP Tracker Fund manager to redeem the basket of securities for cash, instead of receiving the basket of securities. Therefore, the ASB NZ Trust, upon redemption of units in the AMP Tracker Fund, will receive a transfer of securities followed by an immediate sale of those securities by the AMP Tracker Fund manager as agent for the ASB NZ Trust. 19. Although the AMP Tracker Fund’s prospectus refers to a threshold of 100,000 units being the minimum redemption amount (in order to redeem the units in the AMP Tracker Fund), ASB Bank have agreed with the AMP Tracker Fund manager that the treatment of redemptions for parcels of 100,000 units or greater will also apply to parcels of 50,000 or greater in respect of redemptions for the ASB NZ Trust. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) There is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Fund or the Trustee or the Manager and any unitholder (or any person associated with any unitholder) which directly or indirectly has a purpose or effect of the redemption or disposition of any of a unitholder’s units occurring in substitution for or instead of one or more distributions from the Fund. b) The Trust will be a widely-held trust, as that term is defined in section CF 3(14). c) Any cancellation of ASB NZ Trust units will not be part of a pro-rata cancellation as that term is defined in section CF 3(14). d) The ASB NZ Trust units will not be quoted on the official list of any recognised exchange as that term is defined in section OB 1. e) The ASB NZ Trust units are issued on such terms that their redemption is subject to the reverse ordering rule as stated in section CF 3(1)(b)(iv)(B). f) The income of the Fund, net of any expenses incurred by the Fund, will be paid out to unitholders either as cash or additional units in the Fund. However, the Manager may use its discretion, and decide not to make such a payment if the amount to be paid is so minimal that the administrative costs of making the payment would exceed the amount to be distributed. The payment of income to unitholders on this basis is consistent with the Fund's normal dividend policy and Trust Deed. Not necessarily paying out the full value of the Tracker Fund units received as income reflects the Trustee's normal prudence in only distributing the “profits” of the Fund and does not occur for tax purposes; 5 g) The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders, when unitholders wish to redeem or sell their units. The Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool to redeem the units requested and the Fund is unable to borrow to meet the unitholders’ requests. h) Where unitholders elect to receive distributions as additional Fund units instead of cash, these constitute a “taxable bonus issue” as that term is defined in section OB 1. i) The AMP Tracker Fund was chosen to provide a cost effective means for simulating an investment that matches the composition and weighting of the Index. The AMP Tracker Fund was not selected in order to maximise returns. j) The Fund has not taken into account historical returns in deciding to maintain its current investment strategy. k) The investment objectives and authorised investments of the Trust will not be amended. l) The cash pool is held in cash deposits which are held on call in bank deposits. The holding of such cash will arise only from the following circumstances: • To meet the administration expenses of the Fund; • Pending investment in AMP Tracker Fund units; • To meet a withdrawal from the Trust; or • To make income distributions to unitholders. The proportion of the Fund’s assets to be held as cash will not be greater than what strictly arises out of the above described circumstances, and in any event will not exceed the greater of $200,000 or 4% of the total assets of the Fund. m) Condition (l) shall not be breached if the limit referred to in condition (l) is exceeded when this occurs due to the following reasons: • Where a large cash subscription has been paid into the cash pool; or • Receipt of dividends from the AMP Tracker Fund, and the Fund takes immediate action to remedy this within the shortest practicable time, and in any event, no longer than five business days. n) In the event that the Fund has insufficient cash available to meet redemptions, the Fund may temporarily borrow in order to redeem units. Any borrowing that occurs will be: (i) only to the extent that is strictly necessary and will not in any event exceed 2% of the value of the Fund; and (ii) repaid as soon as possible and in any event within five business days. o) The Fund will only sell or otherwise dispose of AMP Tracker Fund units in the following circumstances: 6 • To meet the administration expenses of the Fund; • The Manager must purchase or redeem AMP Tracker Fund units in order to meet the needs of the Fund’s unitholders; or • In order to wind up the Trust. p) When the Fund is given the option of re-investing its dividends for additional units in the AMP Tracker Fund, the Fund will always accept the reinvestment option. In any such case, the value of the units received is equivalent to the value of the cash dividend (net of tax, fees and expenses) and the distribution of cash or units constitutes a “dividend” as that term is defined in section CF 2. q) This ruling shall cease to apply if at any time: (i) there is a unitholder, or two or more unitholders that are associated with each other, or are acting in concert in relation to their investments in the Fund, who hold/s more than 75% of the issued units of the Fund; and (ii) if that unitholder, or one or more of such unitholders, ordinarily hold securities on revenue account or the disposal of securities by that unitholder, or one or more of such unitholders, would ordinarily give rise to gross income for income tax purposes. For the purposes of this condition unitholders are associated with each other if they are “associated persons” within the meaning of section OD 7 or OD 8(3). r) This Ruling only applies while this Fund remains a widely-held trust (as that term is defined in section CF 3(14)), and the Fund units are offered to the public. s) Apart from the Trust Deed and/or Prospectus and/or any Rules of the Fund that have been supplied to Inland Revenue as part of the application for this ruling, there is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Fund or the Trustee or the Manager (or any party acting on behalf of the Fund) and any unitholder (or any person associated with or acting on behalf of any unitholder) regarding the control of the Fund, the nature and timing of its investments, or the timing of the investing or withdrawal of funds. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the fact that a unitholder has the ability to invest, or withdraw at any time and/or (ii) the entry into of agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated by the Trust Deed for the purpose of enabling investment or withdrawal, will not alone constitute an agreement, arrangement or understanding to which the preceding sentence applies. t) The Fund will not exercise any voting rights associated with the holding of AMP Tracker Fund units. 7 u) If the Fund is resettled this Ruling shall not apply from the date of resettlement. The Fund will not be resettled in order to enhance the performance of the Fund or to minimise the losses of the Fund in any way. v) A suspension from issuing or redeeming units will only occur in exceptional circumstances, being: (1) If a material adverse change in the financial markets occurs namely, a breakdown in liquidity caused by an act of God, or a system failure or a terrorist attack; (2) If there is a fundamental breakdown in the functioning of financial markets namely, the failure of pricemaking software; or (3) If it is required so as to avoid a breach of any applicable law. Any such suspension will be for a maximum period of 3 business days, unless the exceptional circumstance giving rise to the need to suspend is beyond the control of the Trustee and Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund and/or the Manager to recover from that event. w) The distribution period of the Fund will only be altered for administrative reasons and shall not be altered to enhance the performance of the Fund in any way. x) The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders, when unitholders wish to redeem or sell their units. The Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool to redeem the units requested and the Fund is unable to borrow to meet the unitholders’ requests. y) The AMP Tracker Fund is an “unlisted trust” in terms of the definition of that term in section CF 3(14). z) Cancellation of AMP Tracker Fund units will not be made as part of a pro rata cancellation of units. aa) AMP Tracker Fund units will not be quoted on the official list of a recognised exchange. bb) The AMP Tracker Fund units are issued on such terms that their redemption is subject to the reverse ordering rule as stated in section CF 3(1)(b)(iv)(B). cc) There is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the AMP Tracker Fund or its trustee or its manager and the ASB NZ Trust (or any person associated with the ASB NZ Trust) which directly or indirectly has a purpose or effect of the redemption or disposition of any of the ASB NZ Trust’s units occurring in substitution for or instead of one or more distributions from the AMP Tracker Fund. 8 dd) The Trust will either: (1) redeem its AMP Tracker Fund units to the AMP Tracker Fund or (2) sell its units to the AMP Tracker Fund manager. The Trust will not dispose of its units in any other manner. ee) All distributions received by the AMP Tracker Fund will be paid out, (either as cash or AMP Tracker Fund units) to investors in the AMP Tracker Fund net of any expenses incurred by the AMP Tracker Fund. ff) Any powers exercised by the Trustee under the Master Deed and Establishment Deed are for the purposes of either buying units in the AMP Tracker Fund to reflect the level of funds invested in the Trust or, selling or redeeming units in the AMP Tracker Fund to fund redemptions of units in the Trust. gg) The existing binding ruling for the AMP Tracker Fund (BR Prv 01/84) or any such replacement ruling or rulings in respect of the same taxation laws remain current and in force. hh) The Fund will not be wound up with a view to enhancing the performance of the Fund or to minimise losses of the Fund in any way. This condition will not be breached if: (i) the Manager decides to wind up the Fund for reasons unrelated to the performance of the investments of the Fund; or (ii) if the unitholders independently resolve to wind up the Fund. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Income distributed by the Trustee will be treated as a dividend pursuant to section CF 2(1)(i). • Any amount received by unitholders on redemption of units in the Fund will be excluded from the definition of dividend in section CF 2, by section CF 3(1)(b) to the extent that that amount does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled. • Section GB 1(3) does not apply to the arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 July 2004 until 30 June 2007. This Ruling is signed by me on the 22 nd day of June 2004. 9 Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 10
PRODUCT RULING – BR Prd 04/10 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by BNZ Investment Management Limited as Administration Manager of The BNZ International Equity Index Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section HH 3(5) and the section OB 1 definitions of “qualifying trust” and “superannuation fund”. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the operation of the BNZ International Equity Index Fund (“the Fund”) pursuant to the Trust Deed of the Fund, dated 1 July 2001, as amended by a Deed of Amendment dated 21 December 2001 (“the Trust Deed”). The Trust Deed will be further amended as soon as practicable following the issuing of this ruling by a Deed of Amendment and the final Deed of Amendment will not be materially different from the draft Deed of Amendment provided to the Rulings Unit on 11 June 2004 (“the Amending Deed”). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The Fund invests in equity securities that correspond to the composition of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index (“MSCI”), modified such that the securities invested in will be of those countries specified in Part A of Schedule 3 to the Act (“grey-list countries”) that each comprise 1% or more of the MSCI (“the BNZ Index”). The Fund has been designed to enable investors to obtain, through one security, the same financial results that can be obtained through the direct investment in the securities of those companies that make up the BNZ Index. 2. The Trustee of the Fund (“the Trustee”) is Trustees Executors Superannuation Limited. In July 2003, TOWER Trust Superannuation Limited (as a result of a change in ownership) reverted to its former name of Trustees Executors Superannuation Limited. 3. The Administration Manager of the Fund is BNZ Investment Management Limited (the “Administration Manager”). The Investment Manager of the Fund is State Street Global Advisors, Australia, Limited (“the Investment Manager”). 4. The Sponsor of the Fund is the Bank of New Zealand (“the Sponsor”). 5. The Fund is a wholesale superannuation fund into which other wholesale and retail superannuation funds invest. The Fund was established for the purpose of being a wholesale investment vehicle for retail superannuation funds, other wholesale superannuation funds and for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to the limited number of natural persons who invest directly in it. Unless the prior approval of the Trustee, with the consent of the Sponsor, is obtained, the minimum initial investment into the Fund is NZ$200,000. 6. The Fund is registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. 7. The Trust Deed states that: The investment policy of the Fund will be: (a) to invest the Fund (other than the Cash Pool) in accordance with Schedule 2 to this Deed only in such investments as the Trustee considers necessary to track the modified grey list components of the World Index; and (b) to invest the Cash Pool in restricted investments, being deposits with banks, and futures contracts. 8. The Fund buys and sells shares as required to ensure that it continues to correspond to the BNZ Index. Such buying and selling will not be motivated by any intention to derive a profit or gain from such sales. In this regard, the Trust Deed states: The Fund and the Trustee do not have an intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling Index Company securities. 9. The Applicant has confirmed that all material aspects of the previous rulings (Prv 97/125, Prv 01/11, Prv 01/65, Prv 01/114, Prd 97/38, Prd 01/30 and Prd 02/01), relating to the Fund, have been complied with, except that: (a) The earliest rulings did not refer to the Investment Manager’s ability to sell securities where an individual security was outside its tracking weight; and (b) In some cases investments from natural persons have been below $200,000. 10. The only amendments to the Trust Deed are those contained in the Amending Deed. There has not been any material change to the management or operation of the Fund since its establishment. Date of Adjustments 11. The Fund is re-balanced in the following circumstances: • If a security is outside its BNZ Index weight by the lesser of- • 0.5% of the total Fund, whether positive or negative; or • three times the BNZ Index weight of the individual security; and 2 • When the periodic (currently quarterly) adjustments are made to the MSCI; and • If there are any MSCI market driven changes (as identified in clause 3.3 of the current MSCI Methodology Book: MSCI Standard Index Series Methodology) or corporate actions such as a merger, takeover, new listing or reduction or increase in capital affecting any index company in the BNZ Index. 12. Such re-balancing will occur at the earliest practicable time after the above events have occurred and in any event within five business days. Events that trigger acquisitions or realisations 13. There are certain reasons or events when investments held by the Fund will have to be bought or sold. The Trustee will only dispose of securities (other than cash pool investments) if: • the Fund is wound up; • there is a change in the BNZ Index and composition of the securities of the Fund no longer tracks the BNZ Index (whether as a result of a change to the countries included or a change to the securities included); • there is a compulsory acquisition of one of the Fund’s securities or a security is acquired on a compulsory acquisition, merger or takeover which does not track the BNZ Index; • there is a net withdrawal of funds from the Fund by members; • there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Fund which cannot be otherwise satisfied; or • the Fund is re-balanced in accordance with the first bullet point in paragraph 11, above. Rights issues 14. In the event of any rights issue by an index company, the Investment Manager will retain the entitlement and take up the securities if the securities the subject of the entitlement will be immediately included in the BNZ Index. 15. Notwithstanding paragraph 14, if the securities the subject of the entitlement are over-represented, the Investment Manager will sell the entitlement and reinvest the proceeds in the index companies to track the BNZ Index. 16. If the Investment Manager does not know whether the securities the subject of the entitlement will be included in the Index the Investment Manager will sell the entitlement at the earliest practicable time (and in any event within five business days) and reinvest the proceeds in the index companies to track the BNZ Index. 3 Mergers, Takeovers and Share Buy-backs 17. The BNZ Index may be adjusted from time to time because of mergers, takeovers, share buy-backs, distributions of capital, cash issues, and substitutions of companies in the BNZ Index. 18. In the event of a merger or takeover of a BNZ Index company the Investment Manager will adjust the Fund portfolio at the earliest practicable time (but in any event within five business days) to the time the BNZ Index is adjusted. The Fund will not accept an offer unless as a consequence of not accepting the offer the Fund would track the BNZ Index less accurately than if it had accepted the offer. 19. The Investment Manager will not participate in an optional share buy-back by a BNZ Index company. Hedging 20. There is no specific provision in the Trust Deed that allows the Fund to hedge foreign exchange risks. 21. The Fund will not take any action to hedge or manage foreign exchange risks or exposures that arise from the investments of the Fund being held in non-New Zealand currencies. Borrowing 22. Clause 10.1 (c) of the Trust provides: ...The Trustee may: borrow money for the purpose of the Fund upon terms and conditions agreed by the Sponsor and the Trustee and charge all or part of the assets of the Fund with repayment and payment of interest on the moneys so borrowed; 23. Pursuant to the ruling, the Fund can only borrow in the following circumstances: • To temporarily fund the redemption of units when the cash pool has insufficient funds; this borrowing must be repaid at the earliest practicable time, and in any event any such borrowing will be repaid within three business days; • Where a security is sold and another purchased and a settlement mismatch occurs resulting in the Fund’s bank account becoming inadvertently overdrawn, and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; • To temporarily fund the purchase of securities in order to rebalance following a merger, where pursuant to the merger payment due to the Fund for securities 4 that have been disposed of has been delayed (such delay being beyond the control of the Fund), and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; or • For advances (not to exceed total borrowings of $5,000) by the Administration Manager to the Fund to meet expenses of the Fund, where the Administration Manager’s expense account is insufficient to enable the Administration Manager to meet such expenses. Cash investments held by the Fund 24. Although it is not an objective of the Fund to hold cash, the Trustee and the Investment Manager may hold cash to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund. The cash held by the Trustee and the Investment Manager is on “call”. Wherever possible, futures contracts will be entered into by the Investment Manager to cover cash held by the Investment Manager. This is known as “equitised cash”. 25. The Investment Manager or the Trustee will hold cash in the following circumstances: • Following the sale of securities in the course of tracking the BNZ Index or in the course of a compulsory acquisition, merger, takeover, share buy-back or distribution of capital pending the reinvestment of that cash; • Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; • Following the sale of securities to meet a request for withdrawal by a member; • When a dividend is paid to the Fund in respect of an investment in a security; • To accumulate the minimum amount of cash required to allow for minimum trade sizes and to obtain a reasonable representation of the number of securities on the BNZ Index (“the minimum investment level”). The Investment Manager has advised that this amount is presently approximately $US 3 million. The minimum investment level may increase (or reduce) in the future to the extent that a different amount is required to purchase the equivalent representation of securities on the BNZ Index. 26. The Investment Manager may hold up to an amount equivalent to the minimum investment level in cash (including both free and equitised cash). This threshold may be exceeded in the following circumstances: • for up to ten business days preceding a MSCI Structural Change or for up to three business days following a significant new investment; 5 • for up to three business days after a MSCI Structural Change; • for up to ten business days prior to a pending withdrawal in respect of which it has received a withdrawal request. 27. In addition to any funds held by the Investment Manager, the Trustee may hold up to NZ$2 million in cash. This threshold may be exceeded in the following circumstances: • for up to ten business days if there are withdrawals pending in respect of which it has received a withdrawal request; or • for up to three business days if the excess results from a significant new investment. 28. At all times, there is a limit on the total cash (including cash held by the Trustee and free and equitised cash held by the Investment Manager) of 5% of the total Fund (except if there is a significant withdrawal or investment). 29. The Investment Manager will use best endeavours to equitise all cash, subject to futures contract size constraints. 30. The following futures contracts are used: Country Contract Australia SPI200 Canada S&P/TSE60 Japan Topix Germany DAX United Kingdom FTSE100 United States S&P500 31. In the event that alternative futures contracts in one or more markets enable improved tracking of the BNZ Index, or that one or more of the above contracts ceases to exist, the Investment Manager will use such alternative contract or contracts. Dividends 32. The Investment Manager will receive the dividend (and other income) distributions from the securities in which funds are invested and will hold these as part of the cash pool, subject to the terms of paragraph 25 above. 33. The Investment Manager will not elect to participate in any dividend reinvestment plan. Foreign Currencies 34. The Investment Manager may enter into spot foreign exchange contracts where these are necessary in order to purchase or sell the foreign currencies necessary to 6 invest in BNZ Index securities. These contracts are not speculative and are settled within two business days. Suspension of subscriptions and withdrawals 35. Clause 18.7 of the Trust Deed enables the Fund to suspend the payment of benefits relating to withdrawal requests. The Fund has not previously suspended withdrawals. The Fund also has the power under clause 3.2 of the Trust Deed to refuse any application for membership without giving reasons. The Fund has never exercised this power. 36. The Fund will only suspend withdrawals or subscriptions in the following exceptional circumstances: • if the volume of withdrawals is too large to be processed; or • if the volume of withdrawals exceeds the immediately available funds; or • trading on the relevant equity markets has been suspended. 37. Any suspension will only be for three business days unless the exceptional circumstance giving rise to the need to suspend is beyond the control of the Trustee and Investment Manager, in which case the suspension will only be for such period as is strictly necessary for the Trustee and/or the Investment Manager to recover from that event. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The Fund will not be resettled in order to enhance the performance of the Fund or to minimise losses of the Fund in any way. b) Subject to condition (a), if the Fund is resettled this Ruling will continue to apply until resettlement. If the Fund is resettled this Ruling shall not apply from the date of resettlement. c) The Fund is an investment vehicle primarily for investment into by superannuation funds which are themselves either: (i) widely-held investment vehicles for direct investment by natural persons or, (ii) vehicles for investment (directly or indirectly) by other superannuation funds that are widely-held vehicles for direct investment by natural persons. d) The Fund is registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. e) All investors in the Fund who are not natural persons are registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. 7 f) The existing binding private ruling for the Fund (BR Prv 04/28) remains in force and continues to apply in all respects to the Arrangement. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The Fund is a “superannuation fund” as that term is defined in section OB 1. • The Fund is a “qualifying trust” as that term is defined in section OB 1. • Investors are not assessable to income tax on withdrawals from the Fund, by virtue of section HH 3(5). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2007. This Ruling is signed by me on the 30 th day of June 2004.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 04/12 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by The Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners (“the College”). Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CB 9(d) of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of the Payments (which are made monthly) by the College to the Registrars, for the Registrars’ participation in the Course, on terms and conditions that are materially the same as those contained in the following three documents (received by the Rulings Unit on 23 September 2003): • Terms and Conditions for Registrars and Seminar Attenders 2004: the terms and conditions to be agreed between the College and all Registrars enrolled in the General Practice Educational Programme (“GPEP”). • Letter of Appointment of Registrar 2004: the letter supplied to the Registrar, by the College, as an agreement of the respective obligations of each party. • Stage 1: GPEP Handbook 2004: the detailed handbook of terms, conditions, obligations and syllabus of the Course. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The College was formed in 1974, and obtained a Royal Charter in 1979. The mission of the College is to improve the health of all New Zealanders through the provision of high-quality general practice care. 2. The main purpose of the College is to provide post graduate general practice education to qualified doctors. 3. The objects and powers of the College (as set out in clause 5.1 of the 28 September 2002 document entitled “The Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners: Rules”) are: (a) To promote in all ways the highest standards in general practice in New Zealand; (b) To sustain and improve the professional competence of members of the medical profession who are engaged in general practice in New Zealand; (c) To encourage, strengthen, and engage in vocational training for general practice; (d) To conduct, direct, encourage, support or provide for continuing education of general practitioners; (e) To encourage and assist in the provision of a high standard of teaching and training for all undergraduate medical students in the field of general practice in New Zealand; (f) To promote activities that encourage the care of members and their families; (g) To encourage and provide for the training of future teachers of general practice; (h) To inform the public in New Zealand about general practice and primary health care issues; (i) To conduct, direct, encourage, support or provide for research in matters relating to general practice; (j) To publish and encourage publication of journals, reports and treatises on matters relating to general practice and allied subjects; (k) To grant diplomas and other certification of proficiency in general practice or any related subject, whether upon examination, thesis, outstanding work or upon other grounds which may be considered sufficient; (l) To establish a register of members of the College and to publish and revise the same from time to time; (m) To acquire, establish, provide and maintain such land and buildings as are deemed necessary and to deal with or dispose of the same with a view to promoting the objects of the College; (n) To acquire and receive property of any kind whether by way of gift, devise, bequest or otherwise howsoever to be applied solely towards the objects of the College provided that no portion thereof shall be paid or transferred directly or indirectly by way of profit to members of the College, but this shall not prevent a member being reimbursed for professional services; 2 (o) To apply annual dues received from members to defray the expenses of the College, and for such other objects as may be deemed proper by the Council; and (p) To undertake all such other lawful acts and things as are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the foregoing objects. 4. The College runs the GPEP created from the objectives of the College and based on the College’s commitment to maintaining and supporting standards of excellence among general practitioners. It is viewed as a significant part of a comprehensive cycle of vocational and professional education provided by the College and results in a Fellow of the Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners (“FRNZCGP”) qualification. 5. The Course is a 40 week practice-based training course established by the College as one part of its GPEP. The 40 weeks are divided into two attachments of 20 weeks. The Course is placed at “year nine” of a doctor’s standard educational path to gaining the FRNZCGP qualification. The GPEP is regarded as encompassing years seven to eleven of this “path”. 6. It is stated by the College (at page 10 of the Stage 1: GPEP 2004 Handbook) that the general aims of the Course are to: • Improve the health of New Zealanders through the provision of a GPEP which achieves a level of competence sufficient to maintain independent general practice; • Promote high standards of general practice in New Zealand by ensuring those entering general practice are vocationally trained; • Ensure Registrars understand the principles of general practice; • Develop and foster a group of general practice teachers and teaching practices; and • Foster an understanding of general practice within the medical profession and primary care purchasers. 7. The Course involves various aspects of training that a Registrar is to complete. Essentially, a Registrar is assigned to a “teaching practice”. Each teaching practice is a general practice medical centre for which the College has contracted with a general practitioner to be the Registrar’s teacher. The general practitioner teacher (“the Teacher”) holds vocational registration and is paid by the College under a separate contract. 8. The standard week for a Registrar under the Course is broken up as follows: • 8 half days per week attendance at the teaching practice to which they are assigned, consisting of: 3 - Patient contact. The conditions in respect of this are that a Registrar is to participate in between 5 and 13 patient consultations per half day. In the early weeks of the attachment, to relieve possible pressure on a Registrar, each consultation is to be for a generous period of 20-30 minutes. - The Registrar having at least three hours of direct contact time with the teacher per week, to include discussion, observation, review and feedback. It is essential that there be a minimum of a one hour and 30 minute uninterrupted block between the Teacher and the Registrar per week. • 2 half days attending seminars and workshops that are provided and organised by the College. Registrars are required to “satisfactorily” attend and participate in these seminars and workshops, and are responsible for organising/presenting part of the programme within these seminars and workshops. 9. A Registrar does not receive any payment from the Teacher, but receives the Payments from the College allocated from the funding the College receives from the Clinical Training Agency (“CTA”). The total dollar value of the Payments is as follows (Registrars being paid monthly amounts during the period of the Course the aggregate of which equals that total amount): For the Forty Week Course Annualised (before tax) 1. $35,035 $44,600 2. $36,400 $46,700 10. Whether the Payments are set at the first or second level is dependent on the level of prior medical experience of a Registrar. However, these amounts are set at a level to provide for the maintenance of the Registrars’ standard of living while undertaking the Course. The Payments are at a level lower than that which a doctor with similar experience in appropriate employment would earn during the period of the Course. 11. A doctor who wishes to attend the Course as a Registrar applies to the College at the appropriate time. From the total number of applicants, the College undertakes a selection process to accept only the number of Registrars for which it has funding. 12. The criteria by which Registrars are selected are merit-based, the College taking the perspective of selecting Registrars who will benefit the community in the long term. These criteria include: • The intention to enter general practice; • Experience in various areas of medicine; 4 • A demonstrated commitment to general practice addressing priority health areas; • A demonstrated commitment to general practice addressing rural health issues; • A demonstrated commitment to general practice addressing Maori health issues; and • A demonstrated commitment to teaching medical students and colleagues. 13. The College initiates an agreement with each individual doctor that is to be agreed before the doctor becomes a Registrar in the Course. 14. The obligations of Registrars are contained in the Terms and Conditions for Registrars and Seminar Attenders 2004, which include (among others) that the Registrar: • Satisfactorily attends, and participates in, 80% of the seminars and workshops; • Completes the “attachment” to teaching practices, and the assessments thereon; • Be involved in patient contact, by having 5 to 13 consultations with patients per half day; and • Undertakes review sessions with the attachment teacher each day. 15. In exchange for undertaking the above, the Registrars receive from the College the Payments. 16. The College Council is responsible for setting the educational philosophy and mission statement for its GPEP. 17. With regard to the Course content, the College has developed a curriculum for general practice training in consultation with College Members and Fellows and with the CTA to ensure that Government health priority areas are reflected in the educational programmes. 18. The College determines, in consultation with its Registrars, the methods of delivery for its programme for Stage I. The content of seminars and workshops is based on the syllabus for the Course and the specific learning needs of Registrars. The College determines the structure of the programme also. Materials for the programme are provided by the College and are purchased from the funding provided by the CTA. Seminars and workshops are held on premises hired by the College for that purpose. 19. Each Registrar’s activities while undertaking the Course reflect the agreement reached between the Registrar and their Teacher as to how the Course syllabus 5 will, in their view, be best achieved for that Registrar. Each Registrar’s activities are therefore designed to enable them to implement their agreed learning programme. A Registrar’s performance of these activities may assist the operation of their Teacher’s practice, but the activities are not designed to achieve this. 20. The Course is designed to teach Registrars to translate prior learning to a community based, primary health team context, as well as to teach them new skills in relation to (amongst other things) the clinical and business management needs of general practice. 21. The College is responsible for setting the Primex examination (sat at the end of the Course) and, in doing so, sets the standards for entry into Stage II and ultimately for vocational registration. The College also determines the structure and timing of the teaching programme. Furthermore the College determines the outputs of Registrars in terms of assignments, research projects, presentations and other learning activities. 22. The College selects Teachers to the programme who meet a number of specific criteria. These include holding general registration with the Medical Council, being a Fellow of the College, and being assessed by the Regional Director as being competent and able to provide excellent education to a trainee. The Teachers are employed by the College to provide teaching within the calendar year of the programme. All Teachers must undertake ongoing professional development activities whilst they remain a Teacher. 23. Regional directors (employed by the College) are responsible for maintaining contact with the Teachers during the programme and resolving any difficulties that may arise. They do so primarily through meetings and practice visits with Teachers. The regional directors are kept informed by Teachers on the progress of Registrars. 24. The College devotes the majority of its resources (staff, funding and other assets) to the administration and running of the GPEP and the continuing education of doctors in general practice. Over 50% of the College’s total income and expenditure for the year ended March 2004 was directly attributable to the GPEP alone. Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: a) The Payments made to the Registrars under the Arrangement are not grants made under regulations made under section 193 of the Education Act 1964, section 303 of the Education Act 1989, or any enactment in substitution for those sections. 6 How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the condition stated above, the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: • The Payments made to the Registrars under the Arrangement are exempt income under section CB 9(d). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 January 2004 until 31 December 2009. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29 th day of July 2004.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 04/13 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Air New Zealand Limited (“Air New Zealand”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 3, CD 4, CD 5, CH 3, CI 1 and CI 2(1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the accruing by a Member of the Air New Zealand Airpoints Programme of Airpoints Dollars provided by Air New Zealand as a result of expenditure incurred by the Member’s employer on the Member’s work related travel (including Airpoints Dollars derived from the conversion of airpoints earned under Air New Zealand’s previous airpoints scheme in respect of work related travel), and the redemption of those Airpoints Dollars for air travel and other rewards (“Rewards”). The Arrangement does not include employees of Air New Zealand and its subsidiaries (as they are not entitled to accrue Airpoints Dollars in respect of work related travel). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Capitalised terms are defined in the Airpoints Members’ Guide as provided to the Commissioner on 28 September 2004. 1. Air New Zealand currently operates an airpoints scheme, but plans to implement some major changes to the way in which it operates. The proposed new form of the scheme is referred to in this Ruling as the Programme (“the Programme”). Under the Programme, Airpoints Dollars will accrue to Members by reference to the value of the fare paid and region of the world travelled, and Airpoints Dollars will have a value identical to dollars on redemption for Rewards. Airpoints Dollars may also accrue to Members from expenditure incurred on goods and services sold by scheme partners (“Partners”), for example hotels and hire car companies. 2. Airpoints Dollars accruing to or accumulated by a Member can be used by them to purchase an equivalent dollar value of travel or to purchase other Air New Zealand products (such as Koru Club membership), or hotel accommodation, travel insurance, car hire and other rewards (“Rewards”). 3. The new terms and conditions of the Programme will be contained in the Airpoints Members’ Guide as provided to the Commissioner on 28 September 2004 (“the Terms and Conditions”). Employees of Air New Zealand’s commercial customers 4. Employees of Air New Zealand’s commercial customers may accrue Airpoints Dollars on travel undertaken for work purposes and paid for by their employer. The employer may pay for this travel by paying Air New Zealand for the tickets which are issued to the employee, or by reimbursing the employee for payments made by them. Any such employees wishing to accrue Airpoints Dollars would first need to become an Airpoints Member. 5. Airpoints Dollars accrue to Members by virtue of a Member’s individual membership. The employer may pay the $50 membership fee, by either reimbursing the employee or paying on behalf of the individual. 6. Members’ employers will not provide any consideration to Air New Zealand for Airpoints Dollars provided to those Members. Air New Zealand will not provide discounts (other than an ordinarily available discount for corporate customers provided for reasons unrelated to Airpoints Dollars) to corporate customers who request that Airpoints Dollars not be issued to their employees in respect of work related travel. 7. Employers have no influence over the Airpoints Dollars to be provided to Members (except to the extent that they purchase air travel). Airpoints Dollars will accrue to Members on the basis provided for in the Terms and Conditions, regardless of whether travel is undertaken for private purposes or for work related purposes and regardless of who pays for the travel. Airpoints Dollars accrue and are redeemed for Rewards on the same basis for any Member of the Programme, irrespective of the Member’s employer. Airpoints Membership 8. Airpoints Membership is available to residents of all countries. 9. The Membership joining fee is a cost of NZ$50.00 for New Zealand residents and AU$50.00 for Australian Members. Residents of all other countries will be charged the local currency equivalent of NZ$50.00. This fee may not be paid for using Airpoints Dollars and must be paid for in cash. 10. Complimentary Membership is available to eligible first class and business class passengers who have paid for and travelled first class or business class on Air New Zealand Operated Flights for international Sectors. Complimentary Membership is available to current fully paid-up members of Air New Zealand Koru Club. 11. Each Member may maintain only one Account. Membership is not transferable. 2 12. No individual Member’s Account information or details will be discussed or amended or transacted unless the Member’s correct Membership number along with their Personal Access Code is first quoted. 13. The Membership Card is used to assist in the earning of Airpoints Dollars and to obtain access to or the provision of Rewards. The Member agrees that his/her signing of a Card and/or quoting his/her Membership number to Air New Zealand or to any of its Partners, employees or agents for the purposes of the Airpoints Programme means that he/she has read and understood the Terms and Conditions of the Airpoints Programme and accepts them. 14. Air New Zealand reserves the right to cancel a Member’s Membership in the Programme at any time without notice and without giving a reason for so doing. Air New Zealand will not provide any consideration for Airpoints Dollars earned but not redeemed at the time of termination of Membership. 15. Membership will terminate on the death of a Member. Airpoints Dollars or any other benefits earned but not redeemed at the time of death will be cancelled with no consideration. Transfer of Airpoints Dollars on the death of a Member is permitted in the situation set out in clause 1.4.5 of the Terms and Conditions (see paragraphs 25 to 27 below). Earning Airpoints Dollars 16. Airpoints Dollars may be earned through expenditure on Air New Zealand and Partner Airline flights and on goods and services purchased from non-airline Partners (including car rental, hotel accommodation, GlobalPlus accounts, travel insurance and currency exchange). Transfer of credit card points/ credits into Airpoints Dollars is available in some cases. Airpoints Dollars are provided by Air New Zealand regardless of whether the entitlement arises from the purchase of Air New Zealand or Partners’ goods and services. Using Airpoints Dollars 17. Rewards may be paid for using Airpoints Dollars. One Airpoints Dollar has the equivalent value of $1 in relation to the number of Airpoints Dollars required to acquire Rewards. A combination of Airpoints Dollars and cash for the acquisition of a Reward is not permitted, unless otherwise specified in writing by Air New Zealand. 18. Airpoints Dollars may be used to obtain Reward flights with Air New Zealand and Partner Airlines. Any Reward ticket which is cancelled and is refundable will be refunded by a re-crediting of Airpoints Dollars. Taxes, levies, or surcharges cannot be paid for using Airpoints Dollars and must be paid for in cash. The only exception to this is where the published fare is inclusive of taxes, levies and/or surcharges, for example on Air New Zealand Operated Flights within New Zealand or where the published fare is inclusive of insurance and fuel charges. 3 19. Non-flight and non-airline Rewards are available, subject to the applicable Partner’s terms and conditions where those Rewards are not provided by Air New Zealand. Rewards include Koru Club membership, car hire, hotel accommodation, holiday packages, and travel insurance. GlobalPlus Credit Card customers may have the ability to redeem their Airpoints Dollars on a limited range of other non-airline products (such as holiday passes, wine and CD vouchers). Non-convertibility 20. Under the Terms and Conditions, Airpoints Dollars and Rewards cannot be redeemed, sold, assigned, gifted or otherwise transferred by a Member for cash or other consideration. The relevant clauses of the Terms and Conditions in this respect are as follows: Clause 3.1.22 of the Terms and Conditions states: In accepting a Reward, you agree that (subject to these Terms and Conditions and in particular the Gifting provisions and clauses 3.4.3.12 and 3.4.4.11) you won’t combine any Rewards with anyone else or sell, assign or otherwise transfer the right to a Reward to any person.

If you redeem a Reward in conjunction with any other loyalty programme (where such programme has our consent to use Airpoints Dollars) you agree that you won’t combine any Rewards with anyone else or sell, assign or otherwise transfer Rewards for Cash or anything else. Air New Zealand and Air New Zealand Link are not responsible for Reward offers by Partners or their conditions, or for Partners’ performance or provision of such Rewards. Clause 4.1.9 of the Terms and Conditions states: You must not receive any Cash or other consideration as payment for any Rewards you gift. Clause 9.7 of the Terms and Conditions states: Notwithstanding any other provision in these Terms and Conditions or the terms and conditions of any other loyalty programme that is offered by a Partner and/or authorised by Air New Zealand, you can’t redeem for Cash or sell your Airpoints Dollars and/or Rewards or assign or transfer them for Cash or any other consideration.

Clause 13.6 of the Terms and Conditions states: Airpoints Dollars are not convertible into Cash. Any Rewards offered by Partners or any use of Airpoints Dollars in conjunction either with the Programme or with any other loyalty programme that we have authorised the use of Airpoints Dollars in conjunction with, are subject to the restriction that you can’t sell, assign or transfer any Rewards or Airpoints Dollars for Cash or any other consideration. 21. If a Member cancels a refundable Ticket, then in accordance with clause 3.1.15 the refund will be a re-credit of the Airpoints Dollars to the Member’s Account. Airpoints Dollars may also be re-credited if an Upgrade for which Airpoints Dollars were redeemed is not available. Gifting 22. Gifting is the process whereby a Member authorises the deduction of Airpoints Dollars from his/her account where such Airpoints Dollars are redeemed to provide a person resident in the same Household as the Member with a Ticket for Reward Travel or for Non-Airline Rewards. Companion Tickets may not be Gifted. 23. Gold Elite Members (Members who have accrued a specified number of Airpoints Dollars from qualifying flights) are additionally entitled to nominate as giftees two individual persons who do not need to reside in the same Household as the Gold Elite Member. 24. Air New Zealand will monitor each Member’s Gifting Register to ensure that no fraudulent activities occur. Transfer of Airpoints Dollars 25. Transfer of Airpoints Dollars between Members’ Accounts is only permitted in the following circumstances. 26. Clause 1.4.5.2 of the Terms and Conditions provides, subject to certain qualifications, for Members who have a joint GlobalPlus Credit Card, joint GlobalPlus Home Loan Account or a joint BNZ Gold Credit Card to transfer 50% of the Airpoints Dollars accrued via these accounts to the other person involved in the joint account in the situation of a marriage separation or divorce. 27. Clause 1.4.5.3 of the Terms and Conditions provides, subject to certain qualifications, on the death of a Member who has a joint GlobalPlus Home Loan Account, joint BNZ credit card or joint BNZ Gold Credit Card, for the transfer of 100% of the Airpoints Dollars accrued via these accounts to the other person involved in the joint account. 5 Combining Airpoints Dollars 28. A Member may be permitted by Air New Zealand, at Air New Zealand’s sole discretion, to combine his/her Airpoints Dollars with another Member’s Airpoints Dollars for the purpose of booking a rental car Reward and/or a hotel Reward for a period in each case of two or more consecutive days, provided that each Member has sufficient Airpoints Dollars to redeem a rental car Reward for a minimum of one day and/or a hotel Reward for a minimum of one night. Monitoring 29. Air New Zealand will monitor Airpoints Membership Accounts and the Programme. In particular, clause 10.3 of the Terms and Conditions states: If you commit fraud in connection with Airpoints Dollars or abuse your Airpoints Dollars accumulation or Rewards use or breach these Terms and Conditions, you’ll be subject to appropriate administrative and/or legal action by Air New Zealand that includes, but is not limited to, Membership termination, Membership suspension, the forfeiture of all accumulated Airpoints Dollars and unused Rewards and an action to recover the monetary value of the Airpoints Dollars and credits concerned. Termination 30. A Member may terminate his/her Membership in the Programme at any time by giving notice in writing and returning the Membership Card to Air New Zealand. 31. Partners may discontinue their participation in the Programme and their provision of Rewards at any time without notice. 32.

Under no circumstances are the Terms and Conditions interchangeable with those of the Air New Zealand Koru Club or any other club or loyalty programme operated by Air New Zealand or any of its Partners. Membership of the Programme does not give access to the benefits of any other Air New Zealand club, facility or loyalty programme unless so stated in the conditions of membership of such other club, facility or loyalty programme. 6 Changes to the Programme 34. The Terms and Conditions may be amended at any time, pursuant to clause 9.1 of the Terms and Conditions. Ruling not applicable to other loyalty programmes 35. This Ruling does not consider or rule on the tax treatment of airpoints under any Air New Zealand scheme prior to the introduction of the Programme. 36. This Ruling does not consider or rule on the tax treatment of any other loyalty programme to which, in accordance with clauses 13.5 and 13.6 of the Terms and Conditions, Air New Zealand has given written consent to use Airpoints Dollars in accordance with the terms and conditions of that other loyalty programme. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: (a) Under no circumstances will the Terms and Conditions allow Airpoints Dollars or Rewards (including any goods or services received from redeeming Rewards such as vouchers) to be redeemed for cash or sold, assigned or transferred by a Member for cash or other consideration. (b) In any circumstance where a Reward is cancelled or unavailable or where for any other reason the Member is entitled to a refund of Airpoints Dollars, the refund is by way of a re-crediting to the Member’s Account with the Airpoints Dollars redeemed by the Member for that Reward. (c) Membership of the Programme is a contract between a Member and Air New Zealand. Employers are not entitled to enter into that contract on behalf of their employees. (d) The membership fee payable to Air New Zealand constitutes a legal liability owed by the applicant to Air New Zealand. (e) Where the Member is an employee of a Partner or a Partner Airline, the Member does not redeem Airpoints Dollars for any Reward offered by that Partner or Partner Airline. (f) Where the employer has either paid the membership fee on behalf of the employee or reimbursed the employee for that fee, the receipt or the possibility of the receipt by the employee of Airpoints Dollars or Rewards is not taken into account by the employer in determining that employee’s remuneration (whether by the relative reduction of remuneration or otherwise). (g) Where the employer has either paid the membership fee on behalf of the employee or reimbursed the employee for that fee, the employer, when 7 purchasing travel in respect of which that employee derives Airpoints Dollars, does not pay substantially more for that travel than the cost of equivalent air travel services with a more than incidental purpose of the provision of Airpoints Dollars or Rewards to that employee. (h) No changes to the Programme are made pursuant to clause 9.1 of the Terms and Conditions that are material to the tax treatment of Airpoints Dollars and Rewards derived by employees in respect of work related travel. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • No gross income arises to the Member under sections CD 3, CD 4, CD 5, or CH 3 when they receive Airpoints Dollars or Rewards. • The employer of the Member is not liable under sections CI 1 or CI 2(1) for FBT on any benefits obtained by the Member as a result of receiving Airpoints Dollars or Rewards. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 3 November 2004 to 2 November 2007. This Ruling is signed by me on the 3 rd day of November 2004.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 05/01 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited as Trustee of the AMP Superannuation Tracker Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BD 2, EE 1, EE 2, EF 1, EF 2 and HH 3(5). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the redemption of Units in the AMP Superannuation Tracker Fund (“the Fund”) by members who receive securities for their redemption, and those shares are trading stock or revenue account property of that member. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below: The AMP Superannuation Tracker Fund The Fund 1. The AMP Superannuation Tracker Fund (“the Fund”) is a registered superannuation scheme under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. The Fund is not listed on the New Zealand stock market (“NZX”). 2. The Fund has been designed to provide members with a simple and cost effective method of investing in a portfolio with a performance broadly representative of the New Zealand share market. 3. The Trustee of the Fund is the New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited (“the Trustee”) although the Trust Deed contains provisions for the retirement or removal and replacement of the Trustee. 4. The Manager of the Fund is AMP Investment Management (N.Z.) Ltd (“the Manager”). The Manager invests the investors’ contributions into the Fund. The Investment Manager/ Promoter of the Fund is AMP Capital Investors (New Zealand) Ltd (“the Investment Manager”). The Investment Manager purchases securities in the Index, described more particularly in paragraphs 6- 8 below. Both the Manager and the Investment Manager are owned by AMP Ltd, incorporated in New South Wales. 5. The Fund was established, as a wholesale registered superannuation scheme, principally for the purpose of paying benefits to persons who are trustees of superannuation schemes registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 and who elect to invest in the Fund. Investment policy 6. According to the Members’ Booklet of the Fund, dated 29 June 2001: The objective of the Scheme is to track the Russell/Ord Minnett \[JB Were\] Tradeable Index (the Tradeable Index) as closely as practical. This will be achieved by holding constituent company securities which, as far as possible, match the composition of the Tradeable Index.... The Manager and the Trustee can adopt such other index of securities as they agree from time to time. 7. In accordance with the current Members’ Booklet (not being materially different to the draft provided to the Commissioner on 17 January 2005), the Manager and the Trustee have agreed to adopt the NZSX 50 Index (“the Index”) administered by New Zealand Exchange Limited. The transition to tracking the Index will occur on 31 January 2005 (refer to paragraph 24(h) below), and the Fund will commence tracking the Index on 1 February 2005. Apart from permitted investments of the cash pool, the Fund will, commencing on 1 February 2005, only invest in the securities that make up the Index and will continue to track the Index as near as practicable irrespective of whether the sale of the shares will give rise to a profit or loss. 8. Despite the Trust Deed providing that the Manager and Trustee can invest in other Indexes, and apart from permitted investments of the cash pool, the Fund will, having made the transition to the Index, only invest in the securities that make up the Index. 9. The Fund is required to buy and sell shares as required to ensure that it continues to correspond as near as practicable to the Index. Such buying and selling will not be motivated by any intention to derive a profit or gain from such sales. In this regard, Clause 5.3.1A of the Trust Deed states: The Fund shall seek to track the Index by investing in Constituent Company Securities as near as practically possible to their weightings in the Index and the Trustee’s primary investment duty shall be to seek to achieve this purpose. All other investment duties (express or implied) shall be construed subject to this duty. The Fund and the Trustee shall not have an intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling Constituent Company Securities. 10. The Trustee and the Manager have confirmed that, to the best of their knowledge, the Fund has complied with the previous rulings (BR Prv 02/04, withdrawn from 30 January 2005, and BR Prd 02/09, withdrawn on 3 February 2005) relating to the Fund. Adjustments to the Fund 2 11. The Fund is re-balanced in the following circumstances: (a) The Fund’s portfolio is monitored regularly, being daily, to ensure that it is tracking the Index. The reference to “Fund’s portfolio” means the Constituent Companies held by the Fund. (b) The Manager will re-balance the Fund to the Index following any adjustments to the Index. Such re-balancing will occur as soon as possible but in any case within three business days of a change to the composition of the Index. Management and operation of the Fund Borrowing 12. Clause 10.3.2 of the Trust Deed provides that: The Trustee may not borrow any money for the purposes of the Plan otherwise than for the purpose of satisfying payment of any Administration Expenses in which case the Trustee may borrow money on terms considered appropriate by the Trustee and may charge any or all of the Plan to secure the repayment of any moneys borrowed. Hedging 13. This Fund only tracks shares quoted on the NZX and hence the Fund will purchase shares in New Zealand dollars. Accordingly, the Fund will not be exposed to foreign exchange risks. Contributions to the Fund 14. Contributions to the Fund will be by way of parcels of securities or cash. Cash may be accepted in the following circumstances: (a) where there is a contemporaneous redemption against which the contribution can be netted off by receiving cash into the Fund and then paying it out on the redemption; or (b) to the extent the application cannot be made in securities due to uneven parcel sizes provided the cash pool remains below 0.5% of the total assets of the Fund and, except where the situations listed in paragraph 16 below arise or where the cash is committed to fund an obligation that was known at the time of receipt of the subscription, the cash is converted to Constituent Company Securities as soon as practicably possible. 15. Members wishing to contribute cash may be required to purchase a parcel of securities through a separate arrangement with the Manager, or through other intermediaries (such as brokers and financial advisors). Cash investments held by the Fund (“cash pool”) 3 16. The proportion of the Fund’s assets to be held as the cash pool will not exceed what is strictly necessary in order to fulfil the purposes of the cash pool (as stated in paragraph 17 of this Ruling), and will not in any event exceed 0.5% of the total assets of the Fund, except if: (i) the Fund receives a large cash contribution (provided the cash is invested as soon as possible and in any event within three business days); or (ii) a member requests a large cash redemption (provided the cash is distributed within three business days of the sale of securities); or (iii) the Fund receives a large cash inflow from or in respect of a Constituent Company, such as a distribution due to a pro-rata buyback or takeover or a change in the Constituent Companies of the Index (provided the cash is invested as soon as possible and in any event within three business days); or (iv) the Fund holds cash as a result of disposing of securities in the course of and for the purposes of winding up the Fund. 17. The purpose of the cash pool as set out in Clause 5.2.5 of the Trust Deed is: The Trustee may maintain or invest in Cash in any amount representing up to five percent (5%) of the Current Fund Value at any time, PROVIDED THAT the investment in Cash shall only be used to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund and to reduce the number of transactions required to be made or to facilitate redemptions from time to time, but may not be used by the Manager or the Trustee to increase the performance of the Fund by maximising the holding of securities considered to be likely to give a high return or minimising the holding of securities considered likely to give a low return. 18. “Cash”, as defined in Clause 3 of the Trust Deed includes: deposits, or negotiable instruments, in each case having maturities which are not later than the times at which the proceeds of realisation thereof are expected to be required, and on which there is full indefeasible liability of: (a) a New Zealand registered bank (having the meaning given to that term by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989) approved by the Manager for the purpose; or (b) the New Zealand government. 19. The size and operation of the cash pool will be strictly managed so as to reflect its threefold purpose of: (a) allowing funds to accumulate to an appropriate amount for investment, and (b) minimising the number of equity security sale and purchase transactions, and 4 (c) managing the liquidity of the Fund in respect of meeting its anticipated liabilities and withdrawals. 20. When the cash held by the Investment Manager reaches the minimum investment level, it will be applied to acquire securities to track the Index as soon as possible and in any event within three business days. The Manager has advised that the minimum amount required to enable the purchase of every security in the Index in a marketable and economically sensible sized parcel is approximately $150,000, but may reduce where a lower amount can permit transaction costs to be maintained at the current level (or a level not materially different). 21. It is not envisaged that the amount of cash required to enable the purchase of securities in a marketable and economically sensible sized parcel will change from $150,000 unless there are improvements in share trading systems that make it economic to trade in smaller parcels of shares. This would be beneficial for the Fund as it would be able to invest surplus cash sooner and keep the cash levels in the Fund at a lower level than might otherwise be the case if the Fund is confined to a predetermined minimum parcel size. 22. The Fund does not normally hold cash equivalents. Rather, the cash amounts are normally held in bank deposits and interest is paid on these deposits. Dividend reinvestment 23. In the event of a dividend reinvestment option being available to the Trustee, the Manager will only accept such an option if it is consistent with tracking the Index. In all other cases, the Manager will decline the option and will always accept the cash dividend that will be immediately allocated to members. Events that trigger acquisitions or realisations 24. There are certain reasons or events when investments held by the Fund will have to be bought or sold. The Trustee will only dispose of securities (other than cash pool investments): (a) If the Fund is voluntarily or involuntarily wound up or if the Trustee is replaced (and this of itself means that there is a technical disposal of securities to the new Trustee and the new Trustee assumes ownership of the same securities held by the previous Trustee immediately before the Trustee is replaced). (b) If there is a change in the Index composition and the composition of the Fund no longer tracks the Index or when the Fund is otherwise required to buy and sell securities to maintain tracking. (c) When transferring securities to a member if the member redeems Units for securities. 5 (d) Where there is no option available to receive dividends in the form of cash, and dividends are received in the form of bonus securities and are converted to cash. (e) To satisfy a legal claim against the Fund or Trustee or to meet expenses of the Fund, but only to the extent to which such a claim or expense cannot be met from existing resources. (f) If a member or members require cash on redemption of Units and such redemption cannot be met from the cash pool. (g) Where securities are purchased in error. (h) As a consequence of the Fund ceasing tracking the Russell/JB Were Tradeable Index and commencing tracking the NZSX 50 Index. The Fund will cease tracking the Tradeable Index on 31 January 2005. As near as possible to the close of trading on 31 January 2005, the Fund will dispose of and acquire all securities as necessary to commence tracking the Index on 1 February 2005, and will do so as soon as possible. If the Fund is unable to dispose of or acquire any necessary securities due to the illiquidity of those securities, the Fund will hold any such securities or cash for only such time as is strictly necessary in order to dispose of or acquire the necessary securities. Up until the time that the Fund ceases to track the Tradeable Index and begins to dispose of and acquire all securities as necessary to track the Index, the Fund will continue to operate in accordance with the previous Ruling BR Prv 02/04 as if that Ruling had not been withdrawn, and BR Prd 02/09. Redemption of Units 25. A member is only able to dispose of their Units by redeeming them. A member may redeem Units subject to the conditions in Clause 8 of the Trust Deed. Clause 8 requires redemptions to be for amounts of at least $10,000 or all of a member’s Units and no member is to be left with less than $100,000 worth of Units. The redemption can be in the form of cash and/or cash equivalents and/or securities. 26. Redemptions are usually made through the transfer of Constituent Company Securities (equal to the value of the Units being redeemed and may also contain a small cash balancing item) but may, in the circumstances described below, be made in cash. 27. In the following circumstances a redemption will be made in cash (where that cash is not committed for other purposes): (a) where there is a contemporaneous contribution against which the redemption can be matched; or (b) where the cash is sufficient to fund the redemption in full, that redemption will be made from the cash pool; and 6 (c) where the cash is not sufficient to fund the redemption in full, the balance of the redemption will be made from securities in the proportions that will ensure that the Fund will continue to match the composition and weighting of the Index as near as practicably possible. 28. Clause 8.3.2 of the Trust Deed provides: Every Benefit payable under this clause 8.3 shall be determined by multiplying the Redemption Price calculated on the date of acceptance by the Manager by the number of Units redeemed and become payable to the Member not later than ten (10) Business Days following the date on which the Manager receives the Benefit request or on any later redemption date requested by the Member. 29. Redemption Price is defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed to mean the “Current Unit Value” less the “Exit Fee”. 30. Current Unit Value is defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed as: ... on any date an amount that is arrived at by dividing the Current Fund Value by the number of Units on issue on such date ... 31. The Current Fund Value is defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed as: The amount calculated by adding as at any time when a valuation is required in relation to the Fund: (a) the total of the market value of all Cash, units in the AMP Investments' Tracker Fund and investments of the Fund determined pursuant to clause 6; and (b) the income of the Fund due but not yet received; and (c) any other amounts which, in the opinion of the Manager, should be included for the purposes of making a fair and reasonable determination of the value of the Fund having due regard to duly accepted accounting practice and accounting principles from time to time; and deducting therefrom such amounts: (d) as are required to meet liabilities properly attributable to the Fund (actual or contingent and not otherwise allowed for in determining the value of any asset) to the extent that the Manager has decided that provision should be made in the accounts of the Plan; (e) as represent Administration Expenses payable by the Trustee or the Manager; and (f) which, in the opinion of the Manager, should be included for the purpose of making a fair and reasonable determination of the current value of the Fund having due regard to generally accepted accounting practice and accounting principles current from time to time. 32. Clause 3 of the Trust Deed provides that Market Value in relation to a Constituent Company Security in the Index means: ... its value as in the Index at any relevant time. 33. Exit Fee is defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed to mean: 7 ... such sum, if any, as the Manager in its absolute discretion may determine (either generally or in relation to a particular Benefit) to be a fair fee payable in relation to the relevant Benefit to provide for the likely per Unit cost of realising Assets to meet that Benefit, having regard to the Manager's estimate of the aggregate of all costs, charges, expenses, disbursements, commissions, brokerage and other usual fees which would be likely to be incurred in respect of the sale or disposal of Assets on the date of calculation of the Redemption Price of Assets to fund a Unit's Redemption Price were sold or disposed of on such date. Suspension of redemptions 34. Clause 8.5 of the Trust Deed provides that the Manager can suspend redemptions in certain circumstances up to a period not exceeding 20 business days. The Fund will not utilise the power to suspend the redemption of Units except in exceptional circumstances (where and to the extent that it is necessary to do so) being: (i) if the Fund is unable to convert sufficient assets into cash, to meet a redemption request; or (ii) if the market value of the Units at the time is not a true reflection of the actual value of the Units, due to a suspension in trading of any Constituent Company Securities on any exchange; or (iii) if, for reasons beyond its control, the Manager is unable to calculate the redemption price. Any such suspension will be for a maximum period of three business days, unless an exceptional circumstance occurs that is beyond the control of the Trustee and the Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund and/or the Manager to recover from that event. Utilisation of member expenses for Tax purposes 35. The Trust Deed has been amended to allow the Trustee to credit a Member’s Account with Units in recognition of any tax deduction that the Plan has received as a result of an election by that member under section DI 3(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Trust Deed was amended, by the Second Deed of Amendment dated 1 February 2002, by inserting Clause 12A. Sub-clause 12A.1, which is relevant for the purposes of the Ruling, provides that: Where a Member has made an election under section DI 3(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (“section DI 3(2)”) that any expenditure, which is incurred by the superannuation scheme for which the Member is a trustee (or, in respect of a superannuation scheme constituted under an Act of Parliament, the person appointed to administer the superannuation scheme), be treated as if it were expenditure incurred by the Plan and the Plan has received a tax deduction as a result of that election, the Trustee shall credit to the Member Account of the relevant Member such number of Units as the Trustee considers equitable to recognise such tax deduction. For the avoidance of doubt, the number of units to be issued in normal circumstances would be calculated by reference to the amount determined by dividing the amount of any tax benefit which the Manager considers arises from the tax deduction by the Issue Price applying on the Business Day on which the tax benefit is considered by the Manager to arise. 8 36. The Fund will always issue Units according to the above Clause and there will be no discretion as to whether the Fund will in fact issue Units in accordance with the above Clause. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following Conditions: a) The Fund is an investment vehicle primarily for investment into by superannuation funds which are themselves either: (i) widely-held investment vehicles for direct investment by natural persons or, (ii) vehicles for investment (directly or indirectly) by other superannuation funds that are widely-held vehicles for direct investment by natural persons. b) The Fund operates in accordance with its Trust Deed dated 10 February 1999, a Members’ Booklet not materially different to the draft provided to the Commissioner on 17 January 2005, the Deed of Arrangements dated 10 February 1999 (as amended on 27 August 2001), the Deed of Amendment dated 30 January 2002, and the Second Deed of Amendment dated 1 February 2002. c) The Fund is a registered superannuation scheme under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. d) The Fund only tracks the Index. e) Where cash is distributed on redemption its market value will be its nominal value. f) Where cash equivalents are distributed on redemption, the value of this distribution will be the market value of these cash equivalents. g) In determining the market value of a security at any time the last sale price for that security, as quoted on the New Zealand stock market at that time, shall be used. h) The Manager, in determining the Members’ entitlement to securities on redemption of Units in the Fund under clause 8.3 of the Trust Deed, shall use the market value of those securities at the valuation time (as defined in the Trust Deed). i) The formula for calculating the “Current Unit Value” as defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed will remain unaltered for the period of this ruling. 9 j) The amounts derived by the Member from the subsequent sale or disposal of securities received on redeeming Units in the Fund will be gross income of the Member. k) Members do not acquire Units in the Fund for the purpose of acquiring securities. l) Units in the Fund are not tradeable on a secondary market. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Pursuant to section HH 3(5) any amounts including securities received by members as a result of redemption of Units in the Fund will not be gross income of the member. • The cost of any securities acquired by a member on redemption of Units in the Fund is the market value of those Units at the valuation time of the units redeemed less any cash or cash equivalents received. • The market value of the Units redeemed is equal to the Redemption Price of those Units. • The cost of a security acquired by a member on the redemption of Units is an allowable deduction under section BD 2 and is deductible: • in full in the income year in which the Units are redeemed, if the member acquires the securities as trading stock for the purpose of section EE 1; and • in accordance with section EF 2 in the later of the income year in which the securities are disposed of and the income year in which the gross income is derived in respect of the disposition of the securities, if the member acquires the securities as revenue account property other than trading stock. 10 The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 31 January 2005 to 30 January 2008. This Ruling is signed by me on the 11 th day of February 2005. Howard Davis Senior Tax Counsel 11
1 PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 05/02 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by BNZ Investment Management Limited as Trustee (“the Trustee”) of the superannuation fund known as the BNZ 25 NZ Equity Index Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section HH 3(5) and the definitions of “superannuation fund” and “qualifying trust” in section OB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the operation by the Bank of New Zealand of a superannuation fund known as the BNZ 25 NZ Equity Index Fund (“the Fund”). The operation of the Fund is governed by the Trust Deed dated 24 February 1997 (“the Trust Deed”) as amended on 23 March 2001, 31 July 2002 and the Deed of Amendment which will be the same as, or not materially different from, the draft deed provided to the Commissioner on 21 June 2005 (“the Amending Trust Deed”). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below: 1. The Fund is registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989, as are the “retail” superannuation funds which invest in it. 2. The Sponsor of the Fund is the Bank of New Zealand. The Trustee is also the Manager of the Fund. 3. The Fund acts as a “wholesale” superannuation fund into which other “wholesale” and “retail” superannuation funds invest. The Fund also operates for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to the limited number of natural persons who invest directly in it. 4. Members of the Fund are only treated differently in relation to the application fees, issue price and exit price (to the extent that such prices change over time to reflect the change in value of the Fund) and costs associated with entry into, and maintenance of, the Fund. 5. The “retail” funds investing in the Fund are superannuation funds (both employee and personal) which have previously been (or may in future be) 2 established completely independently from the establishment of the Fund. For example, an existing BNZ “retail” fund—the Bank of New Zealand Future Lifestyle Plan—currently invests in the Fund. Superannuation funds other than superannuation funds established by or managed by the Bank of New Zealand have also invested in the Fund. 6. The Fund was established for the purposes of being a “wholesale” investment vehicle for other “wholesale” funds and “retail” superannuation funds and for the purposes of providing retirement benefits to the limited number of individual natural persons who invest directly in it. All the “wholesale” and “retail” superannuation funds which invest in the Fund have been or will be established for the purposes of ultimately providing retirement benefits for individual natural persons. 7. The Fund is a passive investment vehicle, investing only in a portfolio of equity securities each of which is listed on the New Zealand Stock Market (“NZSX”) operated by New Zealand Exchange Limited (“NZX”), together with a small cash pool. The Fund will be managed so as to track the composition of a set of listed equity securities which together form the constituent part of an Index known as the BNZ 25 Equity Index (“the Index”). The Index 8. The Index comprises up to 25 of the largest New Zealand equity securities listed on the NZSX, based on average weekly market capitalisation. The Fund will not be subject to any active management as such. Rather, it will be managed to track the composition of a set of listed equity securities that together form the constituent parts of the Index. The weighting of each security in the Index will reflect its respective market capitalisation at the relevant date. 9. The “home” exchange of each stock can be any of the “grey list” countries as they are defined in New Zealand tax law. If the equity security is listed on the NZSX and meets the other criteria, it will be included in the Index. There is no discretion as to whether a grey-list country security listed on the NZSX is included in the Index. The equity securities will normally be shares but there may also be convertible notes. 10. The market capitalisation for securities is calculated as follows: (a) securities that have the NZX as their “home” exchange will be calculated in accordance with the formula: number of shares (or convertible notes) on issue x closing price of the share (or convertible note) – where “number of shares (or convertible notes) on issue” does not include treasury stock; 3 (b) securities that have their “home” exchange outside New Zealand will be calculated in accordance with the formula: number of shares (or convertible notes) listed in New Zealand x closing price of the share (or convertible note) Cash investments of the Fund 11. Approximately 99% of the net asset value of the Fund will be invested in such investments as the Trustee considers necessary to track the Index. While the majority of available funds will be invested to track the Index, a “cash pool” of up to 1% of the net assets of the Fund will be maintained subject to the exceptions listed in condition (a) of the existing binding private ruling for the Fund (BR Prv 05/16). The pool is only invested in bank accounts or money market deposits. 12. Although it is not an objective of the Fund to invest in cash securities, the Fund may hold cash to facilitate easier administration of the Fund. In any event the cash pool will not exceed what is strictly necessary in order to fulfil the following purposes: (a) Allow for cash outflows due to expenses and net withdrawals. (b) Allow for net cash inflows from investments and dividends to accumulate to a level sufficient to minimise the transaction and administrative costs associated with analysing which stocks are to be purchased and making the necessary purchase orders. Index changes 13. Changes will only be made to the Index composition in the following circumstances: (a) At the end of each quarter (being a three month period ending on, respectively, 15 April, 15 July, 15 October and 15 January, a “quarter”), securities will be ranked according to their average weekly market capitalisation for the previous 6 month period (i.e., the 6 month period ending on the end of the month preceding the quarter end). If a security not previously included in the Index has risen at the end of the 6 month period above 21st position, that security will be included as a constituent security in the Index at the quarter end and the lowest ranked Index security held at the quarter end will be removed. If a security that is currently included in the Index at the quarter end has dropped below a ranking of 30th by the end of the 6 month period, that security will be removed as a constituent security from the Index and the highest ranked security at the quarter end not already included in the Index will be included. 4 (b) At the end of each quarter, securities are reviewed with regard to compliance with the necessary minimum liquidity requirements. In order to be included and to maintain inclusion in the Index, a constituent security must meet a minimum liquidity requirement. Liquidity is defined as the average daily trading volume (over a 6 month period leading up to the end of the month preceding the end of the relevant quarter after eliminating the highest and lowest months), expressed as a percentage of the total issued and quoted securities of the same class. The minimum liquidity measure for inclusion in the Index is 0.75% per month. In the event that there are not 25 securities that meet the liquidity requirement, the number of securities in the Index would be less than 25. This liquidity test does not apply to a new listing, which falls within the concessionary rule in paragraph (c) below, until the end of the second complete quarter following the quarter in which listing occurs. (c) If a security is listed on the NZSX for the first time, it will be included in the Index immediately if: (i) it ranks, in terms of market capitalisation, above 21st position (compared with other Index securities ranked according to their average weekly market capitalisation for the 6 month period ending with the month end preceding the previous quarter end); and (ii) at least 25 percent of the security is freely tradeable at the time of listing. For the purposes of calculating the market capitalisation of a security listed on the NZSX for the first time, the “closing price” of the security will be the undiscounted issue price, as advised to NZX, to be paid by investors who subscribe to the security’s public offering. The security previously ranked 25th within the Index at that time will be removed. If a security listed on the NZSX for the first time does not meet the 25% free float test at the time of listing but meets that 25% test at the end of the quarter in which listing occurs or the following quarter, it will be included in the Index at the relevant quarter end (subject to ranking above 21st at that time). Again, the security previously ranked 25th will be removed at that time. (d) If the Trustee recommends, and the independent monitor referred to in paragraph 19 agrees, then the Index must be altered to reflect a material change to NZX’s market capitalisation calculation rules. (e) If there is a merger, takeover offer, scheme of arrangement sanctioned by the High Court or other offer under the Takeovers Code for all of the issued securities of a company: 5 (i) If the merger, takeover, scheme of arrangement or other offer proceeds and as a result (regardless of whether it has 100% acceptance) less than 25% of the company’s securities are freely tradeable, the company’s securities will be removed from the Index; and (ii) The company’s securities will be immediately removed from the Index when the acquirer becomes entitled to, and an announcement is made that it will, proceed with compulsory acquisition. The highest ranked security not already in the Index at that time will be added. (f) If there is one or more partial offers under the Takeovers Code for control (50% or more) of a company included in the Index and at any time after such offer or offers less than 25% of the company’s securities are freely tradeable, the company’s securities will be removed from the Index. The highest ranked security not already in the Index at that time will be added. (g) If there is one or more partial offers under the Takeovers Code for less than 50% of a company included in the Index and at any time after such offer or offers less than 25% of the company’s securities are freely tradeable, the company’s securities will be removed from the Index. The highest ranked security not already in the Index at that time will be added. (h) If, under the Takeovers Code, a company’s shareholders approve an allotment of securities and, at any time after that approval is given, less than 25% of the company’s securities are freely tradeable, the company’s securities will be removed from the Index. The highest ranked security not already in the Index at that time will be added. (i) If a company’s securities are acquired under rule 7(e) of the Takeovers Code and, at any time after the securities are acquired, less than 25% of the company’s securities are freely tradeable, the company’s securities will be removed from the Index. The highest ranked security not already in the Index at that time will be added. (j) If there is a rights issue or bonus issue (other than a bonus issue election scheme for reinvestment of dividends) to existing security holders, the Index will be changed to reflect the issue of shares on the issue’s “ex” trading date. (If the rights issue is not fully underwritten, the adjustment is calculated as if all rights were exercised.) (k) If any other capital adjustment event such as a share issue (including under a dividend reinvestment scheme) or share buy-back occurs which increases or decreases the number on issue of any constituent security and that increase or decrease, measured by market capitalisation on a cumulative basis since the 6 last adjustment, is less than 0.03% of the Index, then any adjustments to the Index will be made at the end of the quarter in which the number of listed securities are increased or decreased. In the event that an increase or decrease represents more than 0.03% of the Index, then an adjustment to the Index will be made as at the close of the NZSX on the 15th day of the month in which the number of listed securities is increased or decreased. (l) If there is any other form of capital reconstruction in relation to a constituent security which impacts on the security’s Index weighting, the Index will be adjusted on the same date to reflect the capital reconstruction. (m) Any changes to the Index composition that are described in paragraphs (a) – (l) (other than where the timing of the change is specified in the relevant paragraph) will be made at the close of business on the 15 th of the month, subject to five (5) business days notice of the event occurring. (n) The Fund currently owns shares in Westpac (NZ) Investments Limited (WPT). Westpac Banking Corporation Limited (WBC) has decided to exercise its rights to convert these WPT shares to WBC shares. WPT is to be delisted from NZX on 1 July. The WPT shares will be removed from the Index. The WBC shares will be capitalised on the NZSX on 11 July and, as a result of this, are likely to rank above 21 st position in the Index. Therefore, the Fund will continue to hold the WPT shares until after delisting and will hold the converted shares (the WBC shares), when issued, until the new capitalisation on 11 July. On 11 July the Index will be altered in accordance with paragraph 13(c) as if the capitalisation of the WBC shares were a new listing and the Fund will be rebalanced. Any residual rebalancing required due to the WBC shares being outside the tolerance levels will be completed at the end of the quarter (15 July). The WBC shares will be held from 1 July to 11 July as part of the Index notwithstanding that these shares will have no value on the NZSX until 11 July. Rights issues 14. In the event of any rights issue by an Index company, the Manager will retain the entitlement and take up the securities if the securities the subject of the entitlement will be immediately included in the Index. 15. Notwithstanding paragraph 14, if the securities the subject of the entitlement are over-represented, the Manager will sell the entitlement and reinvest the proceeds in securities to track the Index. 16. If the Manager does not know whether the securities the subject of the entitlement will be included in the Index, the Manager will sell the entitlement at the earliest possible time and reinvest the proceeds in securities to track the Index. 7 Rebalancing 17. The Fund is rebalanced in the following circumstances: (a) When the quarterly adjustments are made to the Index; (b) When the Index changes other than quarterly due to market driven changes or corporate actions such as merger, takeover, bonus issue, rights issues and capital reconstructions; (c) If the Fund’s holding of a security will be (or is) outside the tolerance levels provided for in paragraph 18 of this Ruling. 18. The Manager will use best endeavours to track the Index as closely as possible. Rebalancing will only occur in accordance with condition (b) of the existing private ruling for the Fund (BR Prv 05/16) and any deviation from the Index remaining after rebalancing will not exceed 1% of the Index. 19. The Trustee has appointed an independent party (the Fund’s auditors) to provide an annual confirmation that the operations of the Fund have conformed to these criteria. 20. The Trustee is authorised to accept from an investor a subscription in kind, i.e. a subscription in the form of a basket of securities that achieves a result of the Fund tracking the then Index composition. 21. Disposition of securities by the Trustee on behalf of the Fund (other than those in the cash pool) will only occur in the following circumstances: (a) If the Fund is ever wound up. (b) If, at any time, the Index composition changes and as a result the composition of the securities in the Fund no longer tracks the weightings in the Index. (c) If, on any day, there is a net withdrawal of funds from the Fund by investing superannuation funds or natural persons which cannot be met out of the cash pool. (d) If there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Fund that cannot be met other than as a result of liquidating some securities. This is not anticipated, but the Trustee needs some ultimate protection against extraordinary circumstances such as, say, a change in taxation law or an unanticipated liability or expense. (e) If the Fund is rebalanced in accordance with paragraph 17 of the Arrangement. In respect of the events under these subparagraphs, sales of securities will only be made to the extent required in each case. 8 22. A fee will be payable to the Trustee by each member of up to 0.3% per annum of the value of the units held by that member (plus GST, if any). 23. Each investing superannuation fund must make a minimum initial contribution to the Fund of $200,000 or such lesser amount as the Trustee with the written consent of the Sponsor may approve. 24. Under the Trust Deed for the Fund, members of the Fund have an individual Member Account, into which is credited any contributions by the member together with any growth in value of the funds invested. It is anticipated that the Member Accounts will be calculated and recorded on a unitised basis, i.e. the total value of the Fund will be divided into units and each member will be allocated the number of units which reflects their respective contributions and earnings. 25. The Fund is required to buy and sell shares as required to ensure that it continues to correspond to the Index. Such buying and selling will not be motivated by any intention to derive a profit or gain from such sales. In this regard, the Trust Deed states: The Fund and the Trustee do not have an intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling Index Company securities. 26. The powers contained in clause 10.1(h) of the Trust Deed will only be exercised to facilitate the purposes of the Fund and in any event will only be used in accordance with paragraph 25 of this Ruling. 27. Members may from time to time elect to withdraw funds from the Fund. A substantial withdrawal from the Fund could be in the millions of dollars. In that circumstance, the Fund may not be able to fund the withdrawal in one portfolio trade as, depending on the market circumstances (including liquidity), brokers are likely to be limited as to the size of the trade they will accept at all. Even if a broker (or brokers) did accept a trade of significant size, they would not be able to guarantee that the trade would be completed or settled within 3 business days. In these circumstances the Fund will accumulate funds to the full withdrawal amount. 28. The Manager does not have the power to purchase units from Members. 29. The Applicant has confirmed that all aspects of the previous private ruling (BR Prv 02/33) and the private ruling prior to that (BR Prv 01/17), relating to the Fund, have been complied with, except that: • in regard to the previous ruling, on the takeover of Powerco Limited by Prime Infrastructure Networks (New Zealand) Limited, the Manager did not rebalance the Fund to include a replacement security until the following quarterly rebalancing. As a result, there was a period where the number of securities held by the Fund was 24. For the avoidance of doubt, this has been 9 disclosed as a circumstance of non-compliance even though the previous ruling was silent on the date of reintroduction of a replacement security; and • in regard to BR Prv 01/17, the Fund received a compulsory share acquisition by court order which required the Fund to hold non-Index shares. This occurred during the Fletcher Energy acquisition when the Fund was issued shares in a company that did not track the Index. (The shares were in a United States company called Capstone. Each Fletcher Energy shareholder was issued with a small number of Capstone shares as well as other consideration.) As it was a court approved compulsory acquisition, the Manager had no choice but to receive those shares. The terms of the issue of the Capstone shares meant that all the recipients had to hold the shares for a period of time before they could sell them and use the proceeds to invest in the Index. 30. There has been no change to the Trust Deed of the Fund (except for the noted amendments dated 23 March 2001, 31 July 2002 and the Amending Trust Deed), nor any change to the management or operation of the Fund since its establishment. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The Fund is a registered superannuation scheme under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. b) The existing binding private ruling for the Fund (BR Prv 05/16) (or any such replacement ruling) remains in force and continues to apply in all respects to the Arrangement. c) The Amending Trust Deed provided to the Commissioner on 21 June 2005 will be executed by 31 August 2005 so that it is the same as, or not materially different from, the draft deed provided to the Commissioner. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The Fund is a “superannuation fund” as defined in section OB 1. • The Fund is a “qualifying trust” under paragraph (b) of the definition of “qualifying trust” in section OB 1. • Amounts derived by investors as a result of withdrawals from the Fund are excluded from income by virtue of section HH 3(5). 10 The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 July 2005 and ending on 30 June 2008. This Ruling is signed by me on the 30 th day of June 2005. David Kelly Manager (Financial Sector)
PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 05/03 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by New Zealand Bloodstock Leasing Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BD 2(1)(b), BG 1, EF 1, EM 1, EO 2A, FC 8A to FC 10, GB 1, GD 1 and the definitions of “excepted financial arrangement”, “hire purchase agreement”, “lease”, “lease asset” and “operating lease” contained in section OB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the leasing of bloodstock by New Zealand Bloodstock Leasing Limited (“NZBL”) to its customers for use in breeding bloodstock progeny on the terms provided in the “Bloodstock Lease to Purchase Agreement” (a copy of which was provided to Inland Revenue on 5 December 2002) entered into by NZBL and its customers. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. NZBL is a wholly owned subsidiary of New Zealand Bloodstock Limited (“NZB”). NZB established NZBL to expand its business and increase sales of bloodstock in New Zealand by making investment in the bloodstock industry more attractive to existing and new entrants. The availability of leasing reduces the initial level of cash required by existing and new entrants to the bloodstock business to acquire bloodstock. 2. NZBL acquires bloodstock from third party owners, then leases this bloodstock to the customer. Alternatively, the customer purchases the bloodstock from the third party owner, sells it to NZBL, then leases the bloodstock from NZBL. This helps protect NZBL from involvement in any subsequent contractual claims regarding the purchase of the bloodstock from the third party owner. In both cases the transaction as a whole (ie, sale and lease-back) is contemplated by the parties at the outset. In either case, the customer sources the bloodstock, drawing on bloodstock consulting, freight, and insurance services provided by NZB. 3. The terms and duration of leases are based on individual requirements, credit risk, and potential breeding expectations. Lease periods may vary. A typical lease term is three years for fillies or mares, and two years for colts or stallions. 4. The bloodstock has a residual value under the Bloodstock Lease to Purchase Agreement (the “Residual Value”). The Residual Value is an estimate (at the time of signing the lease) of the value the bloodstock will have at the end of the lease. Where there is an opportunity to secure the rights to sell future progeny through NZB’s annual sales (in practical terms this will only be where the bloodstock in question is a mare), NZBL sells the bloodstock to New Zealand Bloodstock Progeny Limited (“NZBP”) for the discounted value of the residual value payment. The discounted value is calculated using market rates used by third party companies providing financial facilities. Accordingly, when there is an opportunity to secure the rights to future progeny, NZBP holds title to the bloodstock during the term of the lease, otherwise the title is retained by NZBL. 5. On termination of the lease (the “Lease Termination Date”) the customer may purchase the bloodstock for the Residual Value. NZBP or NZBL will transfer title to the customer in return for payment of the Residual Value. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The customer is in the business, as defined in section OB 1, of breeding bloodstock. b) The customer has entered into the Bloodstock Lease to Purchase Agreement for the sole purpose of breeding from the leased bloodstock and intends to use the leased bloodstock in the production of gross income. c) The lease payments are genuine, arms-length amounts for the possession and use of the bloodstock. d) The leased bloodstock is mature for use in breeding and is capable of being used for breeding throughout the period to which each lease payment relates. e) Any racing undertaken by the leased bloodstock is only incidental to the actual use of the bloodstock for breeding during the lease term. f) The lessee will have title to any progeny produced during the lease term. g) The bloodstock becomes the property of the customer only when the customer makes payment of the Residual Value after the Lease Termination Date. h) The Residual Value of the bloodstock is a reasonable, and the parties’ best, estimate of the likely market value of the bloodstock at the Lease Termination Date. i) The Residual Value amount when paid by the customer is not materially less than the open market value of the bloodstock at the Lease Termination Date. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement 2 Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The bloodstock lease payments are allowable deductions under section BD 2(1)(b) and are not excluded from being deductible under section BD 2(2)(e); • At the end of an income year, the unexpired portion of any lease payments paid in advance is included in gross income and deductible in the subsequent year (unless excluded from this requirement pursuant to determination by the Commissioner) under section EF 1; • The valuation and specified writedown provisions in section EM 1 apply to the customer when the bloodstock is purchased by payment of the Residual Value after the Lease Termination Date; • The cost price of the bloodstock for the purposes of section EM 1 is the Residual Value stated in the Bloodstock Lease to Purchase Agreement; • Sections BG 1and GB 1 do not apply to the Arrangement to negate or vary any of the above conclusions; • Section GD 1(1) does not apply to the Arrangement; • The Accrual Rules in sections EH 19 to EH 59 do not apply to the Arrangement; • The operating lease provision section EO 2A does not apply to the Arrangement; • The finance lease provisions in sections FC 8A to FC 8I do not apply to the Arrangement; • The hire purchase provisions in sections FC 9 and FC 10 do not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 5 December 2002 to 9 February 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 9th day of February 2005.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 05/05 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited as Trustee of the AMP Superannuation Tracker Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BD 4(2), DA 2(1), DB 17, FI 1, FI 2 and the definition of “superannuation fund” in section OB 1. This Ruling does not consider how (if at all) sections CH 1, DB 40 and ED 1 apply to the Arrangement. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the redemption of Units in the AMP Superannuation Tracker Fund (“the Fund”) by members who receive securities for their redemption, and those shares are trading stock or revenue account property of that member. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below: 1. The AMP Superannuation Tracker Fund (“the Fund”) is a registered superannuation scheme under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. The Fund is not listed on the New Zealand stock market (“NZX”). 2. The Fund has been designed to provide members with a simple and cost effective method of investing in a portfolio with a performance broadly representative of the New Zealand share market. 3. The Trustee of the Fund is the New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited (“the Trustee”) although the Trust Deed contains provisions for the retirement or removal and replacement of the Trustee. 4. The Manager of the Fund is AMP Investment Management (N.Z.) Ltd (“the Manager”). The Manager invests the investors’ contributions into the Fund. The Investment Manager/ Promoter of the Fund is AMP Capital Investors (New Zealand) Ltd (“the Investment Manager”). The Investment Manager purchases securities in the Index, described more particularly in paragraphs 6– 8 below. Both the Manager and the Investment Manager are owned by AMP Ltd, incorporated in New South Wales. 5. The Fund was established, as a wholesale registered superannuation scheme, principally for the purpose of paying benefits to persons who are trustees of superannuation schemes registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 and who elect to invest in the Fund. Investment policy 6. According to the Members’ Booklet of the Fund, dated 29 June 2001: The objective of the Scheme is to track the Russell/Ord Minnett \[JB Were) Tradeable Index (the Tradeable Index) as closely as practical. This will be achieved by holding constituent company securities which, as far as possible, match the composition of the Tradeable Index. ... The Manager and the Trustee can adopt such other index of securities as they agree from time to time. 7. In accordance with the current Members’ Booklet (not being materially different to the draft provided to the Commissioner on 17 January 2005), the Manager and the Trustee have agreed to adopt the NZSX 50 Index (“the Index”) administered by New Zealand Exchange Limited. The transition to tracking the Index occurred on 31 January 2005 (refer to paragraph 24(h) below), and the Fund commenced tracking the Index on 1 February 2005. Apart from permitted investments of the cash pool, the Fund will, commencing on 1 February 2005, only invest in the securities that make up the Index and will continue to track the Index as near as practicable irrespective of whether the sale of the shares will give rise to a profit or loss. 8. Despite the Trust Deed providing that the Manager and Trustee can invest in other Indexes, and apart from permitted investments of the cash pool, the Fund will, having made the transition to the Index, only invest in the securities that make up the Index. 9. The Fund is required to buy and sell shares as required to ensure that it continues to correspond as near as practicable to the Index. Such buying and selling will not be motivated by any intention to derive a profit or gain from such sales. In this regard, Clause 5.3.1A of the Trust Deed states: The Fund shall seek to track the Index by investing in Constituent Company Securities as near as practically possible to their weightings in the Index and the Trustee’s primary investment duty shall be to seek to achieve this purpose. All other investment duties (express or implied) shall be construed subject to this duty. The Fund and the Trustee shall not have an intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling Constituent Company Securities. 10. The Trustee and the Manager have confirmed that, to the best of their knowledge, the Fund has complied with the previous rulings (BR Prv 05/02, and BR Prd 05/01), relating to the Fund. 2 Adjustments to the Fund 11. The Fund is rebalanced in the following circumstances: (a) The Fund’s portfolio is monitored regularly, being daily, to ensure that it is tracking the Index. The reference to “Fund’s portfolio” means the Constituent Companies held by the Fund. (b) The Manager will rebalance the Fund to the Index following any adjustments to the Index. Such rebalancing will occur as soon as possible but in any case within three business days of a change to the composition of the Index. Management and operation of the Fund Borrowing 12. Clause 10.3.2 of the Trust Deed provides that: The Trustee may not borrow any money for the purposes of the Plan otherwise than for the purpose of satisfying payment of any Administration Expenses in which case the Trustee may borrow money on terms considered appropriate by the Trustee and may charge any or all of the Plan to secure the repayment of any moneys borrowed. Hedging 13. This Fund only tracks shares quoted on the NZX and hence the Fund will purchase shares in New Zealand dollars. Accordingly, the Fund will not be exposed to foreign exchange risks. The Fund does not enter into any hedging transactions . Contributions to the Fund 14. Contributions to the Fund will be by way of parcels of securities or cash. Cash may be accepted in the following circumstances: (a) where there is a contemporaneous redemption against which the contribution can be netted off by receiving cash into the Fund and then paying it out on the redemption, or (b) to the extent the application cannot be made in securities due to uneven parcel sizes provided the cash pool remains below 0.5% of the total assets of the Fund and, except where the situations listed in paragraph 16 below arise or where the cash is committed to fund an obligation that was known at the time of receipt of the subscription, the cash is converted to Constituent Company Securities as soon as practicably possible. 15. Members wishing to contribute cash may be required to purchase a parcel of securities through a separate arrangement with the Manager, or through other intermediaries (such as brokers and financial advisors). 3 Cash investments held by the Fund (“cash pool”) 16. The proportion of the Fund’s assets to be held as the cash pool will not exceed what is strictly necessary in order to fulfil the purposes of the cash pool (as stated in paragraph 17 of this Ruling), and will not in any event exceed 0.5% of the total assets of the Fund, except if: (i) the Fund receives a large cash contribution (provided the cash is invested as soon as possible and in any event within three business days), or (ii) a member requests a large cash redemption (provided the cash is distributed within three business days of the sale of securities), or (iii) the Fund receives a large cash inflow from or in respect of a Constituent Company, such as a distribution due to a pro-rata buy-back or takeover or a change in the Constituent Companies of the Index (provided the cash is invested as soon as possible and in any event within three business days), or (iv) the Fund holds cash as a result of disposing of securities in the course of and for the purposes of winding up the Fund. 17. The purpose of the cash pool as set out in Clause 5.2.5 of the Trust Deed is: The Trustee may maintain or invest in Cash in any amount representing up to five percent (5%) of the Current Fund Value at any time, PROVIDED THAT the investment in Cash shall only be used to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund and to reduce the number of transactions required to be made or to facilitate redemptions from time to time, but may not be used by the Manager or the Trustee to increase the performance of the Fund by maximising the holding of securities considered to be likely to give a high return or minimising the holding of securities considered likely to give a low return. 18. “Cash”, as defined in Clause 3 of the Trust Deed includes: deposits, or negotiable instruments, in each case having maturities which are not later than the times at which the proceeds of realisation thereof are expected to be required, and on which there is full indefeasible liability of: (a) a New Zealand registered bank (having the meaning given to that term by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989) approved by the Manager for the purpose; or (b) the New Zealand government. 19. The size and operation of the cash pool will be strictly managed so as to reflect its threefold purpose of: (a) allowing funds to accumulate to an appropriate amount for investment, and 4 (b) minimising the number of equity security sale and purchase transactions, and (c) managing the liquidity of the Fund in respect of meeting its anticipated liabilities and withdrawals. 20. When the cash held by the Investment Manager reaches the minimum investment level, it will be applied to acquire securities to track the Index as soon as possible and in any event within three business days. The Manager has advised that the minimum amount required to enable the purchase of every security in the Index in a marketable and economically sensible sized parcel is approximately $150,000, but may reduce where a lower amount can permit transaction costs to be maintained at the current level (or a level not materially different). 21. It is not envisaged that the amount of cash required to enable the purchase of securities in a marketable and economically sensible sized parcel will change from $150,000 unless there are improvements in share trading systems that make it economic to trade in smaller parcels of shares. This would be beneficial for the Fund as it would be able to invest surplus cash sooner and keep the cash levels in the Fund at a lower level than might otherwise be the case if the Fund is confined to a predetermined minimum parcel size. 22. The Fund does not normally hold cash equivalents. Rather, the cash amounts are normally held in bank deposits and interest is paid on these deposits. Dividend reinvestment 23. In the event of a dividend reinvestment option being available to the Trustee, the Manager will only accept such an option if it is consistent with tracking the Index. In all other cases, the Manager will decline the option and will always accept the cash dividend that will be immediately allocated to members. Events that trigger acquisitions or realisations 24. There are certain reasons or events when investments held by the Fund will have to be bought or sold. The Trustee will only dispose of securities (other than cash pool investments): (a) If the Fund is voluntarily or involuntarily wound up or if the Trustee is replaced (and this of itself means that there is a technical disposal of securities to the new Trustee and the new Trustee assumes ownership of the same securities held by the previous Trustee immediately before the Trustee is replaced). (b) If there is a change in the Index composition and the composition of the Fund no longer tracks the Index or when the Fund is otherwise required to buy and sell securities to maintain tracking. 5 (c) When transferring securities to a member if the member redeems Units for securities. (d) Where there is no option available to receive dividends in the form of cash, and dividends are received in the form of bonus securities and are converted to cash. (e) To satisfy a legal claim against the Fund or Trustee or to meet expenses of the Fund, but only to the extent to which such a claim or expense cannot be met from existing resources. (f) If a member or members require cash on redemption of Units and such redemption cannot be met from the cash pool. (g) Where securities are purchased in error. (h) As a consequence of the Fund ceasing tracking the Russell/JB Were Tradeable Index and commencing tracking the NZSX 50 Index. Redemption of Units 25. A member is only able to dispose of their Units by redeeming them. A member may redeem Units subject to the conditions in Clause 8 of the Trust Deed. Clause 8 requires redemptions to be for amounts of at least $10,000 or all of a member’s Units and no member is to be left with less than $100,000 worth of Units. The redemption can be in the form of cash and/or cash equivalents and/or securities. 26. The Units in the Fund are valued on the basis of the market value of the securities and other assets that the Fund holds. 27. Redemptions are usually made through the transfer of Constituent Company Securities (equal to the value of the Units being redeemed and may also contain a small cash balancing item) but may, in the circumstances described below, be made in cash. 28. In the following circumstances a redemption will be made in cash (where that cash is not committed for other purposes): (a) where there is a contemporaneous contribution against which the redemption can be matched, or (b) where the cash is sufficient to fund the redemption in full, that redemption will be made from the cash pool, and (c) where the cash is not sufficient to fund the redemption in full, the balance of the redemption will be made from securities in the proportions that will ensure that the Fund will continue to match the composition and weighting of the Index as near as practicably possible. 6 29. Clause 8.3.2 of the Trust Deed provides: Every Benefit payable under this clause 8.3 shall be determined by multiplying the Redemption Price calculated on the date of acceptance by the Manager by the number of Units redeemed and become payable to the Member net later than ten (10) Business Days following the date on which the Manager receives the Benefit request or on any later redemption date requested by the Member. 30. Redemption Price is defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed to mean the “Current Unit Value” less the “Exit Fee”. 31. Current Unit Value is defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed as: ... on any date an amount that is arrived at by dividing the Current Fund Value by the number of Units on issue on such date ... 32. The Current Fund Value is defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed as: The amount calculated by adding as at any time when a valuation is required in relation to the Fund: (a) the total of the market value of all Cash, units in the AMP Investments’ Tracker Fund and investments of the Fund determined pursuant to clause 6; and (b) the income of the Fund due but not yet received; and (c) any other amounts which, in the opinion of the Manager, should be included for the purposes of making a fair and reasonable determination of the value of the Fund having due regard to duly accepted accounting practice and accounting principles from time to time; and deducting therefrom such amounts: (d) as are required to meet liabilities properly attributable to the Fund (actual or contingent and not otherwise allowed for in determining the value of any asset) to the extent that the Manager has decided that provision should be made in the accounts of the Plan; (e) as represent Administration Expenses payable by the Trustee or the Manager; and (f) which, in the opinion of the Manager, should be included for the purpose of making a fair and reasonable determination of the current value of the Fund having due regard to generally accepted accounting practice and accounting principles current from time to time. 33. Clause 3 of the Trust Deed provides that Market Value in relation to a Constituent Company Security in the Index means: ... its value as in the Index at any relevant time. 34. Exit Fee is defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed to mean: ...such sum, if any, as the Manager in its absolute discretion may determine (either generally or in relation to a particular Benefit) to be a fair fee payable in relation to the relevant Benefit to provide for the likely per Unit cost of realising Assets to meet that Benefit, having regard to the Manager’s estimate of the aggregate of all costs, charges, expenses, disbursements, commissions, brokerage and other usual fees which would be likely to be incurred in respect of the sale or disposal of Assets on the date of calculation of the Redemption Price of Assets to fund a unit’s Redemption Price were sold or disposed of on such date. 7 Suspension of redemptions 35. Clause 8.5 of the Trust Deed provides that the Manager can suspend redemptions in certain circumstances up to a period not exceeding 20 business days. The Fund will not utilise the power to suspend the redemption of Units except in exceptional circumstances (where and to the extent that it is necessary to do so) being: (i) if the Fund is unable to convert sufficient assets into cash, to meet a redemption request, or (ii) if the market value of the Units at the time is not a true reflection of the actual value of the Units, due to a suspension in trading of any Constituent Company Securities on any exchange, or (iii) if, for reasons beyond its control, the Manager is unable to calculate the redemption price. Any such suspension will be for a maximum period of three business days, unless an exceptional circumstance occurs that is beyond the control of the Trustee and the Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund and/or the Manager to recover from that event. Utilisation of member expenses for tax purposes 36. The Trust Deed has been amended to allow the Trustee to credit a Member’s Account with Units in recognition of any tax deduction that the Plan has received as a result of an election by that member under section DI 3(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Trust Deed was amended, by the Second Deed of Amendment dated 1 February 2002, by inserting Clause 12A. Sub-clause 12A.l, which is relevant for the purposes of the Ruling, provides that: Where a Member has made an election under section DI 3(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (“section DI 3(2) “) that any expenditure, which is incurred by the superannuation scheme for which the Member is a trustee (or, in respect of a superannuation scheme constituted under an Act of Parliament, the person appointed to administer the superannuation scheme), be treated as if it were expenditure incurred by the Plan and the Plan has received a tax deduction as a result of that election, the Trustee shall credit to the Member Account of the relevant Member such number of Units as the Trustee considers equitable to recognise such tax deduction. For the avoidance of doubt, the number of units to be issued in normal circumstances would be calculated by reference to the amount determined by dividing the amount of any tax benefit which the Manager considers arises from the tax deduction by the Issue Price applying on the Business Day on which the tax benefit is considered by the Manager to arise. 37. The Fund will always issue Units according to the above Clause and there will be no discretion as to whether the Fund will in fact issue Units in accordance with the above Clause. 8 Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following Conditions: a) The Fund is an investment vehicle primarily for investment into by superannuation funds, being superannuation schemes registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989, which are themselves either: (i) widely-held investment vehicles for direct investment by natural persons, or (ii) vehicles for investment (directly or indirectly) by other superannuation funds that are widely-held vehicles for direct investment by natural persons. b) The Fund operates in accordance with its Trust Deed dated 10 February 1999, a Members’ Booklet not materially different to the draft provided to the Commissioner on 17 January 2005, the Deed of Arrangements dated 10 February 1999 (as amended on 27 August 2001), the Deed of Amendment dated 30 January 2002, and the Second Deed of Amendment dated 1 February 2002. c) The Fund is a registered superannuation scheme under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. d) The Fund only tracks the Index. e) In determining the market value of a security at any time the last sale price for that security, as quoted on the New Zealand stock market at that time, shall be used. f) The Manager, in determining the Members’ entitlement to securities on redemption of Units in the Fund under clause 8.3 of the Trust Deed, shall use the market value of those securities at the valuation time (as defined in the Trust Deed). g) The amounts derived by the Member from the subsequent sale or disposal of securities received on redeeming Units in the Fund will be assessable income of the Member. h) Members do not acquire Units in the Fund for the purpose of acquiring securities. i) Units in the Fund are not tradeable on a secondary market. j) The trust is established by its Trust Deed mainly for the purpose of paying benefits to superannuation funds. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement 9 Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, and the qualification in respect of sections CH 1, DB 40 and ED 1 under the heading “Taxation Laws” above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Pursuant to sections FI 1 and FI 2, the cost of any securities acquired by a member on redemption of Units in the Fund is the market value of those securities on the date the member acquires the securities. • Section DA 2(1) does not apply to the cost of any securities acquired by a member on redemption of units. • The cost of a security acquired by a member on the redemption of Units (being the market value of the security on acquisition) is an allowable deduction under section DB 17. It is deductible in the income year in which the Units are redeemed under section BD 4(2). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 October 2005 and ending on 30 September 2008. This Ruling is signed by me on the 2nd day of December 2005. Howard Davis Senior Tax Counsel 10
PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 05/06 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited as Trustee of the AMP Superannuation World Index Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BD 2, BD 4(2), DA 1(1), DA 2(1), DB 17, FI 1, FI 2, HH 3(5) and the definition of “superannuation fund” in section OB 1. This Ruling does not consider how (if at all) sections CH 1, DB 40 and ED 1 apply to the Arrangement. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the redemption of Units in the AMP Superannuation World Index Fund (“the Fund”) by members who receive securities for their redemption, and those shares are trading stock or revenue account property of that member. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The Fund is a registered superannuation scheme under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. 2. The Fund invests in securities of those companies that are included in the AMP World Index (the “AMP Index” or the “Index”). The AMP Index is a customised version of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index (the “MSCI World Index”) and tracks those securities in the MSCI World Index which are from “Grey List” countries if the market capitalisation of the country’s securities included in the MSCI Index represents at least 1% of the MSCI Index. The Fund has been designed to provide members with a simple and cost efficient method of investing in a portfolio with a performance broadly representative of the world share market. 3. The Trustee of the Fund is the New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited (“the Trustee”), although the Trust Deed contains provision for the retirement and replacement of the Trustee. 4. The Manager of the Fund is AMP Investment Management (N.Z.) Limited (“the Manager”), a wholly owned subsidiary of AMP Limited. 5. Clause 5.3.1 A of the Trust Deed provides: The Fund shall seek to track the Index by investing in Constituent Company Securities as near as practicably possible to their weightings in the Index and the Trustee’s primary investment duty shall be to seek to achieve this purpose. All other investment duties (express or implied) shall be construed subject to this duty. The Fund and the Trustee shall not have an intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling Constituent Company Securities. 6. The Trust Deed also ensures that any statutory superannuation schemes (ie any superannuation scheme constituted under an Act of Parliament or government superannuation scheme) can also join the Fund. 7. The Fund is required to buy and sell shares as required to ensure that its portfolio continues to correspond as near as practicably possible to the Index. Such buying and selling will not be motivated by any intention to derive a profit or gain from such sales. The sole purpose of the Fund will be to continue to track the Index as near as practicably possible irrespective of whether the sale of shares will give rise to a profit or loss. 8. The beneficial interest in the Fund is divided into Units. Every Unit confers an equal interest in the Fund, but does not confer any interest in any particular investment of the Fund. 9. The Applicant and the Manager have confirmed that, to the best of their knowledge, the Fund has complied with the previous rulings (BR Prv 04/69 and BR Prd 02/08) relating to the Fund. The Trust Deed and Members Booklet for the Fund 10. The terms of the Fund are provided in the Trust Deed. There are no clauses in the Trust Deed or Rules of the Fund or any other documents that operate differently for specific members or groups of members. Membership 11. The Fund was established as a wholesale registered superannuation scheme in which any other superannuation scheme can invest. The Fund was not established by any particular financial institution as an investment vehicle for that institution. Date of adjustments 12. The Fund is rebalanced every quarter and other adjustments are made as a result of mergers, takeovers, rights issues and share buy-backs when those events occur. Mergers, takeovers, share buy-backs and right issues 13. The Index may be adjusted from time to time because of mergers, takeovers, share buy-backs, distributions of capital, cash issues, and substitutions of 2 companies in the Index. With the exception of any situation where shares in a Constituent Company are compulsorily acquired pursuant to any companies legislation, listing rules or takeover code requirements, in the event of a merger or takeover, the Manager will adjust the Fund portfolio at a time as close as practically possible (but in any event within three business days) to the time the Index is adjusted. The Fund will not accept an offer, unless as a consequence of not accepting the offer, the Fund would track the Index less accurately than if it had accepted the offer. 14. In the event of a share buy-back by a Constituent Company of the Index, the Manager will adjust the Fund portfolio at a time as close as practicably possible (but in any event within three business days) to the time the Index is adjusted. This adjustment will not be made through electing to participate in a buy-back scheme of a Constituent Company, except if the Fund is able to accept a buy-back offer at the same time as an Index adjustment for that Constituent Company occurs. 15. In the event of any rights issue by a Constituent Company, the Manager will hold the entitlement if the entitlement is included in the Index. If the entitlement is not included in the Index, but the securities the subject of the entitlement will be immediately included in the Index, the Manager will retain the entitlement and take up the securities. If the Manager does not know whether the securities the subject of the entitlement will be included in the Index, the Manager will sell the entitlement at the earliest possible time and reinvest the proceeds in the Constituent Companies to track the Index. Events that trigger acquisitions or realisations 16. Initial contributions to the Fund are made through the Manager. The Manager deposits the cash contributions from the members into the Fund. The Manager invests these cash contributions, in return for which the Manager receives Units on behalf of members. The Manager subcontracts the function of converting contributions to parcels of shares in companies included in the Index to Henderson Fund Management plc (“the Investment Manager”), which is based in the United Kingdom. The Investment Manager will purchase securities in the Index according to the pre-determined rules for calculating and maintaining the AMP Index set out in the current private ruling for the Fund (BR 04/69). 17. Under the Trust Deed, the Manager is responsible for further issues of Units in the Fund. The Manager is also responsible for Unit redemptions. 18. Dividends, net of any fees or expenses of the Fund, that accrue to the portfolio of shares held by the Fund will be invested in securities that constitute the Index or held in cash pending the investment of that dividend. 19. There are certain reasons or events when investments held by the Fund will have to be bought or sold. The Fund will only sell or otherwise dispose of securities in the following circumstances: 3 • If the Fund is voluntarily or involuntarily wound up, or if the Trustee is replaced (and this of itself means that there is a technical disposal of securities) • If there is a change in the AMP Index composition and the composition of the Fund no longer tracks the Index or when the Fund is otherwise required to buy and sell securities to maintain tracking • On the redemption of Units in order to pay benefits to members • Where proceeds are received by the Fund in the form of securities • Where there is no election available and where dividends are received in the form of bonus securities and they are converted to cash • Where securities are purchased in error • To satisfy a legal claim made against the Fund or the Trustee • To meet any expenses of the Fund, which are authorised by clause 10.3.10 or 11.3.2 of the Trust Deed. 20. Clauses 10.3.10 and 11.3.2 provide for the Trustee and Manager to be reimbursed from the Fund for all Administrative Expenses (as defined in the Trust Deed) incurred by them. Payment of benefits 21. A member is only able to dispose of its Units by requesting the Manager to redeem the Units for the purpose of paying a benefit to that member. A member may redeem Units subject to the conditions in clause 8 of the Trust Deed. Clause 8.3.3 requires redemptions to be for amounts of at least $10,000 or all of a member’s Units and no member is to be left with less than $100,000 worth of Units. The Manager may also suspend redemptions in the limited circumstances noted at paragraph 31 below. The redemption can be in the form of cash and/or cash equivalents and/or securities. Even though the Trust Deed gives the Manager a general discretion to redeem by cheque or the transfer of Constituent Company Securities or a combination of them (clause 8.14 of the Trust Deed), redemption in securities will only arise at the request of the member (ie redemption in securities will not arise at the discretion of the Manager/Trustee). In addition, the Manager will not exercise this discretion with a view to increasing the performance of the Fund in any way. Where a member requests a redemption in securities the Manager will only decline a request for redemption in securities due to size constraints (ie the units held by the member is small and as such a parcel of securities cannot be formed). 22. The Units in the Fund are valued on the basis of the market value of the securities and other assets that the Fund holds. 23. Redemptions will be made from the cash pool if sufficient funds are available, otherwise redemptions will be financed from the sale of securities. In addition, following a redemption, the cash pool will not normally be topped up and there is no specified period of time in which the cash pool will be injected with further funds. Accordingly, if there is insufficient cash to pay a redemption if it arises, the redemption will be financed through the sale of securities. 4 24. Members redeem Units directly with the Fund, with the Manager acting on behalf of the Trustee (ie members do not sell their Units to the Manager who then redeems them with the Fund). 25. Clause 8.3.2 of the Trust Deed provides: Every Benefit payable under this clause 8.3 shall be determined by multiplying the Redemption Price calculated on the date of acceptance by the Manager by the number of Units redeemed and become payable to the Member not later than ten (10) Business Days following the date on which the Manager receives the Benefit request or on any later redemption date requested by the Member. 26. Redemption Price is defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed to mean the “Current Unit Value” less the “Exit Fee”. 27. Current Unit Value is defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed as: ... on any date an amount that is arrived at by dividing the Current Fund Value by the number of Units on issue on such date ... 28. The Current Fund Value is defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed as: The amount calculated by adding as at any time when a valuation is required in relation to the Fund: (a) the total of the market value of all Cash, units in the AMP Investments’ World Index Fund and investments of the Fund determined pursuant to clause 6; and (b) the income of the Fund due but not yet received; and (c) any other amounts which, in the opinion of the Manager, should be included for the purposes of making a fair and reasonable determination of the value of the Fund having due regard to duly accepted accounting practice and accounting principles from time to time, and deducting therefrom such amounts: (d) as are required to meet liabilities properly attributable to the Fund (actual or contingent and not otherwise allowed for in determining the value of any asset) to the extent that the Manager has decided that provision should be made in the accounts of the Plan; (e) as represent Administration Expenses payable by the Trustee or the Manager; and (f) which, in the opinion of the Manager, should be included for the purpose of making a fair and reasonable determination of the current value of the Fund having due regard to generally accepted accounting practice and accounting principles current from time to time. 29. Clause 3 of the Trust Deed provides that Market Value in relation to the Constituent Companies Securities in the Index means: ... the last sale price of that security on its home stock exchange at any relevant time (provided that the last sale price is the same as or higher than the current buy price and lower than the 5 current sell price. In the event that the last sale price is lower than the then current buy price, then the market value is the then current buy price and in the event that the last sale price is higher than the current sell price then the market value is the current sell price). 30. Exit Fee is defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed to mean: ...such sum, if any, as the Manager in its absolute discretion may determine (either generally or in relation to a particular Benefit) to be a fair fee payable in relation to the relevant Benefit to provide for the likely per Unit cost of realising Assets to meet that Benefit, having regard to the Manager’s estimate of the aggregate of all costs, charges, expenses, disbursements, commissions, brokerage and other usual fees which would be likely to be incurred in respect of the sale or disposal of Assets on the date of calculation of the Redemption Price if Assets to fund a Unit’s Redemption Price were sold or disposed of on such date. Suspension of payment of benefits 31. Clause 8.5 of the Trust Deed provides that the Manager can suspend redemptions in certain circumstances up to a period not exceeding 20 business days. The Fund will not utilise the power to suspend the redemption of units except in exceptional circumstances (where and to the extent that it is necessary to do so) being: (i) if the Fund is unable to convert sufficient assets into cash, to meet a redemption request, or (ii) if the market value of the units at the time is not a true reflection of the actual value of the units, due to a suspension in trading of any Constituent Company Securities on any exchange, or (iii) if, for reasons beyond its control, the Manager is unable to calculate the redemption price. Any such suspension will be for a maximum period of three business days, except if an exceptional circumstance occurs that is beyond the control of the Trustee and the Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund and/or the Manager to recover from that event. 32. The Fund has suspended redemptions on one occasion before. This suspension occurred as a result of the terrorist attacks in New York on 11 September 2001 as none of the underlying securities held by the Fund were being traded. Ability to decline membership 33. Clause 7.1.5 of the Trust Deed provides that the Manager may accept or decline any application to become a member and shall not be required to give reasons for any such decision. 34. The Manager has never refused an application for membership. However, the Manager may in the future refuse applications for membership. The circumstances where this is likely to arise include: 6 • where the applicant is not, or ceases to be, a registered superannuation scheme or statutory superannuation scheme, or • where accepting the application could result in the Fund breaching a Condition of the existing private ruling for the Fund (BR Prv 04/69 or any such replacement ruling). Hedging 35. The Fund will not take any action to hedge or manage foreign exchange risks or exposures that arise from the investments of the Fund being held in non- New Zealand currencies. The Fund does not enter into any hedging transactions. Borrowing 36. Clause 10.3.2 of the Trust Deed provides that the Trustee may not borrow any money for the purposes of the Fund otherwise than for the purpose of satisfying payment of any Administrative Expenses. Cash investments held by the Fund 37. Although it is not an objective of the Fund to invest in cash securities, the Fund may hold cash to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund. The Fund will hold cash in the following instances: • Following the sale of securities in the course of tracking the Index, pending the reinvestment of that cash • Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution • Following the receipt of a cash dividend or a non-cash dividend and its conversion to cash, pending the investment of that dividend • Following the sale of securities to meet a request to redeem units in cash • To accumulate the minimum amount of cash that will be used to purchase securities in a marketable and economically sensible sized parcel so as to minimise the Fund’s transaction costs. The Manager has advised that this amount is presently US$1 million, but may reduce where a lower amount can permit transaction costs to be maintained at the current level (or a level not materially different) • Following the disposal of securities in the course of and for the purpose of winding up the Fund. 38. The proportion of the Fund’s assets to be held as cash or cash equivalents will not be greater than what strictly arises out of the above described circumstances, and in any event will not exceed 1% of the total assets of the 7 Fund, except if the Fund receives a large cash contribution (provided the cash is invested as soon as possible and in any event within three business days) or a member requests a large cash redemption (provided the cash is distributed within three business days of the sale of securities), or the Fund holds cash in the course of or for the purpose of winding up the Fund. 39. Cash equivalents must have a maturity date of six months or less. Cash equivalents will not include units in any unit trust or group investment fund. 40. It is not envisaged that the amount of cash required to enable the purchase of securities in a marketable and economically sensible sized parcel will change from US$1 million unless there are improvements in share trading systems that make it economic to trade in smaller parcels of shares. This would be beneficial for the Fund as it would be able to invest surplus cash sooner and keep the cash levels in the Fund at a lower level than might otherwise be the case if the Fund is confined to a predetermined minimum parcel size. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The Fund is an investment vehicle primarily for investment into by superannuation funds, being superannuation schemes registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989, which are themselves either: (i) widely-held investment vehicles for direct investment by natural persons, or (ii) vehicles for investment (directly or indirectly) by other superannuation funds that are widely-held vehicles for direct investment by natural persons. b) The Fund operates in accordance with its Trust Deed dated 4 December 1998. c) The Fund is a registered superannuation scheme under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. d) The Fund only tracks the AMP World Index. e) The market value of a security at any time shall be the value quoted on the relevant Stock Exchange at that time, as determined by the method provided in the definition of market value in Clause 3 of the Trust Deed. f) The Manager in determining the Members’ entitlement to securities on redemption of Units in the Fund under clause 8.3 of the Trust Deed, shall use the market value of those securities at the valuation time (as defined in the Trust Deed). 8 g) The amounts derived by the Member from the subsequent sale or disposal of securities received on redeeming Units in the Fund will be assessable income of the Member. h) Members do not acquire Units in the Fund for the purpose of acquiring securities. i) Units in the Fund are not tradeable on a secondary market. j) The Fund is established by its Trust Deed mainly for the purpose of paying benefits to superannuation funds. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, and the qualification in respect of sections CH 1, DB 40 and ED 1 under the heading “Taxation Laws” above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Pursuant to section HH 3(5) any amounts (including securities) received by members as a result of redemption of Units in the Fund will not be income of the member. • Pursuant to sections FI 1 and FI 2, the cost of any securities acquired by a member on redemption of Units in the Fund is the market value of those securities on the date the member acquires the securities. • Section DA 2(1) does not apply to the cost of any securities acquired by a member on redemption of units. • The cost of a security acquired by a member on the redemption of Units (being the market value of the security on acquisition) is an allowable deduction under section BD 2, section DA 1(1) and section DB 17. It is deductible in the income year in which the Units are redeemed under section BD 4(2). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 October 2005 and ending on 30 September 2008. This Ruling is signed by me on the 2nd day of December 2005. Howard Davis Senior Tax Counsel 9 10
PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 05/07 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by SkyCity Consolidated Group – IRD No 63-352- 039 Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: • Section CD 2; • Section CD 3(1); • Section CD 4(1); • Section CD 5(1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the issue of bonus shares by SkyCity Entertainment Group Ltd (“the Company”) and the offer by the Company of an option to redeem the shares where shareholders elect to retain the shares. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The Company, a member of the SkyCity Consolidated Group (“the Group”), is a public company. The Company was incorporated in New Zealand. The Company has in excess of twenty thousand ordinary shareholders, a very small percentage of whom are likely to be taxable at the 39% marginal income tax rate. 2. The Company typically distributes two dividends a year to shareholders - an interim dividend paid in April and a final dividend paid in October. Until April 2005 dividends were paid in cash without a reinvestment option. The Company has previously fully imputed all dividends paid and will continue to do so in the period for which this Ruling applies. At the time the Company pays dividends it has often not had sufficient imputation credits in its imputation credit account to fully impute the dividends. In these circumstances it has paid further income tax sufficient to ensure there is not a debit balance in its imputation credit account at year end and it will continue, if necessary, to pay further income tax during the period for which this Ruling applies so that it will have sufficient imputation credits in its imputation credit account at the end of each imputation year to have fully imputed a cash dividend equal to the amount of the bonus issue which is not redeemed in each and every year during the term of the Arrangement. 3. The Board of the Company has been considering ways to maintain the Company distribution policy without reducing its equity base (i.e. ways to make distributions without negatively impacting cashflow). Maintenance of the equity base is a high priority for the Company at the current time due to recent expansion activity undertaken by the Group, including the acquisition of interests in casinos located in Christchurch and Darwin, Australia, an increase in its shareholding in SkyCity Leisure and Riverside Casino, as well as the development of its Adelaide facilities. 4. On 21 February 2005 the Company announced that it would introduce a new dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) under which shareholders may choose to reinvest all or part of their cash dividends in additional shares in the Company. The DRP was available in respect of the interim dividend for the 2005 financial year paid on 1 April 2005. Additional shares issued under the DRP were issued at their market price but in terms of the Offer Document dated 9 March 2005 the Board may determine that the shares will be issued at a discount. The Company has issued 1,212,484 new shares to shareholders under the DRP in respect of the dividend of $0.12 per share paid on 1 April 2005. These new shares represent 0.289 percent of the ordinary shares in the Company. 5. The Board has been considering an alternative mechanism that would encourage share uptake while still giving those shareholders who require a cashflow a mechanism by which to receive cash. Under the proposed plan bonus shares will be issued to all shareholders. The default option under the plan would be that shareholders retain the shares. It is intended that the Arrangement would continue in effect for an indefinite period in order to build up the shareholder equity base to a satisfactory level. 6. The estimated maximum amount which would be paid by the Company in respect of the redemption of shares under each bonus issue would be 5 percent of the market value of all shares in the Company. Details of proposed bonus issue 7. The Company will issue a notice to shareholders informing them that they will be issued with bonus shares. The shares will be ordinary shares. The number of shares that a shareholder would receive would be based on: (i) the net amount the shareholder would have received if the Company had declared and paid a cash dividend rather than proceeding with the bonus issue; and (ii) the weighted average of the Company’s share price for the five trading days following the relevant record date, less a discount of not more than 5% (and excluding brokerage fees). The discount will be included in the calculation to encourage share retention. 8. The number of bonus shares to be issued to a shareholder would be calculated in accordance with the following formula: 2 Number of shares = S x A P x D where: S is the number of ordinary shares in the Company held by the shareholder before the bonus issue; A is the amount per share (expressed in cents and fractions of cents (after deduction of any amounts of resident withholding, or other, taxes, if any)) which would have been distributed to the shareholder if the Company had instead made a cash distribution; P is the weighted average sale price for the Company’s shares (expressed in cents and fractions of cents) based on trades of those shares on the NZSX on the five trading days immediately following the relevant record date; and D is calculated as (1 – Discount) expressed as a decimal. (A mechanism for “roundings” will also be included in the above calculation.) 9. At the same time shareholders will be notified that the Company will provide an off-market facility available to allow shareholders to make an election to redeem their bonus shares for the equivalent cash value. The option to redeem will be made available at the time of notification of the issue of the bonus shares. The aggregate buyback price for a shareholder’s bonus shares would be the number of shares issued to the shareholder multiplied by “(P x D)” in the above calculation. 10. The discount to be applied will depend on the market at the time of the announcement and will consequently be flexible depending on anticipated market reaction. The higher the discount the more likely shareholders will retain the shares. Conversely where the discount is too low there is less incentive to retain the shares. The Directors, in determining the level of discount, have sought to be fair to all shareholders by determining a rate which favours retention but does not appear to harshly penalise shareholders (through dilution) who have primarily invested for the regular cash flow.. 11. The approximate timetable for each bonus issue and buy back (based on NZ Companies Act and NZSX Listing Rule requirements) would be as follows: Day 1 Notice to NZX and ASX of proposed bonus issue (Appendix 7 NZSX Rules and ASX equivalent) including notice of value of bonus shares to be issued (as a $ value per share held). Day 15 (first Friday at least 10 business days after Day 1) 3 Record date for Bonus Share entitlement. Day 22 (5 business days after Day 15) Determination of strike price for determining number of bonus shares to issue and resulting bonus share ratio. Day 26 (say 4 days after day 22) Details of bonus shares to be issued and buyback offer sent to shareholders. Shareholders given 14 days to elect whether to accept buy back offer. Day 41 (15 days after Shareholders notified) Date for shareholder acceptances of buy back offer. Day 43 Issue of Bonus Shares and completion of buyback. Day 45 Holding statements and payment cheque distributed. Reasons for the structure of the Arrangement 12. The commercial advantages which the Company seeks to achieve from the Arrangement are as follows: a) The reduction of the amount of the net cash outflow: b) The maintenance as much as possible of the Company’s equity base in light of the recent and planned business expansions; c) The maintenance of the Company’s policy of making two distributions a year to shareholders; d) The provision of a mechanism for those shareholders who wish their share of profits to be retained within the Company: e) The prevention of any negative impact on the Company’s share price; f) Due to the decrease in the dividends paid by the Company, the reduction of the amount of imputation credits used. g) The provision of a mechanism for those shareholders who wish to receive cash. 4 13. The Company considers that, as with many New Zealand stock exchange listed companies, its dividend policy and perceptions of its dividend policy has a direct impact on the share price of the Company. The Company has historically maintained a bi-annual high yield dividend policy. As a result investors who require an income stream from their investments may be attracted to invest in the Company. The level of capital growth in the Company, however also may make it attractive to shareholders who are seeking a capital gain. The Company considers that if the redemption option were not available material numbers of shareholders, requiring income from their shares, might seek to exit the stock, thereby having a negative impact on share price. Historically where a Company has reduced its dividend payout ratio this has had a negative impact on the share price. 14. The share issue has been structured to maximise the proportion of shares retained. The Arrangement operates so as to issue shares to all shareholders and give them the option of redeeming within a set period. Shareholders would have two weeks to decide whether to accept the offer to redeem the shares. The Company considers that if shareholders are required to apply for redemption of the shares, the level of share uptake should increase as the default result for shareholders who do not act will be that they retain the shares. 15. The Company also considers that a bonus issue in lieu would be less well received by its shareholders and the investment market in general than the Arrangement. The Company considers, on reasonable grounds, that denying shareholders who do not respond to the notice of a bonus issue within a specified timeframe the opportunity to receive cash is unlikely to be viewed favourably by shareholders. 16. The market reaction to the change in policy is unknown but the Company would anticipate that approximately 40 – 50 percent of the amount of the bonus issue would be retained by shareholders. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The Company will not elect that the bonus issue will be treated as a “taxable bonus issue” (as defined in section OB 1). b) For the purpose of the Companies Act 1993 and the NZX Listing Rulings the Arrangement is a pro rata bonus issue to all existing shareholders followed by an acquisition by the Company of its own shares. c) During the period of this Ruling the Company will have sufficient imputation credits in its imputation credit account at the end of each imputation year to have fully imputed a cash dividend equal to the amount of the bonus issue which is not redeemed in each and every year during the term of the Arrangement. 5 d) The advantages that the Company is seeking to obtain from implementing the Arrangement are as set out in paragraph 12 of this Ruling. e) The primary reason that the Company has chosen to implement this Arrangement as compared to other similar arrangements, such as its existing DRP, is that it considers, on reasonable grounds, that it will result in materially more shares being retained by shareholders, and thus greater funds retained by the Company, than under alternative available arrangements, and the Company has no advice or information contrary to or inconsistent with this that has not been disclosed to the Rulings Unit. This has the purpose of enabling the Company to retain profits for the expansion of its business and encouraging and maximising the retention of bonus shares while preventing any negative impact on the Company’s share price and preventing any negative perceptions by the market of the Company’s profit distribution policy. f) The Company has not taken individual shareholders’ tax consequences into account in deciding to implement this Arrangement. g) The Company has disclosed to the Rulings Unit all advice, analysis or other documentation relating to the purposes and advantages of implementation of this Arrangement. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The bonus issue is a non-taxable bonus issue (as defined in section OB 1) and does not constitute dividends as defined in sections CD 3(1), CD 4(1) and CD 5(1). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 5 December 2005 and ending on 31 March 2009. This Ruling is signed by me on the 5th day of December 2005. Howard Davis Senior Tax Counsel 6
PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 05/08 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by SkyCity Consolidated Group – IRD No 63-352- 039 Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: • Section CB 1, • Section CB 2; • Section CB 3; • Section CB 4; • Section CD 2; • Section CD 3(1); • Section CD 4(1); • Section CD 5(1); • Section CD 14; • Section CD 21; • Section CD 42; • Section FC 4; • Section GC 22; • Section LB 1; • Section LB 2. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the issue of bonus shares by SkyCity Entertainment Group Ltd (“the Company”) and the offer by the Company of an option to redeem the shares where shareholders elect to redeem the shares. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The Company, a member of the SkyCity Consolidated Group (“the Group”), is a public company. The Company was incorporated in New Zealand. The Company has in excess of twenty thousand ordinary shareholders, a very small percentage of whom are likely to be taxable at the 39% marginal income tax rate. 2. The Company typically distributes two dividends a year to shareholders - an interim dividend paid in April and a final dividend paid in October. Until April 2005 dividends were paid in cash without a reinvestment option. The Company has previously fully imputed all dividends paid and will continue to do so in the period for which this Ruling applies. At the time the Company pays dividends it has often not had sufficient imputation credits in its imputation credit account to fully impute the dividends. In these circumstances it has paid further income tax sufficient to ensure there is not a debit balance in its imputation credit account at year end and it will continue, if necessary, to pay further income tax during the period for which this Ruling applies so that it will have sufficient imputation credits in its imputation credit account at the end of each imputation year to have fully imputed a cash dividend equal to the amount of the bonus issue which is not redeemed in each and every year during the term of the Arrangement. 3. The Board of the Company has been considering ways to maintain the Company distribution policy without reducing its equity base (i.e. ways to make distributions without negatively impacting cashflow). Maintenance of the equity base is a high priority for the Company at the current time due to recent expansion activity undertaken by the Group, including the acquisition of interests in casinos located in Christchurch and Darwin, Australia, an increase in its shareholding in SkyCity Leisure and Riverside Casino, as well as the development of its Adelaide facilities. 4.

The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 5 December 2005 and ending on 31 March 2009.

How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The bonus issue is a non-taxable bonus issue (as defined in section OB 1) and does not constitute dividends as defined in sections CD 3(1), CD 4(1) and CD 5(1). • Amounts derived by shareholders from the sale of bonus shares are not gross income under sections CB 2, CB 3, CB 4 or CB 5 where each of the following apply: a) The shareholder is not dealing in shares; and b) The sale of shares is not part of any business carried on by the shareholder; and c) The shareholder did not acquire the shareholder’s original shares for the purpose of sale and at the time the original shares were acquired, 6 the shareholder did not know that bonus shares would be issued by the Company. • The bonus shares will have a nil cost for the purposes of Part E and section EA 2. No deduction will be allowable to shareholders in respect of the bonus shares unless: • Bonus shares are trading stock or revenue account property of a shareholder; and • The value of the bonus shares is taken into account in determining the shareholder’s opening stock for the purpose of section EA 1(2) and (3) or in allocating an allowable deduction under section EA 2. in which event a deduction will be allowable to the extent that a cost is attributed to the bonus shares, from the cost basis of other shares held by the shareholder, under one of the cost flow methods specified in section EB 7. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 5 December 2005 and ending on 31 March 2009. This Ruling is signed by me on the 5th day of December 2005. Howard Davis Senior Tax Counsel 7
PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 06/01 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by LetterBox Channel Limited (“LBC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of New Zealand Post Limited. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 (“the ITA”) unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections DA 2(4), CE 1 ; definitions of “employment income”, “extra pay”, “income from employment”, “salary or wages”, and “withholding payment” in section OB 1 ; the definition of “source deduction payment” in section OB 2(1); the definition of “PAYE rules” in section OB 1 , regulation 4(1) and clause 5(d) of Part A of the Schedule to The Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 (“the Regulations”); and section 6(3)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“The GST Act”). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the engagement of persons (“the Runners”) by Franchisees pursuant to a standard form contract for the delivery of newspapers, leaflets, brochures, catalogues, advertising material, samples and other such items to households and other premises throughout New Zealand. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. LBC carries on the business of distributing newspapers, leaflets, brochures, catalogues, advertising material, samples and other such items to households and other premises throughout New Zealand. 2. LBC intends to implement a franchise model under which Franchisees will engage the Runners pursuant to a standard form contract, the conditions contained in which are required to be agreed to by the Runners when entering into the contact (“the Contract”). 3. The Contract requires Runners to deliver particular items within a specified period, to each house, flat or other premises located within a designated area, by placing one of each item in each letter box (or other specified location). The Runners are paid specified rates per item delivered. 4. The Contract is attached to this Ruling as Appendix I. 5. The items delivered by the Runners pursuant to the Contract are not items the carrying of which requires LBC or the relevant Franchisee to be registered as a postal operator under the Postal Services Act 1998. Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: • The relationship between a Franchisee and the Runners is, and during the period of this Ruling will continue to be, entirely in accordance with the Contract affixed to this Ruling as Appendix I, and there are no other collateral contracts, agreements, terms or conditions, written or otherwise, relating to the engagement of the Runners. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • For the purposes of the PAYE rules, any payment made to a Runner by a Franchisee pursuant to the Contract will not be “salary or wages” or “extra pay” within the meaning of those terms as defined in section OB 1. To the extent that any such payment is also not a “withholding payment” it will therefore not be a “source deduction payment” as defined in section OB 2(1), for the purposes of the PAYE rules. • For the purposes of sections DA 2(4) and CE 1 , any payment made to a Runner by a Franchisee pursuant to the Contract will not be “income from employment’ or “employment income” as those terms are defined in section OB 1. • For the purposes of the PAYE rules, any payment made to a Runner by a Franchisee pursuant to the Contract will not be a “withholding payment” as defined in section OB 1. • For the purposes of the PAYE rules, any payment made to a Runner by a Franchisee pursuant to the Contract will not fall within the class of payment specified in clause 5(d) of Part A of the Schedule to the Regulations and will not be declared to be a “withholding payment” by regulation 4(1) of the Regulations. • For the purposes of the GST Act, the provision of services by any Runner to a Franchisee under the Contract will not be excluded from the definition of “taxable activity” in section 6 of that Act by section 6(3)(b) of that Act. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2011 This Ruling is signed on the 8 day of March 2006 by: Maryanne Hansen Manager, Corporates Appendix 1 «Fr\_Co\_Name» FRANCHISEE LIMITED CONTRACT FOR SERVICES (Delivery of papers/circulars etc) The delivery of circulars has become part of our Kiwi culture.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 06/02 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by LetterBox Channel Limited (“LBC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of New Zealand Post Limited. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 (“the ITA”) unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections DA 2(4), CE 1 ; definitions of “employment income”, “extra pay”, “income from employment”, “salary or wages”, and “withholding payment” in section OB 1 ; the definition of “source deduction payment” in section OB 2(1); the definition of “PAYE rules” in section OB 1 , regulation 4(1) and clause 5(d) of Part A of the Schedule to The Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 (“the Regulations”); and section 6(3)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (‘The GST Act’). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the engagement of persons (“the Supervisors”) by Franchisees pursuant to a standard form contract for facilitation of the distribution of circular advertising, free newspapers and samples etc, through the management of Runners and administration of the services provided by the Franchisee to its clients. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. LBC carries on the business of distributing newspapers, leaflets, brochures, catalogues, advertising material, samples and other such items (unaddressed mail) to households and other premises throughout New Zealand. 2. LBC intends to implement a franchise model under which Franchisees will engage the Supervisors pursuant to a standard form contract, the conditions contained in which are required to be agreed to by the Supervisors when entering into the contact (“the Contract”). 3. The Contract requires Supervisors to facilitate the distribution of the unaddressed mail through oversight of Runners and administration of the delivery services provided by the Franchisee. The Supervisors are paid specified rates for the services they provide. 4. Supervisors will essentially fall into two categories: (a) those that are engaged by a Franchisee to operate in rural and regional towns where the Franchisee is not based (“Remote Town locations”); and (b) those that are engaged by a Franchisee to operate in cities and towns where the Franchisee is based (“Base City locations”). 5. Supervisors in Remote Town locations will own and supply all the equipment necessary to perform the services, and they are likely to have other business interests in addition to their role as a Supervisor in a Remote Town location. Franchisees will engage these Supervisors pursuant to the Contract. 6. Supervisors in Base City locations will usually either: (a) be “Labour Processing Supervisors” (i.e. provide the processing and administrative services listed at Schedule 1 of the Contract); or (b) be “Physical Transport Supervisors” (i.e. provide the collection, transportation and physical delivery services listed at Schedule 1 of the Contract). 7. The Labour Processing Supervisors are unlikely to be suited to an independent contractor relationship, as their role will likely be of a full time nature situated at the Franchisee’s premises, primarily under the instruction of the Franchisee. Franchisees will usually engage these Supervisors as employees. 8. However, the nature of the activities undertaken by Physical Transport Supervisors would be suited to independent contractor relationships. For Base City Locations, the collection and delivery services will be significant due to the high number of runs in these locations. It is likely that a Franchisee will contract multiple Physical Transport Supervisors due to the volume and time factors. This will generally not be a full time role for these Supervisors. They will own and supply all the equipment necessary to perform the services, and they are likely to have other business interests in addition to their role as a Physical Transport Supervisor. Accordingly, Franchisees will engage these Supervisors pursuant to the Contract. 9. The Contract is affixed to this Ruling as Appendix I. 10. The items, the collection and delivery of which is managed by the Supervisor pursuant to the Contract, are not items the carriage of which requires LBC or the relevant Franchisee to be registered as a postal operator under the Postal Services Act 1998. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: • The relationship between a Franchisee and the Supervisor is, and during the period of this Ruling will continue to be, entirely in accordance with the Contract affixed to this Ruling as Appendix I, and there are no other collateral contracts, agreements, terms or conditions, written or otherwise, relating to the engagement of the Supervisor. • LBC has identified that Franchisees may engage Supervisors to carry out certain processing and administrative services on terms which, at law, should be characterised as a contract of service. In particular, paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Arrangement set out an example of such an arrangement, being the engagement of Labour Processing Supervisors in Base City locations which may not be suited to an independent contractor relationship. This Ruling does not apply to Labour Processing Supervisors in Base City locations who have entered into the Contract but who, at law, are employees carrying out the services under a contract of service. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • For the purposes of the PAYE rules, any payment made to a Supervisor by a Franchisee pursuant to the Contract will not be “salary or wages” or “extra pay” within the meaning of those terms as defined in section OB 1. To the extent that any such payment is also not a “withholding payment” it will therefore not be a “source deduction payment” as defined in section OB 2(1), for the purposes of the PAYE rules. • For the purposes of sections DA 2(4) and CE 1 , any payment made to a Supervisor by a Franchisee pursuant to the Contract will not be “income from employment’ or “employment income” as those terms are defined in section OB 1. • For the purposes of the PAYE rules, any payment made to a Supervisor by a Franchisee pursuant to the Contract will not be a “withholding payment’ as defined in section OB 1. • For the purposes of the PAYE rules, any payment made to a Supervisor by a Franchisee pursuant to the Contract will not fall within the class of payment specified in clause 5(d) of Part A of the Schedule to the Regulations and will not be declared to be a “withholding payment” by regulation 4(1) of the Regulations • For the purposes of the GST Act, the provision of services by any Supervisor to a Franchisee under the Contract will not be excluded from the definition of “taxable activity” in section 6 of that Act by section 6(3)(b) of that Act. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2011 This Ruling is signed by me on the 8 day of March 2006. Maryanne Hansen Manager, Corporates Appendix 1 «FR\_CO\_NAME» FRANCHISEE LIMITED CONTRACT FOR SERVICES (Supervise delivery of papers/circulars etc) The delivery of circulars is part of our Kiwi culture.

The fees specified in Schedule 2 are the only amounts payable to you in respect of the Services and are inclusive of all taxes (except GST) and other duties or levies. In the event of any dispute over invoiced services «FR\_CO\_NAME» may withhold the portion of the invoice that relates to the dispute pending resolution, provided that this facility shall not be used as a penalty and shall reflect only the relative value of the contracted services in dispute.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 06/03 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Westpac Banking Corporation (“Westpac”), BT Financial Group (NZ) Limited (“BT”) and Westpac New Zealand Limited (“Newco”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BD 3, BG 1, CA 1, CE 1, CE 5, GB 1, GC 17 and the definitions of “salary or wages”, “extra pay”, “withholding payment” (in section OB 1) and “source deduction payment” (in section OB 2). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of childcare services (referred to as the “Westpac Child Care Centre Benefit”) by Westpac, the parent company of BT and Newco, to employees of the Westpac Group (which for the purposes of this Ruling is defined to mean Westpac, BT, and Newco), on Westpac’s premises. Westpac, BT and Newco will not charge employees for the cost of the childcare services and the services will be provided as a benefit to employees in addition to the salary or wages normally paid to such employees. Employees will enter into a salary reduction agreement with their respective employer, modifying the existing employment contract, pursuant to which an employee’s pre-tax salary will be reduced by an amount equivalent to the value of the childcare services provided to that employee by Westpac. BT and Newco will pay Westpac for the cost of the childcare services provided to their respective employees. This agreement will be legally effective so as to operate as a contractually binding and enforceable agreement to reduce the amount of pre-tax salary by the value of the childcare services provided. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. 1. Westpac, BT and Newco satisfy the section IG 1(2) definition of “group of companies”. 2. 2. Westpac will enter into a management agreement with ABC Developmental Learning Centres (NZ) Ltd (“ABC”), the draft of which was provided to the Rulings Unit on 11 November 2005. Pursuant to this management agreement, ABC is to provide childcare management services at each childcare centre to Westpac. Westpac will provide a licence of the premises to ABC to enable ABC to carry out its obligations to Westpac. 3. 3. Westpac has been planning for some time to provide childcare centres to be made available to its employees, to enable employees in the Westpac Group to achieve a better work/life balance. Westpac is committed to providing childcare services to employees of the Westpac Group, as this is of obvious benefit to its employees and also because it is consistent with Government policies to achieve greater participation in the workforce for employees with children. It is also expected that the provision of childcare services will have flow-on commercial benefits for Westpac in the form of a higher level of employee satisfaction with Westpac as a employer and a resulting improvement in employee morale and retention. 4. 4. In 2004 Westpac entered into negotiations with ABC Learning Centres Limited (“ABC Learning”), an experienced operator of childcare facilities in Australia. Westpac and ABC Learning entered into a memorandum of understanding to provide the framework for negotiating a more detailed management agreement. This memorandum of understanding was dated 29 November 2004, and was provided to the Rulings Unit on 11 November 2005. 5. 5. It is intended that Westpac will establish a pilot site, to be operational in 2006, in Auckland, Wellington or Christchurch. It is expected that childcare centres will be established in the other two cities shortly after the pilot site becomes operational. It is possible that Westpac may establish childcare centres in other cities. Westpac sent out a request for employees to register their interest for the planned childcare centres. As a result of this request, 196 employees registered their interest in respect of a total of 227 children. Registrations of interest for 91 of these children were for the Auckland childcare centre, 80 for the Wellington childcare centre, and 56 for the Christchurch childcare centre. 6. 6. Westpac and ABC Learning entered into the memorandum of understanding to provide a framework for negotiating the terms of a management agreement between ABC and Westpac, pursuant to which Westpac will contract with ABC for ABC to provide, on Westpac’s behalf, quality tailored childcare management services on Westpac’s premises, for the benefit of New Zealand employees in the Westpac Group. 7. 7. The memorandum of understanding is no more than a commitment by the parties to negotiate the terms of a more detailed management agreement and, consequently, the memorandum of understanding does not deal in any detail with the nature of the arrangement to be entered into between Westpac and ABC. .8. Since entering into the memorandum of understanding, the parties have negotiated a detailed management agreement, including schedules, dealing .with various aspects of the operation of the childcare centres to be established by Westpac. (As noted above, a draft form of this management agreement was provided to the Rulings Unit on 11 November 2005). In addition, Westpac has prepared a salary reduction agreement (also provided on 11 November 2005), which contains the terms on which Westpac will provide childcare services to its employees. Westpac provided an amended version of the salary reduction agreement on 1 May 2006, incorporating the adjustment for accrued leave referred to in paragraph 32 below. The same form of salary reduction agreement (with some modifications) will be used for BT’s and Newco’s employees. .9. Broadly, the management agreement: .(i) sets out the agreed services to be provided by ABC, on behalf of Westpac (refer Schedule 1 of the agreement), and the applicable service standards; .(ii) provides that ABC is responsible for the day-to-day administration of each centre and dealing with parents in relation to children at the centre; .(iii) requires that each childcare centre be licensed at all times (and that ABC will be required to apply for the licence for each childcare centre), and that ABC will comply at all times with its obligations under the Education (Early Childhood Centres) Regulations 1998; .(iv) requires that ABC will indemnify Westpac for any breach of the Regulations and other applicable regulatory requirements; and .(v) provides for termination rights, including termination at Westpac’s discretion. 8. 10. The management agreement contemplates that there will be a separate licence agreement for each childcare centre, which will outline the terms of the licence to be provided by Westpac to ABC, to enable ABC to carry out its obligations under the management agreement at a particular site. 9. 11. Westpac and ABC will co-operate to identify and develop suitable sites as childcare centres, pursuant to clause 4 of the management agreement and in accordance with Schedule 7. When a suitable site has been identified and developed as a childcare centre, Westpac will take a lease of the site (if Westpac does not own or already lease the site), Westpac and ABC will enter into a site licence in respect of that site and ABC will then commence providing the childcare services, on behalf of Westpac to Westpac Group’s employees, through the childcare centre at that site. ABC will be required to pay a licence fee to Westpac. .12. The Auckland District Law Society model lease (4 th Edition) is intended to be the form of lease that Westpac will use for a childcare centre. However, the provisions relating to the “Guarantor” (who would normally guarantee the .lessee’s obligations) will be deleted from the lease agreement. In addition, the lease agreement will be subject to any amendments negotiated with the owner of the premises. It is possible that the owner of the premises may have its own form of lease agreement, in which case Westpac would negotiate over the terms of that lease agreement. Any such lease agreement entered into will be a standard and conventional lease that is on arm’s length and commercial terms. 10. 13. The signage on each childcare centre is likely to incorporate the following information: “\[Location\] Child Care Centre Managed by ABC Corporate Care Pty Ltd A wholly owned subsidiary of ABC Learning Centres” 1. 14. Westpac will incur certain direct costs in relation to each site operated as a childcare centre, which will be principally the costs payable under the lease for the site. Westpac will also incur the cost of any increase in insurance premiums, as a result of the premises being used as a childcare centre, and other costs which Westpac reasonably considers are necessary for the premises to be used as a childcare centre. Westpac will recoup these costs from ABC, by way of the licence fee. The licence fee is to be paid monthly in advance (clause 3.1 of Schedule 2 of the Licence for Use and Occupation of Premises). 2. 15. ABC will charge a fee to Westpac, referred to as the Westpac Usage Fee, in consideration for the services provided by ABC at each childcare centre (clause 6.1(a) of the management agreement). The Westpac Usage Fee is defined, in respect of each childcare centre, as the aggregate of the Child Care Fees in each fortnight for services provided by ABC to each child of a Westpac Group employee enrolled at that centre. The Child Care Fees are calculated in accordance with Schedule 5 of the management agreement. Schedule 5 is divided into two parts. Part A provides how ABC must set the Child Care Fees at each centre. These Child Care Fees are to reflect, in Westpac’s reasonable opinion, market rates. Part B provides how ABC must invoice the Child Care Fees. .16. Although each childcare centre will be a Westpac childcare centre and ABC is to be engaged merely to manage each childcare centre on behalf of Westpac, ABC has negotiated the right to contract directly with members of the public to provide childcare services at the childcare centres. For this purpose members of the public will include Westpac Group employees who are not participating in the Westpac Child Care Centre Benefit (and effectively are non-Westpac Group employees for the purposes of access to each childcare centre). Any such contractual arrangements will be directly between ABC and members of the public and will not involve Westpac Group. The ability to offer places to members of the public was considered important by ABC, to ensure the economic viability of each childcare centre. If there are surplus places at any childcare centre after all participating Westpac Group employees have taken up places, ABC will be able to offer such surplus places to members of the public. As a result it is expected that ABC should be able to operate each childcare centre at full capacity and achieve greater economies of .scale. This should assist with minimising the costs to Westpac of providing childcare services to Westpac Group’s employees. 3. 17. Westpac’s objective in setting up each of the childcare centres is to provide for childcare services for employees of the Westpac Group. Each childcare centre is to have a proposed capacity of 75 children, giving the three childcare centres a total proposed capacity of 225 children (although it is possible that the Auckland childcare centre may have a slightly greater capacity). Based on the 196 employees who registered their interest in respect of a total of 227 children, Westpac’s expectation at the outset of the arrangement is that, over time, an average of at least 50% or more of the total number of children at the three childcare centres will be children of employees of Westpac Group who participate in the Westpac Child Care Centre Benefit. 4. 18. Westpac has not adopted a policy that childcare centres will be closed, if the number of children of Westpac Group employees falls below a certain number. However, where the numbers of children of Westpac Group employees using a particular childcare centre falls to a level where Westpac considers that it no longer fulfils the commercial objectives set out in paragraph 4, Westpac will carry out a review of the viability of that childcare centre and make a decision as to whether to continue to keep the centre operating. 5. 19. Clause 9 of the management agreement regulates the availability of places in a centre between Westpac Group employees and non-Westpac Group employees. Clause 9.1(a) provides that the manager shall ensure that priority of enrolment at each centre is provided to the children of parents employed by Westpac Group, in accordance with the priority access guidelines in schedule 2 to the management agreement. Clause 9.2 provides that where there are vacancies at a centre, the manager may make such vacancies available to children whose parents are not employed by Westpac Group, on terms and conditions no less favourable than the terms and conditions applicable to Westpac employees, but subject always to the application of the guidelines in schedule 2. .20. Schedule 2 is in three parts. Part 1 deals with the allocation of places at a centre between children of Westpac Group employees and non-Westpac Group employees, prior to the centre opening. Part 2 of the schedule sets out the procedures for allocating vacant places at a centre from the date the centre becomes operational. Clause 18 of the schedule provides that once a parent of a non-Westpac Group child has accepted a place at the centre, that child shall be guaranteed continuity of that place as long as required, unless: .(i) the centre is designated as a high use centre under Part 3 of the schedule; and .(ii) the child was aged 2 years or under when the child commenced care and has not yet taken up a place in the 3 year old age group; and .(iii) the centre continues to have a high use designation. 6. 21. Clause 19 of the schedule provides that places made available to children (aged 2 or under when care commenced) of non-Westpac Group employees can be reclaimed for the children of Westpac Group employees on 6 months notice, in the case of centres with a high use designation. Part 3 of the schedule sets out the process for applying a high use designation to a centre. Essentially, Westpac can request that any centre be classified as high use, except if the manager is able to produce evidence that children of Westpac Group employees are taking up less than 75% of the available places at the centre. 7. 22. The management agreement makes it clear that the manager must not collect any childcare fees directly from any Westpac employee (who is participating in the Westpac Child Care Centre Benefit) who has children at a childcare centre (clause 6.3(a)). The manager must also ensure that priority of enrolment at any childcare centre is provided to the children of parents who are employees of Westpac Group. Any disputes regarding priority of enrolments shall be determined by Westpac, in accordance with an enrolment policy to be formulated by Westpac (clause 9.1). 8. 23. Westpac’s right to terminate the management agreement or any site licence is provided for in clause 15.2 and clause 15.3. In addition to having the right to terminate the management agreement or any site licence if the manager is in breach, Westpac has an absolute discretion to terminate the agreement or any site licence, on giving 60 days’ written notice to ABC. 9. 24. The structure of the arrangement, as reflected in the management agreement, is as follows. Westpac wishes to provide childcare facilities to its employees and wishes to be able to control the quality and the continuance of those services. Westpac will be able to control the quality and the continuation of the services by having control of the premises as lessee, and by setting the operational standards in the management agreement. If the manager breaches the operational standards, Westpac can terminate the manager’s site licence and arrange for another provider of childcare services to manage the particular childcare centre. Also, if for any other reason Westpac is unhappy with the level of services provided by the manager, Westpac has a complete discretion to terminate either the management agreement in its entirety or any particular site licence. Westpac’s control of the premises and control of the manager is intended to minimise any operational and regulatory risks to which Westpac could be exposed through the provision of childcare services to its employees. .25. If Westpac is not the lessee of the premises, Westpac would be subject to the risk that the provision of childcare services through the particular childcare centre would be discontinued if, for example, ABC were to close that childcare centre or if Westpac, for whatever reason, became dissatisfied with ABC’s standard of performance. This would not be an acceptable commercial risk for Westpac, because the discontinuance of the provision of childcare services through the particular childcare centre would have a disproportionately adverse effect on its relationship with its employees, who no doubt would feel considerably let down if the provision of childcare services through a particular childcare centre was discontinued. Westpac is able to remove or at .least control that risk, by having control of the premises and having the ability to terminate the manager’s performance of services at the particular childcare centre (and arranging for a substitute manager to carry on providing the services at the particular centre). 10. 26. If any of Newco’s or BT’s employees wish to take up a place at a childcare centre Newco/BT will arrange with Westpac for Westpac to provide the necessary childcare services to those employees. That company will pay Westpac for the cost of the childcare services. 11. 27. The salary reduction agreement serves two purposes. First, the agreement modifies the terms and conditions of an employee’s employment contract with Westpac/BT/Newco by providing for a salary reduction. Secondly, the agreement sets out the terms of the childcare benefit available to employees. 12. 28. Under clause 3 of the agreement, an employee’s pre-tax salary for future pay periods is reduced by a specified amount, being the amount identified in the application form to be completed by each employee. The amount of the reduction may be adjusted if childcare fees are increased or the employee requires additional childcare services, but such adjustments would apply only for future pay periods. Clause 5 stipulates that the salary reduction does not, under any circumstances, create an entitlement or right to any monetary sum whatsoever. 13. 29. Under clause 4, Westpac/BT/Newco agrees to provide or procure the provision of childcare services to an employee, equivalent in value to the amount of the reduction in salary, on the terms and conditions set out in the schedules to the agreement. This right to receive childcare services is not transferable by the employee. 14. 30. Schedule 1 contains the formula (refer paragraph 10 of section 1) for calculating the amount of the salary reduction, which is calculated from the number of children that the employee wishes to place at the childcare centre, the Child Care Fees set by ABC for each child and the number of fortnightly periods that the particular childcare centre is treated as open each year. For the purposes of the formula, a childcare centre usually will be treated as open for 26.07 fortnightly periods per year, even though there will be times that the centre will be closed, such as during summer holiday periods. If a childcare centre were to be closed temporarily for an unexpected reason (for example, a fire at the centre), the salary reduction would continue to apply. If an unexpected closure were to continue for an indefinite period, it is likely that Westpac/BT/Newco and the employees would renegotiate the salary reduction pursuant to clause 7 of the agreement. 15. 31. Schedule 1 to the agreement does refer to certain contingencies or consequences of the salary reduction agreement, for example, the position of employees who wish to continue to keep a child or children at a centre during periods of unpaid leave. In such cases, the employee must pay the applicable childcare fees to Westpac/BT/Newco (out of after-tax income). 16. 32. Salary reductions cannot be back-dated and will only apply for future pay periods. As noted in paragraph 18 of schedule 1, an employee cannot elect to reduce a salary, after it has been earned. In particular, employees will not be able to receive the childcare services benefit while taking leave, the entitlement to which accrued before the date of the salary reduction agreement. Employees will be required to pay for the childcare services used while taking leave, the entitlement to which accrued before the date of the salary reduction agreement, by way of an adjustment provided for in the salary reduction agreement. 17. 33. Paragraph 16 in the schedule itemises some of the implications of a salary reduction, including the effect on benefits or insurances, ACC entitlements, liable parent payments and the ability to borrow. 18. 34. An employee shall not be able to reduce his or her salary to a level which would be in breach of any applicable minimum wage laws or other legislative requirements. 19. 35. The maximum percentage of salary that an employee is able to sacrifice is based on the policy of Westpac Australia. This policy sets a maximum salary sacrifice of the lower of 40% of gross salary and $40,000. 20. 36. Employees can only enter into a salary sacrifice agreement in respect of children for whom the employee has legal responsibility (for example, natural or adopted children, or children of whom the employee is the legal guardian). 21. 37. This Ruling only applies to the Arrangement in so far as it relates to the provision of childcare services by Westpac to employees of Westpac, BT and Newco on Westpac’s premises. Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: a) The maximum level of salary reduction for full time employees is the lower of 40% of gross salary and $40,000. b) The Arrangement will be consistent in all material respects with the following draft or final documents provided to the Rulings Unit: . • the Management Agreement between Westpac Banking Corporation and A.B.C. Learning Centres Limited (ABC) (and the associated Schedules (1,2,4,5,6, and 7)), provided to the Rulings Unit on 11 November 2005; • the Licence for Use and Occupation of Premises between Westpac Banking Corporation and A.B.C. Corporate Care Pty Limited (which comprises Schedule 3 to the Management Agreement between Westpac Banking Corporation and A.B.C. as noted above), provided to the Rulings Unit on 11 November 2005; and the amendment made in respect of this document which was provided to the Rulings Unit on 15 June 2006; . • the Memorandum of Understanding between Westpac Banking Corporation and ABC Learning Centres Limited, provided to the Rulings Unit on 11 November 2005; . • the amended Salary Reduction Agreement, provided to the Rulings Unit on 1 May 2006; and . • the Childcare Services Agreement between Westpac Banking Corporation and BT Financial Group provided to the Rulings Unit on 15 March 2006. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: . • The amount of the reduction in salary agreed to by employees of Westpac, Newco and BT pursuant to the salary reduction agreement, the childcare services supplied by Westpac, and the payments by Westpac to ABC under the management agreement, are not income of those employees under sections BD 3, CA 1(2), CE 1 and CE 5 and are not “salary or wages”, “extra pay” or a “withholding payment” (as defined in section OB 1) and are not “source deduction payments” (as defined in section OB 2) . • Section GC 17 does not apply to the Arrangement. . • Sections BG 1 and GB 1 do not apply to vary or negate the above conclusions. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 7 July 2006 and ending on 6 July 2009. This Ruling is signed by me on the 7 th day of July 2006. Howard Davis Senior Tax Counsel
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 06/04 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by TOWER Consolidated Group. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of the definition of “dividend” as defined in subpart CD of the Income Tax Act 2004. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the demerger of the Australian business of the TOWER group. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. Rename Andric Pty Limited The parent of a significant proportion of the Australian operations of TOWER Limited, Andric Pty Limited, will be renamed TOWER Australia Group Limited (“TAGL”). Andric Pty Limited is wholly owned by TOWER Limited subsidiary TOWER Group Network Ltd (“TGN”). The renamed TAGL is the company that will be transferred to TOWER Limited shareholders and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. It will leave the TOWER Limited group as part of the demerger. 2. Restructuring to ensure that all Australian entities are held via TAGL The restructure will require the sale of TOWER Holdings Australia Pty Limited by its New Zealand parent TOWER Insurance Group Limited to TAGL. Following the restructuring, TAGL will hold the existing Australian operations of TOWER Limited, namely TOWER Retail Life, TOWER Alliances & Group Life and TOWER Australia Investments. TOWER Limited (to be renamed TOWER New Zealand after the demerger) will continue to own TOWER Limited’s New Zealand operations, which include TOWER Health & Life, TOWER General Insurance and TOWER Investments. It will retain its listing on the New Zealand and Australian stock exchanges. 3. Shareholder approval A shareholders’ meeting to approve the proposed demerger will be held on 6 November 2006. The arrangement will take effect only if it is approved by a special resolution of TOWER Limited shareholders (i.e. 75% of shareholders voting, either in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ person or by proxy). 4. Agreement to acquire shares in TAGL TOWER Limited will enter into an agreement to acquire the shares in TAGL from its wholly owned subsidiary TGN. The agreement will permit TOWER Limited to direct TGN to distribute the shares in TAGL on a pro rata basis directly to TOWER Limited’s shareholders on its behalf. 5. Buy back of TOWER Limited shares, using TAGL shares as consideration and subsequent cancellation of repurchased TOWER Limited shares A court order will be sought to direct TGN to transfer the shares in TAGL to the shareholders in TOWER Limited pursuant to the above agreement. The current proposal provides that TOWER Limited will transfer all of its 234.3 million shares in TAGL to TOWER Limited shareholders on a pro rata basis of 0.6511 TAGL shares for every TOWER Limited share held, and, in return for that transfer, cancel 0.4760 TOWER Limited shares for every TOWER Limited share held. TOWER Limited intends to round fractional entitlements (with 0.5 being rounded up). At the conclusion of the exercise, TOWER Limited shareholders will hold TAGL shares and a reduced number of TOWER Limited shares. 6. TAGL issues entitlements to subscribe for TAGL shares Following the demerger, TAGL will raise A$160 million of new equity. This capital raising will be by way of an Entitlement Offer in which TAGL shareholders will be provided with an Entitlement to buy 0.4269 TAGL shares for every TAGL share held. The Entitlement Offer is to be fully underwritten by Guinness Peat Group plc. The rights are renounceable by the TAGL shareholders and can be traded on the Australian Stock Exchange. In addition to the special resolution required above, the proposal will not proceed unless there is approval by ordinary resolution (50% or more of the votes cast by shareholders voting at the Special Meeting) to the GPG underwriting agreement. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: (a) All TOWER Limited shares cancelled as part of the Arrangement will be ordinary listed shares of the same class issued by TOWER Limited, and will each be cancelled in whole, not in part. (b) A market value circumstance will not exist at the time of the cancellation. (c) The aggregate amount payable by TOWER Limited to its shareholders on account of the cancellation will be equal to or greater than 15 percent of the market value of all ordinary shares issued by TOWER Limited at the time the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ company first notified shareholders of the proposed cancellation, which was 8 August 2006. (d) TOWER Limited will not issue shares (as defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004) in connection with, or as a consequence of, the demerger. (e) The aggregate amount of available subscribed capital of TOWER Limited per share cancelled, at the time of the cancellation, will not be less than the amount distributed on cancellation. (f) The demerger Arrangement (including the factual and accounting basis on which it is entered into) when completed does not differ materially from the proposal provided to Inland Revenue and set out in the material supplied. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The pro rata share cancellation by TOWER Limited, where TAGL shares are distributed to shareholders, does not constitute a “dividend” as defined in subpart CD of the Income Tax Act 2004. • The Commissioner is satisfied that the cancellation is not in lieu of the payment of a dividend under section CD 14(8). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 20/11/2006 to 31/03/2007. This Ruling is signed by me on the 18 th day of September 2006.

PRODUCT RULING – BR Prd 07/01 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by the Bank of New Zealand. Taxation Laws This Ruling applies in respect of: (a) sections BG 1, CC 7, EW 15, EW 31, GB 1, NF 1, NF 2, NG 1 and NG 8 of the Income Tax Act 2004; and (b) sections 86F and 86I of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971; and (c) the section 2 definition of “disposition of property” in the Estate and Gift Duty Act 1968. Legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is a new product (“TotalMoney”) that Bank of New Zealand (“BNZ”) will offer to customers. TotalMoney involves the creation of new types of accounts which must be in a group of accounts, and the facility to elect to group any number of these new types of accounts into one or more groups for the purpose of either “pooling” or “offsetting” the account balances. “Pooling” involves the aggregation of account credit balances for the purpose of determining the interest rate that will apply to the calculation and crediting of interest to each account balance. “Offsetting” involves the aggregation of account balances for the purpose of calculating the amount of interest debited to a lending facility account balance. Further details of the Arrangement are set out below. 1. Customers in general have a range of accounts with BNZ, including current accounts, savings accounts, and various loans. TotalMoney offers new types of accounts, and the ability effectively to treat a group of these accounts in a collective or aggregated manner. TotalMoney is based around the concept of a group of new accounts, which will comprise new transaction accounts that can also be used for savings purposes (“transaction accounts”) and which can include new lending facility account(s) (“loan accounts”). 2. Transaction accounts will provide full deposit and withdrawal facilities through all existing channels providing ready access to funds including via EFTPOS, direct debits, automatic payments, internet and phone banking systems. An overdraft facility may be made available for a transaction account. 3. Loan accounts will be table and non-table home loans. 4. To participate in TotalMoney, these new transaction accounts and loan accounts must be opened by customers, or existing accounts must be converted into these accounts, and all the accounts must be in a group of accounts. The customer elects which accounts will be in which group, and for each group whether the accounts will be “pooled” or “offset”. 5. Under the terms and conditions applicable to TotalMoney, TotalMoney is not available for business accounts. Primary features of TotalMoney 6. The special features that TotalMoney offers in relation to the accounts within the group are “pooling” and “offsetting”: (a) Pooling The pooling aspect of TotalMoney can operate in circumstances where there are several transaction accounts with credit balances. Interest on these credit balance accounts would be calculated and paid having regard to the cumulative balance of all transaction accounts in the group that are nominated for the pooling feature. Normally interest- bearing accounts attract interest in accordance with interest rate brackets that apply to the balance of its own account. The cumulative balance is calculated purely for the purpose of ascertaining the relevant interest rate tier applicable to the accounts. There is no actual transfer of the separate funds to one account before the interest is calculated. Interest is calculated by reference to the applicable interest rate tier that applies to the accumulated balance. (b) Offsetting With the offset feature of TotalMoney, interest on a loan account within the group would be calculated and paid by the customer on the difference between the loan account balance and the credit balances of transaction accounts in the group that are nominated for the offset feature. Under the terms and conditions agreed between BNZ and its customers for TotalMoney, no interest is paid by BNZ on the credit balances that are “offset” against the loan account. The “offsetting” is purely for the purpose of calculating the balance of the loan account on which interest is payable, or, where the credit balances nominated for the “offset” feature exceed the balance of the loan account, the balance of the credit balances on which interest is receivable. There is no actual transfer of funds, or set-off or “netting” of funds together in an account, or transfer of any interest in or entitlement to funds. 2 7. Every transaction account in TotalMoney group must be selected to either “pool” or “offset”. That is, customers can choose whether (some or all of) their transaction accounts with credit balances are “pooled” (in which case credit interest will be paid by BNZ to those accounts), or “offset” (against the loan account(s)). By default all accounts will be set to the “offset” feature unless changed to “pooled” (by the customer or BNZ on the customer’s instructions). A customer can select and change between an account participating in either the “offset” or “pooling” features at any time for any period. Pooling – further detail 8. BNZ will have a contractual obligation to pay interest to each transaction account with a credit balance participating in the pooling feature, based on the applicable interest rate tier that applies based on the total cumulative balance of all accounts being “pooled”. BNZ will make a separate determination in relation to withholding tax on each interest payment made to each account, in accordance with its usual practice. 9. Account owners will have full deposit and withdrawal access to their transaction accounts. Overdraft facilities may be available in relation to these accounts. However, any overdraft balance is not taken into account for “pooling” purposes, in that debit interest is charged by BNZ in relation to the overdrawn balance of that account. The overdrawn balance does not reduce the “pooled” balance of the accounts with credit balances for the purposes of calculating interest in relation to those accounts. Offsetting – further detail 10. Where one loan account is in the group, the interest payable on the loan account is calculated by reference to the balance of the loan account less the credit balances of accounts set to the “offset” feature. This will be the case as a matter of law (in terms of TotalMoney documentation) and as a matter of practice (in terms of BNZ’s computer system). There is no actual set-off, netting or transfer of funds or transfer of any interest in or entitlement to funds. “Offsetting” occurs before debit or credit interest is calculated. 11. For example, in the case of a loan account which would otherwise be the same as a standard variable rate table home loan facility over 20 years with a “minimum payment”, there will be no provision for the amount of interest saved under “offsetting” to reduce the “minimum payment”. In other words, the effect of “offsetting” is the same as a decrease in the floating interest rate and a decision not to reduce the amount of the “minimum payment” – in either case, the term of the loan is reduced because the principal portion of the payment is effectively increased. (In the case of a non-table loan, interest payments will be reduced by “offsetting”, principal repayments will not change and the loan term will not reduce). 12. Where there is more than one loan account in the group, the default position is that the loan accounts in the group are given a default priority, namely the 3 oldest loan account in the group will receive a higher priority. However, the customer may elect that two or any number of those loan accounts can be prioritised into an order for “offsetting” purposes. The loan account with the highest priority will receive the benefit of “offsetting” first, and it is only where the credit balances of transaction accounts set to offset exceed the balance of that highest priority loan account that the next highest priority loan account balance is offset, and so on. 13. If the total credit balances of the transaction accounts set to “offset” are greater than the total debit balance of loan accounts, credit interest will be applied to the difference and paid pro rata to the credit balance accounts in accordance with the balance of those accounts (essentially in line with the “pooling” feature of TotalMoney). 14. Interest is calculated by BNZ on a daily basis. If, during a month, there is both an entitlement of BNZ to receive interest (where the balance of participating loan accounts exceeds the balance of all transaction accounts set to the offset feature) and at another point in the month an obligation on BNZ to pay interest (if the balance of transaction accounts set to offset exceeds the balance of the relevant loan accounts), then the two interest payments (to and from BNZ) would actually be made, and would not be set-off. Groups 15. TotalMoney is based on a group of participating accounts. A group of participating accounts can only be comprised of multiple accounts owned by customers in the following categories (or subset of these categories): (a) Natural persons An individual, or the individual and joint accounts of married, de facto and civil union couples, and any of their dependent and independent children (including natural children, adopted children, step-children and wards). The accounts of a sole trader used for their business can not be included in this group, however it is noted that the account of an individual (who may be a sole trader) may sometimes be used for business purposes. (b) A company Only the accounts owned by one company can be included in a group of accounts. For example, the accounts of a parent and a subsidiary company or of two associated companies can not be grouped. Any type of company can group their accounts. (c) A trust Only the accounts owned by one trust can be included in a group of accounts. Any type of trust can group their accounts. 4 16. There will be no grouping and pooling or offsetting of accounts in different categories. Residency status 17. Customers may be either resident or non-resident in New Zealand for tax purposes. However, where a group of accounts consists of accounts owned by more than one legal person, either all of those persons must be residents of New Zealand for tax purposes or all of those persons must be non-residents of New Zealand for tax purposes. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: (a) The documentation of the transaction account terms and conditions (as comprised in the documents entitled “Terms and Conditions for your Bank of New Zealand TotalMoney Account” and “Terms and Conditions for your Bank of New Zealand TotalMoney Account for Companies & Trusts”) and of the loan account terms and conditions (as comprised in the documents entitled “Facility Master Agreement” and the “Letter of Advice – TotalMoney Home Loan”) will not be materially different to the draft documentation provided to the Commissioner on 23 February 2007 and 6 December 2006 respectively. (b) There is no arrangement between the customers who have grouped their accounts which provides for the loan account owner(s) to make a payment(s) to the transaction account owner(s) in consideration for the transaction account owner(s) electing the “offset” feature of TotalMoney. For the avoidance of any doubt, a failure to satisfy this condition by the customers who enter into this arrangement means that this ruling does not apply only in relation to that arrangement. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: Gift duty • In relation to a group where the participating accounts are owned by different legal persons, where a credit balance account owned by one person is offset against the loan account balance of another person, with the effect that the interest liability of that other person is less, there is no “disposition of property” for the purposes of section 2 of the Estate and Gift Duty Act 1968 and gift duty cannot apply. 5 Financial arrangements rules • When a credit balance of a transaction account and a debit balance of a loan account are “offset”, there is no amount of consideration paid or payable by virtue of that “offset” for the purposes of the calculation of income and expenditure under sections EW 15 and EW 31 of the “financial arrangements rules” (as defined in section EW 1(2)). Resident withholding tax (“RWT”), non-resident withholding tax (“NRWT”) and approved issuer levy (“AIL”) • Under the “pooling” feature of TotalMoney: o “resident withholding tax” (as defined in section NF 2) and “non-resident withholding tax” (as defined in section NG 2) must be deducted by BNZ from the interest credited to the participating transaction accounts in a group, in accordance with the RWT rules (as defined in section OB 1) and the NRWT rules (as defined in section OB 1); o in relation to an account that is a “registered security” (as defined in section 86F of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 “SCDA”), “approved issuer levy” (as defined in section 86F of the SCDA) may be paid by an “approved issuer” (as defined in section 86F of the SCDA) in relation to the interest credited to that account pursuant to section 86I of the SCDA. • Under the “offsetting” feature of TotalMoney: o There is no payment of or entitlement to “interest” (as defined in section OB 1) in relation to the credit balances of participating transaction accounts in a group, and no obligation to deduct RWT or NRWT or pay AIL, except to the extent that the combined credit balance of those accounts exceeds the combined debit balance of the lending facility accounts. o To the extent that interest is credited to participating transaction accounts in a group: o “resident withholding tax” (as defined in section NF 2) and “non- resident withholding tax” (as defined in section NG 2) must be deducted by BNZ from the interest credited to the participating transaction accounts in a group, in accordance with the RWT rules (as defined in section OB 1) and the NRWT rules (as defined in section OB 1); o in relation to an account that is a “registered security” (as defined in section 86F of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 “SCDA”), “approved issuer levy” (as defined in section 86F of the SCDA) may be paid by an “approved issuer” (as defined in section 86F of the SCDA) in relation to the interest credited to that account pursuant to sections 86F and 86I of the SCDA. 6 Section CC 7 • No income arises under section CC 7 for BNZ or its customers in relation to the Arrangement. Tax avoidance • Section BG 1 does not apply to vary or negate any of the above conclusions. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 12 March 2007 and ending on 31 March 2010. This Ruling is signed by me on the 12th day of March 2007. Martin Smith Chief Tax Counsel 7
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 04/09/2007 1 of 9 PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 07/02 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by ASB NZ Shares Trust. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 3, CD 14 and GB 1(3). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and continued operation of the ASB NZ Shares Trust (the “ASB NZ Trust” or the “Trust” or the “Fund”) pursuant to the Master Deed (which is dated 17 October 1997) (the “Master Deed”), the Establishment Deed (which is also dated 17 October 1997) (the “Establishment Deed”), a “Variation of Master Unit Trust Deed Dated 17 October 1997” (dated 27 April 1999), a Deed of Amendment to ASB NZ Shares Trust Establishment Deed (dated 18 June 2001) and the ASB Unit Trusts Prospectus (dated 6 September 2006). Further details of the arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The ASB NZ Trust is a unit trust pursuant to the Unit Trusts Act 1960 and is a “unit trust” for the purposes of the definition of that term in section OB 1. 2. The trustee of the ASB NZ Trust is Trustees Executors Limited (the “Trustee”). It is registered as a trustee company under the Trustee Companies Act 1967. The manager of the Trust is ASB Group Investments Limited (formerly ASB Investment Services Limited) (the “Manager”), part of the ASB Group of Companies. The beneficial interests in the Trust are divided into units. Each unit confers an equal interest in the Trust, but units do not confer any interest in any particular investment of the Trust. 3. The Applicant has confirmed that the Fund has complied with the previous ruling (BR Prd 04/09). There has been no material change to the management or operation of the Fund. Investment 4. The ASB NZ Trust acts as a special purpose vehicle, which holds units in the AMP Investments’ Tracker Fund (the “AMP Tracker Fund”). Ownership of units in the AMP Tracker Fund enable the ASB NZ Trust to obtain the same financial results through one investment as would be achieved by direct \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 04/09/2007 2 of 9 investment in the securities which make up the NZX50 Index (“the Index”) tracked by the Tracker Fund. 5. ASB selected the AMP Tracker Fund as its underlying investment for the following reasons: • The corporate strength and stability of AMP Limited (“AMP”), and the strong likelihood that AMP would be able to support an index-tracking fund well into the foreseeable future; • AMP’s technical expertise, particularly the investment management skill and capability of AMP Capital Investors (New Zealand) Limited in being able to construct and efficiently manage an index-tracking fund; • The high standard of service provided by AMP eg, regular statements and reporting on the AMP Tracker Fund; good working relationship; and • AMP’s competitive investment management fees resulting in a lower cost to ASB NZ Trust Fund investors in having their funds invested in the AMP Tracker Fund through the ASB NZ Trust. 6. Clauses 3.1 and 3.2 of the ASB NZ Trust’s Establishment Deed state the “investment objectives” of the ASB NZ Trust and identify the “authorised investments” as follows: 3 Investment Policy 3.1 Objectives: The objective of the Trust is to invest in the AMP Investments Tracker Fund, subject to the need for the Trust to hold some cash for liquidity and administrative purposes. The funds of the Trust that are available for investment shall be invested in the AMP Investment Tracker Fund as soon as practicable after receipt by the Trustee. The Trust and the Trustee do not have an intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling AMP Investments’ Tracker Fund units. The Trust and the Trustee do not have an intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling AMP Investments’ Tracker Fund units. 3.2 Authorised Investments: For the purposes of this Trust “Authorised Investments” means: (a) the AMP Investments’ Tracker Fund; (b) cash balances with banks, brokers, agents, funds, including, without limitation, the ASB Money Market Trust, or custodians held for the liquidity and administrative purposes of the Trust referred to at Clause 3.1; 7. Pursuant to the Establishment Deed, the ASB NZ Trust is only authorised to invest contributions from members in: (a) the AMP Tracker Fund and (b) cash investments. The Fund may hold cash investments to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund. The cash investments are held as cash by the Fund in bank deposits. The Fund will hold cash in the following instances: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 04/09/2007 3 of 9 • Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; • Following the sale of AMP Tracker Fund units to meet a request to redeem Trust units in cash; • To make income distributions to unitholders; and • To meet administration expenses of the Fund. 8. It is the intention of the ASB NZ Trust that investment in AMP Tracker Fund units, taking into account the appropriate distribution of excess cash, will be completed on a weekly basis. The level of funds is monitored on a weekly basis and invested if in excess of the cash pool. Funds passed to the Manager are invested in the underlying pool within 24 hours. 9. Under clause 11.3(h) of schedule 1 to the Master Deed the unitholders can sanction any variation of the “authorised investments” of the Trust by extraordinary resolution. However, the Fund intends to maintain its current investment strategy. AMP Tracker Fund 10. The AMP Tracker Fund is a “group investment fund” within the meaning of section OB 1. The AMP Tracker Fund is required to buy and sell shares as required to ensure that it continues to track the Index. The AMP Tracker Fund has a current binding ruling (BR Prv 05/01) which states that such buying and selling is not motivated by any intention to derive a profit or gain from such sales. 11. The ASB NZ Trust will generally distribute to its unitholders part of the distributions it receives from the AMP Tracker Fund six-monthly. To determine the amount of the distribution, the Manager of the ASB NZ Trust will determine the Trust’s “net income” by taking into account, not only the distributions received by the AMP Tracker Fund, but also all costs, charges and expenses due by or to the ASB NZ Trust. 12. The Establishment Deed also provides for special distributions to occur at other times determined by the Manager. However, in the period between receipt of income from the AMP Tracker Fund and any distribution the ASB NZ Trust is required to invest amounts not held for administrative or liquidity purposes in units in the AMP Tracker Fund. 13. The AMP Tracker Fund units will be issued subject to the ordering rule (section CD 14(2)) and may only be redeemed in whole, and not in part. Units in the AMP Tracker Fund are not quoted on any exchange. Suspensions 14. The Fund has not previously suspended redemptions. A suspension from issuing or redeeming units will only occur in exceptional circumstances, being: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 04/09/2007 4 of 9 (1) If a material adverse change in the financial markets occurs, namely, a breakdown in liquidity caused by an act of God or a system failure or a terrorist attack; or (2) If there is a fundamental breakdown in the functioning of financial markets, namely, the failure of pricemaking software; or (3) If it is required so as to avoid a breach of any applicable law. Any such suspension will be for a maximum period of 3 business days, unless the exceptional circumstance giving rise to the need to suspend is beyond the control of the Trustee and Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund and/or the Manager to recover from that event. Redemption of ASB NZ Trust Units 15. The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders, when unitholders wish to redeem or sell their units. The Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool to redeem the units requested and the Fund is unable to borrow to meet the unitholders’ requests. To date, the Manager has not utilised this power. Redemption of AMP Tracker Fund Units 16. When the ASB NZ Trust is required to redeem units in the AMP Tracker Fund, the parcel of securities held by the AMP Tracker Fund attributable to the ASB NZ Trust’s investment can be returned to the ASB NZ Trust. Alternatively, the redemption parcel of securities can be delivered to the AMP Tracker Fund manager as agent for the unitholder (ie, the ASB NZ Trust). In this alternative situation, the AMP Tracker Fund manager will sell the basket of securities comprising the redemption parcel as agent for the ASB NZ Trust, and the AMP Tracker Fund manager will pay the proceeds to the ASB NZ Trust (or in certain circumstances, the AMP Tracker Fund manager will hold the securities and transfer to the ASB NZ Trust the equivalent dollar value of the redeemed securities). 17. The ASB NZ Trust always requests the AMP Tracker Fund manager to redeem the basket of securities for cash, instead of receiving the basket of securities. Therefore, the ASB NZ Trust, upon redemption of units in the AMP Tracker Fund, will receive a transfer of securities followed by an immediate sale of those securities by the AMP Tracker Fund manager as agent for the ASB NZ Trust. 18. Although the AMP Tracker Fund’s prospectus refers to a threshold of 100,000 units being the minimum redemption amount (in order to redeem the units in the AMP Tracker Fund), ASB Bank have agreed with the AMP Tracker Fund manager that the treatment of redemptions for parcels of 100,000 units or greater will also apply to parcels of 50,000 or greater in respect of redemptions for the ASB NZ Trust. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 04/09/2007 5 of 9 Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) There is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Fund or the Trustee or the Manager and any unitholder (or any person associated with any unitholder) which directly or indirectly has a purpose or effect of the redemption or disposition of any of a unitholder’s units occurring in substitution for, or instead of, one or more distributions from the Fund. b) The Trust will be a widely-held trust, as that term is defined in section OB 1. c) Any cancellation of ASB NZ Trust units will not be part of a pro-rata cancellation as that term is defined in section OB 1. d) The ASB NZ Trust units will not be quoted on the official list of any recognised exchange as that term is defined in section OB 1. e) The ASB NZ Trust units are issued on such terms that their redemption is subject to the ordering rule as stated in section CD 14(2). f) The income of the Fund, net of any expenses incurred by the Fund, will be paid out to unitholders either as cash or additional units in the Fund. However, the Manager may use its discretion, and decide not to make such a payment if the amount to be paid is so minimal that the administrative costs of making the payment would exceed the amount to be distributed. The payment of income to unitholders on this basis is consistent with the Fund's normal dividend policy and Trust Deed. Not necessarily paying out the full value of the Tracker Fund units received as income reflects the Trustee's normal prudence in only distributing the “profits” of the Fund and does not occur for tax purposes; g) The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders, when unitholders wish to redeem or sell their units. The Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool to redeem the units requested and the Fund is unable to borrow to meet the unitholders’ requests. h) Where unitholders elect to receive distributions as additional Fund units instead of cash, these constitute a “taxable bonus issue” as that term is defined in section OB 1. i) The AMP Tracker Fund was chosen to provide a cost effective means for simulating an investment that matches the composition and weighting of the Index. The AMP Tracker Fund was not selected in order to maximise returns. j) The Fund has not taken into account historical returns in deciding to maintain its current investment strategy. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 04/09/2007 6 of 9 k) The investment objectives and authorised investments of the Trust will not be amended. l) The cash pool is held in cash deposits which are held on call in bank deposits. The holding of such cash will arise only from the following circumstances: • To meet the administration expenses of the Fund; • Pending investment in AMP Tracker Fund units; • To meet a withdrawal from the Trust; or • To make income distributions to unitholders. The proportion of the Fund’s assets to be held as cash will not be greater than what strictly arises out of the above described circumstances, and in any event will not exceed the greater of $200,000 or 4% of the total assets of the Fund. m) Condition (l) shall not be breached if the limit referred to in condition (l) is exceeded when this occurs due to the following reasons: • Where a large cash subscription has been paid into the cash pool; or • Receipt of dividends from the AMP Tracker Fund, and the Fund takes immediate action to remedy this within the shortest practicable time, and in any event, no longer than five business days. n) In the event that the Fund has insufficient cash available to meet redemptions, the Fund may temporarily borrow in order to redeem units. Any borrowing that occurs will be: (i) only to the extent that is strictly necessary and will not in any event exceed 2% of the value of the Fund; and (ii) repaid as soon as possible and in any event within five business days. o) The Fund will only sell or otherwise dispose of AMP Tracker Fund units in the following circumstances: • To meet the administration expenses of the Fund; • The Manager must purchase or redeem AMP Tracker Fund units in order to meet the needs of the Fund’s unitholders; or • In order to wind up the Trust. p) When the Fund is given the option of re-investing its dividends for additional units in the AMP Tracker Fund, the Fund will always accept the reinvestment option. In any such case, the value of the units received is equivalent to the value of the cash dividend (net of tax, fees and expenses) and the distribution of cash or units constitutes a “dividend” as that term is defined in section CF 2. q) This ruling shall cease to apply if at any time: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 04/09/2007 7 of 9 (i) there is a unitholder, or two or more unitholders that are associated with each other, or are acting in concert in relation to their investments in the Fund, who hold/s more than 75% of the issued units of the Fund; and (ii) if that unitholder, or one or more of such unitholders, ordinarily hold securities on revenue account or the disposal of securities by that unitholder, or one or more of such unitholders, would ordinarily give rise to gross income for income tax purposes. For the purposes of this condition unitholders are associated with each other if they are “associated persons” within the meaning of section OD 7 or OD 8(3). r) This Ruling only applies while this Fund remains a widely-held trust (as that term is defined in section OB 1), and the Fund units are offered to the public. s) Apart from the Trust Deed and/or Prospectus and/or any Rules of the Fund that have been supplied to Inland Revenue as part of the application for this ruling, there is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Fund or the Trustee or the Manager (or any party acting on behalf of the Fund) and any unitholder (or any person associated with or acting on behalf of any unitholder) regarding the control of the Fund, the nature and timing of its investments, or the timing of the investing or withdrawal of funds. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the fact that a unitholder has the ability to invest, or withdraw at any time and/or (ii) the entry into of agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated by the Trust Deed for the purpose of enabling investment or withdrawal, will not alone constitute an agreement, arrangement or understanding to which the preceding sentence applies. t) The Fund will not exercise any voting rights associated with the holding of AMP Tracker Fund units. u) If the Fund is resettled this Ruling shall not apply from the date of resettlement. The Fund will not be resettled in order to enhance the performance of the Fund or to minimise the losses of the Fund in any way. v) A suspension from issuing or redeeming units will only occur in exceptional circumstances, being: (1) If a material adverse change in the financial markets occurs, namely, a breakdown in liquidity caused by an act of God, or a system failure or a terrorist attack; (2) If there is a fundamental breakdown in the functioning of financial markets, namely, the failure of pricemaking software; or (3) If it is required so as to avoid a breach of any applicable law. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 04/09/2007 8 of 9 Any such suspension will be for a maximum period of 3 business days, unless the exceptional circumstance giving rise to the need to suspend is beyond the control of the Trustee and Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund and/or the Manager to recover from that event. w) The distribution period of the Fund will only be altered for administrative reasons and shall not be altered to enhance the performance of the Fund in any way. x) The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders, when unitholders wish to redeem or sell their units. The Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool to redeem the units requested and the Fund is unable to borrow to meet the unitholders’ requests. y) The AMP Tracker Fund is an “unlisted trust” in terms of the definition of that term in section CD 14(9). z) Cancellation of AMP Tracker Fund units will not be made as part of a pro rata cancellation of units. aa) AMP Tracker Fund units will not be quoted on the official list of a recognised exchange. bb) The AMP Tracker Fund units are issued on such terms that their redemption is subject to the ordering rule as stated in section CD 14(2). cc) There is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the AMP Tracker Fund or its trustee or its manager and the ASB NZ Trust (or any person associated with the ASB NZ Trust) which directly or indirectly has a purpose or effect of the redemption or disposition of any of the ASB NZ Trust’s units occurring in substitution for, or instead of, one or more distributions from the AMP Tracker Fund. dd) The Trust will either: (1) redeem its AMP Tracker Fund units to the AMP Tracker Fund or (2) sell its units to the AMP Tracker Fund manager. The Trust will not dispose of its units in any other manner. ee) All distributions received by the AMP Tracker Fund will be paid out (either as cash or AMP Tracker Fund units) to investors in the AMP Tracker Fund net of any expenses incurred by the AMP Tracker Fund. ff) Any powers exercised by the Trustee under the Master Deed and Establishment Deed are for the purposes of either buying units in the AMP Tracker Fund to reflect the level of funds invested in the Trust, or selling or redeeming units in the AMP Tracker Fund to fund redemptions of units in the Trust. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 04/09/2007 9 of 9 gg) The existing binding ruling for the AMP Tracker Fund (BR Prv 05/01) or any such replacement ruling or rulings in respect of the same taxation laws remain current and in force. hh) The Fund will not be wound up with a view to enhancing the performance of the Fund or to minimise losses of the Fund in any way. This condition will not be breached if: (i) the Manager decides to wind up the Fund for reasons unrelated to the performance of the investments of the Fund; or (ii) if the unitholders independently resolve to wind up the Fund. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Income distributed by the Trustee will be treated as a dividend pursuant to section CD 3. • Any amount received by unitholders on redemption of units in the Fund will be excluded from the definition of dividend in section CD 3 by section CD 14(2) to the extent that that amount does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled. • Section GB 1(3) does not apply to the arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 30 June 2007 to the earlier of: i) The date upon which Portfolio Investment Entity (“PIE”) status applies to the Fund in terms of section HL 11; or ii) 31 December 2007. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29 th day of June 2007. John Trezise Sector Manager
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 04/09/2007 1 of 10 PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 07/03 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by ASB World Shares Trust. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 3, CD 14 and GB 1(3). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and continued operation of the ASB World Shares Trust (the “ASB World Trust” or the “Trust” or the “Fund”) pursuant to a master deed dated 17 October 1997 (the “Master Deed”), an establishment deed also dated 17 October 1997 (the “Establishment Deed”), a “Variation of Master Deed Dated 17 October 1997” (executed on 27 April 1999), a Deed of Amendment to ASB World Shares Trust Establishment Deed (dated 18 June 2001) and the ASB Unit Trusts Prospectus (dated 6 September 2006). Further details of the arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The ASB World Trust is a unit trust pursuant to the Unit Trusts Act 1960 and is a “unit trust” for the purposes of the definition of that term in section OB 1. 2. The trustee of the ASB World Trust is Trustees Executors Limited (the “Trustee”). It is registered as a trustee company under the Trustee Companies Act 1967. The manager of the Trust is ASB Group Investments Limited (formerly ASB Investment Services Limited) (the “Manager”), part of the ASB group of Companies. The beneficial interests in the Trust are divided into units. Each unit confers an equal interest in the Trust, but units do not confer any interest in any particular investment of the Trust. 3. The Applicant has confirmed that the Fund has complied with the previous ruling (BR Prd 04/08). There has been no material change to the management or operation of the Fund. Investment 4. The ASB World Trust acts as a special purpose vehicle, which holds units in the AMP Investments’ World Index Fund (the “AMP WiNZ Fund”). Ownership of units in the AMP WiNZ Fund enable the ASB World Trust to obtain the same financial results through one investment as would be achieved by direct investment in the securities which make up the AMP World Index (the “Index”) tracked by the AMP WiNZ Fund. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 04/09/2007 2 of 10 5. ASB selected the AMP WiNZ Fund for its underlying investment for the following reasons: • The corporate strength and stability of AMP Limited (“AMP”), and the strong likelihood that AMP would be able to support an index-tracking fund well into the foreseeable future; • AMP’s technical expertise, particularly the investment management skill and capability of AMP Capital Investors (New Zealand) Limited in being able to construct and efficiently manage an index-tracking fund; • The high standard of service provided by AMP eg, regular statements and reporting on the AMP WiNZ Fund; good working relationship; and • AMP’s competitive investment management fees resulting in a lower cost to ASB World Trust Fund investors in having their funds invested in the AMP WiNZ Fund through the ASB World Trust. 6. Clauses 3.1 and 3.2 of the ASB World Trust’s Establishment Deed state the “investment objectives” of the ASB World Trust and identify the “authorised investments” as follows: 3 Investment Policy 3.1 Objectives: The objectives of the Trust are to: (a) invest in the AMP Investments’ World Index Fund subject to the need for the Trust to hold some cash for liquidity and administrative purposes; and (b) provide after tax foreign currency hedges in respect of 50% of the foreign currency securities indirectly invested in through the Trust’s investment in the AMP Investment’s World Index Fund. The funds of the Trust that are available for investment shall be invested in the AMP Investments’ World Index Fund or in foreign currency contracts as soon as practicable after receipt by the Trustee. The Trust and the Trustee do not have an intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling AMP Investments’ World Fund units. 3.2 Authorised Investments: For the purposes of this Trust “Authorised Investments” means: (a) the AMP Investments’ World Index Fund; (b) cash balances with banks, brokers, agents, funds, including, without limitation, the ASB Money Market Trust, or custodians held for the liquidity and administrative purposes of the Trust referred to at Clause 3.1; and (c) foreign exchange contracts for the foreign currencies of the securities making up the AMP World Index entered into to provide the hedges referred to in clause 3.1 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 04/09/2007 3 of 10 7. Pursuant to the Establishment Deed, the ASB World Trust is only authorised to invest contributions from Members in: (a) the AMP WiNZ Fund, (b) a fixed 50% after tax foreign currency hedge and (c) cash investments. The Fund may hold cash investments to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund. The cash investments are held by the Fund in bank deposits. The Fund will hold cash in the following instances: • Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; • Following the sale of AMP WiNZ Fund units to meet a request to redeem units in cash; • To make income distributions to unitholders; • To meet obligations under the fixed 50% after tax foreign currency hedge; and • To met administration expenses of the Fund. 8. It is the intention of the ASB World Trust that investment in AMP WiNZ Fund units (taking into account the appropriate level of hedge, or distribution of excess cash, whichever is relevant) will be completed on a weekly basis. The level of funds is monitored on a weekly basis and invested if in excess of the cash pool. Funds passed to the Manager are invested in the underlying pool within 24 hours. 9. The currencies to be hedged are the US dollar, Japanese yen, Euro, British pound, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. The weighting of these currencies in the hedge will be determined exactly, based on the Trust’s underlying exposure, on each rollover date, based on the latest country weightings (included in the Index) which are made available by AMP Capital Investors (New Zealand) Limited. 10. The ASB World Trust is required to place an order for a 74.6% hedge (or an equivalent residual figure should the applicable income tax rate change from 33%) and accept the closest to this figure that is obtainable within the set limits. Further, realignment of the hedge level will occur monthly at the rollover of forward contracts to a new forward date. All hedge contracts will mature on or about the fifteenth business day of the month following entry. The level of the hedge is to be maintained at between 71.6% and 77.6% of the non-New Zealand dollar amount invested offshore. This variance is required to take account of redemptions and subscriptions arising during a month. It is also required to take account of the fact that foreign currency hedges can generally only be obtained in round amounts. Where the hedge moves outside the plus or minus 3% (pre-tax) band the hedge will be adjusted back to 74.6%, on the day that this occurs, based on the country weightings made available by AMP Capital Investors (New Zealand) Limited on the last roll-over date. 11. Under clause 11.3(h) of schedule 1 to the Master Deed the unitholders can sanction any variation of the “authorised investments” of the Trust by extraordinary resolution. However, the Fund intends to maintain its current investment strategy. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 04/09/2007 4 of 10 AMP WiNZ Fund 12. The AMP WiNZ Fund is a “group investment fund” within the meaning of section OB 1. The AMP WiNZ Fund is required to buy and sell shares as required to ensure that it continues to track the Index. The AMP WiNZ Fund has two current binding rulings (BR Prv 04/26, regarding sections BD 1(1), CD 3, CD 4, and CD 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and BR Prv 04/27, regarding sections OZ1 and CG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994) which state that such buying and selling is not motivated by any intention to derive a profit or gain from such sales. The AMP WiNZ Fund is listed on the New Zealand Stock Market (“NZSX”). 13. The AMP WiNZ Fund will make taxable distributions to the Trust from any income received by the AMP WiNZ Fund semi-annually within 20 days from the end of June and December. 14. The Trust will generally distribute such part, as is determined by the Manager, of its net income 6-monthly to unitholders and that net income will be calculated taking into account all costs, charges and expenses due. 15. The Establishment Deed also provides for special distributions to occur at other times determined by the Manager. However, in the period between receipt of income from the AMP WiNZ Fund and any distribution, the ASB World Trust is required to invest amounts not held for administrative or liquidity purposes in units in the AMP WiNZ Fund and maintain the fixed 50% after tax foreign currency hedge. Suspensions 16. A suspension from issuing or redeeming units will only occur in exceptional circumstances, being the following situations: (1) If a material adverse change in the financial markets occurs, namely, a breakdown in liquidity caused by an act of God or a system failure or a terrorist attack; (2) If there is a fundamental breakdown in the functioning of financial markets, namely, the failure of pricemaking software; or (3) If it is required so as to avoid a breach of any applicable law. Any such suspension will be for a maximum period of 3 business days, unless the exceptional circumstance giving rise to the need to suspend is beyond the control of the Trustee and Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund and/or the Manager to recover from that event. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 04/09/2007 5 of 10 The issuing and redeeming of units was suspended for 5 days as a result of the September 11 terrorist attack. Redemption of ASB World Fund units 17. The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders, when unitholders wish to redeem or sell their units. The Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool to redeem the units requested and the Fund is unable to borrow to meet the unitholders’ requests. To date, the Manager has not utilised this power. Redemption of AMP WiNZ Fund units 18. When the ASB World Trust is required to redeem units in the AMP WiNZ Fund, the ASB World Trust can sell its units to a third party, or it can redeem its units to the AMP WiNZ Fund. Upon redemption, the ASB World Trust will receive a parcel of securities equal to the value of the units at that time. The AMP WiNZ Fund manager may sell those securities on behalf of (as agent for) the ASB World Trust, and then give the ASB World Trust cash for those units. The ASB World Trust also has the option (as opposed to redeeming its units to the AMP WiNZ Fund) to sell its units through the AMP WiNZ Fund manager. 19. Redemption requests for AMP WiNZ Fund units must be for a minimum of 1,000,000 WiNZ units. When the ASB World Trust makes a redemption request to the AMP WiNZ Fund, the AMP WiNZ Fund manager makes a choice as to how to effect that redemption request. The AMP WiNZ Fund manager may effect redemption by either: (1) cancellation of the units or (2) purchasing those units on its own behalf. In either situation, when the AMP WiNZ Fund manager effects a redemption request, the unitholder (ie, the ASB World Trust) will receive the same redemption amount for its AMP WiNZ Fund units. 20. Requests to dispose of parcels of less than 1,000,000 AMP WiNZ Fund units will be facilitated by the AMP WiNZ Fund manager in parcels of 100,000 AMP WiNZ Fund units. The ASB World Trust will only dispose of its AMP WiNZ Fund units by making a redemption request to the AMP WiNZ Fund manager. The ASB World Trust will not dispose of AMP WiNZ Fund units in any other manner. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) There is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Fund or the Trustee or the Manager and any unitholder (or any person associated with any unitholder) which directly or indirectly has a purpose or effect of the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 04/09/2007 6 of 10 redemption or disposition of any of a unitholder’s units occurring in substitution for or instead of one or more distributions from the Fund. b) The Trust will be a widely-held trust, as that term is defined in section OB 1. c) Any cancellation of ASB World Trust units will not be part of a pro-rata cancellation as that term is defined in section OB 1. d) The ASB World Trust units will not be quoted on the official list of any recognised exchange as that term is defined in section OB 1. e) The ASB World Trust units are issued on such terms that their redemption is subject to the ordering rule as stated in section CD 14(2). f) The income of the Fund, net of any expenses incurred by the Fund, will be paid out to unitholders either as cash or additional units in the Fund. However, the Manager may use its discretion, and decide not to make such a payment if the amount to be paid is so minimal that the administrative costs of making the payment would exceed the amount to be distributed. The payment of income to unitholders on this basis is consistent with the Fund's normal dividend policy and Trust Deed. Not necessarily paying out the full value of the WiNZ Fund units received as income reflects the Trustee's normal prudence in only distributing the "profits" of the Fund and does not occur for tax purposes. g) The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders, when unitholders wish to redeem or sell their units. The Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool to redeem the units requested and the Fund is unable to borrow to meet the unitholders’ requests. h) Where unitholders elect to receive distributions as additional Fund units instead of cash, these constitute a “taxable bonus issue” as that term is defined in section OB 1. i) The AMP WiNZ Fund was chosen to provide a cost effective means for simulating an investment that matches the composition and weighting of the Index. The AMP WiNZ Fund was not selected in order to maximise returns. j) The Fund has not taken into account historical returns in deciding to maintain its current investment strategy. k) The investment objectives and authorised investments of the Trust will not be amended. l) The cash pool is held in cash deposits which are held on call in bank deposits.. The holding of such cash will arise only from the following circumstances: • Pending investment in AMP WiNZ Fund units; • To meet a withdrawal from the Trust; • To make income distributions to unitholders; \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 04/09/2007 7 of 10 • Pursuant to the fixed 50% after tax foreign currency hedge; and • To meet administration expenses of the Fund. The proportion of the Fund’s assets to be held as cash will not be greater than what strictly arises out of the above described circumstances, and in any event will not exceed the greater of $200,000 or 4% of the total assets of the Fund. m) Condition (l) shall not be breached if the limit referred to in condition (l) is exceeded when this occurs due to the following reasons: • Where a large cash subscription has been paid into the cash pool; or • Receipt of dividends from the AMP WiNZ Fund; or • From proceeds or settlement of maturing currency hedge contracts; and the Fund takes immediate action to remedy this within the shortest practicable time, and in any event, no longer than 5 business days. n) The Fund may borrow temporarily in order to meet the following obligations where it is unable to meet such demands out of its current cash reserves: (1) to redeem units; (2) to meet hedging contract obligations. Any such borrowing will only be to the extent that is strictly necessary and in the case of borrowing to redeem units will not exceed 2% of the value of the Fund and in the case of borrowing to meet hedging obligations will not exceed 10% of the value of the Fund. All such borrowing will be repaid within five business days. o) The Fund will only sell or otherwise dispose of AMP WiNZ Fund units in the following circumstances: • To meet administration expenses of the Fund that cannot be met out of the cash pool; or • Where the Manager must purchase or redeem AMP WiNZ Fund units in order to meet the needs of the Fund’s unitholders; or • In order to wind up the Trust; or • To meet hedging contract obligations that cannot be met out of the cash pool. p) When the Fund is given the option of re-investing its dividends for additional units in the AMP WiNZ Fund, the Fund will always accept the reinvestment option. In any such case, the value of the units received is equivalent to the value of the cash dividend, (net of tax, fees and expenses). q) This ruling shall cease to apply if at any time: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 04/09/2007 8 of 10 (i) there is a unitholder, or two or more unitholders that are associated with each other, or are acting in concert in relation to their investments in the Fund, who hold/s more than 75% of the issued units of the Fund; and (ii) if that unitholder, or one or more of such unitholders, ordinarily hold securities on revenue account or the disposal of securities by that unitholder, or one or more of such unitholders, would ordinarily give rise to gross income for income tax purposes. For the purposes of this condition unitholders are associated with each other if they are “associated persons” within the meaning of section OD 7 or OD 8(3). r) This Ruling only applies while this Fund remains a widely-held trust (as that term is defined in section OB 1), and the Fund units are offered to the public. s) Apart from the Trust Deed and/or Prospectus and/or any Rules of the Fund that have been supplied to Inland Revenue as part of the application for this ruling, there is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Fund or the Trustee or the Manager (or any party acting on behalf of the Fund) and any unitholder (or any person associated with or acting on behalf of any unitholder) regarding the control of the Fund, the nature and timing of its investments, or the timing of the investing or withdrawal of funds. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the fact that a unitholder has the ability to invest, or withdraw at any time and/or (ii) the entry into of agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated by the Trust Deed for the purpose of enabling investment or withdrawal, will not alone constitute an agreement, arrangement or understanding to which the preceding sentence applies. t) The Fund will not exercise any voting rights associated with the holding of AMP WiNZ Fund units. u) If the Fund is resettled this Ruling shall not apply from the date of resettlement. The Fund will not be resettled in order to enhance the performance of the Fund or to minimize the losses of the Fund in any way. v) A suspension from issuing or redeeming units will only occur in exceptional circumstances, being: (1) If a material adverse change in the financial markets occurs, namely, a breakdown in liquidity caused by an act of God, or a system failure or a terrorist attack; or (2) If there is a fundamental breakdown in the functioning of financial markets, namely, the failure of pricemaking software; or (3) If it is required so as to avoid a breach of any applicable law. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 04/09/2007 9 of 10 Any such suspension will be for a maximum period of 3 business days, unless the exceptional circumstance giving rise to the need to suspend is beyond the control of the Trustee and Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund and/or the Manager to recover from that event. w) The distribution period of the Fund will only be altered for administrative reasons and shall not be altered to enhance the performance of the Fund in any way. x) The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders, when unitholders wish to redeem or sell their units. The Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool to redeem the units requested and the Fund is unable to borrow to meet the unitholders’ requests. y) There is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the AMP WiNZ Fund or its trustee or its manager and the ASB World Trust (or any person associated with the ASB World Trust) which directly or indirectly has a purpose or effect of the redemption or disposition of any of the ASB World Trust’s units occurring in substitution for or instead of one or more distributions from the AMP WiNZ Fund. z) The Trust will only dispose of its AMP WiNZ Fund units by making a redemption request to the AMP WiNZ Fund manager or by selling to a third party. The Fund will only sell to a third party in the exceptional circumstance where the request to the AMP WiNZ Fund Manager cannot be actioned within 7 business days. aa) Any powers exercised by the Trustee under the Master Deed and Establishment Deed are for the purposes of either buying units in the AMP WiNZ Fund, matched by a 50% after tax hedge, to reflect the level of funds invested in the Trust, or selling units in the AMP WINZ Fund to fund redemption of units in the Trust, or in order to meet its payment obligations under the hedging arrangement or to meet administration expenses of the Fund. bb) The existing binding rulings for the AMP WiNZ Fund (BR Prv 04/26 and BR Prv 04/27) or any such replacement ruling or rulings in respect of the same taxation laws remain current and in force. cc) The Fund will not be wound up with a view to enhancing the performance of the Fund or to minimise losses of the Fund in any way. This condition will not be breached if: (i) the Manager decides to wind up the Fund for reasons unrelated to the performance of the investments of the Fund; or \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 04/09/2007 10 of 10 (iii) if the unitholders independently resolve to wind up the Fund. dd) The AMP WiNZ Fund has deferred the application of the Foreign Investment Fund legislation until 1 October 2007 by giving the required notice to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue before 1 April 2007. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Income distributed by the Trustee will be treated as a dividend pursuant to section CD 3. • Any amount received by unitholders on redemption of units in the Fund will be excluded from the definition of dividend in section CD 3 by section CD 14(2) to the extent that that amount does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled. • Section GB 1(3) does not apply to the arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 30 June 2007 to 30 September 2007. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29 th day of June 2007.

PRODUCT RULING – BR Prd 07/04 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Assure Funds Management Limited as Administration Manager of the International Equity Index Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections HH 3(5) and the section OB 1 definitions of “qualifying trust” and “superannuation fund”. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the operation of the International Equity Index Fund (“the Fund”) pursuant to the Trust Deed of the Fund, dated 1 July 2001, as amended by a Deed of Amendment dated 21 December 2001 (“the Trust Deed”), and further amended by a Deed of Amendment and the final Deed of Amendment (as previously submitted in draft to the Rulings Unit on 11 June 2004 (“the Amending Deed”)). Subsequently by way of Deed (undated) the Trustee of the Fund was changed from BNZ Investment Management Limited to Tower Trust Superannuation Limited. Further, by way of deed dated 31 January 2006 the sponsor of the Fund was changed from Bank of New Zealand to Arcus Investment Management Limited. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1) The Fund invests in equity securities that correspond to the composition of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index (“MSCI”), modified such that the securities invested in will be of those countries specified in Part A of Schedule 3 to the Act (“grey- list countries”) that each comprise 1% or more of the MSCI (“the Modified World Index”). The Fund has been designed to enable investors to obtain, through one security, the same financial results that can be obtained through the direct investment in the securities of those companies that make up the Modified World Index. 2) The Trustee of the Fund (“the Trustee”) is Trustees Executors Superannuation Limited. 3) The Administration Manager of the Fund is Assure Funds Management Limited (“the Administration Manager”). The Investment Manager of the Fund is State Street Global Advisors, Australia, Limited (“the Investment Manager”). 4) The Sponsor of the Fund is Arcus Investment Management Limited (“the Sponsor”). 5) The Fund is a wholesale superannuation fund into which other wholesale and retail superannuation funds invest. The Fund was established for the purpose of being a wholesale investment vehicle for retail superannuation funds, other wholesale superannuation funds and for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to the limited number of natural persons who invest directly in it. Unless the prior approval of the Trustee, with the consent of the Sponsor, is obtained, the minimum initial investment into the Fund is NZ$200,000. 6) The Fund is registered under the Superannuation Scheme Act 1989. 7) The Trust Deed states that: The investment policy of the Fund will be: a) to invest the Fund (other then the Cash Pool) in accordance with Schedule 2 to this Deed only in such investments as the Trustee considers necessary to track the modified grey list components of the World Index; and b) to invest the Cash Pool in restricted investments, being deposits with banks, and futures contracts. 8) The Fund buys and sells shares as required to ensure that it continues to correspond to the Modified World Index. Such buying or selling will not be motivated by any intention to derive a profit or gain from such sales. In this regard, the Trust Deed states: The Fund and the Trustees do not have an intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling Index Company securities. 9) The Applicant has confirmed that all material aspects of the previous rulings (Prv 97/125, Prv 01/11, Prv 01/65, Prv 01/114, Prv 04/28, Prd 97/38, Prd 01/30, Prd 02/01 and Prd 04/10), relating to the Fund, have been complied with, except that: a. The earliest rulings did not refer to the Investment Manager’s ability to sell securities where an individual security was outside its tracking weight; and b. In some cases investments from natural persons have been below $200,000. 10) The only amendments to the Trust Deed are those contained in the Amending Deed. There has not been any material change to the management or operation of the Fund since its establishment. Date of Adjustments 11) The Fund is re-balanced in the following circumstances: • If a security is outside its Modified World Index weight by the lesser of- • 0.5% of the total Fund, whether positive or negative; or • three times the Modified World Index weight of the individual security; and • When the periodic (currently quarterly) adjustments are made to the MSCI; and • If there are any MSCI market driven changes (as identified in clause 3.3 of the current MSCI Methodology Book: MSCI Standard Index Series Methodology) or corporate actions such as a merger, takeover, new listing or reduction or increase in capital affecting any index company in the Modified World Index. 12) Such re-balancing will occur at the earliest practicable time after the above events have occurred and in any event within five business days. Events that trigger acquisitions or realizations 13) There are certain reasons or events when investments held by the Fund will have to be bought or sold. The Trustee will only dispose of securities (other than cash pool investments) if: • the Fund is wound up; • there is a change in the Modified World Index and composition of the securities of the Fund no longer tracks the Modified World Index (whether as a result of a change to the countries included or a change to the securities included); • there is a compulsory acquisition of one of the Fund’s securities or a security is acquired on a compulsory acquisition, merger or takeover which does not track the Modified World Index; • there is a net withdrawal of funds from the Fund by members; • there is a claim on the Trustees in respect of the Fund which cannot be otherwise satisfied; or • the Fund is re-balanced in accordance with the first bullet point in paragraph 11, above Rights Issues 14) In the event of any rights issue by an index company, the Investment Manager will retain the entitlement and take up the securities if the securities the subject of the entitlement will be immediately included in the Modified World Index. 15) Notwithstanding paragraph 14, if the securities the subject of the entitlement are over- represented, the Investment Manager will sell the entitlement and reinvest the proceeds in the index companies to track the Modified World Index. 16) If the Investment Manager does not know whether the securities the subject of the entitlement will be included in the Index the Investment Manager will sell the entitlement at the earliest practicable time (and in any event within five business days) and reinvest the proceeds in the index companies to track the Modified World Index. Mergers, Takeovers and Share Buy-backs 17) The Modified World Index may be adjusted from time to time because of mergers, takeovers, share buy-backs, distributions of capital, cash issues, and substitutions of companies in the Modified World Index. 18) In the event of a merger or takeover of a Modified World Index company the Investment Manager will adjust the Fund portfolio at the earliest practicable time (but in any event within five business days) to the time the Modified World Index is adjusted. The Fund will not accept an offer unless as a consequence of not accepting the offer the Fund would track the Modified World Index less accurately than if it had accepted the offer. 19) The Investment Manager will not participate in an optional share buy-back by a Modified World Index company. Hedging 20) There is no specific provision in the Trust Deed that allows the Fund to hedge foreign exchange risks. 21) The Fund will not take any action to hedge or manage foreign exchange risks or exposures that arise from the investments of the Fund being held in non-New Zealand currencies. Borrowing 22) Clause 10.0 (c) of the Trust provides: ...The Trustee may: borrow money for the purpose of the Fund upon terms and conditions agreed by the Sponsor and the Trustee and charge all or part of the assets of the Fund with repayment and payment of interest on the moneys so borrowed; 23) Pursuant to the ruling, the Fund can only borrow in the following circumstances: • To temporarily fund the redemption of units when the cash pool has insufficient funds; this borrowing must be repaid at the earliest practicable time, and in any event and such borrowing will be repaid within three business days; • Where a security is sold and another purchased and a settlement mismatch occurs resulting in the Fund’s bank account becoming inadvertently overdrawn, and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; • To temporarily fund the purchase of securities in order to rebalance following a merger, where pursuant to the merger payment due to the Fund for securities that have been disposed of has been delayed (such delay being beyond the control of the Fund), and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; or • For advances (not to exceed total borrowings for $5,000) by the Administration Manager to the Fund to meet expenses of the Fund, where the Administration Manager’s expense account is insufficient to enable the Administration Manager to meet such expenses. Cash investments held by the Fund 24) Although it is not an objective of the Fund to hold cash, the Trustee and the Investment Manager may hold cash to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund. The cash held by the Trustee and the Investment Manager is on “call”. Wherever possible, futures contracts will be entered into by the Investment Manager to cover cash held by the Investment Manager. This is known as “equitised cash”. 25) The Investment Manager or the Trustee will hold cash in the following circumstances: • Following the sale of securities in the course of tracking the Modified World Index or in the course of a compulsory acquisition, merger, takeover, share buy-back or distribution of capital pending the reinvestment of that cash; • Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; • Following the sale of securities to meet a request for withdrawal by a member; • When a dividend is paid to the Fund in respect of an investment in a security; • To accumulate the minimum amount of cash required to allow for minimum trade sizes and to obtain a reasonable representation of the number of securities on the Modified World Index (“the minimum investment level”). The Investment Manager has advised that this amount is presently approximately $US 3 million. The minimum investment level may increase (or reduce) in the future to the extent that a different amount is required to purchase the equivalent representation of securities on the Modified World Index. 26) The Investment Manager may hold up to an amount equivalent to the minimum investment level in cash (including both free and equitised cash). This threshold may be exceeded in the following circumstances: • for up to ten business days preceding a MSCI Structural Change or for up to three business days following a significant new investment; • for up to three business days after a MSCI Structural Change; • for up to ten business days prior to a pending withdrawal in respect of which it has received a withdrawal request. 27) In addition to any funds held by the Investment Manager, the Trustee may hold up to NZ$2 million in cash. This threshold may be exceeded in the following circumstances: • for up to ten business days if there are withdrawals pending in respect of which it has received a withdrawal request; or • for up to three business days if the excess results from a significant new investment. 28) At all times, there is a limit on the total cash (including cash held by the Trustee and free and equitised cash held by the Investment Manager) of 5% of the total Fund (except if there is a significant withdrawal or investment). 29) The Investment Manager will use best endeavours to equitise all cash, subject to futures contract size constraints. 30) The following futures contracts are used: Country Contract Australia SPI200 Canada S&P/TSE60 Japan Topix Germany DAX United Kingdom FTSE100 United States S&P500 Spain IBEX35 31) In the event that alternative futures contracts in one or more markets enable improved tracking of the Modified World Index, or that one or more of the above contracts ceases to exist, the Investment Manager will use such alternative contract or contracts. Dividends 32) The Investment Manager will receive the dividend (and other income) distributions from the securities in which funds are invested and will hold these as part of the cash pool, subject to the terms of paragraph 25 above. 33) The Investment Manager will not elect to participate in any dividend reinvestment plan. Foreign Currencies 34) The Investment Manager may enter into spot foreign exchange contracts where these are necessary in order to purchase or sell the foreign currencies necessary to invest in Modified World Index securities. These contracts are not speculative and are settled within two business days. Suspension of subscriptions and withdrawals 35) Clause 18.7 of the Trust Deed enables the Fund to suspend the payment of benefits relating to withdrawal requests. The Fund has not previously suspended withdrawals. The Fund also has the power under clause 3.2 of the Trust Deed to refuse any application for membership without giving reasons. The Fund has never exercised this power. 36) The Fund will only suspend withdrawals or subscriptions in the following exceptional circumstances: • if the volume of withdrawals is too large to be processed; or • if the volume of withdrawals exceeds the immediately available funds; or • trading on the relevant equity markets has been suspended. 37) Any suspension will only be for three business days unless the exceptional circumstance giving rise to the need to suspend is beyond the control of the Trustee and Investment Manager, in which case the suspension will only be for such period as is strictly necessary for the Trustees and/or the Investment Manager to recover from that event. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The Fund will not be resettled in order to enhance the performance of the Fund or to minimise losses of the Fund in any way. b) Subject to condition (a), if the Fund is resettled this Ruling will continue to apply until resettlement.
